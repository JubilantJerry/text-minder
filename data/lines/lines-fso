- Yeah.
- I love coming over here.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I better get going.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll catch you at work, right?
He's not scared of me at all.
And he's not going to quit unless I stop him.
You're a lifesaver.
Not all cops are so nice to strippers.
To tell you the truth,
I was hoping you had something more for me.
More for you?
About the murders.
[Scoffs] What?
You think this is just some ploy so I can get you alone and spill my guts?
Look, I told you everything that I knew.
My car really did break down.
Sorry.
If you want, I could pay you for the gas.
Stop it.
It's fine.
It's the least I can do after all I'm costing you in tips.
You'll have to do a lot more than give me a lift to make up for that.
This is it.
On the left.
What'd you have in mind as far as compensation?
I don't know.
Use your imagination.
Well, you're gonna have to give me a hint.
I'm very unimaginative.
Okay.
George says the problem with my car could be the transmission.
Mm-hmm.
It means it's going to be in the shop for at least a few days.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you could pick up the bill.
I'd really appreciate it.
You're awfully quiet tonight.
Anything you wanna talk about?
Anything I can do?
Yeah.
What?
Do you have any A.1.?
I think so.
Just enough for a good night's sleep.
That's all I need.
Success!
Thank you.
[Keys clattering]
Just finishing what you started.
[Sighs] I promised Deb.
[Cell phone ringing distantly]
[Ringing grows louder]
Hello?
Where are you?
Sorry.
I got here as fast as I could.
I almost drove off the road.
I'm so fucking tired.
[Sighs] What are you doing here?
I snuck out of the house while you were asleep.
Dexter, what the fuck did you do?
Nothing.
[Laughs]
I couldn't go through with it, but I wanted to.
I needed to.
I didn't care about anything else.
I lost control.
All I could see was blood.
All I could feel was the pressure...
[Sniffles] in my head.
Fuck.
It is too deep inside me.
Harry was right.
I am a monster.
You should arrest me.
You should take me in.
Get me off the street.
Dex, dad was wrong.
The fact that we're here tonight proves that you are in control.
- But I wasn't.
- But you stopped.
That's what's important.
It must've been so hard for you to call me, but you did, and that's a huge step.
It makes me think maybe you can control this.
You really believe that?
I didn't, but maybe now I do.
What happened tonight is a good thing.
It was really, really good.
I'm not gonna give up, and I'm not gonna let you give up.
Are you okay to drive?
No, I'm gonna stay with you.
I just need to be alone for a couple of minutes.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Okay.
[Engine turns]
You'll wake up with a headache, probably have a decent idea how you got here.
Maybe that's a good thing.
I still have to get you out of my life.
But not by taking yours.
What the fuck?
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm your employer-- or rather, former employer.
I believe you recently gave notice.
Bullshit.
I work for George.
- Well, worked.
- And he works for me.
My name is Isaak.
I'm the owner of the Fox Hole chain of gentlemen's clubs, amongst other enterprises.
What do you want?
Well, it would appear that George neglected to do your exit interview.
It's company policy, and I'm a stickler when it comes to rules.
[Chuckles] You got-- you got to be kidding, right?
Keeping good employees is essential to running a successful business.
Your feedback is important.
Would you mind telling me why you quit?
Well, I trust it wasn't the hostile working environment.
No, I, um...
[Clears throat]
I just felt it was time to move on.
So it was nothing to do with the tragic death of one of our dancers?
Kaja, I believe her name was.
Because if it did, I would completely understand.
It must have been quite a traumatic loss for you.
What do you mean?
Maybe that's why you talked to the police.
No way.
I had you followed.
You know what?
I didn't say a word.
I swear.
I lied.
I didn't have you followed.
You were just the most likely candidate.
- You loved her, didn't you?
- What?
Kaja.
You were in love with her.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's the one thing that gives meaning in this life.
I would have done the same thing if I was in your position.
It's terrible to lose someone you love.
[Grunts]
You still thinking about last night?
Actually, I'm thinking about how much I could go for a Frosty Swirl.
That's good.
A sudden craving for sugar is good?
Well, if you're thinking about normal things, then maybe you're becoming more normal.
I'm never going to be normal, Deb.
Yeah.
None of us really are.
Where are you going?
I want a Frosty Swirl.
I'll bring you one.
She'll always be watching me.
But maybe that's okay.
If Wayne Randall can make peace with his sentence, who am I to complain?
Especially considering the alternative.
Well, well.
Looks like you two are ready to eat each other's shit.
Oh, yeah.
We kind of patched things up.
I'm happy for you.
I never got to do that with Hannah.
Robin to my Batman.
I was never as alive as I was when I was with her.
Every day was like
Christmas day-- unwrapped present.
I wish I had a chance to tell her how I felt.
You can still tell her.
Yeah.
I'm afraid the clock has run out.
Damn, I sure as fuck... gonna miss that.
Hannah used to think I was something special.
Now she sees me as just a killer.
And you know what?
She's not wrong.
There's just one last person I need to kill.
[Horn honking]
[Brakes screeching]
He never cared if anyone found the bodies.
He just wanted a couple of days of sunshine and Frosty Swirl.
Randall didn't change, and he couldn't take life in prison.
Can I?
Previously, on Dexter...
- Where's your lug wrench at?
- No--
We are investigating the homicide of a Miami Metro police officer.
Viktor left on an evening flight.
He arrives in Kiev at 5:25 P.M., your time.
What about the dead police officer?
- I'll make it go away.
- Good.
Hello, Viktor.
Is there anything I can do to keep you from killing me?
No.
In my game, you can be the serial killer.
I think this is offensive.
Who would choose to be a serial killer?
It's a bad idea.
Do something else.
Only one person who ever worked at Miami Metro ever took blood slides.
Sergeant Doakes, the Bay Harbor Butcher.
What happened was too strong.
It got into you too early.
You mustn't ever tell Debra the truth about yourself.
If you think she's upset now, that's nothing compared to how she'd feel if she learned what you are.
Dexter, what the fuck?
You said Travis came at you with a sword.
Where did you get the knives?
There was, like, a whole roll of them.
I'm just trying to put this together.
Are you a serial killer?
Yes.
I've dreaded this moment my whole life... but I never pictured it like this.
Don't you fucking touch me.
I just want to know you're okay.
I am not okay.
I am never gonna fucking be okay.
- Just try to take it easy.
- Ohh...
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.
How long have you been doing this?
How long have you been fucking doing this?
Since I was 20.
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.
Those blood slides that I found in your apartment, they look like the ones we found in Doakes' car.
Deb...
Are you the Bay Harbor Butcher?
This is not the place to talk about this.
Deb...
I only kill certain kinds of people...
- Oh, God.
- Like Travis.
Deb, dad taught me.
He gave me a code.
Dad knew?
It was his idea.
He knew everything.
- Oh, fuck.
- Deb.
Please, just... just come back inside with me.
Please.
Harry found me sitting in a pool of my mother's blood.
He understood why I had these... urges.
A lot of horrible things happen to a lot of people, and they don't turn out like you.
I don't know about other people.
But I have this... need deep inside me.
I call it my Dark Passenger.
You gave it a name?
Harry said it got in me too early and too deep.
He said I couldn't change it.
And so...
he thought up the code.
He said if I had to kill,
I might as well kill people who deserved it.
You make it sound like it's okay-- like you're the victim here.
The people in that box, Dexter-- they're the victims.
Victims?
A choir director who raped and murdered little boys?
A married couple smuggling refugees who killed the ones who couldn't pay?
A psychiatrist who manipulated women into taking their own lives?
There's this place called the police department.
Sometimes the system doesn't work.
Killers fall through the cracks.
Don't I fucking know it?
I'm talking to one right now.
I am the worst fucking detective in the world.
You're my own brother.
How could I not see what you were doing?
You're not responsible for this.
Well, I am now.
I helped you cover up Travis' murder.
I'm an accomplice.
You walked in on me.
I had to think on my feet.
Well, fuck me for ruining your night.
What am I supposed to do here?
My name has the word "Lieutenant" in front of it.
I can't turn my back on this.
All of this is very, very fucking wrong.
So...
What are you gonna do?
Uhh!
I never wanted her to go through this, Dex.
Neither did I.
Then you should have been more careful.
At least she didn't arrest me.
Not yet.
What is this doing here?
Is it some kind of message?
Maybe someone else is on to me.
"According to FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy,
"it's almost certain that the Butcher is still at work.
"Serial killers have an addiction and will continue to kill until they're caught."
If the ITK hand in my apartment is genuine, then it can't still be in evidence.
Not here.
Then I was sent the real thing.
No record of it being checked out.
Could it have been stolen?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Saw you come in here.
I just got curious.
- Now I wish I hadn't.
- Why?
You're looking for the hand, aren't you?
Look, I can explain.
Look, remember my former intern Ryan?
Blonde, stacked, and the cause of many sleepless nights?
Yeah.
Well, she needed some extra dough, so she stole the hand and auctioned it online.
That's why I fired her.
Who won the auction?
Don't know.
I put Louis on the case to find out.
Louis?
Now, even with all his digital skills, he couldn't dig up a name.
At least he was able to erase the electronic trail.
Did Louis find the hand and keep it?
No one needs to know, right?
But why send the work of a serial killer to me?
Does Louis know what I am?
Dex?
What?
We're cool, right?
Yeah.
No one needs to know.
Oh, thank God.
I was ready to blow you.
Not necessary.
Briefing.
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.
I have to find out what Louis knows about me.
Some time alone with him, and he'd open up-- one way or another.
But I need to put out fires, not start new ones.
Remember him?
It's been three days since Mike was gunned down, and the son of a bitch that pulled the trigger is still walking the streets.
Where are we?
We're continuing to hit the club where Miss Soroka was employed.
Someone there must've seen something related to her death.
We still think it's our best shot at a lead, so we're going to shut them down every night.
You know, those places do big business during lunch too.
Just saying.
Start shutting them down twice a day.
- With pleasure.
- Moving on.
This pretty face belongs to Wayne Randall.
15 years ago, Randall and his teenage girlfriend went on a three-state killing spree that ended here in Miami.
He's currently serving two consecutive life terms at Dade.
Randall now claims to have evidence on three other murders that he committed in the Miami area, and he wants to come clean.
He wants to lead investigators to where he buried the bodies.
Hmm.
That's nice of him.
He says he wants to clear his conscience.
I think his lawyers are just trying to swing a deal.
- What's he telling us?
- He told us about one victim, a brunette in her mid-20s that matches a missing persons report from that time, a Janice Dubois.
So then there's a chance he's not completely full of shit.
County has requested one detective and one lab tech to help them process the scene.
Miller, you're volunteer number one.
- I'll go.
- No.
I want Masuka on this.
Aw.
I don't to work a dumpsite.
Come on lieutenant, I'm up to my ears on Mike's case.
I'm sorry.
You're with Miller.
Contact info will be in your boxes.
You'll start tomorrow.
That's it.
Thank you.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
I was this close to arresting you this morning.
I even thought about what I would say to the press.
I wouldn't want to have to write that speech.
I don't know what to do.
Every alternative I can think of... is fucking crazy.
Such as?
It's fucked up.
Try me.
The say people like you are addicts.
Like drugs.
It's not untrue.
Well, when addicts want to get better, they go to rehab.
I don't think there are clinics for what I've got.
We can make one.
I could be your clinic.
- How?
- You move in with me.
I watch you 24/7 and make sure that there's no way in hell you can... do what you do.
And...
If it is an addiction, then maybe-- maybe you can get over it.
You're right.
It's crazy.
Dexter, if you can channel your urges, why can't you control them?
What if dad had taught you how to quit instead of teaching you how to live with it?
He fucked up.
Deb, there's a big problem with this idea.
What?
I've tried stopping before.
It didn't work.
Well, now you have me.
Someone who loves you more than you will ever fucking know.
And in spite all of this,
I still believe that there is good in you.
Maybe more that's in most people.
What if it doesn't work?
I don't want to think about that.
And how much choice do I have here?
None.
Okay.
Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.
I'm curious.
Your facilities are state-of-the-art.
Why go through a private lab?
Just trying to lighten the load.
It's been a hectic few months.
But just to confirm, the blood you sampled from the glass fragment is a positive match with Travis Marshall's?
No question about it.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Remember, keep this confidential.
And when you send back the findings, address them to me personally, okay?
- No problem.
- Great.
Thanks.
Yes, captain?
Regional FBI office, please.
We are back.
Hey.
I won't allow this to go on.
This is harassment.
No, this is an inconvenience.
We're working our way up to harassment.
I told you the last time you were here,
I don't know who killed Kaja.
I don't know who shot your policeman.
Kaja was clubbed to death in the parking lot 15 yards from where we are now.
- No one here saw anything.
- Sell that shit somewhere else.
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna keep coming here every day and shut me down?
No, I'm coming back tonight too.
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want the shooter.
Now, you better rack your brain and give me something, or I'm gonna turn this place into a fucking monastery.
Mm-hmm.
You got that list?
Follow me.
You know, the money we make here is all we have to live on.
What you're doing is really unfair.
What's your name?
Nadia.
Come here.
Have a drink.
We're not supposed to drink while we're working.
Come on.
You hear any music playing?
Now, what you said isn't true.
I do care who killed Kaja, but no one around here seems interested in helping me find out who it is.
Okay?
Do you know anybody who might be interested in hurting your friend?
You've been told not to cooperate with us?
Kaja was dating someone.
Tony Rush.
He's one of the bouncers here.
They were on and off, but Tony is a good guy.
Can you point Tony out to me?
He's not here today.
Mm-hmm.
I really hope you catch the person who did this and put a bullet through his head.
That's not generally how we work, but I get where you're coming from.
Here, if you can think of anything to help, just give me a call.
I will...
Detective Quinn.
Joey.
Excuse me.
Joey.
- Tell me you got the shooter.
- Possibly.
One of the bouncers hasn't come to work
- since the night of the murders.
- Tony Rush.
- How'd you know?
- He and Kaja were an item.
Suspicious timing, don't you think?
- The sudden absence?
- Mm-hmm.
Come on.
Hey.
You're gonna sleep in the bedroom.
I'm not gonna put you out.
Yes, you are.
I'm sleeping out here.
Deb, that's ridiculous.
This isn't a fucking pajama party, Dex, okay?
You're gonna take my bedroom, and I'm gonna sleep out here on the couch.
Between me and the front door?
I will be by the door.
You've really thought this through.
Yeah, well, I found this website--
"How to cure a serial killer in ten easy steps,"
and this is the first step.
You'll have to print me out a copy.
I'm figuring this out as I go along, Dexter.
But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it all the way.
We're gonna eat together, we're gonna watch TV together, we're gonna drive to fucking work together.
Hope you got a big shower.
Why don't you go unpack.
I'll heat us up something to eat.
You have to be completely honest with me.
That is the first rule.
My new code.
Don't you think Deb has gone through enough without you lying to her again?
I'm not lying.
You're a killer, Dex.
Deb didn't raise you.
I did.
She never saw what you were really like.
I did.
I was right to channel your urges instead of trying to suppress them.
You think I can just walk out of here and call the whole thing off?
If it were this simple, watching you for 24 hours a day, don't you think I would have tried it?
Maybe you should've.
How does it feel... this need to kill?
What do you call it?
My Dark Passenger.
You make it sound like you're possessed or something.
That's how it feels sometimes.
Do you know how many assholes in prison blame their actions on someone or something else?
I'm not copping a plea, Deb.
I'm giving you honesty.
It's rule number one, right?
How's the spaghetti?
Overcooked.
First rule.
So how does it feel?
It starts with blood.
Blood?
Yeah, the image of it.
Trickling down the back of my eyelids.
The trickle becomes a stream and then a flood.
It fills me up... all my empty spaces.
But then the blood isn't red anymore.
What is it?
It's black.
And pressing.
It feels like my head is gonna explode.
The only way to relieve the pressure is to open the floodgates and let it spill out.
I can't believe you're like this.
You're a sick fuck, Dexter.
Jesus Christ.
Well, maybe we shouldn't talk about it.
Yeah, maybe not while I'm serving fucking tomato sauce.
Are you seeing blood now?
Nope, just spaghetti.
Well, if you start seeing red, will you fucking call me?
And say what?
"Deb, I'm seeing blood"?
Say, "I really feel... like wrapping someone up in plastic and stabbing them."
And I can say, "No, Dexter, don't."
Second rule.
There have to be families out there that are more fucked up than us.
But I sure as hell wouldn't wanna meet them.
What the fuck am I doing here?
What you think's right.
Right would be turning you in.
I'm doing this because you're my brother, and I can't stand the idea of you living the rest of your life in prison.
Or worse.
I told Deb I'd be honest with her, but it's not like I'm stalking a kill.
I just need to get into Louis' penthouse and find out what he knows about me.
Are you okay?
It's late.
Yeah.
I'm just doing some work.
I'll sit with you.
Deb, I'm fine.
No.
You shouldn't be alone right now.
I mean, awake and alone.
Yeah.
Maybe I should try to get some sleep.
Just know that I'm here for you.
How could I forget?
Now that Deb is my Siamese twin, getting into Louis' penthouse is going to be next to impossible.
But how long can I wait?
You know, for the tenth time,
I barely saw Kaja that night.
I was working.
She got off at 2:00 A.M., and I don't know what she did after that.
Whatever you decide to get into after this, forget writing, 'cause you could not make up a story to save your fucking life.
Security tapes back him up.
Shit.
Are you sure?
No doubt.
He was at the club all night working.
Well, it looks like some of what you said wasn't bullshit.
You were working when Kaja was killed.
We still don't like the fact that you vanished the day after she died.
Smells like guilt to me.
You could have had someone else do it for you.
- No way.
- What happened?
She start sleeping around on you?
- Kaja was loyal.
- Loyal, huh?
Mm-hmm.
So she was doing you.
At least we're getting somewhere.
The problem is now we know you've been lying to us about you and Kaja.
And that's bad form, Tony.
We tend to get cranky when people bullshit us.
Now, if you think what we're doing to the club is bad, wait till we start on you.
She was with Viktor.
Say again?
The night that Kaja died.
She left the club with Viktor.
Fucking sleazebag.
Who the fuck is Viktor?
Hey.
How's it going out there?
Don't ask.
- Bad as you thought?
- Worse.
We sit in the sun waiting for the diggers to find a body.
I mean, so far they've uncovered a telephone cable and a bag of used diapers.
I mean, all this waiting around...
It's like dating a born-again Christian.
If I don't have Deb watching my every move, it'll be a lot easier to slip away to Louis' apartment.
You know, I'm getting a little stir crazy.
I wouldn't mind a day out of the lab.
Dude, oh, my God, I would be eternally grateful, but you'd have to clear it with your sister.
For some reason, she really wants me out there.
You think she secretly hates me?
I'll see what I can do.
Masuka's miserable on this whole Wayne Randall thing.
He's begging me to take over for him today.
Okay.
Great.
Great.
I'll drive.
You'll drive?
I could use some fresh air.
Let's go.
We just got a break on Mike's shooting.
What?
The last person to see Kaja alive was Viktor Baskov.
He's a Russian expat.
We couldn't find anything on him in here, but we got a hit on the Interpol database.
It turns out he's a member of the Koshka Brotherhood in the Ukraine, known for narcotics and human trafficking.
Hold on.
I have to take care of this.
Are we good?
Deb, I'll be surrounded by federal marshals.
I think I'll be okay.
It was 15 years ago.
Give me a fucking break.
Where are the bodies, Wayne?
Closer to the road.
But why'd you tell us to dig here?
Because this place looks completely different.
Look at these mini-malls.
You think I like being out here with you in the fucking heat?
All right.
Listen.
We're moving.
Strike this.
Okay.
Ha.
One more wit, he'd be a fucking half-wit.
God.
Oh, it's hot as a pig's asshole.
All this asphalt.
You know, this used to be a real pretty place.
Field, trees.
Now look at it.
Nothing stays the same.
That's the truth.
Well, at least the Frosty Swirl's still here.
You surprised a lot of people.
How's that?
Leading us to these bodies.
Why the change of heart?
Why do you care?
I'm just curious.
People say you grew a conscience.
It was always there.
It was just buried under a lot of Wayne Randall.
I just surrendered.
Surrendered?
All right.
Let's break for lunch.
We'll pick this up in an hour.
Oh, here we go.
Getting to Louis' penthouse and back in an hour will be tight, but I'm not exactly flush with options.
I can appreciate the mind-set of a collector...
But toys?
Seems like a waste of a good obsession.
My charge card numbers?
So Louis killed my credit cards.
Why is he messing with my life?
Uh, it features 29 points of articulation, five more than the last figure they put out, so at least they're listening to the collectors.
Uh, still, they could have--
Idea:
A video diary app.
One touch, device starts recording.
Tap again, and it uploads directly to--
Still waiting.
- Yeah, I'm almost done.
- Your hour's almost up.
I'm only thinking of you.
Oh God.
There'll never be an app for this.
Jesus.
This is going to be worse than Bob Henley.
He got off easy.
I want to see Dexter lying in his own piss and vomit, and I won't stop until that represents the high point of his day.
No one fucks with me.
No one.
Now, on to more important things.
4.99--
Bob Henley.
"Henley arrested after the FBI found child pornography
"on his workstation.
"Skanda Tech has announced his dismissal pending charges which could fetch up to 15 years."
Is this how Louis took control of his software company, by setting this guy up?
What's he planning for me?
With Deb on my case,
I don't know when I'll have this chance again.
Why are you fucking with me, Louis?
God, please, don't hurt me.
You better give me a good reason not to hurt you, because right now I really want to break your neck.
Why'd you send me the hand?
It was just a-- it was a stupid joke.
I just--you know, the lifelines, you know, time is short.
It was a clue.
I was screwing with you.
Why?
Uh, because...
I came to you for help with my game, and you said no.
Your game?
Uhh!
Yes, I swear that's the reason.
Gah--
This is about your game?
I spent five years on that game, and you shit all over it.
And now I'm too depressed to even look at it, okay?
It was my whole world.
I never wanna see you again.
Work.
Jamie.
Do you understand?
I'm done.
I'm totally done.
Where the fuck have you been?
Running an errand.
What errand?
Deb, I didn't kill anybody.
How the fuck do I know that?
I've been calling you and calling you.
Well, I didn't get the messages.
Well, check your fucking phone.
I need to know where you are at all times.
That is what we agreed on, right?
It won't happen again.
Finish what you need to do here, and then we'll go visit Harrison together.
Okay.
Here you are.
Seems you rode that wagon until the wheels came off.
- Trouble in paradise?
- No, she's my sister.
Also my boss.
Congratulations.
You just redefined hell.
What crawled up her ass?
It's a long story.
Randall, what'd you mean earlier when you said "surrendered"?
I just accepted my situation, you know, of being where I am.
Prison.
People watching your every move.
It is what it is.
Once I stopped fighting it, the anger just fell off...
Like a bad scab.
Left me open to try and make things right.
They still use real ice cream.
At least everything hasn't gone to hell.
We're still not getting anywhere, George.
I mean, you really must like us coming here.
There's nothing I can do about it.
Well, stop protecting Viktor Baskov.
- I told you...
- Yeah, he doesn't work here.
Just comes in for a drink now and then.
- That's all I know.
- Right.
We'll see you soon.
I might even bring a portable polygraph next time.
You know how long it would take to poly everyone in here?
Okay.
Everybody get your asses back to work.
Rough day?
Isaak.
Mr. Sirko.
What are you doing here?
I heard the police.
It would appear that I'm here for the same reason, to find Viktor.
Yeah, I swear.
I have no idea how they got his name.
I'm sure of it.
But we'll get to that.
Anyway, I thought he was in Kiev with you.
If Viktor was in Kiev, why would I be here?
Viktor never made his flight.
I checked.
I don't understand.
Where is he, then?
Viktor's caused us some problems.
I won't deny it.
Shooting a policeman is never good for business.
I can't help but wonder if someone in the brotherhood decided to make an example of him.
Without your approval?
No, no, no.
Viktor was impulsive, yes.
He did a stupid thing, yes.
But he was one of us.
And we would always protect him.
You're in luck.
Why?
I believe you.
I've had a long flight.
We have a lot to discuss.
- Hello?
- Hello, Joey?
It's Nadia from the Fox Hole.
Yeah, how many Nadias do you think I know?
- What's up?
- My car won't start.
I was wondering if maybe you could give me a ride home tonight.
Yeah, sure.
What time do you get off?
Hey, we were just having a little dinner.
Look who's here.
Hey, bud, I missed you today.
- How was school?
- We had toy share.
- Toy share?
- Mm-hmm.
Did you bring your train set?
Fire truck.
Fire truck beat out the train set?
Yes.
Oh, hey, Dex.
Just grabbing one for the road.
I know you don't like me being on this side alone, but it's all right when Jamie's here, right?
Why not?
Sweet.
This is such a great place to hang out.
Right by the bay.
- Yeah.
- I love coming over here.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I better get going.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll catch you at work, right?
He's not scared of me at all.
And he's not going to quit unless I stop him.
You're a lifesaver.
Not all cops are so nice to strippers.
To tell you the truth,
I was hoping you had something more for me.
More for you?
About the murders.
What?
You think this is just some ploy so I can get you alone and spill my guts?
Look, I told you everything that I knew.
My car really did break down.
Sorry.
If you want, I could pay you for the gas.
Stop it.
It's fine.
It's the least I can do after all I'm costing you in tips.
You'll have to do a lot more than give me a lift to make up for that.
This is it.
On the left.
What'd you have in mind as far as compensation?
I don't know.
Use your imagination.
Well, you're gonna have to give me a hint.
I'm very unimaginative.
Okay.
George says the problem with my car could be the transmission.
Mm-hmm.
It means it's going to be in the shop for at least a few days.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you could pick up the bill.
I'd really appreciate it.
You're awfully quiet tonight.
Anything you wanna talk about?
Anything I can do?
Yeah.
What?
Do you have any A.1.?
I think so.
Just enough for a good night's sleep.
That's all I need.
Success!
Thank you.
Just finishing what you started.
I promised Deb.
Hello?
Where are you?
Sorry.
I got here as fast as I could.
I almost drove off the road.
I'm so fucking tired.
What are you doing here?
I snuck out of the house while you were asleep.
Dexter, what the fuck did you do?
Nothing.
I couldn't go through with it, but I wanted to.
I needed to.
I didn't care about anything else.
I lost control.
All I could see was blood.
All I could feel was the pressure... in my head.
Fuck.
It is too deep inside me.
Harry was right.
I am a monster.
You should arrest me.
You should take me in.
Get me off the street.
Dex, dad was wrong.
The fact that we're here tonight proves that you are in control.
- But I wasn't.
- But you stopped.
That's what's important.
It must've been so hard for you to call me, but you did, and that's a huge step.
It makes me think maybe you can control this.
You really believe that?
I didn't, but maybe now I do.
What happened tonight is a good thing.
It was really, really good.
I'm not gonna give up, and I'm not gonna let you give up.
Are you okay to drive?
No, I'm gonna stay with you.
I just need to be alone for a couple of minutes.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Okay.
You'll wake up with a headache, probably have a decent idea how you got here.
Maybe that's a good thing.
I still have to get you out of my life.
But not by taking yours.
What the fuck?
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm your employer-- or rather, former employer.
I believe you recently gave notice.
Bullshit.
I work for George.
- Well, worked.
- And he works for me.
My name is Isaak.
I'm the owner of the Fox Hole chain of gentlemen's clubs, amongst other enterprises.
What do you want?
Well, it would appear that George neglected to do your exit interview.
It's company policy, and I'm a stickler when it comes to rules.
You got-- you got to be kidding, right?
Keeping good employees is essential to running a successful business.
Your feedback is important.
Would you mind telling me why you quit?
Well, I trust it wasn't the hostile working environment.
No, I, um...
I just felt it was time to move on.
So it was nothing to do with the tragic death of one of our dancers?
Kaja, I believe her name was.
Because if it did, I would completely understand.
It must have been quite a traumatic loss for you.
What do you mean?
Maybe that's why you talked to the police.
No way.
I had you followed.
You know what?
I didn't say a word.
I swear.
I lied.
I didn't have you followed.
You were just the most likely candidate.
- You loved her, didn't you?
- What?
Kaja.
You were in love with her.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's the one thing that gives meaning in this life.
I would have done the same thing if I was in your position.
It's terrible to lose someone you love.
You still thinking about last night?
Actually, I'm thinking about how much I could go for a Frosty Swirl.
That's good.
A sudden craving for sugar is good?
Well, if you're thinking about normal things, then maybe you're becoming more normal.
I'm never going to be normal, Deb.
Yeah.
None of us really are.
Where are you going?
I want a Frosty Swirl.
I'll bring you one.
She'll always be watching me.
But maybe that's okay.
If Wayne Randall can make peace with his sentence, who am I to complain?
Especially considering the alternative.
Well, well.
Looks like you two are ready to eat each other's shit.
Oh, yeah.
We kind of patched things up.
I'm happy for you.
I never got to do that with Hannah.
Robin to my Batman.
I was never as alive as I was when I was with her.
Every day was like
Christmas day-- unwrapped present.
I wish I had a chance to tell her how I felt.
You can still tell her.
Yeah.
I'm afraid the clock has run out.
Damn, I sure as fuck... gonna miss that.
Hannah used to think I was something special.
Now she sees me as just a killer.
And you know what?
She's not wrong.
There's just one last person I need to kill.
He never cared if anyone found the bodies.
He just wanted a couple of days of sunshine and Frosty Swirl.
Randall didn't change, and he couldn't take life in prison.
Can I?
Previously, on Dexter...
- Where's your lug wrench at?
- No--
We are investigating the homicide of a Miami Metro police officer.
Viktor left on an evening flight.
He arrives in Kiev at 5:25 P.M., your time.
What about the dead police officer?
- I'll make it go away.
- Good.
Hello, Viktor.
Is there anything I can do to keep you from killing me?
No.
In my game, you can be the serial killer.
I think this is offensive.
Who would choose to be a serial killer?
It's a bad idea.
Do something else.
Only one person who ever worked at Miami Metro ever took blood slides.
Sergeant Doakes, the Bay Harbor Butcher.
What happened was too strong.
It got into you too early.
You mustn't ever tell Debra the truth about yourself.
If you think she's upset now, that's nothing compared to how she'd feel if she learned what you are.
Dexter, what the fuck?
You said Travis came at you with a sword.
Where did you get the knives?
There was, like, a whole roll of them.
I'm just trying to put this together.
Are you a serial killer?
Yes.
I've dreaded this moment my whole life... but I never pictured it like this.
Don't you fucking touch me.
I just want to know you're okay.
I am not okay.
I am never gonna fucking be okay.
- Just try to take it easy.
- Ohh...
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.
How long have you been doing this?
How long have you been fucking doing this?
Since I was 20.
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.
Those blood slides that I found in your apartment, they look like the ones we found in Doakes' car.
Deb...
Are you the Bay Harbor Butcher?
This is not the place to talk about this.
Deb...
I only kill certain kinds of people...
- Oh, God.
- Like Travis.
Deb, dad taught me.
He gave me a code.
Dad knew?
It was his idea.
He knew everything.
- Oh, fuck.
- Deb.
Please, just... just come back inside with me.
Please.
Harry found me sitting in a pool of my mother's blood.
He understood why I had these... urges.
A lot of horrible things happen to a lot of people, and they don't turn out like you.
I don't know about other people.
But I have this... need deep inside me.
I call it my Dark Passenger.
You gave it a name?
Harry said it got in me too early and too deep.
He said I couldn't change it.
And so...
he thought up the code.
He said if I had to kill,
I might as well kill people who deserved it.
You make it sound like it's okay-- like you're the victim here.
The people in that box, Dexter-- they're the victims.
Victims?
A choir director who raped and murdered little boys?
A married couple smuggling refugees who killed the ones who couldn't pay?
A psychiatrist who manipulated women into taking their own lives?
There's this place called the police department.
Sometimes the system doesn't work.
Killers fall through the cracks.
Don't I fucking know it?
I'm talking to one right now.
I am the worst fucking detective in the world.
You're my own brother.
How could I not see what you were doing?
You're not responsible for this.
Well, I am now.
I helped you cover up Travis' murder.
I'm an accomplice.
You walked in on me.
I had to think on my feet.
Well, fuck me for ruining your night.
What am I supposed to do here?
My name has the word "Lieutenant" in front of it.
I can't turn my back on this.
All of this is very, very fucking wrong.
So...
What are you gonna do?
Uhh!
I never wanted her to go through this, Dex.
Neither did I.
Then you should have been more careful.
At least she didn't arrest me.
Not yet.
What is this doing here?
Is it some kind of message?
Maybe someone else is on to me.
"According to FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy,
"it's almost certain that the Butcher is still at work.
"Serial killers have an addiction and will continue to kill until they're caught."
If the ITK hand in my apartment is genuine, then it can't still be in evidence.
Not here.
Then I was sent the real thing.
No record of it being checked out.
Could it have been stolen?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Saw you come in here.
I just got curious.
- Now I wish I hadn't.
- Why?
You're looking for the hand, aren't you?
Look, I can explain.
Look, remember my former intern Ryan?
Blonde, stacked, and the cause of many sleepless nights?
Yeah.
Well, she needed some extra dough, so she stole the hand and auctioned it online.
That's why I fired her.
Who won the auction?
Don't know.
I put Louis on the case to find out.
Louis?
Now, even with all his digital skills, he couldn't dig up a name.
At least he was able to erase the electronic trail.
Did Louis find the hand and keep it?
No one needs to know, right?
But why send the work of a serial killer to me?
Does Louis know what I am?
Dex?
What?
We're cool, right?
Yeah.
No one needs to know.
Oh, thank God.
I was ready to blow you.
Not necessary.
Briefing.
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.
I have to find out what Louis knows about me.
Some time alone with him, and he'd open up-- one way or another.
But I need to put out fires, not start new ones.
Remember him?
It's been three days since Mike was gunned down, and the son of a bitch that pulled the trigger is still walking the streets.
Where are we?
We're continuing to hit the club where Miss Soroka was employed.
Someone there must've seen something related to her death.
We still think it's our best shot at a lead, so we're going to shut them down every night.
You know, those places do big business during lunch too.
Just saying.
Start shutting them down twice a day.
- With pleasure.
- Moving on.
This pretty face belongs to Wayne Randall.
15 years ago, Randall and his teenage girlfriend went on a three-state killing spree that ended here in Miami.
He's currently serving two consecutive life terms at Dade.
Randall now claims to have evidence on three other murders that he committed in the Miami area, and he wants to come clean.
He wants to lead investigators to where he buried the bodies.
Hmm.
That's nice of him.
He says he wants to clear his conscience.
I think his lawyers are just trying to swing a deal.
- What's he telling us?
- He told us about one victim, a brunette in her mid-20s that matches a missing persons report from that time, a Janice Dubois.
So then there's a chance he's not completely full of shit.
County has requested one detective and one lab tech to help them process the scene.
Miller, you're volunteer number one.
- I'll go.
- No.
I want Masuka on this.
Aw.
I don't to work a dumpsite.
Come on lieutenant, I'm up to my ears on Mike's case.
I'm sorry.
You're with Miller.
Contact info will be in your boxes.
You'll start tomorrow.
That's it.
Thank you.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
I was this close to arresting you this morning.
I even thought about what I would say to the press.
I wouldn't want to have to write that speech.
I don't know what to do.
Every alternative I can think of... is fucking crazy.
Such as?
It's fucked up.
Try me.
The say people like you are addicts.
Like drugs.
It's not untrue.
Well, when addicts want to get better, they go to rehab.
I don't think there are clinics for what I've got.
We can make one.
I could be your clinic.
- How?
- You move in with me.
I watch you 24/7 and make sure that there's no way in hell you can... do what you do.
And...
If it is an addiction, then maybe-- maybe you can get over it.
You're right.
It's crazy.
Dexter, if you can channel your urges, why can't you control them?
What if dad had taught you how to quit instead of teaching you how to live with it?
He fucked up.
Deb, there's a big problem with this idea.
What?
I've tried stopping before.
It didn't work.
Well, now you have me.
Someone who loves you more than you will ever fucking know.
And in spite all of this,
I still believe that there is good in you.
Maybe more that's in most people.
What if it doesn't work?
I don't want to think about that.
And how much choice do I have here?
None.
Okay.
Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.
I'm curious.
Your facilities are state-of-the-art.
Why go through a private lab?
Just trying to lighten the load.
It's been a hectic few months.
But just to confirm, the blood you sampled from the glass fragment is a positive match with Travis Marshall's?
No question about it.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Remember, keep this confidential.
And when you send back the findings, address them to me personally, okay?
- No problem.
- Great.
Thanks.
Yes, captain?
Regional FBI office, please.
We are back.
Hey.
I won't allow this to go on.
This is harassment.
No, this is an inconvenience.
We're working our way up to harassment.
I told you the last time you were here,
I don't know who killed Kaja.
I don't know who shot your policeman.
Kaja was clubbed to death in the parking lot 15 yards from where we are now.
- No one here saw anything.
- Sell that shit somewhere else.
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna keep coming here every day and shut me down?
No, I'm coming back tonight too.
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want the shooter.
Now, you better rack your brain and give me something, or I'm gonna turn this place into a fucking monastery.
Mm-hmm.
You got that list?
Follow me.
You know, the money we make here is all we have to live on.
What you're doing is really unfair.
What's your name?
Nadia.
Come here.
Have a drink.
We're not supposed to drink while we're working.
Come on.
You hear any music playing?
Now, what you said isn't true.
I do care who killed Kaja, but no one around here seems interested in helping me find out who it is.
Okay?
Do you know anybody who might be interested in hurting your friend?
You've been told not to cooperate with us?
Kaja was dating someone.
Tony Rush.
He's one of the bouncers here.
They were on and off, but Tony is a good guy.
Can you point Tony out to me?
He's not here today.
Mm-hmm.
I really hope you catch the person who did this and put a bullet through his head.
That's not generally how we work, but I get where you're coming from.
Here, if you can think of anything to help, just give me a call.
I will...
Detective Quinn.
Joey.
Excuse me.
Joey.
- Tell me you got the shooter.
- Possibly.
One of the bouncers hasn't come to work
- since the night of the murders.
- Tony Rush.
- How'd you know?
- He and Kaja were an item.
Suspicious timing, don't you think?
- The sudden absence?
- Mm-hmm.
Come on.
Hey.
You're gonna sleep in the bedroom.
I'm not gonna put you out.
Yes, you are.
I'm sleeping out here.
Deb, that's ridiculous.
This isn't a fucking pajama party, Dex, okay?
You're gonna take my bedroom, and I'm gonna sleep out here on the couch.
Between me and the front door?
I will be by the door.
You've really thought this through.
Yeah, well, I found this website--
"How to cure a serial killer in ten easy steps,"
and this is the first step.
You'll have to print me out a copy.
I'm figuring this out as I go along, Dexter.
But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it all the way.
We're gonna eat together, we're gonna watch TV together, we're gonna drive to fucking work together.
Hope you got a big shower.
Why don't you go unpack.
I'll heat us up something to eat.
You have to be completely honest with me.
That is the first rule.
My new code.
Don't you think Deb has gone through enough without you lying to her again?
I'm not lying.
You're a killer, Dex.
Deb didn't raise you.
I did.
She never saw what you were really like.
I did.
I was right to channel your urges instead of trying to suppress them.
You think I can just walk out of here and call the whole thing off?
If it were this simple, watching you for 24 hours a day, don't you think I would have tried it?
Maybe you should've.
How does it feel... this need to kill?
What do you call it?
My Dark Passenger.
You make it sound like you're possessed or something.
That's how it feels sometimes.
Do you know how many assholes in prison blame their actions on someone or something else?
I'm not copping a plea, Deb.
I'm giving you honesty.
It's rule number one, right?
How's the spaghetti?
Overcooked.
First rule.
So how does it feel?
It starts with blood.
Blood?
Yeah, the image of it.
Trickling down the back of my eyelids.
The trickle becomes a stream and then a flood.
It fills me up... all my empty spaces.
But then the blood isn't red anymore.
What is it?
It's black.
And pressing.
It feels like my head is gonna explode.
The only way to relieve the pressure is to open the floodgates and let it spill out.
I can't believe you're like this.
You're a sick fuck, Dexter.
Jesus Christ.
Well, maybe we shouldn't talk about it.
Yeah, maybe not while I'm serving fucking tomato sauce.
Are you seeing blood now?
Nope, just spaghetti.
Well, if you start seeing red, will you fucking call me?
And say what?
"Deb, I'm seeing blood"?
Say, "I really feel... like wrapping someone up in plastic and stabbing them."
And I can say, "No, Dexter, don't."
Second rule.
There have to be families out there that are more fucked up than us.
But I sure as hell wouldn't wanna meet them.
What the fuck am I doing here?
What you think's right.
Right would be turning you in.
I'm doing this because you're my brother, and I can't stand the idea of you living the rest of your life in prison.
Or worse.
I told Deb I'd be honest with her, but it's not like I'm stalking a kill.
I just need to get into Louis' penthouse and find out what he knows about me.
Are you okay?
It's late.
Yeah.
I'm just doing some work.
I'll sit with you.
Deb, I'm fine.
No.
You shouldn't be alone right now.
I mean, awake and alone.
Yeah.
Maybe I should try to get some sleep.
Just know that I'm here for you.
How could I forget?
Now that Deb is my Siamese twin, getting into Louis' penthouse is going to be next to impossible.
But how long can I wait?
You know, for the tenth time,
I barely saw Kaja that night.
I was working.
She got off at 2:00 A.M., and I don't know what she did after that.
Whatever you decide to get into after this, forget writing, 'cause you could not make up a story to save your fucking life.
Security tapes back him up.
Shit.
Are you sure?
No doubt.
He was at the club all night working.
Well, it looks like some of what you said wasn't bullshit.
You were working when Kaja was killed.
We still don't like the fact that you vanished the day after she died.
Smells like guilt to me.
You could have had someone else do it for you.
- No way.
- What happened?
She start sleeping around on you?
- Kaja was loyal.
- Loyal, huh?
Mm-hmm.
So she was doing you.
At least we're getting somewhere.
The problem is now we know you've been lying to us about you and Kaja.
And that's bad form, Tony.
We tend to get cranky when people bullshit us.
Now, if you think what we're doing to the club is bad, wait till we start on you.
She was with Viktor.
Say again?
The night that Kaja died.
She left the club with Viktor.
Fucking sleazebag.
Who the fuck is Viktor?
Hey.
How's it going out there?
Don't ask.
- Bad as you thought?
- Worse.
We sit in the sun waiting for the diggers to find a body.
I mean, so far they've uncovered a telephone cable and a bag of used diapers.
I mean, all this waiting around...
It's like dating a born-again Christian.
If I don't have Deb watching my every move, it'll be a lot easier to slip away to Louis' apartment.
You know, I'm getting a little stir crazy.
I wouldn't mind a day out of the lab.
Dude, oh, my God, I would be eternally grateful, but you'd have to clear it with your sister.
For some reason, she really wants me out there.
You think she secretly hates me?
I'll see what I can do.
Masuka's miserable on this whole Wayne Randall thing.
He's begging me to take over for him today.
Okay.
Great.
Great.
I'll drive.
You'll drive?
I could use some fresh air.
Let's go.
We just got a break on Mike's shooting.
What?
The last person to see Kaja alive was Viktor Baskov.
He's a Russian expat.
We couldn't find anything on him in here, but we got a hit on the Interpol database.
It turns out he's a member of the Koshka Brotherhood in the Ukraine, known for narcotics and human trafficking.
Hold on.
I have to take care of this.
Are we good?
Deb, I'll be surrounded by federal marshals.
I think I'll be okay.
It was 15 years ago.
Give me a fucking break.
Where are the bodies, Wayne?
Closer to the road.
But why'd you tell us to dig here?
Because this place looks completely different.
Look at these mini-malls.
You think I like being out here with you in the fucking heat?
All right.
Listen.
We're moving.
Strike this.
Okay.
Ha.
One more wit, he'd be a fucking half-wit.
God.
Oh, it's hot as a pig's asshole.
All this asphalt.
You know, this used to be a real pretty place.
Field, trees.
Now look at it.
Nothing stays the same.
That's the truth.
Well, at least the Frosty Swirl's still here.
You surprised a lot of people.
How's that?
Leading us to these bodies.
Why the change of heart?
Why do you care?
I'm just curious.
People say you grew a conscience.
It was always there.
It was just buried under a lot of Wayne Randall.
I just surrendered.
Surrendered?
All right.
Let's break for lunch.
We'll pick this up in an hour.
Oh, here we go.
Getting to Louis' penthouse and back in an hour will be tight, but I'm not exactly flush with options.
I can appreciate the mind-set of a collector...
But toys?
Seems like a waste of a good obsession.
My charge card numbers?
So Louis killed my credit cards.
Why is he messing with my life?
Uh, it features 29 points of articulation, five more than the last figure they put out, so at least they're listening to the collectors.
Uh, still, they could have--
Idea:
A video diary app.
One touch, device starts recording.
Tap again, and it uploads directly to--
Still waiting.
- Yeah, I'm almost done.
- Your hour's almost up.
I'm only thinking of you.
Oh God.
There'll never be an app for this.
Jesus.
This is going to be worse than Bob Henley.
He got off easy.
I want to see Dexter lying in his own piss and vomit, and I won't stop until that represents the high point of his day.
No one fucks with me.
No one.
Now, on to more important things.
4.99--
Bob Henley.
"Henley arrested after the FBI found child pornography
"on his workstation.
"Skanda Tech has announced his dismissal pending charges which could fetch up to 15 years."
Is this how Louis took control of his software company, by setting this guy up?
What's he planning for me?
With Deb on my case,
I don't know when I'll have this chance again.
Why are you fucking with me, Louis?
God, please, don't hurt me.
You better give me a good reason not to hurt you, because right now I really want to break your neck.
Why'd you send me the hand?
It was just a-- it was a stupid joke.
I just--you know, the lifelines, you know, time is short.
It was a clue.
I was screwing with you.
Why?
Uh, because...
I came to you for help with my game, and you said no.
Your game?
Uhh!
Yes, I swear that's the reason.
Gah--
This is about your game?
I spent five years on that game, and you shit all over it.
And now I'm too depressed to even look at it, okay?
It was my whole world.
I never wanna see you again.
Work.
Jamie.
Do you understand?
I'm done.
I'm totally done.
Where the fuck have you been?
Running an errand.
What errand?
Deb, I didn't kill anybody.
How the fuck do I know that?
I've been calling you and calling you.
Well, I didn't get the messages.
Well, check your fucking phone.
I need to know where you are at all times.
That is what we agreed on, right?
It won't happen again.
Finish what you need to do here, and then we'll go visit Harrison together.
Okay.
Here you are.
Seems you rode that wagon until the wheels came off.
- Trouble in paradise?
- No, she's my sister.
Also my boss.
Congratulations.
You just redefined hell.
What crawled up her ass?
It's a long story.
Randall, what'd you mean earlier when you said "surrendered"?
I just accepted my situation, you know, of being where I am.
Prison.
People watching your every move.
It is what it is.
Once I stopped fighting it, the anger just fell off...
Like a bad scab.
Left me open to try and make things right.
They still use real ice cream.
At least everything hasn't gone to hell.
We're still not getting anywhere, George.
I mean, you really must like us coming here.
There's nothing I can do about it.
Well, stop protecting Viktor Baskov.
- I told you...
- Yeah, he doesn't work here.
Just comes in for a drink now and then.
- That's all I know.
- Right.
We'll see you soon.
I might even bring a portable polygraph next time.
You know how long it would take to poly everyone in here?
Okay.
Everybody get your asses back to work.
Rough day?
Isaak.
Mr. Sirko.
What are you doing here?
I heard the police.
It would appear that I'm here for the same reason, to find Viktor.
Yeah, I swear.
I have no idea how they got his name.
I'm sure of it.
But we'll get to that.
Anyway, I thought he was in Kiev with you.
If Viktor was in Kiev, why would I be here?
Viktor never made his flight.
I checked.
I don't understand.
Where is he, then?
Viktor's caused us some problems.
I won't deny it.
Shooting a policeman is never good for business.
I can't help but wonder if someone in the brotherhood decided to make an example of him.
Without your approval?
No, no, no.
Viktor was impulsive, yes.
He did a stupid thing, yes.
But he was one of us.
And we would always protect him.
You're in luck.
Why?
I believe you.
I've had a long flight.
We have a lot to discuss.
- Hello?
- Hello, Joey?
It's Nadia from the Fox Hole.
Yeah, how many Nadias do you think I know?
- What's up?
- My car won't start.
I was wondering if maybe you could give me a ride home tonight.
Yeah, sure.
What time do you get off?
Hey, we were just having a little dinner.
Look who's here.
Hey, bud, I missed you today.
- How was school?
- We had toy share.
- Toy share?
- Mm-hmm.
Did you bring your train set?
Fire truck.
Fire truck beat out the train set?
Yes.
Oh, hey, Dex.
Just grabbing one for the road.
I know you don't like me being on this side alone, but it's all right when Jamie's here, right?
Why not?
Sweet.
This is such a great place to hang out.
Right by the bay.
- Yeah.
- I love coming over here.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I better get going.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll catch you at work, right?
He's not scared of me at all.
And he's not going to quit unless I stop him.
You're a lifesaver.
Not all cops are so nice to strippers.
To tell you the truth,
I was hoping you had something more for me.
More for you?
About the murders.
What?
You think this is just some ploy so I can get you alone and spill my guts?
Look, I told you everything that I knew.
My car really did break down.
Sorry.
If you want, I could pay you for the gas.
Stop it.
It's fine.
It's the least I can do after all I'm costing you in tips.
You'll have to do a lot more than give me a lift to make up for that.
This is it.
On the left.
What'd you have in mind as far as compensation?
I don't know.
Use your imagination.
Well, you're gonna have to give me a hint.
I'm very unimaginative.
Okay.
George says the problem with my car could be the transmission.
Mm-hmm.
It means it's going to be in the shop for at least a few days.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you could pick up the bill.
I'd really appreciate it.
You're awfully quiet tonight.
Anything you wanna talk about?
Anything I can do?
Yeah.
What?
Do you have any A.1.?
I think so.
Just enough for a good night's sleep.
That's all I need.
Success!
Thank you.
Just finishing what you started.
I promised Deb.
Hello?
Where are you?
Sorry.
I got here as fast as I could.
I almost drove off the road.
I'm so fucking tired.
What are you doing here?
I snuck out of the house while you were asleep.
Dexter, what the fuck did you do?
Nothing.
I couldn't go through with it, but I wanted to.
I needed to.
I didn't care about anything else.
I lost control.
All I could see was blood.
All I could feel was the pressure... in my head.
Fuck.
It is too deep inside me.
Harry was right.
I am a monster.
You should arrest me.
You should take me in.
Get me off the street.
Dex, dad was wrong.
The fact that we're here tonight proves that you are in control.
- But I wasn't.
- But you stopped.
That's what's important.
It must've been so hard for you to call me, but you did, and that's a huge step.
It makes me think maybe you can control this.
You really believe that?
I didn't, but maybe now I do.
What happened tonight is a good thing.
It was really, really good.
I'm not gonna give up, and I'm not gonna let you give up.
Are you okay to drive?
No, I'm gonna stay with you.
I just need to be alone for a couple of minutes.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Okay.
You'll wake up with a headache, probably have a decent idea how you got here.
Maybe that's a good thing.
I still have to get you out of my life.
But not by taking yours.
What the fuck?
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm your employer-- or rather, former employer.
I believe you recently gave notice.
Bullshit.
I work for George.
- Well, worked.
- And he works for me.
My name is Isaak.
I'm the owner of the Fox Hole chain of gentlemen's clubs, amongst other enterprises.
What do you want?
Well, it would appear that George neglected to do your exit interview.
It's company policy, and I'm a stickler when it comes to rules.
You got-- you got to be kidding, right?
Keeping good employees is essential to running a successful business.
Your feedback is important.
Would you mind telling me why you quit?
Well, I trust it wasn't the hostile working environment.
No, I, um...
I just felt it was time to move on.
So it was nothing to do with the tragic death of one of our dancers?
Kaja, I believe her name was.
Because if it did, I would completely understand.
It must have been quite a traumatic loss for you.
What do you mean?
Maybe that's why you talked to the police.
No way.
I had you followed.
You know what?
I didn't say a word.
I swear.
I lied.
I didn't have you followed.
You were just the most likely candidate.
- You loved her, didn't you?
- What?
Kaja.
You were in love with her.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's the one thing that gives meaning in this life.
I would have done the same thing if I was in your position.
It's terrible to lose someone you love.
You still thinking about last night?
Actually, I'm thinking about how much I could go for a Frosty Swirl.
That's good.
A sudden craving for sugar is good?
Well, if you're thinking about normal things, then maybe you're becoming more normal.
I'm never going to be normal, Deb.
Yeah.
None of us really are.
Where are you going?
I want a Frosty Swirl.
I'll bring you one.
She'll always be watching me.
But maybe that's okay.
If Wayne Randall can make peace with his sentence, who am I to complain?
Especially considering the alternative.
Well, well.
Looks like you two are ready to eat each other's shit.
Oh, yeah.
We kind of patched things up.
I'm happy for you.
I never got to do that with Hannah.
Robin to my Batman.
I was never as alive as I was when I was with her.
Every day was like
Christmas day-- unwrapped present.
I wish I had a chance to tell her how I felt.
You can still tell her.
Yeah.
I'm afraid the clock has run out.
Damn, I sure as fuck... gonna miss that.
Hannah used to think I was something special.
Now she sees me as just a killer.
And you know what?
She's not wrong.
There's just one last person I need to kill.
He never cared if anyone found the bodies.
He just wanted a couple of days of sunshine and Frosty Swirl.
Randall didn't change, and he couldn't take life in prison.
Can I?
Previously, on Dexter...
- Where's your lug wrench at?
- No--
We are investigating the homicide of a Miami Metro police officer.
Viktor left on an evening flight.
He arrives in Kiev at 5:25 P.M., your time.
What about the dead police officer?
- I'll make it go away.
- Good.
Hello, Viktor.
Is there anything I can do to keep you from killing me?
No.
In my game, you can be the serial killer.
I think this is offensive.
Who would choose to be a serial killer?
It's a bad idea.
Do something else.
Only one person who ever worked at Miami Metro ever took blood slides.
Sergeant Doakes, the Bay Harbor Butcher.
What happened was too strong.
It got into you too early.
You mustn't ever tell Debra the truth about yourself.
If you think she's upset now, that's nothing compared to how she'd feel if she learned what you are.
Dexter, what the fuck?
You said Travis came at you with a sword.
Where did you get the knives?
There was, like, a whole roll of them.
I'm just trying to put this together.
Are you a serial killer?
Yes.
I've dreaded this moment my whole life... but I never pictured it like this.
Don't you fucking touch me.
I just want to know you're okay.
I am not okay.
I am never gonna fucking be okay.
- Just try to take it easy.
- Ohh...
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.
How long have you been doing this?
How long have you been fucking doing this?
Since I was 20.
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.
Those blood slides that I found in your apartment, they look like the ones we found in Doakes' car.
Deb...
Are you the Bay Harbor Butcher?
This is not the place to talk about this.
Deb...
I only kill certain kinds of people...
- Oh, God.
- Like Travis.
Deb, dad taught me.
He gave me a code.
Dad knew?
It was his idea.
He knew everything.
- Oh, fuck.
- Deb.
Please, just... just come back inside with me.
Please.
Harry found me sitting in a pool of my mother's blood.
He understood why I had these... urges.
A lot of horrible things happen to a lot of people, and they don't turn out like you.
I don't know about other people.
But I have this... need deep inside me.
I call it my Dark Passenger.
You gave it a name?
Harry said it got in me too early and too deep.
He said I couldn't change it.
And so...
he thought up the code.
He said if I had to kill,
I might as well kill people who deserved it.
You make it sound like it's okay-- like you're the victim here.
The people in that box, Dexter-- they're the victims.
Victims?
A choir director who raped and murdered little boys?
A married couple smuggling refugees who killed the ones who couldn't pay?
A psychiatrist who manipulated women into taking their own lives?
There's this place called the police department.
Sometimes the system doesn't work.
Killers fall through the cracks.
Don't I fucking know it?
I'm talking to one right now.
I am the worst fucking detective in the world.
You're my own brother.
How could I not see what you were doing?
You're not responsible for this.
Well, I am now.
I helped you cover up Travis' murder.
I'm an accomplice.
You walked in on me.
I had to think on my feet.
Well, fuck me for ruining your night.
What am I supposed to do here?
My name has the word "Lieutenant" in front of it.
I can't turn my back on this.
All of this is very, very fucking wrong.
So...
What are you gonna do?
Uhh!
I never wanted her to go through this, Dex.
Neither did I.
Then you should have been more careful.
At least she didn't arrest me.
Not yet.
What is this doing here?
Is it some kind of message?
Maybe someone else is on to me.
"According to FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy,
"it's almost certain that the Butcher is still at work.
"Serial killers have an addiction and will continue to kill until they're caught."
If the ITK hand in my apartment is genuine, then it can't still be in evidence.
Not here.
Then I was sent the real thing.
No record of it being checked out.
Could it have been stolen?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Saw you come in here.
I just got curious.
- Now I wish I hadn't.
- Why?
You're looking for the hand, aren't you?
Look, I can explain.
Look, remember my former intern Ryan?
Blonde, stacked, and the cause of many sleepless nights?
Yeah.
Well, she needed some extra dough, so she stole the hand and auctioned it online.
That's why I fired her.
Who won the auction?
Don't know.
I put Louis on the case to find out.
Louis?
Now, even with all his digital skills, he couldn't dig up a name.
At least he was able to erase the electronic trail.
Did Louis find the hand and keep it?
No one needs to know, right?
But why send the work of a serial killer to me?
Does Louis know what I am?
Dex?
What?
We're cool, right?
Yeah.
No one needs to know.
Oh, thank God.
I was ready to blow you.
Not necessary.
Briefing.
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.
I have to find out what Louis knows about me.
Some time alone with him, and he'd open up-- one way or another.
But I need to put out fires, not start new ones.
Remember him?
It's been three days since Mike was gunned down, and the son of a bitch that pulled the trigger is still walking the streets.
Where are we?
We're continuing to hit the club where Miss Soroka was employed.
Someone there must've seen something related to her death.
We still think it's our best shot at a lead, so we're going to shut them down every night.
You know, those places do big business during lunch too.
Just saying.
Start shutting them down twice a day.
- With pleasure.
- Moving on.
This pretty face belongs to Wayne Randall.
15 years ago, Randall and his teenage girlfriend went on a three-state killing spree that ended here in Miami.
He's currently serving two consecutive life terms at Dade.
Randall now claims to have evidence on three other murders that he committed in the Miami area, and he wants to come clean.
He wants to lead investigators to where he buried the bodies.
Hmm.
That's nice of him.
He says he wants to clear his conscience.
I think his lawyers are just trying to swing a deal.
- What's he telling us?
- He told us about one victim, a brunette in her mid-20s that matches a missing persons report from that time, a Janice Dubois.
So then there's a chance he's not completely full of shit.
County has requested one detective and one lab tech to help them process the scene.
Miller, you're volunteer number one.
- I'll go.
- No.
I want Masuka on this.
Aw.
I don't to work a dumpsite.
Come on lieutenant, I'm up to my ears on Mike's case.
I'm sorry.
You're with Miller.
Contact info will be in your boxes.
You'll start tomorrow.
That's it.
Thank you.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
I was this close to arresting you this morning.
I even thought about what I would say to the press.
I wouldn't want to have to write that speech.
I don't know what to do.
Every alternative I can think of... is fucking crazy.
Such as?
It's fucked up.
Try me.
The say people like you are addicts.
Like drugs.
It's not untrue.
Well, when addicts want to get better, they go to rehab.
I don't think there are clinics for what I've got.
We can make one.
I could be your clinic.
- How?
- You move in with me.
I watch you 24/7 and make sure that there's no way in hell you can... do what you do.
And...
If it is an addiction, then maybe-- maybe you can get over it.
You're right.
It's crazy.
Dexter, if you can channel your urges, why can't you control them?
What if dad had taught you how to quit instead of teaching you how to live with it?
He fucked up.
Deb, there's a big problem with this idea.
What?
I've tried stopping before.
It didn't work.
Well, now you have me.
Someone who loves you more than you will ever fucking know.
And in spite all of this,
I still believe that there is good in you.
Maybe more that's in most people.
What if it doesn't work?
I don't want to think about that.
And how much choice do I have here?
None.
Okay.
Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.
I'm curious.
Your facilities are state-of-the-art.
Why go through a private lab?
Just trying to lighten the load.
It's been a hectic few months.
But just to confirm, the blood you sampled from the glass fragment is a positive match with Travis Marshall's?
No question about it.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Remember, keep this confidential.
And when you send back the findings, address them to me personally, okay?
- No problem.
- Great.
Thanks.
Yes, captain?
Regional FBI office, please.
We are back.
Hey.
I won't allow this to go on.
This is harassment.
No, this is an inconvenience.
We're working our way up to harassment.
I told you the last time you were here,
I don't know who killed Kaja.
I don't know who shot your policeman.
Kaja was clubbed to death in the parking lot 15 yards from where we are now.
- No one here saw anything.
- Sell that shit somewhere else.
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna keep coming here every day and shut me down?
No, I'm coming back tonight too.
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want the shooter.
Now, you better rack your brain and give me something, or I'm gonna turn this place into a fucking monastery.
Mm-hmm.
You got that list?
Follow me.
You know, the money we make here is all we have to live on.
What you're doing is really unfair.
What's your name?
Nadia.
Come here.
Have a drink.
We're not supposed to drink while we're working.
Come on.
You hear any music playing?
Now, what you said isn't true.
I do care who killed Kaja, but no one around here seems interested in helping me find out who it is.
Okay?
Do you know anybody who might be interested in hurting your friend?
You've been told not to cooperate with us?
Kaja was dating someone.
Tony Rush.
He's one of the bouncers here.
They were on and off, but Tony is a good guy.
Can you point Tony out to me?
He's not here today.
Mm-hmm.
I really hope you catch the person who did this and put a bullet through his head.
That's not generally how we work, but I get where you're coming from.
Here, if you can think of anything to help, just give me a call.
I will...
Detective Quinn.
Joey.
Excuse me.
Joey.
- Tell me you got the shooter.
- Possibly.
One of the bouncers hasn't come to work
- since the night of the murders.
- Tony Rush.
- How'd you know?
- He and Kaja were an item.
Suspicious timing, don't you think?
- The sudden absence?
- Mm-hmm.
Come on.
Hey.
You're gonna sleep in the bedroom.
I'm not gonna put you out.
Yes, you are.
I'm sleeping out here.
Deb, that's ridiculous.
This isn't a fucking pajama party, Dex, okay?
You're gonna take my bedroom, and I'm gonna sleep out here on the couch.
Between me and the front door?
I will be by the door.
You've really thought this through.
Yeah, well, I found this website--
"How to cure a serial killer in ten easy steps,"
and this is the first step.
You'll have to print me out a copy.
I'm figuring this out as I go along, Dexter.
But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it all the way.
We're gonna eat together, we're gonna watch TV together, we're gonna drive to fucking work together.
Hope you got a big shower.
Why don't you go unpack.
I'll heat us up something to eat.
You have to be completely honest with me.
That is the first rule.
My new code.
Don't you think Deb has gone through enough without you lying to her again?
I'm not lying.
You're a killer, Dex.
Deb didn't raise you.
I did.
She never saw what you were really like.
I did.
I was right to channel your urges instead of trying to suppress them.
You think I can just walk out of here and call the whole thing off?
If it were this simple, watching you for 24 hours a day, don't you think I would have tried it?
Maybe you should've.
How does it feel... this need to kill?
What do you call it?
My Dark Passenger.
You make it sound like you're possessed or something.
That's how it feels sometimes.
Do you know how many assholes in prison blame their actions on someone or something else?
I'm not copping a plea, Deb.
I'm giving you honesty.
It's rule number one, right?
How's the spaghetti?
Overcooked.
First rule.
So how does it feel?
It starts with blood.
Blood?
Yeah, the image of it.
Trickling down the back of my eyelids.
The trickle becomes a stream and then a flood.
It fills me up... all my empty spaces.
But then the blood isn't red anymore.
What is it?
It's black.
And pressing.
It feels like my head is gonna explode.
The only way to relieve the pressure is to open the floodgates and let it spill out.
I can't believe you're like this.
You're a sick fuck, Dexter.
Jesus Christ.
Well, maybe we shouldn't talk about it.
Yeah, maybe not while I'm serving fucking tomato sauce.
Are you seeing blood now?
Nope, just spaghetti.
Well, if you start seeing red, will you fucking call me?
And say what?
"Deb, I'm seeing blood"?
Say, "I really feel... like wrapping someone up in plastic and stabbing them."
And I can say, "No, Dexter, don't."
Second rule.
There have to be families out there that are more fucked up than us.
But I sure as hell wouldn't wanna meet them.
What the fuck am I doing here?
What you think's right.
Right would be turning you in.
I'm doing this because you're my brother, and I can't stand the idea of you living the rest of your life in prison.
Or worse.
I told Deb I'd be honest with her, but it's not like I'm stalking a kill.
I just need to get into Louis' penthouse and find out what he knows about me.
Are you okay?
It's late.
Yeah.
I'm just doing some work.
I'll sit with you.
Deb, I'm fine.
No.
You shouldn't be alone right now.
I mean, awake and alone.
Yeah.
Maybe I should try to get some sleep.
Just know that I'm here for you.
How could I forget?
Now that Deb is my Siamese twin, getting into Louis' penthouse is going to be next to impossible.
But how long can I wait?
You know, for the tenth time,
I barely saw Kaja that night.
I was working.
She got off at 2:00 A.M., and I don't know what she did after that.
Whatever you decide to get into after this, forget writing, 'cause you could not make up a story to save your fucking life.
Security tapes back him up.
Shit.
Are you sure?
No doubt.
He was at the club all night working.
Well, it looks like some of what you said wasn't bullshit.
You were working when Kaja was killed.
We still don't like the fact that you vanished the day after she died.
Smells like guilt to me.
You could have had someone else do it for you.
- No way.
- What happened?
She start sleeping around on you?
- Kaja was loyal.
- Loyal, huh?
Mm-hmm.
So she was doing you.
At least we're getting somewhere.
The problem is now we know you've been lying to us about you and Kaja.
And that's bad form, Tony.
We tend to get cranky when people bullshit us.
Now, if you think what we're doing to the club is bad, wait till we start on you.
She was with Viktor.
Say again?
The night that Kaja died.
She left the club with Viktor.
Fucking sleazebag.
Who the fuck is Viktor?
Hey.
How's it going out there?
Don't ask.
- Bad as you thought?
- Worse.
We sit in the sun waiting for the diggers to find a body.
I mean, so far they've uncovered a telephone cable and a bag of used diapers.
I mean, all this waiting around...
It's like dating a born-again Christian.
If I don't have Deb watching my every move, it'll be a lot easier to slip away to Louis' apartment.
You know, I'm getting a little stir crazy.
I wouldn't mind a day out of the lab.
Dude, oh, my God, I would be eternally grateful, but you'd have to clear it with your sister.
For some reason, she really wants me out there.
You think she secretly hates me?
I'll see what I can do.
Masuka's miserable on this whole Wayne Randall thing.
He's begging me to take over for him today.
Okay.
Great.
Great.
I'll drive.
You'll drive?
I could use some fresh air.
Let's go.
We just got a break on Mike's shooting.
What?
The last person to see Kaja alive was Viktor Baskov.
He's a Russian expat.
We couldn't find anything on him in here, but we got a hit on the Interpol database.
It turns out he's a member of the Koshka Brotherhood in the Ukraine, known for narcotics and human trafficking.
Hold on.
I have to take care of this.
Are we good?
Deb, I'll be surrounded by federal marshals.
I think I'll be okay.
It was 15 years ago.
Give me a fucking break.
Where are the bodies, Wayne?
Closer to the road.
But why'd you tell us to dig here?
Because this place looks completely different.
Look at these mini-malls.
You think I like being out here with you in the fucking heat?
All right.
Listen.
We're moving.
Strike this.
Okay.
Ha.
One more wit, he'd be a fucking half-wit.
God.
Oh, it's hot as a pig's asshole.
All this asphalt.
You know, this used to be a real pretty place.
Field, trees.
Now look at it.
Nothing stays the same.
That's the truth.
Well, at least the Frosty Swirl's still here.
You surprised a lot of people.
How's that?
Leading us to these bodies.
Why the change of heart?
Why do you care?
I'm just curious.
People say you grew a conscience.
It was always there.
It was just buried under a lot of Wayne Randall.
I just surrendered.
Surrendered?
All right.
Let's break for lunch.
We'll pick this up in an hour.
Oh, here we go.
Getting to Louis' penthouse and back in an hour will be tight, but I'm not exactly flush with options.
I can appreciate the mind-set of a collector...
But toys?
Seems like a waste of a good obsession.
My charge card numbers?
So Louis killed my credit cards.
Why is he messing with my life?
Uh, it features 29 points of articulation, five more than the last figure they put out, so at least they're listening to the collectors.
Uh, still, they could have--
Idea:
A video diary app.
One touch, device starts recording.
Tap again, and it uploads directly to--
Still waiting.
- Yeah, I'm almost done.
- Your hour's almost up.
I'm only thinking of you.
Oh God.
There'll never be an app for this.
Jesus.
This is going to be worse than Bob Henley.
He got off easy.
I want to see Dexter lying in his own piss and vomit, and I won't stop until that represents the high point of his day.
No one fucks with me.
No one.
Now, on to more important things.
4.99--
Bob Henley.
"Henley arrested after the FBI found child pornography
"on his workstation.
"Skanda Tech has announced his dismissal pending charges which could fetch up to 15 years."
Is this how Louis took control of his software company, by setting this guy up?
What's he planning for me?
With Deb on my case,
I don't know when I'll have this chance again.
Why are you fucking with me, Louis?
God, please, don't hurt me.
You better give me a good reason not to hurt you, because right now I really want to break your neck.
Why'd you send me the hand?
It was just a-- it was a stupid joke.
I just--you know, the lifelines, you know, time is short.
It was a clue.
I was screwing with you.
Why?
Uh, because...
I came to you for help with my game, and you said no.
Your game?
Uhh!
Yes, I swear that's the reason.
Gah--
This is about your game?
I spent five years on that game, and you shit all over it.
And now I'm too depressed to even look at it, okay?
It was my whole world.
I never wanna see you again.
Work.
Jamie.
Do you understand?
I'm done.
I'm totally done.
Where the fuck have you been?
Running an errand.
What errand?
Deb, I didn't kill anybody.
How the fuck do I know that?
I've been calling you and calling you.
Well, I didn't get the messages.
Well, check your fucking phone.
I need to know where you are at all times.
That is what we agreed on, right?
It won't happen again.
Finish what you need to do here, and then we'll go visit Harrison together.
Okay.
Here you are.
Seems you rode that wagon until the wheels came off.
- Trouble in paradise?
- No, she's my sister.
Also my boss.
Congratulations.
You just redefined hell.
What crawled up her ass?
It's a long story.
Randall, what'd you mean earlier when you said "surrendered"?
I just accepted my situation, you know, of being where I am.
Prison.
People watching your every move.
It is what it is.
Once I stopped fighting it, the anger just fell off...
Like a bad scab.
Left me open to try and make things right.
They still use real ice cream.
At least everything hasn't gone to hell.
We're still not getting anywhere, George.
I mean, you really must like us coming here.
There's nothing I can do about it.
Well, stop protecting Viktor Baskov.
- I told you...
- Yeah, he doesn't work here.
Just comes in for a drink now and then.
- That's all I know.
- Right.
We'll see you soon.
I might even bring a portable polygraph next time.
You know how long it would take to poly everyone in here?
Okay.
Everybody get your asses back to work.
Rough day?
Isaak.
Mr. Sirko.
What are you doing here?
I heard the police.
It would appear that I'm here for the same reason, to find Viktor.
Yeah, I swear.
I have no idea how they got his name.
I'm sure of it.
But we'll get to that.
Anyway, I thought he was in Kiev with you.
If Viktor was in Kiev, why would I be here?
Viktor never made his flight.
I checked.
I don't understand.
Where is he, then?
Viktor's caused us some problems.
I won't deny it.
Shooting a policeman is never good for business.
I can't help but wonder if someone in the brotherhood decided to make an example of him.
Without your approval?
No, no, no.
Viktor was impulsive, yes.
He did a stupid thing, yes.
But he was one of us.
And we would always protect him.
You're in luck.
Why?
I believe you.
I've had a long flight.
We have a lot to discuss.
- Hello?
- Hello, Joey?
It's Nadia from the Fox Hole.
Yeah, how many Nadias do you think I know?
- What's up?
- My car won't start.
I was wondering if maybe you could give me a ride home tonight.
Yeah, sure.
What time do you get off?
Hey, we were just having a little dinner.
Look who's here.
Hey, bud, I missed you today.
- How was school?
- We had toy share.
- Toy share?
- Mm-hmm.
Did you bring your train set?
Fire truck.
Fire truck beat out the train set?
Yes.
Oh, hey, Dex.
Just grabbing one for the road.
I know you don't like me being on this side alone, but it's all right when Jamie's here, right?
Why not?
Sweet.
This is such a great place to hang out.
Right by the bay.
- Yeah.
- I love coming over here.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I better get going.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll catch you at work, right?
He's not scared of me at all.
And he's not going to quit unless I stop him.
You're a lifesaver.
Not all cops are so nice to strippers.
To tell you the truth,
I was hoping you had something more for me.
More for you?
About the murders.
What?
You think this is just some ploy so I can get you alone and spill my guts?
Look, I told you everything that I knew.
My car really did break down.
Sorry.
If you want, I could pay you for the gas.
Stop it.
It's fine.
It's the least I can do after all I'm costing you in tips.
You'll have to do a lot more than give me a lift to make up for that.
This is it.
On the left.
What'd you have in mind as far as compensation?
I don't know.
Use your imagination.
Well, you're gonna have to give me a hint.
I'm very unimaginative.
Okay.
George says the problem with my car could be the transmission.
Mm-hmm.
It means it's going to be in the shop for at least a few days.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you could pick up the bill.
I'd really appreciate it.
You're awfully quiet tonight.
Anything you wanna talk about?
Anything I can do?
Yeah.
What?
Do you have any A.1.?
I think so.
Just enough for a good night's sleep.
That's all I need.
Success!
Thank you.
Just finishing what you started.
I promised Deb.
Hello?
Where are you?
Sorry.
I got here as fast as I could.
I almost drove off the road.
I'm so fucking tired.
What are you doing here?
I snuck out of the house while you were asleep.
Dexter, what the fuck did you do?
Nothing.
I couldn't go through with it, but I wanted to.
I needed to.
I didn't care about anything else.
I lost control.
All I could see was blood.
All I could feel was the pressure... in my head.
Fuck.
It is too deep inside me.
Harry was right.
I am a monster.
You should arrest me.
You should take me in.
Get me off the street.
Dex, dad was wrong.
The fact that we're here tonight proves that you are in control.
- But I wasn't.
- But you stopped.
That's what's important.
It must've been so hard for you to call me, but you did, and that's a huge step.
It makes me think maybe you can control this.
You really believe that?
I didn't, but maybe now I do.
What happened tonight is a good thing.
It was really, really good.
I'm not gonna give up, and I'm not gonna let you give up.
Are you okay to drive?
No, I'm gonna stay with you.
I just need to be alone for a couple of minutes.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Okay.
You'll wake up with a headache, probably have a decent idea how you got here.
Maybe that's a good thing.
I still have to get you out of my life.
But not by taking yours.
What the fuck?
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm your employer-- or rather, former employer.
I believe you recently gave notice.
Bullshit.
I work for George.
- Well, worked.
- And he works for me.
My name is Isaak.
I'm the owner of the Fox Hole chain of gentlemen's clubs, amongst other enterprises.
What do you want?
Well, it would appear that George neglected to do your exit interview.
It's company policy, and I'm a stickler when it comes to rules.
You got-- you got to be kidding, right?
Keeping good employees is essential to running a successful business.
Your feedback is important.
Would you mind telling me why you quit?
Well, I trust it wasn't the hostile working environment.
No, I, um...
I just felt it was time to move on.
So it was nothing to do with the tragic death of one of our dancers?
Kaja, I believe her name was.
Because if it did, I would completely understand.
It must have been quite a traumatic loss for you.
What do you mean?
Maybe that's why you talked to the police.
No way.
I had you followed.
You know what?
I didn't say a word.
I swear.
I lied.
I didn't have you followed.
You were just the most likely candidate.
- You loved her, didn't you?
- What?
Kaja.
You were in love with her.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's the one thing that gives meaning in this life.
I would have done the same thing if I was in your position.
It's terrible to lose someone you love.
You still thinking about last night?
Actually, I'm thinking about how much I could go for a Frosty Swirl.
That's good.
A sudden craving for sugar is good?
Well, if you're thinking about normal things, then maybe you're becoming more normal.
I'm never going to be normal, Deb.
Yeah.
None of us really are.
Where are you going?
I want a Frosty Swirl.
I'll bring you one.
She'll always be watching me.
But maybe that's okay.
If Wayne Randall can make peace with his sentence, who am I to complain?
Especially considering the alternative.
Well, well.
Looks like you two are ready to eat each other's shit.
Oh, yeah.
We kind of patched things up.
I'm happy for you.
I never got to do that with Hannah.
Robin to my Batman.
I was never as alive as I was when I was with her.
Every day was like
Christmas day-- unwrapped present.
I wish I had a chance to tell her how I felt.
You can still tell her.
Yeah.
I'm afraid the clock has run out.
Damn, I sure as fuck... gonna miss that.
Hannah used to think I was something special.
Now she sees me as just a killer.
And you know what?
She's not wrong.
There's just one last person I need to kill.
He never cared if anyone found the bodies.
He just wanted a couple of days of sunshine and Frosty Swirl.
Randall didn't change, and he couldn't take life in prison.
Can I?
Previously, on Dexter...
- Where's your lug wrench at?
- No--
We are investigating the homicide of a Miami Metro police officer.
Viktor left on an evening flight.
He arrives in Kiev at 5:25 P.M., your time.
What about the dead police officer?
- I'll make it go away.
- Good.
Hello, Viktor.
Is there anything I can do to keep you from killing me?
No.
In my game, you can be the serial killer.
I think this is offensive.
Who would choose to be a serial killer?
It's a bad idea.
Do something else.
Only one person who ever worked at Miami Metro ever took blood slides.
Sergeant Doakes, the Bay Harbor Butcher.
What happened was too strong.
It got into you too early.
You mustn't ever tell Debra the truth about yourself.
If you think she's upset now, that's nothing compared to how she'd feel if she learned what you are.
Dexter, what the fuck?
You said Travis came at you with a sword.
Where did you get the knives?
There was, like, a whole roll of them.
I'm just trying to put this together.
Are you a serial killer?
Yes.
I've dreaded this moment my whole life... but I never pictured it like this.
Don't you fucking touch me.
I just want to know you're okay.
I am not okay.
I am never gonna fucking be okay.
- Just try to take it easy.
- Ohh...
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.
How long have you been doing this?
How long have you been fucking doing this?
Since I was 20.
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.
Those blood slides that I found in your apartment, they look like the ones we found in Doakes' car.
Deb...
Are you the Bay Harbor Butcher?
This is not the place to talk about this.
Deb...
I only kill certain kinds of people...
- Oh, God.
- Like Travis.
Deb, dad taught me.
He gave me a code.
Dad knew?
It was his idea.
He knew everything.
- Oh, fuck.
- Deb.
Please, just... just come back inside with me.
Please.
Harry found me sitting in a pool of my mother's blood.
He understood why I had these... urges.
A lot of horrible things happen to a lot of people, and they don't turn out like you.
I don't know about other people.
But I have this... need deep inside me.
I call it my Dark Passenger.
You gave it a name?
Harry said it got in me too early and too deep.
He said I couldn't change it.
And so...
he thought up the code.
He said if I had to kill,
I might as well kill people who deserved it.
You make it sound like it's okay-- like you're the victim here.
The people in that box, Dexter-- they're the victims.
Victims?
A choir director who raped and murdered little boys?
A married couple smuggling refugees who killed the ones who couldn't pay?
A psychiatrist who manipulated women into taking their own lives?
There's this place called the police department.
Sometimes the system doesn't work.
Killers fall through the cracks.
Don't I fucking know it?
I'm talking to one right now.
I am the worst fucking detective in the world.
You're my own brother.
How could I not see what you were doing?
You're not responsible for this.
Well, I am now.
I helped you cover up Travis' murder.
I'm an accomplice.
You walked in on me.
I had to think on my feet.
Well, fuck me for ruining your night.
What am I supposed to do here?
My name has the word "Lieutenant" in front of it.
I can't turn my back on this.
All of this is very, very fucking wrong.
So...
What are you gonna do?
Uhh!
I never wanted her to go through this, Dex.
Neither did I.
Then you should have been more careful.
At least she didn't arrest me.
Not yet.
What is this doing here?
Is it some kind of message?
Maybe someone else is on to me.
"According to FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy,
"it's almost certain that the Butcher is still at work.
"Serial killers have an addiction and will continue to kill until they're caught."
If the ITK hand in my apartment is genuine, then it can't still be in evidence.
Not here.
Then I was sent the real thing.
No record of it being checked out.
Could it have been stolen?
Sorry.
Sorry.
Saw you come in here.
I just got curious.
- Now I wish I hadn't.
- Why?
You're looking for the hand, aren't you?
Look, I can explain.
Look, remember my former intern Ryan?
Blonde, stacked, and the cause of many sleepless nights?
Yeah.
Well, she needed some extra dough, so she stole the hand and auctioned it online.
That's why I fired her.
Who won the auction?
Don't know.
I put Louis on the case to find out.
Louis?
Now, even with all his digital skills, he couldn't dig up a name.
At least he was able to erase the electronic trail.
Did Louis find the hand and keep it?
No one needs to know, right?
But why send the work of a serial killer to me?
Does Louis know what I am?
Dex?
What?
We're cool, right?
Yeah.
No one needs to know.
Oh, thank God.
I was ready to blow you.
Not necessary.
Briefing.
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.
I have to find out what Louis knows about me.
Some time alone with him, and he'd open up-- one way or another.
But I need to put out fires, not start new ones.
Remember him?
It's been three days since Mike was gunned down, and the son of a bitch that pulled the trigger is still walking the streets.
Where are we?
We're continuing to hit the club where Miss Soroka was employed.
Someone there must've seen something related to her death.
We still think it's our best shot at a lead, so we're going to shut them down every night.
You know, those places do big business during lunch too.
Just saying.
Start shutting them down twice a day.
- With pleasure.
- Moving on.
This pretty face belongs to Wayne Randall.
15 years ago, Randall and his teenage girlfriend went on a three-state killing spree that ended here in Miami.
He's currently serving two consecutive life terms at Dade.
Randall now claims to have evidence on three other murders that he committed in the Miami area, and he wants to come clean.
He wants to lead investigators to where he buried the bodies.
Hmm.
That's nice of him.
He says he wants to clear his conscience.
I think his lawyers are just trying to swing a deal.
- What's he telling us?
- He told us about one victim, a brunette in her mid-20s that matches a missing persons report from that time, a Janice Dubois.
So then there's a chance he's not completely full of shit.
County has requested one detective and one lab tech to help them process the scene.
Miller, you're volunteer number one.
- I'll go.
- No.
I want Masuka on this.
Aw.
I don't to work a dumpsite.
Come on lieutenant, I'm up to my ears on Mike's case.
I'm sorry.
You're with Miller.
Contact info will be in your boxes.
You'll start tomorrow.
That's it.
Thank you.
Can I talk to you outside for a second?
I was this close to arresting you this morning.
I even thought about what I would say to the press.
I wouldn't want to have to write that speech.
I don't know what to do.
Every alternative I can think of... is fucking crazy.
Such as?
It's fucked up.
Try me.
The say people like you are addicts.
Like drugs.
It's not untrue.
Well, when addicts want to get better, they go to rehab.
I don't think there are clinics for what I've got.
We can make one.
I could be your clinic.
- How?
- You move in with me.
I watch you 24/7 and make sure that there's no way in hell you can... do what you do.
And...
If it is an addiction, then maybe-- maybe you can get over it.
You're right.
It's crazy.
Dexter, if you can channel your urges, why can't you control them?
What if dad had taught you how to quit instead of teaching you how to live with it?
He fucked up.
Deb, there's a big problem with this idea.
What?
I've tried stopping before.
It didn't work.
Well, now you have me.
Someone who loves you more than you will ever fucking know.
And in spite all of this,
I still believe that there is good in you.
Maybe more that's in most people.
What if it doesn't work?
I don't want to think about that.
And how much choice do I have here?
None.
Okay.
Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.
I'm curious.
Your facilities are state-of-the-art.
Why go through a private lab?
Just trying to lighten the load.
It's been a hectic few months.
But just to confirm, the blood you sampled from the glass fragment is a positive match with Travis Marshall's?
No question about it.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Remember, keep this confidential.
And when you send back the findings, address them to me personally, okay?
- No problem.
- Great.
Thanks.
Yes, captain?
Regional FBI office, please.
We are back.
Hey.
I won't allow this to go on.
This is harassment.
No, this is an inconvenience.
We're working our way up to harassment.
I told you the last time you were here,
I don't know who killed Kaja.
I don't know who shot your policeman.
Kaja was clubbed to death in the parking lot 15 yards from where we are now.
- No one here saw anything.
- Sell that shit somewhere else.
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna keep coming here every day and shut me down?
No, I'm coming back tonight too.
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want the shooter.
Now, you better rack your brain and give me something, or I'm gonna turn this place into a fucking monastery.
Mm-hmm.
You got that list?
Follow me.
You know, the money we make here is all we have to live on.
What you're doing is really unfair.
What's your name?
Nadia.
Come here.
Have a drink.
We're not supposed to drink while we're working.
Come on.
You hear any music playing?
Now, what you said isn't true.
I do care who killed Kaja, but no one around here seems interested in helping me find out who it is.
Okay?
Do you know anybody who might be interested in hurting your friend?
You've been told not to cooperate with us?
Kaja was dating someone.
Tony Rush.
He's one of the bouncers here.
They were on and off, but Tony is a good guy.
Can you point Tony out to me?
He's not here today.
Mm-hmm.
I really hope you catch the person who did this and put a bullet through his head.
That's not generally how we work, but I get where you're coming from.
Here, if you can think of anything to help, just give me a call.
I will...
Detective Quinn.
Joey.
Excuse me.
Joey.
- Tell me you got the shooter.
- Possibly.
One of the bouncers hasn't come to work
- since the night of the murders.
- Tony Rush.
- How'd you know?
- He and Kaja were an item.
Suspicious timing, don't you think?
- The sudden absence?
- Mm-hmm.
Come on.
Hey.
You're gonna sleep in the bedroom.
I'm not gonna put you out.
Yes, you are.
I'm sleeping out here.
Deb, that's ridiculous.
This isn't a fucking pajama party, Dex, okay?
You're gonna take my bedroom, and I'm gonna sleep out here on the couch.
Between me and the front door?
I will be by the door.
You've really thought this through.
Yeah, well, I found this website--
"How to cure a serial killer in ten easy steps,"
and this is the first step.
You'll have to print me out a copy.
I'm figuring this out as I go along, Dexter.
But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it all the way.
We're gonna eat together, we're gonna watch TV together, we're gonna drive to fucking work together.
Hope you got a big shower.
Why don't you go unpack.
I'll heat us up something to eat.
You have to be completely honest with me.
That is the first rule.
My new code.
Don't you think Deb has gone through enough without you lying to her again?
I'm not lying.
You're a killer, Dex.
Deb didn't raise you.
I did.
She never saw what you were really like.
I did.
I was right to channel your urges instead of trying to suppress them.
You think I can just walk out of here and call the whole thing off?
If it were this simple, watching you for 24 hours a day, don't you think I would have tried it?
Maybe you should've.
How does it feel... this need to kill?
What do you call it?
My Dark Passenger.
You make it sound like you're possessed or something.
That's how it feels sometimes.
Do you know how many assholes in prison blame their actions on someone or something else?
I'm not copping a plea, Deb.
I'm giving you honesty.
It's rule number one, right?
How's the spaghetti?
Overcooked.
First rule.
So how does it feel?
It starts with blood.
Blood?
Yeah, the image of it.
Trickling down the back of my eyelids.
The trickle becomes a stream and then a flood.
It fills me up... all my empty spaces.
But then the blood isn't red anymore.
What is it?
It's black.
And pressing.
It feels like my head is gonna explode.
The only way to relieve the pressure is to open the floodgates and let it spill out.
I can't believe you're like this.
You're a sick fuck, Dexter.
Jesus Christ.
Well, maybe we shouldn't talk about it.
Yeah, maybe not while I'm serving fucking tomato sauce.
Are you seeing blood now?
Nope, just spaghetti.
Well, if you start seeing red, will you fucking call me?
And say what?
"Deb, I'm seeing blood"?
Say, "I really feel... like wrapping someone up in plastic and stabbing them."
And I can say, "No, Dexter, don't."
Second rule.
There have to be families out there that are more fucked up than us.
But I sure as hell wouldn't wanna meet them.
What the fuck am I doing here?
What you think's right.
Right would be turning you in.
I'm doing this because you're my brother, and I can't stand the idea of you living the rest of your life in prison.
Or worse.
I told Deb I'd be honest with her, but it's not like I'm stalking a kill.
I just need to get into Louis' penthouse and find out what he knows about me.
Are you okay?
It's late.
Yeah.
I'm just doing some work.
I'll sit with you.
Deb, I'm fine.
No.
You shouldn't be alone right now.
I mean, awake and alone.
Yeah.
Maybe I should try to get some sleep.
Just know that I'm here for you.
How could I forget?
Now that Deb is my Siamese twin, getting into Louis' penthouse is going to be next to impossible.
But how long can I wait?
You know, for the tenth time,
I barely saw Kaja that night.
I was working.
She got off at 2:00 A.M., and I don't know what she did after that.
Whatever you decide to get into after this, forget writing, 'cause you could not make up a story to save your fucking life.
Security tapes back him up.
Shit.
Are you sure?
No doubt.
He was at the club all night working.
Well, it looks like some of what you said wasn't bullshit.
You were working when Kaja was killed.
We still don't like the fact that you vanished the day after she died.
Smells like guilt to me.
You could have had someone else do it for you.
- No way.
- What happened?
She start sleeping around on you?
- Kaja was loyal.
- Loyal, huh?
Mm-hmm.
So she was doing you.
At least we're getting somewhere.
The problem is now we know you've been lying to us about you and Kaja.
And that's bad form, Tony.
We tend to get cranky when people bullshit us.
Now, if you think what we're doing to the club is bad, wait till we start on you.
She was with Viktor.
Say again?
The night that Kaja died.
She left the club with Viktor.
Fucking sleazebag.
Who the fuck is Viktor?
Hey.
How's it going out there?
Don't ask.
- Bad as you thought?
- Worse.
We sit in the sun waiting for the diggers to find a body.
I mean, so far they've uncovered a telephone cable and a bag of used diapers.
I mean, all this waiting around...
It's like dating a born-again Christian.
If I don't have Deb watching my every move, it'll be a lot easier to slip away to Louis' apartment.
You know, I'm getting a little stir crazy.
I wouldn't mind a day out of the lab.
Dude, oh, my God, I would be eternally grateful, but you'd have to clear it with your sister.
For some reason, she really wants me out there.
You think she secretly hates me?
I'll see what I can do.
Masuka's miserable on this whole Wayne Randall thing.
He's begging me to take over for him today.
Okay.
Great.
Great.
I'll drive.
You'll drive?
I could use some fresh air.
Let's go.
We just got a break on Mike's shooting.
What?
The last person to see Kaja alive was Viktor Baskov.
He's a Russian expat.
We couldn't find anything on him in here, but we got a hit on the Interpol database.
It turns out he's a member of the Koshka Brotherhood in the Ukraine, known for narcotics and human trafficking.
Hold on.
I have to take care of this.
Are we good?
Deb, I'll be surrounded by federal marshals.
I think I'll be okay.
It was 15 years ago.
Give me a fucking break.
Where are the bodies, Wayne?
Closer to the road.
But why'd you tell us to dig here?
Because this place looks completely different.
Look at these mini-malls.
You think I like being out here with you in the fucking heat?
All right.
Listen.
We're moving.
Strike this.
Okay.
Ha.
One more wit, he'd be a fucking half-wit.
God.
Oh, it's hot as a pig's asshole.
All this asphalt.
You know, this used to be a real pretty place.
Field, trees.
Now look at it.
Nothing stays the same.
That's the truth.
Well, at least the Frosty Swirl's still here.
You surprised a lot of people.
How's that?
Leading us to these bodies.
Why the change of heart?
Why do you care?
I'm just curious.
People say you grew a conscience.
It was always there.
It was just buried under a lot of Wayne Randall.
I just surrendered.
Surrendered?
All right.
Let's break for lunch.
We'll pick this up in an hour.
Oh, here we go.
Getting to Louis' penthouse and back in an hour will be tight, but I'm not exactly flush with options.
I can appreciate the mind-set of a collector...
But toys?
Seems like a waste of a good obsession.
My charge card numbers?
So Louis killed my credit cards.
Why is he messing with my life?
Uh, it features 29 points of articulation, five more than the last figure they put out, so at least they're listening to the collectors.
Uh, still, they could have--
Idea:
A video diary app.
One touch, device starts recording.
Tap again, and it uploads directly to--
Still waiting.
- Yeah, I'm almost done.
- Your hour's almost up.
I'm only thinking of you.
Oh God.
There'll never be an app for this.
Jesus.
This is going to be worse than Bob Henley.
He got off easy.
I want to see Dexter lying in his own piss and vomit, and I won't stop until that represents the high point of his day.
No one fucks with me.
No one.
Now, on to more important things.
4.99--
Bob Henley.
"Henley arrested after the FBI found child pornography
"on his workstation.
"Skanda Tech has announced his dismissal pending charges which could fetch up to 15 years."
Is this how Louis took control of his software company, by setting this guy up?
What's he planning for me?
With Deb on my case,
I don't know when I'll have this chance again.
Why are you fucking with me, Louis?
God, please, don't hurt me.
You better give me a good reason not to hurt you, because right now I really want to break your neck.
Why'd you send me the hand?
It was just a-- it was a stupid joke.
I just--you know, the lifelines, you know, time is short.
It was a clue.
I was screwing with you.
Why?
Uh, because...
I came to you for help with my game, and you said no.
Your game?
Uhh!
Yes, I swear that's the reason.
Gah--
This is about your game?
I spent five years on that game, and you shit all over it.
And now I'm too depressed to even look at it, okay?
It was my whole world.
I never wanna see you again.
Work.
Jamie.
Do you understand?
I'm done.
I'm totally done.
Where the fuck have you been?
Running an errand.
What errand?
Deb, I didn't kill anybody.
How the fuck do I know that?
I've been calling you and calling you.
Well, I didn't get the messages.
Well, check your fucking phone.
I need to know where you are at all times.
That is what we agreed on, right?
It won't happen again.
Finish what you need to do here, and then we'll go visit Harrison together.
Okay.
Here you are.
Seems you rode that wagon until the wheels came off.
- Trouble in paradise?
- No, she's my sister.
Also my boss.
Congratulations.
You just redefined hell.
What crawled up her ass?
It's a long story.
Randall, what'd you mean earlier when you said "surrendered"?
I just accepted my situation, you know, of being where I am.
Prison.
People watching your every move.
It is what it is.
Once I stopped fighting it, the anger just fell off...
Like a bad scab.
Left me open to try and make things right.
They still use real ice cream.
At least everything hasn't gone to hell.
We're still not getting anywhere, George.
I mean, you really must like us coming here.
There's nothing I can do about it.
Well, stop protecting Viktor Baskov.
- I told you...
- Yeah, he doesn't work here.
Just comes in for a drink now and then.
- That's all I know.
- Right.
We'll see you soon.
I might even bring a portable polygraph next time.
You know how long it would take to poly everyone in here?
Okay.
Everybody get your asses back to work.
Rough day?
Isaak.
Mr. Sirko.
What are you doing here?
I heard the police.
It would appear that I'm here for the same reason, to find Viktor.
Yeah, I swear.
I have no idea how they got his name.
I'm sure of it.
But we'll get to that.
Anyway, I thought he was in Kiev with you.
If Viktor was in Kiev, why would I be here?
Viktor never made his flight.
I checked.
I don't understand.
Where is he, then?
Viktor's caused us some problems.
I won't deny it.
Shooting a policeman is never good for business.
I can't help but wonder if someone in the brotherhood decided to make an example of him.
Without your approval?
No, no, no.
Viktor was impulsive, yes.
He did a stupid thing, yes.
But he was one of us.
And we would always protect him.
You're in luck.
Why?
I believe you.
I've had a long flight.
We have a lot to discuss.
- Hello?
- Hello, Joey?
It's Nadia from the Fox Hole.
Yeah, how many Nadias do you think I know?
- What's up?
- My car won't start.
I was wondering if maybe you could give me a ride home tonight.
Yeah, sure.
What time do you get off?
Hey, we were just having a little dinner.
Look who's here.
Hey, bud, I missed you today.
- How was school?
- We had toy share.
- Toy share?
- Mm-hmm.
Did you bring your train set?
Fire truck.
Fire truck beat out the train set?
Yes.
Oh, hey, Dex.
Just grabbing one for the road.
I know you don't like me being on this side alone, but it's all right when Jamie's here, right?
Why not?
Sweet.
This is such a great place to hang out.
Right by the bay.
- Yeah.
- I love coming over here.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I better get going.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll catch you at work, right?
He's not scared of me at all.
And he's not going to quit unless I stop him.
You're a lifesaver.
Not all cops are so nice to strippers.
To tell you the truth,
I was hoping you had something more for me.
More for you?
About the murders.
What?
You think this is just some ploy so I can get you alone and spill my guts?
Look, I told you everything that I knew.
My car really did break down.
Sorry.
If you want, I could pay you for the gas.
Stop it.
It's fine.
It's the least I can do after all I'm costing you in tips.
You'll have to do a lot more than give me a lift to make up for that.
This is it.
On the left.
What'd you have in mind as far as compensation?
I don't know.
Use your imagination.
Well, you're gonna have to give me a hint.
I'm very unimaginative.
Okay.
George says the problem with my car could be the transmission.
Mm-hmm.
It means it's going to be in the shop for at least a few days.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you could pick up the bill.
I'd really appreciate it.
You're awfully quiet tonight.
Anything you wanna talk about?
Anything I can do?
Yeah.
What?
Do you have any A.1.?
I think so.
Just enough for a good night's sleep.
That's all I need.
Success!
Thank you.
Just finishing what you started.
I promised Deb.
Hello?
Where are you?
Sorry.
I got here as fast as I could.
I almost drove off the road.
I'm so fucking tired.
What are you doing here?
I snuck out of the house while you were asleep.
Dexter, what the fuck did you do?
Nothing.
I couldn't go through with it, but I wanted to.
I needed to.
I didn't care about anything else.
I lost control.
All I could see was blood.
All I could feel was the pressure... in my head.
Fuck.
It is too deep inside me.
Harry was right.
I am a monster.
You should arrest me.
You should take me in.
Get me off the street.
Dex, dad was wrong.
The fact that we're here tonight proves that you are in control.
- But I wasn't.
- But you stopped.
That's what's important.
It must've been so hard for you to call me, but you did, and that's a huge step.
It makes me think maybe you can control this.
You really believe that?
I didn't, but maybe now I do.
What happened tonight is a good thing.
It was really, really good.
I'm not gonna give up, and I'm not gonna let you give up.
Are you okay to drive?
No, I'm gonna stay with you.
I just need to be alone for a couple of minutes.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Okay.
You'll wake up with a headache, probably have a decent idea how you got here.
Maybe that's a good thing.
I still have to get you out of my life.
But not by taking yours.
What the fuck?
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm your employer-- or rather, former employer.
I believe you recently gave notice.
Bullshit.
I work for George.
- Well, worked.
- And he works for me.
My name is Isaak.
I'm the owner of the Fox Hole chain of gentlemen's clubs, amongst other enterprises.
What do you want?
Well, it would appear that George neglected to do your exit interview.
It's company policy, and I'm a stickler when it comes to rules.
You got-- you got to be kidding, right?
Keeping good employees is essential to running a successful business.
Your feedback is important.
Would you mind telling me why you quit?
Well, I trust it wasn't the hostile working environment.
No, I, um...
I just felt it was time to move on.
So it was nothing to do with the tragic death of one of our dancers?
Kaja, I believe her name was.
Because if it did, I would completely understand.
It must have been quite a traumatic loss for you.
What do you mean?
Maybe that's why you talked to the police.
No way.
I had you followed.
You know what?
I didn't say a word.
I swear.
I lied.
I didn't have you followed.
You were just the most likely candidate.
- You loved her, didn't you?
- What?
Kaja.
You were in love with her.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's the one thing that gives meaning in this life.
I would have done the same thing if I was in your position.
It's terrible to lose someone you love.
You still thinking about last night?
Actually, I'm thinking about how much I could go for a Frosty Swirl.
That's good.
A sudden craving for sugar is good?
Well, if you're thinking about normal things, then maybe you're becoming more normal.
I'm never going to be normal, Deb.
Yeah.
None of us really are.
Where are you going?
I want a Frosty Swirl.
I'll bring you one.
She'll always be watching me.
But maybe that's okay.
If Wayne Randall can make peace with his sentence, who am I to complain?
Especially considering the alternative.
Well, well.
Looks like you two are ready to eat each other's shit.
Oh, yeah.
We kind of patched things up.
I'm happy for you.
I never got to do that with Hannah.
Robin to my Batman.
I was never as alive as I was when I was with her.
Every day was like
Christmas day-- unwrapped present.
I wish I had a chance to tell her how I felt.
You can still tell her.
Yeah.
I'm afraid the clock has run out.
Damn, I sure as fuck... gonna miss that.
Hannah used to think I was something special.
Now she sees me as just a killer.
And you know what?
She's not wrong.
There's just one last person I need to kill.
He never cared if anyone found the bodies.
He just wanted a couple of days of sunshine and Frosty Swirl.
Randall didn't change, and he couldn't take life in prison.
Can I?
Wake up.
Hello?
Is this Geoff?
Yeah.
This is Samuel here, we were expecting you this morning?
Oh, Samuel...
I completely passed out.
Okay, we'll see you soon.
Hi, Geoff Burton for Samuel Mead, please.
Injecting room here, got your stereomicroscope.
Quarantine room for incoming animals.
Microscope room with confocal imaging station, all the usual stuff.
Spinning disk confocal, twophoton confocal, upright confocals with dipping lenses, all the laser lines you could wish for.
Anything to make science beautiful.
We've got a cold room, we've got a microbial culture room;
the autoclaves are downstairs.
There's a...
How's your accommodation, Geoffrey?
Oh, fine, fine.
I was just wondering where my office is going to be?
Oh, we don't really do 'offices' per Se.
We're more communal than that.
Of course, we can loan you a lab for the length of a given project.
Right...
Look who I found.
- Doctor Burton.
- Doctor Fiedler.
Rebekka's come a long way since she was interned with you.
Yes, so I hear.
I'm sorry I can't leave this right now.
- We'll catch up later.
- Great.
- Shall we continue?
- Yes.
That way.
Now, there's something else we need to do...
Sorry, I didn't...
Anyway, let's get your security pass sorted out.
Son of a bitch...
Geoff...
How are you?
I'm fine, you?
I'm good.
I'm setting up the new research lab.
The one in Munich right?
No, Dresden... remember?
So, you must be happy?
What's that supposed to mean?
- It's nothing, forget about it...
- Hey babe!
I'm home.
Hold on for a second.
So... what's up?
I heard about your news.
When were you planning to tell me?
I was going to tell you, I really was.
Fm in my second month,
I wasn't quite sure and I didn't tell anyone else.
Well, Joe and Karla knew.
Oh, no.
That was Ben.
Right.
Ben.
He was excited about the baby so he just told them.
You know...
You're angry?
No.
Of course.
No.
I'm not angry...
I'm just, I don't know.
I gotta think about it.
Think about what?
Well, what do you want me to say?
Congratulations?
I dunno.
Maybe you can be happy for me.
What do you want?
Why did you call me?
I don't know why I called.
I miss you.
I have to go.
Geoffrey Burton comes to us from U-Mass, where his research into early detection of embryonic abnormalities has certainly proved one of the more, ah, fiercely-debated topics in the scientific community this decade.
Now, I don't need to tell you what the implications of this are.
The proverbial 'cure for cancer' has always eluded us.
But the potential of pre-natal discovery certainly brings the possibility a few steps closer.
And Geoffrey has now come here to continue his research in a rather less politicized environment, and he's going to speak to us this morning about the state of his work to date.
When you're ready...
Thank you.
Will you now all please join me in welcoming Geoffrey Burton.
Thank you, thank you, Samuel...
I never intended to become a geneticist.
My PhD. was actually on bacterial biochemistry.
But, as I'm sure many of you know, I was drawn to this by my experience with my own son, whose condition led me to focus my research on screening embryos for traces of rare genetic mutations
such as his.
I want to make one thing very clear:
this is not eugenics.
I'm not trying to develop new techniques to pre-screen people with brown eyes, or dark skin, or freckles.
I like freckles.
Diversity - one of the things which defines us as a species is to be celebrated.
Mutations which endanger human life are not.
For example - here we see the subject in the earliest stages.
The disease is non-contagious in the traditional sense, yet at the same time, unusually virulent.
I've allowed myself the conceit of calling it Burton's Syndrome.
What made this syndrome noteworthy was its sudden appearance in what appeared to be a perfectly healthy subject.
Within a matter of days, the symptoms had manifested as a number of neoplasms, exponentially multiplying and growing in size.
These, ah, tumor-like appendages eventually covered the entire body, as we can see.
Respiration became increasingly difficult.
They began to affect the internal organs - crushing the heart, constricting the lungs...
Brain activity ceased shortly thereafter.
From first symptoms to death, the entire process took little over a week.
What made this unique was that this was not an acquired disease - like a virus, but a seemingly random genetic mutation occurring in gene RIPS on chromosome twenty.
All right.
Let's take a closer look at some tissue samples...
May I sit here?
People don't want to know the way things happen.
This fish, for example - no one wants to think of it suffocating in agony.
We just want to fry it, eat it, forget.
Same with science.
People want the cure, but not the research.
It makes them uncomfortable, knowing how you got there.
What you had to do, to what.
It's true.
I would like to live a million years just to see what we evolve into.
Do we become telepathic?
Do we get wings?
I would like wings.
And you?
What would you like?
I don't know.
I'd like to be a time traveler, you know, travel through time backwards and forwards...
Chiba!
Are those incubations done yet?
Hello, I'm Jarek Novak.
Geoffrey Burton.
We actually met yesterday.
I almost liberated your mouse.
- I didn't know it was you.
- It's me.
Your lecture, I really liked it.
Great images.
Thank you.
I guess.
I was thinking maybe you'd like to look at some things I've been working on?
In kind of a similar vein, you know?
Yeah.
Why not.
- Good.
We should have a drink.
- Sure.
What about tonight?
Will you excuse me a minute?
Excuse me.
Sorry.
- No thank you.
I quit.
- You quit?
Yeah.
I guess it has been a while since I've seen you last.
Yeah, that was your choice.
I'm sorry.
You know, I...
I don't want it to be awkward.
I don't either.
You know, I have been watching you, though.
I've been watching your rise.
Read all your papers.
Very impressive.
You're the one who got Samuel to approach me, right?
You know, I...
I felt like I'd hit a wall with my research.
And, you know, I heard what you were dealing with in America, so I thought perhaps you'd like to come over.
I don't know, to be honest, I didn't expect you to say yes.
What have I said yes to?
I can show you.
- Let's go back.
- Good, cos my ass is cold.
Have a seat.
Okay, so.
Now here...
This is a typical regeneration cycle.
About ten weeks from amputation to full regeneration.
Yes?
Yes.
Okay, so now watch this one.
Did you see?
Ah, missed it.
I'll play it again.
Watch closely.
You're kidding, right?
That's not possible.
When I inserted the Easter Gene, I found it accelerated the natural regeneration capacity of the axolotls, way beyond anything I could have imagined.
But since then, I've refined the genetic code further.
Wait a minute, what 'Easter Gene'?
What are you talking about?
Look...
I labeled only the transplanted Easter Gene cells with the GFP.
They were localized in the wound area, but then they completely took over.
Look for yourself.
That's ah...
I've even had success regenerating severely damaged brain and spinal tissue.
I mean, can you imagine the possibilities for this in humans?
- Jesus Christ...
- Exactly!
Easter.
Why haven't you published this?
I dunno.
A discovery's not a cure.
Even so, I mean...
- It won't even uptake in mice.
- What happens when you try?
Nothing.
I've been stuck for six months now.
And then I thought:
if anyone could help me with the molecular mechanism, to help me activate it in mammals...
You know, I'm sorry, I've got an appointment with Samuel right now.
But what do you think about, you know, discussing this later over dinner, at my place?
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing.
I can cook something for you.
German.
- I like German.
- Don't worry. it's not a date.
Looks like we're having a drink tonight after all, just not together.
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I'm not going back to the guesthouse, so...
It's cold, come on!
Alright.
You want to try an electrical cigarette?
Ah, no.
I've got my own.
Real cigarette.
Ah, I'm sorry, but it's a non smoking car.
Of course.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Where we going?
Oh, yeah, right.
Sorry ah...
- Pfotenhau...
Pfoten...
- Can I see it?
Ah, PfotenhauerstraBe.
Yes, I know it.
Good.
That's where we're going.
- I know you, also.
Very well.
- Yeah.
You do?
Yes.
Your science.
We're the same, both of us.
And how do you figure?
You know.
Taking risks.
Whatever it takes for a new brave world.
New Brave World?
Yeah, I haven't read that one...
I have ideas, even if say it myself, brilliant experiments.
You could be part of them.
Well, that's a very kind offer.
But, ah, my work's kind of a full-time thing right now.
Why did we stop?
You know Mosquitos.
Bed-bugs.
Fleas.
Ticks...
They're all vectors for disease, yes?
But instead of spreading sickness, why not change the formula?
Make them carry genetically modified viruses.
Antigens to their own plague.
Imagine releasing these in the third world.
In Africa...
They're going to be bitten anyway.
So why not let them catch malaria vaccine instead?
But then first you'd have to invent the malaria vaccine, right?
- You don't think it's possible?
- I didn't say that.
- You know Stalin?
Mao Tse-tung?
- Only by reputation.
Both of them believed you could transfer ideology by breeding one indoctrinated generation to the next.
And eventually you get genetically-programmed Communists.
I mean, I know this sounds maybe a little bit crazy.
But there were some really good ideas in there.
But look, um, what good ideas are we talking about really?
- You're not getting my point.
- What is your point?
There is the idea, and there's making people believe in the idea, and that is the key to scientific freedom.
And financing.
Exactly, and you need that freedom to be able to get the good ideas because they can come from unexpected places.
Like your son for example.
You know, I'm gonna walk from here.
Say hello to Rebekka from me!
So why didn't you call me?
I could have picked you up.
I got a lift, well, sort of a half a lift from that Jarek guy at the Institute.
What's up with that guy?
I don't have much to do with him.
Don't you get enough of these at work?
I find them beautiful.
You know, they're such strange, resourceful organisms;
there's nothing quite like them on earth...
You don't agree?
I kinda always saw them as redundant.
You know, genetic dead-ends.
But then again after what I saw today, who knows.
What about this?
They're called Wunderkammer.
What?
-
- Wunderkammer.
Wunderkammer...
They were used in the old days to display things that hadn't been classified yet.
Now I'm creating new wonders.
So you're an artist now and a scientist?
Come on, let's eat something.
- Alright, go on.
- You're not in training, so...
Tell me.
- What?
- Tell me!
- What?
What do you think?
Tell you what?
About this Easter Gene of yours.
Why do you think I'm here?
Okay, I'll tell you everything on one condition.
- Okay.
You have to agree to work with me.
Yeah, okay, sure.
To fruitful collaborations.
Okay, that's good.
Because I need your brain.
Just my brain...
Alright, that was a little much.
You had a big impact on me, you know?
Did I?
You were this unreachable, kind of... star scientist.
Whatever.
Intelligent and inspiring and intimidating of course too sometimes.
I mean even now, what you're doing is brave I suppose.
Why is that?
- Forget about it...
- No, no, no!
Think I'm a little drunk.
You tell me.
Just...
Using your son like that.
In the lecture...
I can't imagine what that must be like.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- I didn't mean to say that.
- Yeah, you did.
Come on Geoff, I'm not criticizing you.
You know, I haven't published anything significant in four years.
'Publish or perish', remember, isn't that what we used to say?
They were forcing me out of U-Mass.
But you knew that, right?
They were cutting my funding until my lab was unworkable... waiting for me to quit.
They couldn't fire me, that would make them look bad.
You know, my boy, he was the only case.
And it killed him.
I'm just trying to find something positive out of all this.
You know, if I don't, then what's the point?
But you've made progress.
I think I should go.
You know, I'm still a little tired, jetlagged.
- Geoff...
Dinner was nice.
Yeah, I'm gonna go.
Wait...
You look nice, by the way.
See you tomorrow.
No fucking idea...
Hi, it's Sarah, I'm not available at the moment, but please leave a message.
Shit...
So, where is it?
Put it in the fridge.
She'll notice if we take any more.
She's got a whole rack of them.
Anyway, we're doing her a favor.
Her research is a dead end.
You're such a thoughtful guy.
So devoted to her...
Fuck off.
Pass me the next one.
Come on, there is no time for sleep!
Okay wait, I have some pussy remedy for you.
One for me and one for you.
Take it.
Okay.
You know, Margaret Thatcher, Iron Woman, she only sleeps four hours a night.
Huh, think about it.
None of it was beauty-sleep.
Very strong woman.
I know that.
I'm hungry.
I need to eat something.
I'm hungry.
I need to eat something.
Okay, let's make a break.
Come on.
Take it off.
You know, Margaret Thatcher, she would sleep maybe 12 years in her life.
Normal person, sleeping 25 years - you, 50.
Oww!
Son of a bitch...
- Hello...
- Hello.
What are you doing here?
Just working late.
In the mouse house?
Is that where I am?
These hallways all look the same.
Excuse me.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
He's in pain, help him.
He's in pain!
What's he doing with you?
Ah...
Shit.
I'm sorry.
- Hey, Sunny, come on.
- Excuse me, excuse me.
Do you know what an axolotl says to another axolotl?
I love your 'genes'.
Yes?
Ah, Geoffrey.
Excellent timing.
Come in, take a seat.
Geoffrey Burton, Jarek Novak.
Yes, ah, we've met.
Jarek and Rebekka made the initial breakthrough with the Easter Gene.
I presume she's filled you in by now?
Yeah...
She mentioned it.
Well, I'm sure Jarek here can bring you up to speed.
- Yes.
You're staying at the guesthouse, right?
I can just pop by when it suits you.
What is your room number?
I'll just...
I'll call you.
- You have my number?
- No.
I'm sure Samuel can help you.
Don't mind him Geoffrey.
He means well.
He just forgets, sometimes, that he's not the only horse on the track.
Yeah, but do you trust him?
I trust all my staff.
Yes?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Bad news?
No.
Just the usual administrative headaches.
Our funders are very generous, they allow us a good deal of latitude.
But they're just so impatient.
And that's where I come in?
You're an asset to our team, Geoffrey.
You wouldn't be here if you weren't.
But, I do admit, I hope you're excited by what Jarek has to show you.
Perhaps even enough to give him the benefit of your expertise.
You see, that's where I'm still confused.
I'm sorry, but are you asking me to collaborate with both?
Jarek and Rebekka?
Well, that's up to you.
I can hardly tell you to stop your own research, after all that's why you're here.
But you must admit, this is a rather unique opportunity.
See, I was under the impression that this was Rebekka's project.
That the Easter gene was her discovery.
You know scientists.
Always bickering over who did what when.
- Yeah.
Actually Geoffrey, just between you and I, this is a bit of a tricky situation.
Rebekka has refused to collaborate with him any further.
Yeah, why is that?
- I don't know.
But I can hardly throw him off the project.
So what's he working on down there?
I've got him doing some genotyping.
Tinkering away alone in the dark.
That's what suits him best...
On mice?
On Axolotls.
He does have some mice thing, his pet project.
Viral vectors and so forth.
Geoffrey, just meet with him.
I like to thaw him out sometimes.
Is there something wrong?
No.
No, I'm just trying to get my bearings, is all.
- It's easier to work with zebra fish.
- Yeah, I know.
- Hi, Sorry.
- Excuse me.
I'm just finishing up some embryos.
It's so funny, I thought this morning, we're like the yin and yang of mitosis.
You work on cell proliferation out of control: cancer.
Me: on perfect cell harmony.
So what's the story with this Jarek guy?
What do you mean?
What about him?
I don't know.
He just seems kind of secretive.
Kinda weird.
I don't know.
Samuel thinks he's some kind of genius.
And with you?
What do you mean?
Were you and he ever...?
Are you joking?
Just asking.
So, what's he actually working on?
I don't know what he's working on.
He doesn't want to tell me.
To be honest I don't really care.
Something related to the Easter Gene maybe?
Shit!
Rebekka, Samuel told me.
- Told you what?
- About the Easter Gene.
It wasn't just your discovery, was it?
- It's my discovery.
- But not yours alone.
I'm not a liar, Geoff.
Look, I just want to know what you're getting me into here.
You say we're working together.
Fine.
But I don't even know whose research it is anymore.
I don't even know who's involved.
Jarek isn't involved in what I'm doing.
- But you did work with him.
Only briefly, in the very early stages.
I didn't like his style.
He was too reckless.
He tried to dominate my project.
I threatened to quit if Samuel didn't take him off.
In the end I won.
According to Samuel he's still on it.
It's cosmetic.
You might want to see this.
- Where did you get this?
- I 'retrieved' it from the mouse house and I suggest you change your locks.
What do you mean?
Jarek's got a clandestine lab set up.
And I'm, yeah, I'm pretty damn sure he's trialing your Easter Gene on mice.
What do you want to do about it?
- I'll deal with it.
- How?
- I'll talk to Samuel.
- Why?
- Why don't we just confront him?
- It won't help.
It's my research, okay?
I want to deal with it my way.
You have to trust me.
Okay.
Do something, Geoff, help him.
I'll take care of it, okay?
I'll fix it.
I'm just going to take a little bit of blood...
Just a minute!
Hi.
What's with the gloves?
I'm... doing some dishes.
So what are you doing here?
I'm taking you to the party.
- What party?
Haven't you seen the signs?
- No.
It's our big annua...
- Annual.
- Annual get-together.
You have to come.
Everybody will be there.
I don't think so.
You have no choice.
You're my date.
Looks like you got started early.
Is that wrong?
No.
- You want some more?
- Bitte.
What?
You know what that means, 'bitte'?
- No.
Yeah, I thought so.
So, what's up with the trench coat?
Holy shit.
It's an axolotl!
Don't you get it?
Me the axolotl woman.
Right... cos?
- It's a costume party!
- I see.
- Come on!
I have an idea for you.
- Oh God...
Come, come on.
Oh, sorry.
This is insane.
This guy's trying to steal your research.
Geoff, I, you know, I don't want to create a fuss.
Okay?
I know how to handle Jarek.
It has to be done discreetly.
Listen to me.
I know what I saw.
They were fully grown mice.
Not embryos.
Geoff, please.
Can you just...
Can you just leave it, just for tonight?
Please.
I want to have some fun, feel human for a change.
Please.
Okay?
Just tonight.
One night?
Promise?
- Promise.
- Now, hold still...
One more thing.
Just wait.
What?
You know it's not Boston.
I'm not your intern anymore.
You don't have to feel guilty.
Why did you bring me here?
Hold still.
Was it for work?
Or was it to start something again?
What if I said both?
Then I'd say, it's not a very good idea.
Look, its, its not that I don't think you're attractive.
I do.
It just feels too...
Yeah, okay.
You're finished.
- Rebekka...
- Here, put that on.
I'll go warm up the car.
Oh, there they are!
Hi!
Hey!
You look great!
Have you both met?
I dunno.
I need a drink.
Do you want anything?
They dream...
Did you know that?
When Drosophila lose contact from the ground, they fly.
It is instinct.
So, we put them in a flight simulator and blow banana wind - smell of banana - at them;
eventually they sleep from exhaustion.
Yet we still detect brain activity from olfactory bulbs, representing the pattern, reaction, to banana smell.
Which means: sleeping fruit fly dream of banana...
Are you her new boyfriend?
Think you'll get lucky tonight, huh?
You've been there before, right?
Professor's privilege...
And by the way, I want my mouse back.
- Your mouse?
- Yes, my mouse.
Give me one good reason why I just don't go to Samuel and tell him what you're up to?
- What I'm up to...?
- Yeah.
Tell me, what am I up to?
Well, I know you've stolen Rebekka's research.
And I saw your stupid lapdog break into her lab.
There is no 'her research' or 'my research', Geoff.
We're just one big organism.
Didn't Samuel tell you that?
No?
Well, you see that would make your mouse our mouse then.
And our mouse tells me that you've been trialing the Easter Gene on mammals.
And I also know that it's working.
What I don't know is how you did it.
So go on, tell me how you did it.
Come on.
I guess you'll have to wait and read my paper.
Like everybody else.
Tell me!
Do you need a doctor?
It's his own fault.
Fuck him.
Come.
Hello.
Hello!
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's going to need some serious stitches.
You okay?
What?
No!
No!
No!
No!
Geoff, what are you doing?
Let's make it right...
You're awake?
Your fever's gone.
You really scared me last night.
What are you doing?
It's quite a dossier you have here.
You always go through people's stuff?
If you didn't want me to see it, why's it just lying around?
You know, I saw Jarek at the club.
We had a nice little chat...
- Why?
- Why did you do that?
- Why not?
I saw him grab you.
I saw you talking to him last night after work.
That's what I thought.
So what?
What do you want me to say?
- The truth.
Okay, I had a little fling with Jarek.
So what?
It was stupid.
So stupid.
At least I knew who I was fucking.
You called me Sarah last night.
I was delirious.
What's your excuse?
Why do I need one?
Listen, I don't care if you were sleeping with some freak.
What I do care about is everything you've been telling me lately sounds like bullshit.
- Bullshit?
- Bullshit.
Okay then, let's just define 'bullshit' for a moment, shall we?
What's bullshit is that you were never going to leave her?
Despite everything you told me.
I never said anything that would make you think...
You think that didn't hurt?
I was frightened.
You know, it wasn't just some little crush on my professor.
I was scared that it could get out and my career would suffer.
That was a long time ago, you need to move on.
Get out.
Get out!
You know, you have no idea what I've had to deal with.
Oh, come on, Geoff!
Deal with?
You haven't dealt with anything.
Sarah?
Ah, she's not available right now.
Is this Geoff?
Just put my wife on, please.
She's not your wife anymore.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Yes, she does.
Every time you call you upset her.
- I'm sick of it!
- Just put her on, Ben!
Hey, who the fuck...
Oh, you fucking...
Squek...
Come on!
Answer the phone!
Where's Rebekka?
Up on the roof.
Hi.
I need your help.
Rebekka, please.
- What is it you want from me?
- I can't tell you here.
Here.
- I need you...
- Geoff!
- To do a blood test.
- Yeah, of course.
- You can run a PCR, right?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?
Help me.
Can you please just tell me what's going on?
You're scaring me!
I was bitten by a mouse!
- A lab mouse?
- Yes.
And I'm pretty sure I've contracted a virus.
That's not possible.
These are the most pathogen-free mice in the world.
Not if they belong to Jarek.
Now come on, we need a sample from you too for the negative control.
- I know how it works, Geoff.
- Then do it!
What am I supposed to be looking for?
Your Easter Gene.
Jarek's using a viral vector to integrate it into the mammal genome.
Not embryos, fully grown mice.
He scooped you on the mammals, I'm sorry he did it, but I don't know how.
What?
I'm the proof.
You know what, you're right.
Screw the test!
- Where are you going?
- Where's Jarek?
- I don't know.
- Yes you do!
- Probably in the mouse house.
- The mouse house?
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?
Please, let me call Samuel.
Oh, now you're gonna call him!
Call Samuel, get him to the mouse house right now.
- Let's think about this.
- I'm done thinking!
Where are you going?
Stop!
- Geoff!
- Squeak is spelt with an 'A', asshole!
- What are you doing?
- You used a viral vector.
- Get off him!
- Come on!
- It was infectious!
- What are you talking about?
You're mouse, it was infectious!
- Get this crazy asshole off me!
- Tell me!
Stop it!
Please!
I'm going to fucking kill you!
Get off me.
Jarek!
Get back!
Jarek...
- Get back.
Jarek?
What's wrong, Jarek?
This is exactly what you wanted, wasn't it?
Get back!
What are you going to do?
I mean it.
Do it.
- Get back!
- What the hell is going on here?
He just went crazy, he was attacking us!
Don't listen to him, Samuel!
These guys infected me!
That's a lie.
He's done it to himself.
Waldemar, tell him.
- Bullshit.
- It's true.
He did.
They lured me here.
In fact you all lured me and you used the mouse to infect me and make it look unintentional.
Put that scalpel down.
Put the scalpel down!
Look at his head.
The cut.
- What cut?
- Shit.
Will someone kindly tell me what the hell this is all about?
It's healed.
It works.
It works in humans!
You fucking back off!
Alright, I see what's going on now.
I understand your little collaboration, right?
- Geoffrey...
No, I get it now.
You're in on this, too.
What is this 'infection'?
Is it viral?
Of course it's fucking viral.
The Easter Gene is an endogenous retro virus.
Even though these two geniuses couldn't work it out.
Is this true?
What the hell have you done?
What I have done?
I've just made the discovery of the century!
This is what I have done!
Me, Jarek Novak.
Remember it.
Happy Easter.
Yeah... discovery's not a cure, right?
That's what you told me.
If the healing's accelerated, so has the tumorgenesis.
What do you think I got?
A day?
Maybe two?
Is this contagious?
Ah, it's alright, Samuel.
I'm pretty god damn sure that it's blood-borne.
No, Geoff, no!
No, please!
Let me go!
Please!
No, please!
Let me go!
Please!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Let me go, please!
Please!
I'm not going to be anybody's specimen.
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff, please stop!
Stop please.
Geoff!
Stop!
There's nothing you can do.
Come back with me, it's your only chance.
No.
I'm going home.
Listen, I made a few changes in the sequence, but it's basically the same.
Same?
- Yeah.
- The same as what?
- Burton's Syndrome.
What?
What?
I requested tissue samples when I heard about your son's condition.
My son?
Why?
Why would you do that?
I...
I thought I could help you somehow.
I...
I don't...
You know, when I started cloning the gene, I...
I discovered it could regenerate dying cells.
I mean the tumors are actually a symptom of cell regeneration.
It's regeneration out of control.
That's what happened to your son.
I wanted you here to share it.
To show it to you, to make you part of it...
I mean, you are part of it.
I wanted to tell you.
I just...
I was waiting for the right time.
What took you so long, huh?
I was afraid to tell you.
I didn't know how you'd react or...
I'm sorry, I went too far with it.
I'm...
Why?
- Because...
- Why?
Because I love you, Geoff.
Don't you see that?
I love you!
You love me?
I'm so sorry...
- No, it's fine...
- I never meant for this to happen.
I have my own disease.
You know how funny that is?
I have my own disease.
It was just research to help you.
Research...
That's exactly what I would say to Sarah.
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff, where are you going?
Geoff!
Yeah.
That's alright!
You're drooling again!
Son of a bitch!
What are you doing?
Okay...
Please open the door.
Please come out.
Have you got a ticket?
Ticket?
Ticket?
You speak English?
Do you speak English?
Stop!
Please stop.
Please stop!
Hi, ifs Sarah, I'm not available at the moment.
Please leave a message after the beep.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I loved him so much.
And it was just hard...
I did love him, I really did.
I really did.
Where is she?
Yeah?
Where is she?
Geoffrey.
You're awake.
Well, at least you've got your own room.
No, no.
No, don't do that.
You've been very restless these past few days.
But don't you worry.
Everything is being thoroughly investigated.
Geoffrey...
You have been very ill, but you're all better now.
Your recovery has been remarkable.
Inspirational, in fact.
Do you remember anything?
Where is she?
She's right here.
Look.
No.
Sarah.
Listen, old chap.
We're going to have to keep you in here for a bit.
You're unique, you see?
But just at the moment, you're a bit of a danger to yourself.
But don't worry.
You'll be all right.
You were really sick, but you're good now.
You're immune.
Look at this.
Do you see that?
Jarek was right.
Burton's Syndrome is actually a dormant retrovirus.
We all have it, it's millions of years old.
Only that your son had a very special version of it.
And now you.
You're a miracle.
And your son was a miracle.
Why didn't your son recover?
Excuse me, I need to take some blood.
How was I supposed to know?
Shit...
Yes?
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Shit!
Yeah.
That's alright!
You're drooling again!
Son of a...
Bitch.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hey!
Oh...
Okay...
Please open the door.
Please come out.
Have you got a ticket?
Stop!
Please stop.
Excuse me, I need to take some blood.
wake up.
wake up.
Hello.
is this geoff?
Yeah.
This is samuel, here.
We were expecting you this morning.
Oh, samuel, uh I completely passed out.
Okay.
We'll see you soon.
Geoff burton for samuel mead, please.
Injecting room here, got your stereo microscope Quarantine room for incoming animals Microscope room with confocal imaging station.
All the usual stuff.
Spinning disc confocal Two photon confocals Upright confocals with dipping lenses...
All the laser lines you could wish for Anything to make science beautiful.
We've got a cold room.
We've got a microbial culture room ...The auto glazer, downstairs.
Um, there's an elevator?
How's your accommodation, geoffrey?
Oh, fine, fine.
I was just wondering where my office
Is gonna be.
Oh, we don't really do offices, per se.
We're more communal than that.
Of course, we can loan you a lab
For the duration of a given project.
Right.
Look who I've found...
- Dr. Burton.
- Dr. Fiedler.
Rebekka's come a long way
Since she was interned with you.
Yes, so I hear.
I'm sorry, I can't leave this right now.
We'll catch up later.
Great.
- Shall we continue?
- Yes.
That way.
Now, there's something else we need to do.
Sorry, I didn't...
Erm...
Anyway Let's get your security pass sorted out.
Son of a bitch.
oh, geoff...
How are you?
I'm fine.
You?
Hmm...
I'm good.
...Setting up the new research lab.
Uh, the one in munich, right?
Uh, no.
Dresden, remember?
You must be happy.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's...
It's nothing.
- Forget about it.
- hey, babe.
I'm home.
hold on for a second.
So, uh...
What's up?
I heard about your news.
When were you planning to tell me?
I was going to tell you.
I really was...
I'm in my second month and I I wasn't quite sure, and I didn't tell anyone else.
Well, joe and carla knew.
Oh.
No, that was...
That was ben.
Right...
Ben.
He was excited about the baby
So he jus-just told them, you know?
You're angry.
No...
Of course...
I'm not angry.
I'm just I dunno, I gotta think about it.
Think about what?
Well what do you want me to say?
Congratulations?
...Maybe you could be happy for me.
What do you want?
Why did you call me?
I don't know why I called.
I miss you.
I have to go.
Geoffrey burton comes to us from umass,
Where his research into the early detection
Of embryonic abnormalities...
One of the more, uh, furiously debated topics
Of the scientific community this decade.
Now, I don't need to tell you
What the implications of this are The proverbial cure for cancer
Has always eluded us.
The potential of prenatal discovery
Certainly brings the possibility a few steps closer.
To continue his research in a rather less politicized environment.
And he's going to speak to us all this morning About the state of his work to date.
When you're ready.
Thank you.
Would you now all please join me
In welcoming Geoffrey burton.
Thank you.
Thank you, samuel.
I never intended to become a geneticist.
My ph.D. Was actually on bacterial biochemistry.
But, as I'm sure many of you know
I was drawn to this by my experience
With my own son...
To focus my research on screening embryos
For traces of rare genetic mutations.
...Such as his.
I want to make one thing very clear:
I'm not trying to develop new techniques
To prescreen people with brown eyes or dark skin Or freckles.
I like freckles.
Diversity...
One of the things
Which defines us as a species
Is to be celebrated.
Mutations Which endanger human life...
Are not.
For example...
Here we see the subject
In the earliest stages The disease is non-contagious
In the traditional sense.
Yet, at the same time, unusually virulent.
I've allowed myself the conceit of calling it Burton syndrome.
What made this syndrome noteworthy
Was its sudden appearance
In what appeared to be a perfectly healthy subject.
Within a matter of days, the Symptoms had manifested
As a number of neoplasms Exponentially multiplying and growing in size.
These, uh Tumor-like appendages
Eventually cover the entire body,
As we can see.
Respiration became increasingly difficult Began to affect internal organs Crushing the heart Constricting the lungs.
Brain activity ceased shortly thereafter.
From first symptoms to death,
The entire process took little over a week.
What made this unique was that this was not
An acquired disease like a virus,
But a seemingly Random genetic mutation Occurring in the gene rip-5 on chromosome 20.
Alright.
Let's take a closer look at some tissue samples.
May I sit here?
People don't want to know
The way things happen.
This fish, for example...
No one wants to think of it...
Suffocating...
In agony.
We just want to fry it...
Eat it...
Forget.
Same with science.
People want the cure But not the research.
It makes them uncomfortable,
Knowing how you got there,
What you had to do.
To what...
It's true.
I would like to live a million years Just to see what we evolve into.
Do we become telepathic?
Do we get wings?
I would like wings.
And you What would you like?
I don't know, uh I can be a time traveler.
You know, travel through time,
Backwards and forwards...
Chiba I don't think your patent's done yet.
Hello.
I'm jarek novak.
Geoffrey burton.
We actually met yesterday.
I almost Liberated your mouse.
- I didn't know it was you.
- It's me.
Your lecture, I really like it.
Great images.
Thank you...
I guess.
I was thinking Maybe you would like to have a look
At some things I've been working on.
We kind of, similar vein, you know?
Yeah?
Why not?
Good.
We should have a drink.
- Sure.
- What about tonight?
Excuse me a minute.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
No, thank you.
I quit.
- You quit?
- Yeah.
I guess it has been a while
Since I've seen you last.
Yeah, that was your choice.
I'm sorry.
You know, I I don't want it to be awkward.
I don't, either.
You know, I have been watching you, though.
You know, I've been watching you rise.
Read all your papers.
Very impressive.
You're the one who got samuel
To approach me, right?
You know, I I felt like I'd hit a wall
With my research, and You know I-I heard what you were dealing with
In america, so...
I thought, perhaps, you'd like to come over.
I, uh...
I don't know, I...
To be honest, I didn't expect you to say yes.
What have I said "yes" to?
I can show you.
Let's go back.
Good, 'cause my ass is cold.
Have a seat.
Okay...
So...
Now, here...
Okay, this is a typical regeneration cycle,
About ten weeks from amputation to full regeneration.
Yes?
Yes.
Okay, so now Watch this one.
Did you see?
Uh...
Missed it.
I'll play it again.
Watch closely.
You're kidding, right?
That's not possible.
When I inserted the easter gene,
I found it accelerated the natural regeneration capacity
Of the axolotls way beyond anything
I could have imagined.
But, since then, I've refined
The genetic code further.
Just...
Wait a minute.
What easter gene?
What are you talking about?
Look.
I labeled only the transplanted
Easter gene cells With a gfp.
They were localized in the wound area,
But then they completely took over.
Look for yourself.
That's, uh...
I've even had success regenerating severely damage
Brain and spinal tissue.
I mean, can you imagine the possibilities
For this in humans?
Jesus christ...
Exactly...
Easter.
Why haven't you published this?
I don't know.
A discovery is not a cure.
Even so, I mean...
It won't even uptake in mice.
What happens when you try?
Nothing.
I've been stuck for six month, now.
And then, I thought, if anybody could help me
With the molecular mechanism To help me activate it in mammals...
Hmm...
You know, I'm sorry, I've got an appointment
With samuel right now, but what do you think
About, you know, discussing this later,
Over dinner?
- Yep.
- At my place?
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing.
Hm.
I can cook something for you.
- German?
- I like german.
Don't worry.
It's not a date.
hey!
Hey...
Looks like we are having a drink tonight, after all.
It is not together.
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I'm not going back to the guest house, so...
It's cold.
Come on.
Alright.
Want to try electrical cigarette?
Uh, no.
I've got my own.
...Real cigarette.
Ah...
I'm sorry, but, uh It's a non-smoking car.
Of course.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Where are we going?
Oh, right...
Sorry, uh...
Uh..
fodenhau...
Foten...
Can I see it?
Ah, pfotenhauerstrasse Yes.
I know it.
Good.
That's where we're going.
I know you, also...
- ...
Very well.
- Yeah, you do?
- Yes, the science.
- Hmm.
We are the same, both of us.
How do you figure?
You know Taking risks, whatever it takes.
A new, brave world.
Yeah, I haven't read that one.
I have ideas.
You have saved myself, uh, brilliant experiments.
You could be part of them.
Well, that's a very kind offer, ...My work's kind of a full time thing right now
Why'd we stop?
You know mosquitos, bed bugs, fleas, ticks They're all vectors for disease, yes?
But instead of spreading sickness,
Why not change the formula?
Make them carry genetically modified viruses Antigenes for their own plague.
Imagine releasing this in the third world In africa.
Hm?
They're going to be bitten, anyway.
So why not let them catch Malaria vaccine, instead?
But then, first you would have to Invent the malaria vaccine, right?
You don't think it's possible?
I didn't say that.
You know stalin, mao tse-tung...?
Both of them believed you could transfer ideology
By breeding one indoctrinated generation to the next.
And, eventually, you would get
Genetically programmed communists.
I mean, I know this sounds maybe a little...
Crazy...
But There were some really good ideas in there.
But, look, uh What good ideas are we talking about, really?
- You're not getting my point.
- What is your point?
There is the idea And there is making people believe in the idea.
And that is the key to scientific freedom.
...And financing.
Exactly.
And you need that freedom
To be able to get the good ideas.
Because they can come from unexpected places.
Like your son, for example.
You know I'm gonna walk from here.
Say hello to rebekka from me.
So why didn't you call me?
I could have picked you up.
I got a lift.
Well, sort of...
Half a lift.
...From that jarek guy at the institute.
What's up with that guy?
I don't have much to do with him.
Oh.
Don't you get enough of these at work?
I find them beautiful.
You know, they are such strange and resourceful organisms.
There is nothing quite like them on earth.
Mm-hmm.
You don't agree?
I kinda always saw them as redundant.
You know, genetic dead ends.
But, then again, after what I saw today Who knows?
What about this?
They're called wunderkammer.
What?
Wunderkammer.
wunderkammer...
To display things that hadn't been classified yet.
I'm creating new wonders.
So you're an artist, now, and a scientist.
Come on, let's eat something.
- Alright, go on.
- You're not in training, so...
- Tell me.
- What?
Tell me.
- What?
- What do you think?
Tell you what?
About this easter gene of yours.
Why do you think I'm here?
I'll tell you everything, on one condition.
Okay.
You have to agree to work with me.
Yeah, okay.
Sure.
to fruitful collaborations.
- Okay, that's good...
- Okay.
...Because I need your brain.
Just my brain.
Alright, a little much...
You had a big impact on me, you know...
Did I?
You were this unreachable...
Kind of...
Star scientist Whatever.
Intelligent and Inspiring, and Intimidating, of course, too, sometimes.
- Hmm.
- I mean, even now What you're doing, it's Brave, I suppose.
Why is that?
- Forget about it.
- No, no, no, no...
I think I'm a little drunk.
You tell me.
just...
Using your son like that...
In the lecture...
I can't imagine what that must be like.
I'm sorry.
- That's alright.
- I didn't mean to say that.
Yeah you did.
Come on, geoff.
I'm not criticizing you.
You know I haven't published
Anything significant in four years?
Publish or perish, remember?
Isn't that what we used to say?
They were forcing me out of umass.
But you knew that, right?
They were cutting my funding
Until my lab was unworkable Waiting for me to quit.
They couldn't fire me.
That would make them look bad.
You know, my boy He was the only case.
And it killed him.
I'm just trying to find something positive
Out of all this.
You know if I don't, then What's the point?
But you've made progress.
I think I should go.
- I'm still a little tired, jet lagged...
- Geoff...
Dinner was nice.
I'm gonna go.
Wait...
You look nice, by the way.
See you tomorrow.
No fucking idea... hi, it's sarah.
I am not available
At the moment, please leave a mess...
Scheisse.
[Shit]
Where is it?
Put it in the fridge.
She will notice if we take anymore.
She's got a whole rack of them.
Anyway, we are doing her a favor.
Her research is a dead end.
You're such a thoughtful guy...
- So devoted to her...
- Fuck off.
Pass me the next one.
Come on, it is not time for sleep.
Okay, wait.
I have some pussy remedy for you.
One for me And one for you.
Take it.
Aaaaaaah...
Okay.
You know margaret thatcher Our woman?
She only sleep four hours a night
Huh?
Think about it.
None of it was beauty sleep.
Very strong woman.
I know that.
I'm hungry.
I need to eat something.
I'm hungry, I need to eat something.
Okay.
Let's take a break, come on.
Take it off.
You know, margaret thatcher sleep, uh..
...Maybe 12 years in her life.
Normal person...
Sleeping 25 years.
You... 50.
ow!
Son of a bitch.
- Hello.
- Hello.
What are you doing here?
Just working late.
In the mouse house...
Is that where I am?
These hallways all look the same.
Excuse me.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
He's in pain.
Do something.
Help him.
He's in pain...
What's he doing with you?
Come on...
Uh...
Ah, shit.
I'm sorry.
Okay...
Excuse me I love your genes.
Yes.
Oh, geoffrey Excellent timing.
Come in.
Take a seat.
Geoffrey burton Jarek novak.
Yes.
We've, uh, met.
Jarek and rebekka made the initial breakthrough
With the easter gene.
I presume she's filled you in by now.
Yeah, she mentioned it.
I'm sure jarek, here, can bring you up to speed.
Yes.
You're staying at the guest house, right?
Mm-hmm.
I can just pop by when it suits you.
What is your room number?
Oh, well, just...
I'll call you.
- You have my number?
- No.
I'm sure someone can help you.
He means well, he just forgets, sometimes,
He's not the only horse on the track.
Yeah, but do you trust him?
I trust all my staff.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Danke.
[Thank you]
Danke schön.
[Thank you very much]
- Bad news?
- Hmm?
Just the usual administrative headaches.
Our funders are very generous,
They allow us a good deal of latitude But they're just so impatient.
And that's where I come in?
You're an asset to our team, geoffrey.
You wouldn't be here if you weren't.
But I do admit, I hope you're excited
About what jarek has to show you Perhaps even enough to give him the benefit
You see, that's where I'm still confused.
I'm sorry, but...
Are you asking me to collaborate
With both jarek and rebekka?
Well, that's up to you.
I can hardly tell you to stop your own research,
After all, I mean...
That's why you're here.
But you must admit,
This is a rather unique opportunity.
See, I was under the impression
That this was rebekka's project,
That the easter gene was...
Her discovery.
- Always bickering over who did what, and when - yeah...
Actually, geoffrey Just between you and I This is a bit of a tricky situation.
Rebekka has refused to collaborate with him any further.
Yeah?
Why is that?
I don't know, but I can hardly
Throw him off the project.
So what's he working on down there?
I've got him doing some genotyping Tinkering away, alone in the dark.
It's what suits him best.
On mice.
On axolotls.
He does have some...
Mice thing His pet project Viral vectors, and so forth.
Geoffrey Meet with him.
I like to thaw him out, sometimes.
Is there something wrong?
No, no...
I'm just Trying to get my bearings, is all.
Excuse me.
I'm just finishing up some embryos.
It's so funny, I thought this morning
We are like the yin and yang of mitosis.
You work on cell proliferation out of control, cancer Me, on perfect cell harmony.
So what's the story with that jarek guy?
What do you mean?
What about him?
I don't know.
Just seems kinda secretive.
It's kinda weird.
I don't know, samuel thinks he's some kind of genius.
And with you?
What do you mean?
Were you and he ever, uh...
Are you joking?
Just asking.
So what's he actually working on?
I don't know what he's working on.
He doesn't want to tell me.
To be honest, I don't really care.
Something related to the easter gene, maybe.
Scheisse.
[Shit]
Rebekka, samuel told me.
- Told you what?
- About the easter gene It wasn't just your discovery, was it?
- It's my discovery.
- But not yours, alone.
I'm not a liar, geoff.
Look, I just want to know
What you're getting me into, here.
You say we're working together, fine But I don't even know whose Research it is, anymore.
I-I don't even know who's involved.
Jarek isn't involved in what I'm doing.
- You did work with him.
- Only briefly In the very early stages.
I didn't like his style.
He was too reckless.
He tried to dominate my project.
I threatened to quit
If samuel didn't take him off.
In the end, I won.
Well, according to samuel, he's still on it.
It's cosmetic.
You might want to see this.
- Where did you get this?
- I retrieved it From the mouse house, and I suggest you change your locks.
Jarek's got a clandestine lab set up, and I'm Yeah, I'm pretty damn sure he's trialling your easter gene
On mice.
What do you want to do about it?
- I'll deal with it.
- How?
- I'll talk to samuel.
- Why?
Why don't we...
- ...
Just confront...
- It won't help.
It's my research, okay?
I want to deal with it my way.
You have to trust me.
Okay.
do something, geoff.
Help him.
I'll take care of it, okay?
I'll fix it.
I'm gonna take just a little bit of blood.
Just a minute.
Hi.
What's with the glove?
I, um Just doing some dishes.
So...
What are you doing here?
I'm taking you to the party.
- Haven't you seen the signs?
- No.
It's our big...
Anyal...
- "Annual." - ...
Annual get-together.
You have to come.
Everybody will be there.
I don't think so.
You have no choice You're my date.
woop!
Looks like you got started early.
Is that wrong?
No.
- You want some more?
- Bitte. [Please]
What?
You know what that means, "bitte?" [Please]
- No.
- Yeah, I thought so.
So what's up with the trench coat?
Holy shit.
It's an axolotl!
Don't you get it?
Me, the axolotl woman...
Woo.
- right, 'cause...
- It's a costume party!
- I see.
Aww, come on...
- ...
I have an idea for you.
- Oh, god.
Come.
Come on.
Ooh!
I'm sorry!
This is insane.
This guy's trying to steal your...
Geoff, you know, I don't want
To create a fuss, okay?
I know how to handle jarek.
It has to be done discreetly.
Uh huh.
Listen to me, I know what I saw.
They were fully grown mice, not embryos.
Geoff, please, can you just Can you just leave it?
Just for tonight, please?
I-I...
I want to have some fun,
Feel human for a change, please.
Okay?
Just tonight.
One night?
Promise?
promise.
Now, hold still.
One more thing...
Just, wait...
What?
You know, it's not boston.
I'm not your intern, anymore.
You don't have to feel guilty.
Why did you bring me here?
Hm?
Hold still.
Was it for work, or was it to start something again?
What if I said both?
Then I'd say it's not a very good idea.
It's not that I don't think you're attractive;
I do.
It just feels too...
Yeah, okay.
- You're finished.
- What?
- Rebekka...
- Here, put that on.
I'll go warm up the car.
Hey.
Oh, there they are.
Hey, woo!
Hey!
Have you both met?
I need a drink.
Do you want anything?
Thanks.
They dream.
Did you know that?
When drosophila lose contact from the ground They fly!
It is instinct.
So we put them in a flight simulator And blow banana wind Smell of banana!
Eventually, they sleep from exhaustion,
Yet we still detect brain activity
From olfactory bulbs Representing the patterned reaction
To banana smell!
Which means Sleeping fruit fly dream of banana!
Are you her new boyfriend?
Think you will get lucky tonight, huh?
You've been there before, right?
Professor's privilege?
By the way I want my mouse back.
Your mouse?
Yes.
My mouse.
Give me one good reason
Why I wouldn't just go to samuel
And tell him what you're up to.
What I'm up to?
Tell me.
What am I up to?
Well, I know you've stolen rebekka's research.
I saw your stupid lap dog break into the lab.
There is no "her research" and "my research."
We are just one big organism.
Did someone tell you that?
No?
Well, you see, that would Make "your mouse" "our mouse," then.
And our mouse tells me You've been trialling the easter gene on animals.
I also know it's working.
What I don't know, is How you did it.
So, go on.
Tell me how you did it.
I guess you will have to wait and read my paper.
...Like everybody else.
Stop!
Stop it!
You want doctor?
It's his own fault.
Fuck him.
Come.
Hello.
I'm sorry.
It's going to need some serious stitches.
You okay?
Hey What?
No.
No.
Geoff, what are you doing?
Let's make it right.
You're awake.
Oh, your fever is gone.
You really scared me last night.
What are you doing?
It's quite the dossier, here.
You always go through people's stuff?
You didn't want me to see it, why is it just lying around?
You know, I saw jarek at the club.
We had a nice little chat.
Why?
Why did you do that?
Why not?
I saw him grab you, I saw you Talkin' to him last night, after work.
That's what I thought.
So, what...
...What do you want me to say?
How about the truth?
Okay, I had a little fling with jarek.
So what?
It was stupid.
So stupid.
At least I knew who I was fucking.
You called me sarah last night.
I was delirious.
What's your excuse?
Why do I need one?
Listen, I don't care if you were Sleeping with some freak What I do care about is that
Everything you've been telling me lately
Sounds like bullshit.
Okay, then let's just define bullshit for a moment, shall we?
What's bullshit is That you were never going to leave her,
Despite everything you told me.
I never said anything that would make you...
You think that didn't hurt?
I was frightened.
You know, it wasn't just a little crush on my professor.
I was scared that it could get out, and My career would suffer.
That was a long time ago.
You need to move on.
Get out.
Get out!
You know...
You have no idea What I've had to deal with.
Oh, come on, geoff Deal with?
You haven't dealt with anything.
uh, she's not available right now.
- Is this geoff?
- Just put my wife on, please.
She's not your wife, anymore.
And she doesn't want to talk to you.
Yes...
She does.
Every time you call, you upset her.
- I'm sick of it.
- Just put her on, ben.
hey, who the fuck...
Oh, you fucking...
Fucker.
"squek"
Come on.
Answer the phone.
Where's rebekka?
Up on the roof.
Hi.
I need your help.
Rebekka, please...
What is it you want from me?
I can't tell you here.
Here.
- I need you...
- What's that?
- ...
To do a blood test.
- Yeah, of course.
- You can run a pcr, right?
- Yeah.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Can you please just tell me what's going on?
- You're scaring me.
- I was bitten by a mouse.
- A...
A lab mouse?
- Yes.
And I'm pretty sure I contracted a virus.
That's not possible.
These are the most pathogen-free mice
In the world.
Not if they belong to jarek.
We need a sample from you, too, for the negative.
- I know how it works, geoff.
- Then do it!
What am I supposed to be looking for?
Your easter gene!
Jarek's using a viral vector to integrate it
Into the mammal genome.
Not embryos Fully grown mice.
He scooped you on the mammals.
I'm sorry, he did it.
But I don't know how.
What?
I'm the proof.
You know what, you're right.
Screw the test.
- Where are you going?
- Where's jarek?
I don't know...
Yes, you do.
Probably the mouse house.
Mouse house?
What are you doing?
What do you think?
Please Let me call samuel.
Oh, now you're gonna call.
Call samuel, and get him to the mouse house, right now.
Let's think about this.
- I'm done thinking.
- Where're you going?
Stop!
Stop!
"squeak" is spelled with an "a," asshole!
For your survival Get the hell out of here!
It was infectious.
What are you talking about?
Your mice!
It was infectious!
Get this crazy ass off of me!
Tell me!
Stop it, please!
Stop it!
Jarek!
Get back!
- Jarek...
- Get back.
Jarek...
What's wrong, jarek?
This is exactly what you wanted, wasn't it?
Huh?
Get back!
What're you gonna do?
I mean it.
Do it.
get back!
what the hell is going on here?
He just went crazy!
He was attacking us.
Don't listen to him, samuel.
These guys infected me.
That is a lie.
He's done it to himself.
- Waldemar, tell him.
- Bullshit.
It's true...
- ...
He did.
- Bullshit.
They lured me here.
In fact You all lured me
He used the mouse to infect me.
It made it look unintentional.
Put the scalpel down.
Put the scalpel Down.
Look at his head.
The cut...
- What cut?
- Shit...
Will someone kindly tell me what the hell this is all about?
It's healed.
It works!
It works in humans!
You fucking back off.
Alright, I see what's going on now.
I understand your little collaboration, right?
- Geoffrey...
- No, I get it now.
You're in on this, too.
What is this infection?
- Is it viral?
- Of course, it's fucking viral.
The easter gene is endogenous retrovirus.
Even though these two geniuses couldn't work it out.
This is true.
What the hell have you done?
What I have done?
I have just made the discovery of the century!
This is what I have done!
Me, jarek novak!
Remember it.
Happy easter.
Discovery is not a cure, right?
That's what you told me.
If the healing has accelerated So has the tumorigenesis.
what do you think I got?
A day?
Maybe two?
Is this contagious?
Ah, it's alright, Samuel
Pretty goddamn sure that it's blood-borne.
No!
Nooo!
No, please!
Stop, let me help him!
Please!
Please, let me help!
No, please!
Please!
Please!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Please...
Oh, please!
Let me go!
Please, please let me go, please!
Please!
geoff...
Geoff!
Geoff.
Geoff, please stop.
Stop, please.
Geoff.
Stop!
There's nothing you can do.
Come back with me.
It's your only chance.
No.
I'm going home.
Listen, I...
I made a few Changes in the sequence, but, it's It's basically the same.
- Same?
- Yeah.
The same as what?
Burton's syndrome.
What?
I I requested tissue samples
When I heard about your son's condition.
My son?
Why?
Why would you do that?
I I thought I Could help you, somehow.
I I don't...
You know, when I started cloning the gene, I I discovered it could regenerate
Dying cells.
I mean The tumors are actually the symptom
Of cell regeneration.
It's regeneration, out of control.
That's what happened to your son.
I wanted you here to share it To show it to you, to Make you part of it.
I mean, you were a part of it.
I wanted to tell you, I just I was waiting for the right time.
What took you so long, huh?
I was afraid to tell you.
I didn't know How you'd react, or...
I'm sorry, I I went too far with it...
- Why?
Why?
!
- Because Because I love you, geoff!
Don't you see that?
I love you!
You love me?
I am so sorry, I...
- No, it's fine.
- ...
I never meant For this to happen, I...
I have my own disease.
You know how funny that is?
I have my own disease.
it was just research To help you.
Research That's exactly what I would say to sarah.
Geoff.
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff, where are you going?
!
Geoff!
hey!
Hey...
Hey!
Oh...
Okay...
Ticket?
Ticket?
Speak english.
Do you speak english?
Hey, hey, hey...
Halt!
Please, stop!
hi, it's sarah.
I am not available at the moment.
Please leave a message after the beep.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
...And it was just so hard I really did...
Why...?
where is she?
- Yeah?
- Where is she?
Geoffrey You're awake.
Well, at least you got your own room.
No No, no.
Don't do that.
You've been very Restless, these past few days.
But don't you worry.
Everything is being thoroughly investigated.
Geoffrey You have been very ill.
But, you're all better now.
Your recovery has been remarkable Inspirational, in fact.
Do you remember anything?
Where is she?
She's right here.
Look...
No...
Sarah...
Listen, old chap We're gonna have to keep you in here, for a bit.
You're unique, you see But just for the moment, you're a bit of a danger to yourself.
Now, don't worry You'll be alright.
Hey, you.
You were really sick But you're good now.
You're immune.
Look at this.
Do you see that?
Jarek was right.
Burton syndrome is actually a dormant retrovirus.
We all have it.
It's millions of years old.
Only that your son had a very special version of it Now you.
You're a miracle.
And your son was a miracle.
Why didn't your son recover?
How was I supposed to know?
Wake up...
Wake up...
Hello?
Is this Geoff?
Yeah.
This is Samuel here, we were expecting you this morning?
Oh, Samuel... ah.
I completely passed out.
Okay, we'll see you soon.
Hi, Geoff Burton for Samuel Mead, please.
Injecting room here, got your stereomicroscope.
Quarantine room for incoming animals.
Microscope room with confocal imaging station
- all the usual stuff:
Spinning disk confocal, twophoton confocal, upright confocals with dipping lenses, all the laser lines you could wish for.
Anything to make science beautiful.
We've got a cold room, we've got a microbial culture room;
the autoclaves are downstairs.
There's a...
How's your accommodation, Geoffrey?
Oh, fine, fine.
I was just wondering where my office is going to be?
Oh, we don't really do 'offices' per se.
We're more communal than that.
Of course, we can loan you a lab for the length of a given project.
Right...
Look who I found.
- Doctor Burton.
- Doctor Fiedler.
Rebekka's come a long way since she was interned with you.
Yes, so I hear.
I'm sorry I can't leave this right now.
- We'll catch up later.
- Great.
- Shall we continue?
- Yes.
That way.
Now, there's something else we need to do...
Sorry, I didn't...
Anyway, let's get your security pass sorted out.
Son of a bitch...
Geoff...
How are you?
I'm fine, you?
I'm good.
I'm setting up the new research lab.
The one in Munich right?
No, Dresden... remember?
So, you must be happy?
What's that supposed to mean?
- It's nothing, forget about it...
- Hey babe!
I'm home.
Hold on for a second.
So... what's up?
I heard about your news.
When were you planning to tell me?
I was going to tell you, I really was.
Fm in my second month,
I wasn't quite sure and I didn't tell anyone else.
Well, Joe and Karla knew.
Oh, no.
That was Ben.
Right.
Ben.
He was excited about the baby so he just told them.
You know...?
You're angry?
No.
Of course.
No.
I'm not angry...
I'm just, I don't know.
I gotta think about it.
Think about what?
Well, what do you want me to say?
Congratulations?
I dunno.
Maybe you can be happy for me.
What do you want?
Why did you call me?
I don't know why I called.
I miss you.
I have to go.
Geoffrey Burton comes to us from U-Mass, where his research into early detection of embryonic abnormalities has certainly proved one of the more, ah, fiercely-debated topics in the scientific community this decade.
Now, I don't need to tell you what the implications of this are.
The proverbial 'cure for cancer' has always eluded us.
But the potential of pre-natal discovery certainly brings the possibility a few steps closer.
And Geoffrey has now come here to continue his research in a rather less politicized environment, and he's going to speak to us this morning about the state of his work to date.
When you're ready...
Thank you.
Will you now all please join me in welcoming Geoffrey Burton.
Thank you, thank you, Samuel...
I never intended to become a geneticist.
My PhD. was actually on bacterial biochemistry.
But, as I'm sure many of you know, I was drawn to this by my experience with my own son, whose condition led me to focus my research on screening embryos for traces of rare genetic mutations
such as his.
I want to make one thing very clear:
this is not eugenics.
I'm not trying to develop new techniques to pre-screen people with brown eyes, or dark skin, or freckles.
I like freckles.
Diversity - one of the things which defines us as a species is to be celebrated.
Mutations which endanger human life are not.
For example - here we see the subject in the earliest stages.
The disease is non-contagious in the traditional sense, yet at the same time, unusually virulent.
I've allowed myself the conceit of calling it Burton's Syndrome.
What made this syndrome noteworthy was its sudden appearance in what appeared to be a perfectly healthy subject.
Within a matter of days, the symptoms had manifested as a number of neoplasms, exponentially multiplying and growing in size.
These, ah, tumor-like appendages eventually covered the entire body, as we can see.
Respiration became increasingly difficult.
They began to affect the internal organs - crushing the heart, constricting the lungs...
Brain activity ceased shortly thereafter.
From first symptoms to death, the entire process took little over a week.
What made this unique was that this was not an acquired disease - like a virus, but a seemingly random genetic mutation occurring in gene RIPS on chromosome twenty.
All right.
Let's take a closer look at some tissue samples...
May I sit here?
People don't want to know the way things happen.
This fish, for example - no one wants to think of it suffocating in agony.
We just want to fry it, eat it, forget.
Same with science.
People want the cure, but not the research.
It makes them uncomfortable, knowing how you got there.
What you had to do, to what.
It's true.
I would like to live a million years just to see what we evolve into.
Do we become telepathic?
Do we get wings?
I would like wings.
And you?
What would you like?
I don't know.
I'd like to be a time traveler, you know, travel through time backwards and forwards...
Chiba!
Are those incubations done yet?
Hello, I'm Jarek Novak.
Geoffrey Burton.
We actually met yesterday.
I almost liberated your mouse.
- I didn't know it was you.
- It's me.
Your lecture, I really liked it.
Great images.
Thank you.
I guess.
I was thinking maybe you'd like to look at some things I've been working on?
In kind of a similar vein, you know?
Yeah.
Why not.
- Good.
We should have a drink.
- Sure.
What about tonight?
Will you excuse me a minute?
Excuse me.
Sorry.
- No thank you.
I quit.
- You quit?
Yeah.
I guess it has been a while since I've seen you last.
Yeah, that was your choice.
I'm sorry.
You know, I...
I don't want it to be awkward.
I don't either.
You know, I have been watching you, though.
I've been watching your rise.
Read all your papers.
Very impressive.
You're the one who got Samuel to approach me, right?
You know, I...
I felt like I'd hit a wall with my research.
And, you know, I heard what you were dealing with in America, so I thought perhaps you'd like to come over.
I don't know, to be honest, I didn't expect you to say yes.
What have I said yes to?
I can show you.
- Let's go back.
- Good, cos my ass is cold.
Have a seat.
Okay, so.
Now here...
This is a typical regeneration cycle.
About ten weeks from amputation to full regeneration.
Yes?
Yes.
Okay, so now watch this one.
Did you see?
Ah, missed it.
I'll play it again.
Watch closely.
You're kidding, right?
That's not possible.
When I inserted the Easter Gene, I found it accelerated the natural regeneration capacity of the axolotls, way beyond anything I could have imagined.
But since then, I've refined the genetic code further.
Wait a minute, what 'Easter Gene'?
What are you talking about?
Look...
I labeled only the transplanted Easter Gene cells with the GFP.
They were localized in the wound area, but then they completely took over.
Look for yourself.
That's ah...
I've even had success regenerating severely damaged brain and spinal tissue.
I mean, can you imagine the possibilities for this in humans?
- Jesus Christ...
- Exactly!
Easter.
Why haven't you published this?
I dunno.
A discovery's not a cure.
Even so, I mean...
- It won't even uptake in mice.
- What happens when you try?
Nothing.
I've been stuck for six months now.
And then I thought:
if anyone could help me with the molecular mechanism, to help me activate it in mammals...
You know, I'm sorry, I've got an appointment with Samuel right now.
But what do you think about, you know, discussing this later over dinner, at my place?
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing.
I can cook something for you.
German.
- I like German.
- Don't worry. it's not a date.
Hey!
Hey...
Looks like we're having a drink tonight after all - just not together.
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I'm not going back to the guesthouse, so... it's cold, come on!
Alright...
You want to try an electrical cigarette?
Ah, no.
I've got my own.
Real cigarette.
Ah, I'm sorry, but it's a non smoking car.
Of course.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Where we going?
Oh, yeah, right.
Sorry ah...
- Pfotenhau...
Pfoten...
- Can I see it?
Ah, PfotenhauerstraBe.
Yes, I know it.
Good.
That's where we're going.
- I know you, also.
Very well.
- Yeah.
You do?
Yes.
Your science.
We're the same, both of us.
And how do you figure?
You know.
Taking risks.
Whatever it takes for a new brave world.
New Brave World?
Yeah, I haven't read that one...
I have ideas, even if I say it myself, brilliant experiments.
You could be part of them.
Well, that's a very kind offer.
But, ah, my work's kind of a full-time thing right now.
Why did we stop?
You know Mosquitos.
Bed-bugs.
Fleas.
Ticks...
They're all vectors for disease, yes?
But instead of spreading sickness, why not change the formula?
Make them carry genetically modified viruses.
Antigens to their own plague.
Imagine releasing these in the third world.
In Africa...
They're going to be bitten anyway.
So why not let them catch malaria vaccine instead?
But then first you'd have to invent the malaria vaccine, right?
- You don't think it's possible?
- I didn't say that.
- You know Stalin?
Mao Tse-tung?
- Only by reputation.
Both of them believed you could transfer ideology by breeding one indoctrinated generation to the next.
And eventually you get genetically-programmed Communists.
I mean, I know this sounds maybe a little bit crazy.
But there were some really good ideas in there.
Huh?
But look, um, what good ideas are we talking about really?
- You're not getting my point.
- What is your point?
There is the idea, and there's making people believe in the idea, and that is the key to scientific freedom.
And financing.
Exactly, and you need that freedom to be able to get the good ideas because they can come from unexpected places.
Like your son for example.
You know, I'm gonna walk from here.
Say hello to Rebekka from me!
So why didn't you call me?
I could have picked you up.
I got a lift, well, sort of a half a lift from that Jarek guy at the Institute.
What's up with that guy?
I don't have much to do with him.
Don't you get enough of these at work?
I find them beautiful.
You know, they're such strange, resourceful organisms;
there's nothing quite like them on earth...
You don't agree?
I kinda always saw them as redundant.
You know, genetic dead-ends.
But then again after what I saw today, who knows.
What about this?
They're called Wunderkammer.
What?
Wunderkammer.
They were used in the old days to display things that hadn't been classified yet.
Now I'm creating new wonders.
So you're an artist now and a scientist?
Come on, let's eat something.
- Alright, go on.
- You're not in training, so...
- Tell me.
- What?
- Tell me!
- What!
What do you think?
Tell you what?
About this Easter Gene of yours.
Why do you think I'm here?
Okay, I'll tell you everything on one condition.
- Okay.
You have to agree to work with me.
Yeah, okay, sure.
To fruitful collaborations!
Okay, that's good!
Because I need your brain.
Just my brain...
Alright, that was a little much.
You had a big impact on me, you know?
Did I?
You were this unreachable, kind of, star scientist.
Whatever.
Intelligent and inspiring and intimidating of course too sometimes.
I mean even now, what you're doing is brave I suppose.
Why is that?
- Forget about it...
- No, no, no!
Think I'm a little drunk.
You tell me.
Just...
Using your son like that.
In the lecture...
I can't imagine what that must be like.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- I didn't mean to say that.
- Yeah, you did.
Come on Geoff, I'm not criticizing you.
You know, I haven't published anything significant in four years.
'Publish or perish', remember, isn't that what we used to say?
They were forcing me out of U-Mass.
But you knew that, right?
They were cutting my funding until my lab was unworkable... waiting for me to quit.
They couldn't fire me, that would make them look bad.
You know, my boy, he was the only case.
And it killed him.
I'm just trying to find something positive out of all this.
You know, if I don't, then what's the point?
But you've made progress.
I think I should go.
You know, I'm still a little tired, jetlagged.
- Geoff...
Dinner was nice.
Yeah, I'm gonna go.
Wait...
You look nice, by the way.
See you tomorrow.
No fucking idea...
Hi, it's Sarah, I'm not available at the moment, but please leave a message.
Shit...
So, where is it?
Put it in the fridge.
She'll notice if we take any more.
She's got a whole rack of them.
Anyway, we're doing her a favor.
Her research is a dead end.
You're such a thoughtful guy.
So devoted to her...
Fuck off.
Pass me the next one.
Come on, there is no time for sleep!
Okay wait, I have some pussy remedy for you.
One for me and one for you.
Take it.
Arrgghh.
Okay.
You know, Margaret Thatcher, Iron Woman, she only sleeps four hours a night.
Huh, think about it.
None of it was beauty-sleep.
Very strong woman.
I know that.
I'm hungry.
I need to eat something.
I'm hungry.
I need to eat something.
Okay, let's make a break.
Come on.
Take it off.
You know, Margaret Thatcher, she would sleep maybe 12 years in her life.
Normal person, sleeping 25 years - you, 50.
Oww!
Son of a bitch...
- Hello...
- Hello.
What are you doing here?
Just working late.
In the mouse house?
Is that where I am?
These hallways all look the same.
Excuse me.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
He's in pain, help him.
He's in pain!
What's he doing with you?
Ah...
Shit.
I'm sorry.
- Hey, Sunny, come on.
- Excuse me, excuse me.
Do you know what an axolotl says to another axolotl?
I love your 'genes'.
Yes?
Ah, Geoffrey.
Excellent timing.
Come in, take a seat.
Geoffrey Burton, Jarek Novak.
Yes, ah, we've met.
Jarek and Rebekka made the initial breakthrough with the Easter Gene.
I presume she's filled you in by now?
Yeah...
She mentioned it.
Well, I'm sure Jarek here can bring you up to speed.
- Yes.
You're staying at the guesthouse, right?
I can just pop by when it suits you.
What is your room number?
I'll just...
I'll call you.
- You have my number?
- No.
I'm sure Samuel can help you.
Don't mind him Geoffrey.
He means well.
He just forgets, sometimes, that he's not the only horse on the track.
Yeah, but do you trust him?
I trust all my staff.
Yes?
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Bad news?
No.
Just the usual administrative headaches.
Our funders are very generous, they allow us a good deal of latitude.
But they're just so impatient.
And that's where I come in?
You're an asset to our team, Geoffrey.
You wouldn't be here if you weren't.
But, I do admit, I hope you're excited by what Jarek has to show you.
Perhaps even enough to give him the benefit of your expertise.
You see, that's where I'm still confused.
I'm sorry, but are you asking me to collaborate with both?
Jarek and Rebekka?
Well, that's up to you.
I can hardly tell you to stop your own research, after all that's why you're here.
But you must admit, this is a rather unique opportunity...
See, I was under the impression that this was Rebekka's project.
That the Easter gene was her discovery.
You know scientists.
Always bickering over who did what when.
- Yeah...
Actually Geoffrey, just between you and I, this is a bit of a tricky situation.
Rebekka has refused to collaborate with him any further.
Yeah, why is that?
I don't know.
But I can hardly throw him off the project.
So what's he working on down there?
I've got him doing some genotyping.
Tinkering away alone in the dark.
That's what suits him best...
On mice?
On Axolotls.
He does have some mice thing - his pet project.
Viral vectors and so forth.
Geoffrey, just meet with him...
I like to thaw him out sometimes.
Is there something wrong?
No.
No, I'm just trying to get my bearings, is all.
- It's easier to work with zebra fish.
- Yeah, I know.
- Hi, Sorry.
- Excuse me.
I'm just finishing up some embryos
It's so funny, I thought this morning, we're like the yin and yang of mitosis.
You work on cell proliferation out of control: cancer.
Me: on perfect cell harmony.
So what's the story with this Jarek guy?
What do you mean?
What about him?
I don't know.
He just seems kind of secretive.
Kinda weird.
I don't know.
Samuel thinks he's some kind of genius.
And with you?
What do you mean?
Were you and he ever...?
Are you joking?
Just asking.
So, what's he actually working on?
I don't know what he's working on.
He doesn't want to tell me.
To be honest I don't really care.
Something related to the Easter Gene maybe?
Shit!
Rebekka, Samuel told me.
- Told you what?
- About the Easter Gene.
It wasn't just your discovery, was it?
- It's my discovery.
- But not yours alone.
I'm not a liar, Geoff.
Look, I just want to know what you're getting me into here.
You say we're working together.
Fine.
But I don't even know whose research it is anymore.
I don't even know who's involved.
Jarek isn't involved in what I'm doing.
But you did work with him.
Only briefly, in the very early stages.
I didn't like his style.
He was too reckless.
He tried to dominate my project.
I threatened to quit if Samuel didn't take him off.
In the end I won.
According to Samuel he's still on it.
It's cosmetic.
You might want to see this.
- Where did you get this?
- I 'retrieved' it from the mouse house and I suggest you change your locks.
What do you mean?
Jarek's got a clandestine lab set up.
And I'm, yeah, I'm pretty damn sure he's trialing your Easter Gene on mice.
What do you want to do about it?
- I'll deal with it.
- How?
- I'll talk to Samuel.
- Why?
- Why don't we just confront him?
- It won't help.
It's my research, okay?
I want to deal with it my way.
You have to trust me.
Okay.
Do something, Geoff, help him.
I'll take care of it, okay?
I'll fix it.
I'm just going to take a little bit of blood...
Just a minute!
Hi.
What's with the gloves?
I'm doing some dishes.
What are you doing here?
I'm taking you to the party.
What party?
Haven't you seen the signs?
No.
It's our big annua...
- Annual.
- Annual get-together.
You have to come.
Everybody will be there.
I don't think so.
You have no choice.
You're my date.
Looks like you got started early.
Is that wrong?
No.
- You want some more?
- Bitte.
What?
You know what that means, 'bitte'?
No.
Yeah, I thought so.
So, what's up with the trench coat?
Holy shit.
It's an axolotl!
Don't you get it?
Me the axolotl woman.
Right... cos?
- It's a costume party!
- I see.
- Come on!
I have an idea for you.
- Oh God...
Come, come on.
Oh, sorry.
This is insane.
This guy's trying to steal your research.
Geoff, I, you know, I don't want to create a fuss.
Okay?
I know how to handle Jarek.
It has to be done discreetly.
Listen to me.
I know what I saw...
They were fully grown mice.
Not embryos!
Geoff.
Please.
Can you just...
Can you just leave it, just for tonight?
Please!
I want to have some fun...
feel human for a change.
Please.
Okay?
Just tonight.
One night?
Promise?
- Promise.
- Now, hold still...
One more thing.
Just wait.
What?
You know it's not Boston.
I'm not your intern anymore.
You don't have to feel guilty.
Why did you bring me here?
Hold still.
Was it for work?
Or was it to start something again?
What if I said both?
Then I'd say, it's not a very good idea.
Look, its, its not that I don't think you're attractive.
I do.
It just feels too...
Yeah, okay.
You're finished.
- Rebekka!
- Here, put that on.
I'll go warm up the car.
Hey!
Oh, there they are!
Hi!
Hey!
You look great!
Have you both met?
I dunno.
I need a drink.
Do you want anything?
They dream...
Did you know that?
When Drosophila lose contact from the ground, they fly.
It is instinct.
So, we put them in a flight simulator and blow banana wind - smell of banana - at them;
eventually they sleep from exhaustion.
Yet we still detect brain activity from olfactory bulbs, representing the pattern, reaction, to banana smell.
Which means: sleeping fruit fly dream of banana...
Are you her new boyfriend?
Think you'll get lucky tonight, huh?
You've been there before, right?
Professor's privilege...
And by the way, I want my mouse back.
- Your mouse?
- Yes, my mouse.
Give me one good reason why I just don't go to Samuel and tell him what you're up to?
- What I'm up to...?
- Yeah.
Tell me, what am I up to?
Well, I know you've stolen Rebekka's research.
And I saw your stupid lapdog break into her lab.
There is no 'her research' or 'my research', Geoff.
We're just one big organism.
Didn't Samuel tell you that?
No?
Well, you see that would make your mouse our mouse then.
And our mouse tells me that you've been trialing the Easter Gene on mammals.
And I also know that it's working.
What I don't know is how you did it.
So go on, tell me how you did it!
Come on.
I guess you'll have to wait and read my paper.
Like everybody else.
Tell me!
Do you need a doctor?
It's his own fault.
Fuck him.
Come.
Hello!
Hello!
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's going to need some serious stitches.
You okay?
He'!
-
What?
No!
No!
No!
No!
Geoff, what are you doing?
Let's make it right...
You're awake?
Your fever's gone.
You really scared me last night.
What are you doing?
It's quite a dossier you have here.
You always go through people's stuff?
If you didn't want me to see it, why's it just lying around?
You know, I saw Jarek at the club.
We had a nice little chat...
- Why?
- Why did you do that?
- Why not?
I saw him grab you.
I saw you talking to him last night after work.
That's what I thought.
So what!
What do you want me to say?
- The truth.
Okay, I had a little fling with Jarek.
So what?
it was stupid.
So stupid...
At least I knew who I was fucking.
You called me Sarah last night.
I was delirious.
What's your excuse?
Why do I need one?
Listen, I don't care if you were sleeping with some freak.
What I do care about is everything you've been telling me lately sounds like bullshit.
- Bullshit?
- Bullshit.
Okay then, let's just define 'bullshit' for a moment, shall we?
What's bullshit is that you were never going to leave her.
Despite everything you told me.
I never said anything that would make you think...
You think that didn't hurt?
I was frightened.
You know, it wasn't just some little crush on my professor...
I was scared that it could get out and my career would suffer.
That was a long time ago, you need to move on.
Get out.
Get out!
You know, you have no idea what I've had to deal with.
Oh, come on, Geoff!
Deal with!
You haven't dealt with anything.
Sarah?
Ah, she's not available right now.
Is this Geoff?
Just put my wife on, please.
She's not your wife anymore.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Yes, she does.
Every time you call you upset her.
- I'm sick of it!
- Just put her on, Ben!
Hey, who the fuck!
Oh, you fucking...
Squek...
Come on!
Answer the phone!
Where's Rebekka?
Up on the roof.
Hi...
I need your help.
Rebekka...
Please.
- What is it you want from me?
- I can't tell you here.
Here!
- I need you...
- Geoff!
- ...to do a blood test.
- Yeah, of course.
- You can run a PCR, right?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?
Help me.
Can you please just tell me what's going on?
You're scaring me!
I was bitten by a mouse!
- A lab mouse?
- Yes.
And I'm pretty sure I've contracted a virus.
That's not possible.
These are the most pathogen-free mice in the world.
Not if they belong to Jarek.
Now come on, we need a sample from you too for the negative control.
- I know how it works, Geoff.
- Then do it!
What am I supposed to be looking for?
Your Easter Gene.
Jarek's using a viral vector to integrate it into the mammal genome.
Not embryos - fully grown mice.
He scooped you on the mammals, I'm sorry he did it, but I don't know how.
What?
I'm the proof.
You know what, you're right.
Screw the test!
- Where are you going?
- Where's Jarek?
- I don't know.
- Yes you do!
- Probably in the mouse house.
- The mouse house?
- What are you doing?
- What do you think.
Please.
Let me call Samuel.
Oh, now you're gonna call him!
Call Samuel, get him to the mouse house right now.
- Let's think about this.
- I'm done thinking!
Where are you going?
Stop!
- Geoff!
- Squeak is spelt with an 'A', asshole!
- What are you doing?
- You used a viral vector.
- Get off him!
- Come on!
- It was infectious!
- What are you talking about?
You're mouse, it was infectious!
- Get this crazy asshole off me!
- Tell me!
Stop it!
Please!
I'm going to fucking kill you!
Get off me.
Jarek!
Get back!
- Jarek.
- Get back.
Jarek.
What's wrong, Jarek?
This is exactly what you wanted, wasn't it?
Get back!
What are you going to do?
I mean it.
Do it.
- Get back!
- What the hell is going on here?
He just went crazy, he was attacking us!
Don't listen to him, Samuel!
These guys infected me!
That's a lie.
He's done it to himself.
Waldemar, tell him.
- Bullshit.
- It's true.
He did.
They lured me here.
In fact you all lured me and you used the mouse to infect me and make it look unintentional.
Put that scalpel down.
Put the scalpel down!
Look at his head.
The cut.
- What cut?
- Shit.
Will someone kindly tell me what the hell this is all about?
It's healed...
It works.
It works in humans!
You fucking back off!
Alright, I see what's going on now.
I understand your little collaboration, right?
- Geoffrey...
No, I get it now.
You're in on this, too!
What is this 'infection'?
Is it viral?
Of course it's fucking viral.
The Easter Gene is an endogenous retro virus.
Even though these two geniuses couldn't work it out.
Is this true?
What the hell have you done?
What I have done?
I've just made the discovery of the century!
This is what I have done.
Me, Jarek Novak.
Remember it.
Happy Easter.
Yeah, discovery's not a cure, right?
That's what you told me.
If the healing's accelerated, so has the tumorgenesis.
What do you think I got?
A day?
Maybe two?
Is this contagious?
Ah, it's alright, Samuel.
I'm pretty god damn sure that it's blood-borne.
No, Geoff, no!
No, please!
Let me go!
Please!
No, please!
Let me go!
Please!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Let me go!
Please!
I'm not going to be anybody's specimen.
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff, please stop!
Stop please.
Geoff!
Stop!
There's nothing you can do.
Come back with me, it's your only chance.
No.
I'm going home.
Listen, I made a few changes in the sequence, but it's basically the same.
Same?
Yeah.
- The same as what?
- Burton's Syndrome.
What?
What?
I requested tissue samples when I heard about your son's condition.
My son?
Why?
Why would you do that?
I thought I could help you somehow.
I...
I don't...
You know, when I started cloning the gene,
I discovered it could regenerate dying cells.
I mean the tumors are actually a symptom of cell regeneration.
It's regeneration out of control.
That's what happened to your son.
I wanted you here to share it.
To show it to you, to make you part of it...
I mean, you are part of it.
I wanted to tell you.
I just...
I was waiting for the right time.
What took you so long, huh?
I was afraid to tell you.
I didn't know how you'd react or...
I'm sorry, I went too far with it.
I'm...
Why?
Because...
Why?
Because I love you, Geoff.
Don't you see that?
I love you.
You love me.
I'm so sorry...
- No, it's fine...
- I never meant for this to happen.
I have my own disease.
You know how funny that is?
I have my own disease.
It was just research to help you.
'Research'...
That's exactly what I would say to Sarah.
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff, where are you going?
Geoff!
Yeah.
That's alright!
You're drooling again!
Son of a...
Bitch.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hey!
Oh...
Okay...
Please open the door.
Please come out.
Have you got a ticket?
Ticket?
Ticket?
You speak English?
Do you speak English?
Hey!
Stop!
Please stop.
Please stop!
Hi, ifs Sarah, I'm not available at the moment.
Please leave a message after the beep.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I loved him so much.
And it was just hard...
I did love him, I really did.
I really did.
Where is she?
Yeah?
Where is she?
Geoffrey.
You're awake.
Well, at least you've got your own room.
No, no.
No, don't do that.
You've been very restless these past few days.
But don't you worry.
Everything is being thoroughly investigated.
Geoffrey.
You have been very ill, but you're all better now.
Your recovery has been remarkable...
Inspirational, in fact.
Do you remember anything?
Where is she?
She's right here.
Look.
No.
Sarah.
Listen, old chap.
We're going to have to keep you in here for a bit.
You're unique, you see?
But just at the moment, you're a bit of a danger to yourself.
But don't worry.
You'll be all right.
Hey...
You were really sick, but you're good now.
You're immune.
Look at this.
Do you see that?
Jarek was right.
Burton's Syndrome is actually a dormant retrovirus.
We all have it, it's millions of years old.
Only that your son had a very special version of it.
And now you.
You're a miracle.
And your son was a miracle.
Why didn't your son recover?
Excuse me, I need to take some blood.
How was I supposed to know?
Wake up.
Wake up.
Hello.
Is this geoff?
Yeah.
This is samuel, here.
We were expecting you this morning.
Oh, samuel, uh...
I completely passed out.
Okay.
We'll see you soon.
Geoff burton for samuel mead, please.
Injecting room here, got your stereo microscope...
Quarantine room for incoming animals...
Microscope room with confocal imaging station.
All the usual stuff.
Spinning disc confocal...
Two photon confocals...
Upright confocals with dipping lenses...
All the laser lines you could wish for...
Anything to make science beautiful.
We've got a cold room.
We've got a microbial culture room
The auto glazer, downstairs.
Um, there's an elevator?
How's your accommodation, geoffrey?
Oh, fine, fine.
I was just wondering where my office
Is gonna be.
Oh, we don't really do offices, per se.
We're more communal than that.
Of course, we can loan you a lab
For the duration of a given project.
Right.
Look who I've found...
- Dr. Burton.
- Dr. Fiedler.
Rebekka's come a long way
Since she was interned with you.
Yes, so I hear.
I'm sorry, I can't leave this right now.
We'll catch up later.
Great.
- Shall we continue?
- Yes.
That way.
Now, there's something else we need to do.
Sorry, I didn't...
Erm...
Anyway...
Let's get your security pass sorted out.
Son of a bitch.
Oh, geoff...
How are you?
I'm fine.
You?
Hmm...
I'm good.
Setting up the new research lab.
Uh, the one in munich, right?
Uh, no.
Dresden, remember?
You must be happy.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's...
It's nothing.
- Forget about it.
- Hey, babe.
I'm home.
Hold on for a second.
So, uh...
What's up?
I heard about your news.
When were you planning to tell me?
I was going to tell you.
I really was...
I'm in my second month and I...
I wasn't quite sure, and...
I didn't tell anyone else.
Well, joe and carla knew.
Oh.
No, that was...
That was ben.
Right...
Ben.
He was excited about the baby
So he jus-just told them, you know?
You're angry.
No...
Of course...
I'm not angry.
I'm just...
I dunno, I gotta think about it.
Think about what?
Well what do you want me to say?
Congratulations?
Maybe you could be happy for me.
What do you want?
Why did you call me?
I don't know why I called.
I miss you.
I have to go.
Geoffrey burton comes to us from umass,
Where his research into the early detection
Of embryonic abnormalities...
One of the more, uh, furiously debated topics
Of the scientific community this decade.
Now, I don't need to tell you
What the implications of this are...
The proverbial cure for cancer
Has always eluded us.
The potential of prenatal discovery
Certainly brings the possibility a few steps closer.
To continue his research in a rather less politicized environment.
And he's going to speak to us all this morning...
About the state of his work to date.
When you're ready.
Thank you.
Would you now all please join me
In welcoming...
Geoffrey burton.
Thank you.
Thank you, samuel.
I never intended to become a geneticist.
My ph.D. Was actually on bacterial biochemistry.
But, as I'm sure many of you know
I was drawn to this by my experience
With my own son...
To focus my research on screening embryos
For traces of rare genetic mutations.
Such as his.
I want to make one thing very clear:
I'm not trying to develop new techniques
To prescreen people with brown eyes or dark skin...
Or freckles.
I like freckles.
Diversity...
One of the things
Which defines us as a species
Is to be celebrated.
Mutations...
Which endanger human life...
Are not.
For example...
Here we see the subject
In the earliest stages...
The disease is non-contagious
In the traditional sense.
Yet, at the same time, unusually virulent.
I've allowed myself the conceit of calling it...
Burton syndrome.
What made this syndrome noteworthy
Was its sudden appearance
In what appeared to be a perfectly healthy subject.
Within a matter of days, the...
Symptoms had manifested
As a number of neoplasms...
Exponentially multiplying and growing in size.
These, uh...
Tumor-like appendages
Eventually cover the entire body,
As we can see.
Respiration became increasingly difficult...
Began to affect internal organs...
Crushing the heart...
Constricting the lungs.
Brain activity ceased shortly thereafter.
From first symptoms to death,
The entire process took little over a week.
What made this unique was that this was not
An acquired disease like a virus,
But a seemingly...
Random genetic mutation...
Occurring in the gene rip-5 on chromosome 20.
Alright.
Let's take a closer look at some tissue samples.
May I sit here?
People don't want to know
The way things happen.
This fish, for example...
No one wants to think of it...
Suffocating...
In agony.
We just want to fry it...
Eat it...
Forget.
Same with science.
People want the cure...
But not the research.
It makes them uncomfortable,
Knowing how you got there,
What you had to do.
To what...
It's true.
I would like to live a million years...
Just to see what we evolve into.
Do we become telepathic?
Do we get wings?
I would like wings.
And you...
What would you like?
I don't know, uh...
I can be a time traveler.
You know, travel through time,
Backwards and forwards...
Chiba...
I don't think your patent's done yet.
Hello.
I'm jarek novak.
Geoffrey burton.
We actually met yesterday.
I almost...
Liberated your mouse.
- I didn't know it was you.
- It's me.
Your lecture, I really like it.
Great images.
Thank you...
I guess.
I was thinking...
Maybe you would like to have a look
At some things I've been working on.
We kind of, similar vein, you know?
Yeah?
Why not?
Good.
We should have a drink.
- Sure.
- What about tonight?
Excuse me a minute.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
No, thank you.
I quit.
- You quit?
- Yeah.
I guess it has been a while
Since I've seen you last.
Yeah, that was your choice.
I'm sorry.
You know, I...
I don't want it to be awkward.
I don't, either.
You know, I have been watching you, though.
You know, I've been watching you rise.
Read all your papers.
Very impressive.
You're the one who got samuel
To approach me, right?
You know, I...
I felt like I'd hit a wall
With my research, and...
You know I-I heard what you were dealing with
In america, so...
I thought, perhaps, you'd like to come over.
I, uh...
I don't know, I...
To be honest, I didn't expect you to say yes.
What have I said "yes" to?
I can show you.
Let's go back.
Good, 'cause my ass is cold.
Have a seat.
Okay...
So...
Now, here...
Okay, this is a typical regeneration cycle,
About ten weeks from amputation to full regeneration.
Yes?
Yes.
Okay, so now...
Watch this one.
Did you see?
Uh...
Missed it.
I'll play it again.
Watch closely.
You're kidding, right?
That's not possible.
When I inserted the easter gene,
I found it accelerated the natural regeneration capacity
Of the axolotls way beyond anything
I could have imagined.
But, since then, I've refined
The genetic code further.
Just...
Wait a minute.
What easter gene?
What are you talking about?
Look.
I labeled only the transplanted
Easter gene cells...
With a gfp.
They were localized in the wound area,
But then they completely took over.
Look for yourself.
That's, uh...
I've even had success regenerating severely damage
Brain and spinal tissue.
I mean, can you imagine the possibilities
For this in humans?
Jesus christ...
Exactly...
Easter.
Why haven't you published this?
I don't know.
A discovery is not a cure.
Even so, I mean...
It won't even uptake in mice.
What happens when you try?
Nothing.
I've been stuck for six month, now.
And then, I thought, if anybody could help me
With the molecular mechanism...
To help me activate it in mammals...
Hmm...
You know, I'm sorry, I've got an appointment
With samuel right now, but what do you think
About, you know, discussing this later,
Over dinner?
- Yep.
- At my place?
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing.
Hm.
I can cook something for you.
- German?
- I like german.
Don't worry.
It's not a date.
Hey!
Hey...
Looks like we are having a drink tonight, after all.
It is not together.
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I'm not going back to the guest house, so...
It's cold.
Come on.
Alright.
Want to try electrical cigarette?
Uh, no.
I've got my own.
Real cigarette.
Ah...
I'm sorry, but, uh...
It's a non-smoking car.
Of course.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Where are we going?
Oh, right...
Sorry, uh...
Uh..
Fodenhau...
Foten...
Can I see it?
Ah, pfotenhauerstrasse...
Yes.
I know it.
Good.
That's where we're going.
I know you, also...
- ...
Very well.
- Yeah, you do?
- Yes, the science.
- Hmm.
We are the same, both of us.
How do you figure?
You know...
Taking risks, whatever it takes.
A new, brave world.
Yeah, I haven't read that one.
I have ideas.
You have saved myself, uh, brilliant experiments.
You could be part of them.
Well, that's a very kind offer,
My work's kind of a full time thing right now
Why'd we stop?
You know mosquitos, bed bugs, fleas, ticks...
They're all vectors for disease, yes?
But instead of spreading sickness,
Why not change the formula?
Make them carry genetically modified viruses...
Antigenes for their own plague.
Imagine releasing this in the third world...
In africa.
Hm?
They're going to be bitten, anyway.
So why not let them catch...
Malaria vaccine, instead?
But then, first you would have to...
Invent the malaria vaccine, right?
You don't think it's possible?
I didn't say that.
You know stalin, mao tse-tung...?
Both of them believed you could transfer ideology
By breeding one indoctrinated generation to the next.
And, eventually, you would get
Genetically programmed communists.
I mean, I know this sounds maybe a little...
Crazy...
But...
There were some really good ideas in there.
But, look, uh...
What good ideas are we talking about, really?
- You're not getting my point.
- What is your point?
There is the idea...
And there is making people believe in the idea.
And that is the key to scientific freedom.
And financing.
Exactly.
And you need that freedom
To be able to get the good ideas.
Because they can come from unexpected places.
Like your son, for example.
You know...
I'm gonna walk from here.
Say hello to rebekka from me.
So why didn't you call me?
I could have picked you up.
I got a lift.
Well, sort of...
Half a lift.
From that jarek guy at the institute.
What's up with that guy?
I don't have much to do with him.
Oh.
Don't you get enough of these at work?
I find them beautiful.
You know, they are such strange and resourceful organisms.
There is nothing quite like them on earth.
Mm-hmm.
You don't agree?
I kinda always saw them as redundant.
You know, genetic dead ends.
But, then again, after what I saw today...
Who knows?
What about this?
They're called wunderkammer.
What?
Wunderkammer.
To display things that hadn't been classified yet.
I'm creating new wonders.
So you're an artist, now, and a scientist.
Come on, let's eat something.
- Alright, go on.
- You're not in training, so...
- Tell me.
- What?
Tell me.
- What?
- What do you think?
Tell you what?
About this easter gene of yours.
Why do you think I'm here?
I'll tell you everything, on one condition.
Okay.
You have to agree to work with me.
Yeah, okay.
Sure.
To fruitful collaborations.
- Okay, that's good...
- Okay.
Because I need your brain.
Just my brain.
Alright, a little much...
You had a big impact on me, you know...
Did I?
You were this unreachable...
Kind of...
Star scientist...
Whatever.
Intelligent and...
Inspiring, and...
Intimidating, of course, too, sometimes.
- Hmm.
- I mean, even now...
What you're doing, it's...
Brave, I suppose.
Why is that?
- Forget about it.
- No, no, no, no...
I think I'm a little drunk.
You tell me.
Just...
Using your son like that...
In the lecture...
I can't imagine what that must be like.
I'm sorry.
- That's alright.
- I didn't mean to say that.
Yeah you did.
Come on, geoff.
I'm not criticizing you.
You know I haven't published
Anything significant in four years?
Publish or perish, remember?
Isn't that what we used to say?
They were forcing me out of umass.
But you knew that, right?
They were cutting my funding
Until my lab was unworkable...
Waiting for me to quit.
They couldn't fire me.
That would make them look bad.
You know, my boy...
He was the only case.
And it killed him.
I'm just trying to find something positive
Out of all this.
You know if...
I don't, then...
What's the point?
But you've made progress.
I think I should go.
- I'm still a little tired, jet lagged...
- Geoff...
Dinner was nice.
I'm gonna go.
Wait...
You look nice, by the way.
See you tomorrow.
No fucking idea... hi, it's sarah.
I am not available
At the moment, please leave a mess...
Scheisse.
[Shit]
Where is it?
Put it in the fridge.
She will notice if we take anymore.
She's got a whole rack of them.
Anyway, we are doing her a favor.
Her research is a dead end.
You're such a thoughtful guy...
- So devoted to her...
- Fuck off.
Pass me the next one.
Come on, it is not time for sleep.
Okay, wait.
I have some pussy remedy for you.
One for me...
And one for you.
Take it.
Aaaaaaah...
Okay.
You know margaret thatcher...
Our woman?
She only sleep four hours a night
Huh?
Think about it.
None of it was beauty sleep.
Very strong woman.
I know that.
I'm hungry.
I need to eat something.
I'm hungry, I need to eat something.
Okay.
Let's take a break, come on.
Take it off.
You know, margaret thatcher sleep, uh..
Maybe 12 years in her life.
Normal person...
Sleeping... 25 years.
You... 50.
Ow!
Son of a bitch.
- Hello.
- Hello.
What are you doing here?
Just working late.
In the mouse house...
Is that where I am?
These hallways all look the same.
Excuse me.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
He's in pain.
Do something.
Help him.
He's in pain...
What's he doing with you?
Come on...
Uh...
Ah, shit.
I'm sorry.
Okay...
Excuse me...
I love your genes.
Yes.
Oh, geoffrey...
Excellent timing.
Come in.
Take a seat.
Geoffrey burton...
Jarek novak.
Yes.
We've, uh, met.
Jarek and rebekka made the initial breakthrough
With the easter gene.
I presume she's filled you in by now.
Yeah, she mentioned it.
I'm sure jarek, here, can bring you up to speed.
Yes.
You're staying at the guest house, right?
Mm-hmm.
I can just pop by when it suits you.
What is your room number?
Oh, well, just...
I'll call you.
- You have my number?
- No.
I'm sure someone can help you.
He means well, he just forgets, sometimes,
He's not the only horse on the track.
Yeah, but do you trust him?
I trust all my staff.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Danke.
[Thank you]
Danke schön.
[Thank you very much]
- Bad news?
- Hmm?
Just the usual administrative headaches.
Our funders are very generous,
They allow us a good deal of latitude...
But they're just so impatient.
And that's where I come in?
You're an asset to our team, geoffrey.
You wouldn't be here if you weren't.
But I do admit, I hope you're excited
About what jarek has to show you...
Perhaps even enough to give him the benefit
You see, that's where I'm still confused.
I'm sorry, but...
Are you asking me to collaborate
With both jarek and rebekka?
Well, that's up to you.
I can hardly tell you to stop your own research,
After all, I mean...
That's why you're here.
But you must admit,
This is a rather unique opportunity.
See, I was under the impression
That this was rebekka's project,
That the easter gene was...
Her discovery.
- Always bickering over who did what, and when - yeah...
Actually, geoffrey...
Just between you and I...
This is a bit of a tricky situation.
Rebekka has refused to collaborate with him any further.
Yeah?
Why is that?
I don't know, but I can hardly
Throw him off the project.
So what's he working on down there?
I've got him doing some genotyping...
Tinkering away, alone in the dark.
It's what suits him best.
On mice.
On axolotls.
He does have some...
Mice thing...
His pet project...
Viral vectors, and so forth.
Geoffrey...
Meet with him.
I like to thaw him out, sometimes.
Is there something wrong?
No, no...
I'm just...
Trying to get my bearings, is all.
Excuse me.
I'm just finishing up some embryos.
It's so funny, I thought this morning
We are like the yin and yang of mitosis.
You work on cell proliferation out of control, cancer...
Me, on perfect cell harmony.
So what's the story with that jarek guy?
What do you mean?
What about him?
I don't know.
Just seems kinda secretive.
It's kinda weird.
I don't know, samuel thinks he's some kind of genius.
And with you?
What do you mean?
Were you and he ever, uh...
Are you joking?
Just asking.
So what's he actually working on?
I don't know what he's working on.
He doesn't want to tell me.
To be honest, I don't really care.
Something related to the easter gene, maybe.
Scheisse.
[Shit]
Rebekka, samuel told me.
- Told you what?
- About the easter gene...
It wasn't just your discovery, was it?
- It's my discovery.
- But not yours, alone.
I'm not a liar, geoff.
Look, I just want to know
What you're getting me into, here.
You say we're working together, fine...
But I don't even know whose...
Research it is, anymore.
I-I don't even know who's involved.
Jarek isn't involved in what I'm doing.
- You did work with him.
- Only briefly...
In the very early stages.
I didn't like his style.
He was too reckless.
He tried to dominate my project.
I threatened to quit
If samuel didn't take him off.
In the end, I won.
Well, according to samuel, he's still on it.
It's cosmetic.
You might want to see this.
- Where did you get this?
- I retrieved it...
From the mouse house, and I suggest you change your locks.
Jarek's got a clandestine lab set up, and I'm...
Yeah, I'm pretty damn sure he's trialling your easter gene
On mice.
What do you want to do about it?
- I'll deal with it.
- How?
- I'll talk to samuel.
- Why?
Why don't we...
- ...
Just confront...
- It won't help.
It's my research, okay?
I want to deal with it my way.
You have to trust me.
Okay.
Do something, geoff.
Help him.
I'll take care of it, okay?
I'll fix it.
I'm gonna take just a little bit of blood.
Just a minute.
Hi.
What's with the glove?
I, um...
Just doing some dishes.
So...
What are you doing here?
I'm taking you to the party.
- Haven't you seen the signs?
- No.
It's our big...
Anyal...
- "Annual." - ...
Annual get-together.
You have to come.
Everybody will be there.
I don't think so.
You have no choice...
You're my date.
Woop!
Looks like you got started early.
Is that wrong?
No.
- You want some more?
- Bitte. [Please]
What?
You know what that means, "bitte?" [Please]
- No.
- Yeah, I thought so.
So what's up with the trench coat?
Holy shit.
It's an axolotl!
Don't you get it?
Me, the axolotl woman...
Woo.
- right, 'cause...
- It's a costume party!
- I see.
Aww, come on...
- ...
I have an idea for you.
- Oh, god.
Come.
Come on.
Ooh!
I'm sorry!
This is insane.
This guy's trying to steal your...
Geoff, you know, I don't want
To create a fuss, okay?
I know how to handle jarek.
It has to be done discreetly.
Uh huh.
Listen to me, I know what I saw.
They were fully grown mice, not embryos.
Geoff, please, can you just...
Can you just leave it?
Just for tonight, please?
I-I...
I want to have some fun,
Feel human for a change, please.
Okay?
Just tonight.
One night?
Promise?
Promise.
Now, hold still.
One more thing...
Just, wait...
What?
You know, it's not boston.
I'm not your intern, anymore.
You don't have to feel guilty.
Why did you bring me here?
Hm?
Hold still.
Was it for work, or was it to start something again?
What if I said both?
Then I'd say it's not a very good idea.
It's not that I don't think you're attractive;
I do.
It just feels too...
Yeah, okay.
- You're finished.
- What?
- Rebekka...
- Here, put that on.
I'll go warm up the car.
Hey.
Oh, there they are.
Hey, woo!
Hey!
Have you both met?
I need a drink.
Do you want anything?
Thanks.
They dream.
Did you know that?
When drosophila lose contact from the ground...
They fly!
It is instinct.
So we put them in a flight simulator...
And blow banana wind...
Smell of banana!
Eventually, they sleep from exhaustion,
Yet we still detect brain activity
From olfactory bulbs...
Representing the patterned reaction
To banana smell!
Which means...
Sleeping fruit fly dream of banana!
Are you her new boyfriend?
Think you will get lucky tonight, huh?
You've been there before, right?
Professor's privilege?
By the way...
I want my mouse back.
Your mouse?
Yes.
My mouse.
Give me one good reason
Why I wouldn't just go to samuel
And tell him what you're up to.
What I'm up to?
Tell me.
What am I up to?
Well, I know you've stolen rebekka's research.
I saw your stupid lap dog break into the lab.
There is no "her research" and "my research."
We are just one big organism.
Did someone tell you that?
No?
Well, you see, that would...
Make "your mouse" "our mouse," then.
And our mouse tells me...
You've been trialling the easter gene on animals.
I also know it's working.
What I don't know, is...
How you did it.
So, go on.
Tell me how you did it.
I guess you will have to wait and read my paper.
Like everybody else.
Stop!
Stop it!
You want doctor?
It's his own fault.
Fuck him.
Come.
Hello.
I'm sorry.
It's going to need some serious stitches.
You okay?
Hey...
What?
No.
No.
Geoff, what are you doing?
Let's make it right.
You're awake.
Oh, your fever is gone.
You really scared me last night.
What are you doing?
It's quite the dossier, here.
You always go through people's stuff?
You didn't want me to see it, why is it just lying around?
You know, I saw jarek at the club.
We had a nice little chat.
Why?
Why did you do that?
Why not?
I saw him grab you, I saw you...
Talkin' to him last night, after work.
That's what I thought.
So, what...
...What do you want me to say?
How about the truth?
Okay, I had a little fling with jarek.
So what?
It was stupid.
So stupid.
At least I knew who I was fucking.
You called me sarah last night.
I was delirious.
What's your excuse?
Why do I need one?
Listen, I don't care if you were...
Sleeping with some freak...
What I do care about is that
Everything you've been telling me lately
Sounds like bullshit.
Okay, then let's just define bullshit for a moment, shall we?
What's bullshit is...
That you were never going to leave her,
Despite everything you told me.
I never said anything that would make you...
You think that didn't hurt?
I was frightened.
You know, it wasn't just a little crush on my professor.
I was scared that it could get out, and...
My career would suffer.
That was a long time ago.
You need to move on.
Get out.
Get out!
You know...
You have no idea...
What I've had to deal with.
Oh, come on, geoff...
Deal with?
You haven't dealt with anything.
Uh, she's not available right now.
- Is this geoff?
- Just put my wife on, please.
She's not your wife, anymore.
And she doesn't want to talk to you.
Yes...
She does.
Every time you call, you upset her.
- I'm sick of it.
- Just put her on, ben.
Hey, who the fuck...
Oh, you fucking...
Fucker.
"squek"
Come on.
Answer the phone.
Where's rebekka?
Up on the roof.
Hi.
I need your help.
Rebekka, please...
What is it you want from me?
I can't tell you here.
Here.
- I need you...
- What's that?
- ...
To do a blood test.
- Yeah, of course.
- You can run a pcr, right?
- Yeah.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Can you please just tell me what's going on?
- You're scaring me.
- I was bitten by a mouse.
- A...
A lab mouse?
- Yes.
And I'm pretty sure I contracted a virus.
That's not possible.
These are the most pathogen-free mice
In the world.
Not if they belong to jarek.
We need a sample from you, too, for the negative.
- I know how it works, geoff.
- Then do it!
What am I supposed to be looking for?
Your easter gene!
Jarek's using a viral vector to integrate it
Into the mammal genome.
Not embryos...
Fully grown mice.
He scooped you on the mammals.
I'm sorry, he did it.
But I don't know how.
What?
I'm the proof.
You know what, you're right.
Screw the test.
- Where are you going?
- Where's jarek?
I don't know...
Yes, you do.
Probably the mouse house.
Mouse house?
What are you doing?
What do you think?
Please...
Let me call samuel.
Oh, now you're gonna call.
Call samuel, and get him to the mouse house, right now.
Let's think about this.
- I'm done thinking.
- Where're you going?
Stop!
Stop!
"squeak" is spelled with an "a," asshole!
For your survival...
Get the hell out of here!
It was infectious.
What are you talking about?
Your mice!
It was infectious!
Get this crazy ass off of me!
Tell me!
Stop it, please!
Stop it!
Jarek!
Get back!
- Jarek...
- Get back.
Jarek...
What's wrong, jarek?
This is exactly what you wanted, wasn't it?
Huh?
Get back!
What're you gonna do?
I mean it.
Do it.
Get back!
What the hell is going on here?
He just went crazy!
He was attacking us.
Don't listen to him, samuel.
These guys infected me.
That is a lie.
He's done it to himself.
- Waldemar, tell him.
- Bullshit.
It's true...
- ...
He did.
- Bullshit.
They lured me here.
In fact...
You all lured me
He used the mouse to infect me.
It made it look unintentional.
Put the scalpel down.
Put the scalpel...
Down.
Look at his head.
The cut...
- What cut?
- Shit...
Will someone kindly tell me what the hell this is all about?
It's healed.
It works!
It works in humans!
You fucking back off.
Alright, I see what's going on now.
I understand your little collaboration, right?
- Geoffrey...
- No, I get it now.
You're in on this, too.
What is this infection?
- Is it viral?
- Of course, it's fucking viral.
The easter gene is endogenous retrovirus.
Even though these two geniuses couldn't work it out.
This is true.
What the hell have you done?
What I have done?
I have just made the discovery of the century!
This is what I have done!
Me, jarek novak!
Remember it.
Happy easter.
Discovery is not a cure, right?
That's what you told me.
If the healing has accelerated...
So has the tumorigenesis.
What do you think I got?
A day?
Maybe two?
Is this contagious?
Ah, it's alright, Samuel
Pretty goddamn sure that it's blood-borne.
No!
Nooo!
No, please!
Stop, let me help him!
Please!
Please, let me help!
No, please!
Please!
Please!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Please...
Oh, please!
Let me go!
Please, please let me go, please!
Please!
Geoff...
Geoff!
Geoff.
Geoff, please stop.
Stop, please.
Geoff.
Stop!
There's nothing you can do.
Come back with me.
It's your only chance.
No.
I'm going home.
Listen, I...
I made a few...
Changes in the sequence, but, it's...
It's basically the same.
- Same?
- Yeah.
The same as what?
Burton's syndrome.
What?
I...
I requested tissue samples
When I heard about your son's condition.
My son?
Why?
Why would you do that?
I...
I thought I...
Could help you, somehow.
I...
I don't...
You know, when I started cloning the gene, I...
I discovered it could regenerate
Dying cells.
I mean...
The tumors are actually the symptom
Of cell regeneration.
It's regeneration, out of control.
That's what happened to your son.
I wanted you here to share it...
To show it to you, to...
Make you part of it.
I mean, you were a part of it.
I wanted to tell you, I just...
I was waiting for the right time.
What took you so long, huh?
I was afraid to tell you.
I didn't know...
How you'd react, or...
I'm sorry, I...
I went too far with it...
- Why?
Why?
!
- Because...
Because I love you, geoff!
Don't you see that?
I love you!
You love me?
I am so sorry, I...
- No, it's fine.
- ...
I never meant...
For this to happen, I...
I have my own disease.
You know how funny that is?
I have my own disease.
It was just research...
To help you.
Research...
That's exactly what I would say to sarah.
Geoff.
Geoff!
Geoff!
Geoff, where are you going?
!
Geoff!
Hey!
Hey...
Hey!
Oh...
Okay...
Ticket?
Ticket?
Speak english.
Do you speak english?
Hey, hey, hey...
Halt!
Please, stop!
Hi, it's sarah.
I am not available at the moment.
Please leave a message after the beep.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
And it was just so hard...
I really did...
Why...?
Where is she?
- Yeah?
- Where is she?
Geoffrey...
You're awake.
Well, at least you got your own room.
No...
No, no.
Don't do that.
You've been very...
Restless, these past few days.
But don't you worry.
Everything is being thoroughly investigated.
Geoffrey...
You have been very ill.
But, you're all better now.
Your recovery has been remarkable...
Inspirational, in fact.
Do you remember anything?
Where is she?
She's right here.
Look...
No...
Sarah...
Listen, old chap...
We're gonna have to keep you in here, for a bit.
You're unique, you see...
But just for the moment, you're a bit of a danger to yourself.
Now, don't worry...
You'll be alright.
Hey, you.
You were really sick...
But you're good now.
You're immune.
Look at this.
Do you see that?
Jarek was right.
Burton syndrome is actually a dormant retrovirus.
We all have it.
It's millions of years old.
Only that your son had a very special version of it...
Now you.
You're a miracle.
And your son was a miracle.
Why didn't your son recover?
How was I supposed to know?
Shit...
Yes?
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Shit!
Yeah.
That's alright!
You're drooling again!
Son of a...
Bitch.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Oh...
Okay...
Please open the door.
Please come out.
Have you got a ticket?
Stop!
Please stop.
Excuse me, I need to take some blood.
~ Errors of the Human Body (2012) ~
Wake up.
Wake up.
Hello.
Is this Geoff?
Yeah.
This is Samuel, here.
We were expecting you this morning.
Oh, Samuel, uh I completely passed out.
Okay.
We'll see you soon.
Geoff Burton for Samuel Mead, please.
Injecting room here, got your stereo microscope Quarantine room for incoming animals Microscope room with confocal imaging station.
All the usual stuff.
Spinning disc confocal Two photon confocals Upright confocals with dipping lenses...
All the laser lines you could wish for Anything to make science beautiful.
We've got a cold room.
We've got a microbial culture room.
...The auto glazer, downstairs.
Um, there's an elevator?
How's your accommodation, Geoffrey?
Oh, fine, fine.
I was just wondering where my office is gonna be.
Oh, we don't really do offices, per se.
We're more communal than that.
Of course, we can loan you a lab for the duration of a given project.
Right.
Look who I've found...
- Dr. Burton.
- Dr. Fiedler.
Rebekka's come a long way since she was interned with you.
Yes, so I hear.
I'm sorry, I can't leave this right now.
We'll catch up later.
Great.
- Shall we continue?
- Yes.
That way.
Now, there's something else we need to do.
Sorry, I didn't...
Erm...
Anyway Let's get your security pass sorted out.
Son of a bitch.
Oh, Geoff...
How are you?
I'm fine.
You?
Hmm...
I'm good.
...Setting up the new research lab.
Uh, the one in Munich, right?
Uh, no.
Dresden, remember?
You must be happy.
What's that supposed to mean?
It's... it's nothing.
- Forget about it.
- Hey, babe.
I'm home.
Hold on for a second.
So, uh... what's up?
I heard about your news.
When were you planning to tell me?
I was going to tell you.
I really was...
I'm in my second month and I I wasn't quite sure, and I didn't tell anyone else.
Well, Joe and Carla knew.
Oh.
No, that was...
that was Ben.
Right...
Ben.
He was excited about the baby so he jus-just told them, you know?
You're angry.
No...
Of course...
I'm not angry.
I'm just I dunno, I gotta think about it.
Think about what?
Well what do you want me to say?
Congratulations?
...Maybe you could be happy for me.
What do you want?
Why did you call me?
I don't know why I called.
I miss you.
I have to go.
Geoffrey Burton comes to us from UMass, [University of Massachusetts in Amherst, MA] where his research into the early detection of embryonic abnormalities... has certainly proved to be one of the more, uh, furiously debated topics
of the scientific community this decade.
Now, I don't need to tell you what the implications of this are The proverbial cure for cancer has always eluded us.
The potential of prenatal discovery certainly brings the possibility a few steps closer.
To continue his research in a rather less politicized environment.
And he's going to speak to us all this morning about the state of his work to date.
When you're ready.
Thank you.
Would you now all please join me in welcoming Geoffrey Burton.
Thank you.
Thank you, Samuel.
I never intended to become a geneticist.
My Ph.D. Was actually on bacterial biochemistry.
But, as I'm sure many of you know
I was drawn to this by my experience with my own son...
His condition led me to focus my research on screening embryos for traces of rare genetic mutations.
...such as his.
I want to make one thing very clear:
This is not eugenic [offsprings selection].
I'm not trying to develop new techniques to prescreen people with brown eyes or dark skin or freckles.
I like freckles.
Diversity...
One of the things which defines us as a species is to be celebrated.
Mutations which endanger human life... are not.
For example... here we see the subject in the earliest stages The disease is non-contagious in the traditional sense.
Yet, at the same time, unusually virulent.
I've allowed myself the conceit of calling it Burton syndrome.
[A fictional disease]
What made this syndrome noteworthy was its sudden appearance in what appeared to be a perfectly healthy subject.
Within a matter of days, the symptoms had manifested as a number of neoplasms Exponentially multiplying and growing in size.
These, uh tumor-like appendages eventually cover the entire body,
As we can see.
Respiration became increasingly difficult Began to affect internal organs Crushing the heart Constricting the lungs.
Brain activity ceased shortly thereafter.
From first symptoms to death, the entire process took little over a week.
What made this unique was that this was not an acquired disease like a virus, but a seemingly random genetic mutation occurring in the gene R.I.P. 5 on chromosome 20.
[RIP5 is a fictional easter gene] [An easter gene is used for "regeneration/rebirth"]
Alright.
Let's take a closer look at some tissue samples.
May I sit here?
People don't want to know the way things happen.
This fish, for example...
No one wants to think of it... suffocating... in agony.
We just want to fry it,... eat it,... forget.
Same with science.
People want the cure but not the research.
It makes them uncomfortable, knowing how you got there, what you had to do, to what...
It's true.
I would like to live a million years just to see what we evolve into.
Do we become telepathic?
Do we get wings?
I would like wings.
And you, what would you like?
I don't know, uh it would be a time traveler.
Travel through time, backwards and forwards...
Chiba I don't think your patent's done yet.
Hello.
I'm Jarek Novak.
Geoffrey Burton.
We actually met yesterday.
I almost liberated your mouse.
- I didn't know it was you.
- It's me.
Your lecture, I really like it.
Great images.
Thank you...
I guess.
I was thinking maybe you would like to have a look
At some things I've been working on.
We kind of, similar vein, you know?
Yeah?
Why not?
Good.
We should have a drink.
- Sure.
- What about tonight?
Excuse me a minute.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
No, thank you.
I quit.
- You quit?
- Yeah.
I guess it has been a while
Since I've seen you last.
Yeah, that was your choice.
I'm sorry.
You know, I I don't want it to be awkward.
I don't, either.
You know, I have been watching you, though.
You know, I've been watching you rise.
Read all your papers.
Very impressive.
You're the one who got Samuel to approach me, right?
You know, I I felt like I'd hit a wall with my research, and You know I-I heard what you were dealing with in America, so...
I thought, perhaps, you'd like to come over.
I, uh...
I don't know, I...
To be honest, I didn't expect you to say "yes".
What have I said "yes" to?
I can show you.
Let's go back.
Good, 'cause my ass is cold.
Have a seat.
Okay...
So...
Now, here...
[Axolotl, not a fish but an amphibian,...] [commonly called "walking fish"...]
Okay, this is a typical regeneration cycle.
About ten weeks from amputation to full regeneration.
Yes?
Yes.
Okay, so now watch this one.
[Axolotls have the ability to regenerate lost body parts,] [thus, extensively scientifically studied.]
Did you see?
Uh... missed it.
I'll play it again.
Watch closely.
[Regenerated in Hours instead of Weeks]
You're kidding, right?
That's not possible.
When I inserted the easter gene,
I found it accelerated the natural regeneration capacity of the axolotls way beyond anything
I could have imagined.
But, since then, I've refined the genetic code further.
Just... wait a minute.
What easter gene?
[Gene sequence that promotes "regeneration/rebirth"]
What are you talking about?
[Gene sequence that promotes "regeneration/rebirth"]
[Gene sequence that promotes "regeneration/rebirth"]
Look.
[Axolotls have the ability to regenerate lost body parts]
I labeled only the transplanted [Axolotls have the ability to regenerate lost body parts] easter gene cells...
[Axolotls have the ability to regenerate lost body parts] ...with a GFP.
[Green Fluorescent Protein, used as a "reporter"]
They were localized in the wound area, but then they completely took over.
Look for yourself.
That's, uh...
Are we going to have success regenerating severely damage brain and spinal tissue.
I mean, can you imagine the possibilities for this in humans?
Jesus Christ...
[Ref.
J.C.'s day of resurrection...]
Exactly...
Easter.
[... is known as Easter.]
Why haven't you published this?
I don't know.
A discovery is not a cure.
Even so, I mean...
It won't even uptake in mice.
What happens when you try?
Nothing.
I've been stuck for six month, now.
And then, I thought, if anybody could help me with the molecular mechanism to help me activate it in mammals...
Hmm...
You know, I'm sorry, I've got an appointment with Samuel right now, but what do you think about... you know, discussing this later, over dinner?
- Yep.
- At my place?
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing.
Hm.
I can cook something for you.
- German?
- I like German.
Don't worry.
It's not a date.
Hey!
Hey...
Looks like we are having a drink tonight, after all.
It is not together.
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I'm not going back to the guest house, so...
It's cold.
Come on.
Alright.
Want to try electrical cigarette?
Uh, no.
I've got my own.
...Real cigarette.
Ah...
I'm sorry, but, uh It's a non-smoking car.
Of course.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Where are we going?
Oh, right...
Sorry, uh...
Uh..
Fodenhau...
Foten...
Can I see it?
Ah, Pfotenhauerstrasse...
[Trivia:
A street along the Dresden University of Technology (TUD)] ...Yes.
[Trivia:
A street along the Dresden University of Technology (TUD)]
I know it.
Good.
That's where we're going.
I know you, also...
- ...
Very well.
- Yeah, you do?
- Yes, the science.
- Hmm.
We are the same, both of us.
How do you figure?
You know Taking risks, whatever it takes.
A new, brave world.
Yeah, I haven't read that one.
I have ideas.
You have saved myself, uh, brilliant experiments.
You could be part of them.
Well, that's a very kind offer, ...My work's kind of a full time thing right now.
Why'd we stop?
You know mosquitos, bed bugs, fleas, ticks They're all vectors for disease, yes?
But instead of spreading sickness, why not change the formula?
Make them carry genetically modified viruses Antigenes for their own plague.
Imagine releasing this in the third world In Africa.
Hm?
They're going to be bitten, anyway.
So why not let them catch malaria vaccine, instead?
[A parasitic disease]
But then, first you would have to invent the malaria vaccine, right?
You don't think it's possible?
I didn't say that.
You know Stalin, Mao Tse-Tung...?
[Rulers/dictators of Communist Soviet Union and China]
Only by reputation.
[Rulers/dictators of Communist Soviet Union and China]
Both of them believed you could transfer ideology
By breeding one indoctrinated generation to the next.
And, eventually, you would get genetically programmed communists.
I mean, I know this sounds maybe a little... crazy...
But there were some really good ideas in there.
But, look, uh what good ideas are we talking about, really?
- You're not getting my point.
- What is your point?
There is the idea and there is making people believe in the idea.
And that is the key to scientific freedom.
...And financing.
Exactly.
And you need that freedom to be able to get the good ideas.
Because they can come from unexpected places.
Like your son, for example.
You know I'm gonna walk from here.
Say hello to Rebekka from me.
So why didn't you call me?
I could have picked you up.
I got a lift.
Well, sort of...
half a lift, ...from that Jarek guy at the institute.
What's up with that guy?
I don't have much to do with him.
Oh.
Don't you get enough of these at work?
I find them beautiful.
You know, they are such strange and resourceful organisms.
There is nothing quite like them on earth.
Mm-hmm.
You don't agree?
I kinda always saw them as redundant.
You know, genetic dead ends.
But, then again, after what I saw today who knows?
What about this?
They're called wunderkammer.
["wonder-room"]
What?
Wunderkammer.
[Cabinet of Wonder]
Wunderkammer...
They were used in the old days to display things that hadn't been classified yet.
I'm creating new wonders.
So you're an artist now, and a scientist.
Come on, let's eat something.
- Alright, go on.
- You're not in training, so...
- Tell me.
- What?
Tell me.
- What?
- What do you think?
Tell you what?
About this easter gene of yours.
Why do you think I'm here?
I'll tell you everything, on one condition.
Okay.
You have to agree to work with me.
Yeah, okay.
Sure.
To fruitful collaborations.
- Okay, that's good...
- Okay.
...because I need your brain.
Just my brain.
Alright, a little much...
You had a big impact on me, you know...
Did I?
You were this unreachable... kind of... star scientist Whatever.
Intelligent and inspiring, and intimidating, of course, too, sometimes.
- Hmm.
- I mean, even now what you're doing, it's brave, I suppose.
Why is that?
- Forget about it.
- No, no, no, no...
I think I'm a little drunk.
You tell me.
Just... using your son like that... in the lecture...
I can't imagine what that must be like.
I'm sorry.
- That's alright.
- I didn't mean to say that.
Yeah you did.
Come on, Geoff.
I'm not criticizing you.
You know I haven't published anything significant in 4 years?
Publish or perish, remember?
Isn't that what we used to say?
They were forcing me out of UMass.
But you knew that, right?
They were cutting my funding until my lab was unworkable Waiting for me to quit.
They couldn't fire me.
That would make them look bad.
You know, my boy he was the only case.
And it killed him.
I'm just trying to find something positive out of all this.
You know if I don't, then what's the point?
But you've made progress.
I think I should go.
- I'm still a little tired, jet lagged...
- Geoff...
Dinner was nice.
I'm gonna go.
Wait...
You look nice, by the way.
See you tomorrow.
No fucking idea...
Hi, it's Sarah.
I am not available at the moment, please leave a mess...
Scheisse.
[Shit. (German)]
Where is it?
Put it in the fridge.
She will notice if we take anymore.
She's got a whole rack of them.
Anyway, we are doing her a favor.
Her research is a dead end.
You're such a thoughtful guy...
- So devoted to her...
- Fuck off.
Pass me the next one.
Come on, it is not time for sleep.
Okay, wait.
I have some pussy remedy for you.
One for me and one for you.
Take it.
Aaaaaaah...
Okay.
You know Margaret Thatcher...
[The "Iron Lady, as UK Prime Minister from 1972-1990] ...our woman?
[The "Iron Lady, as UK Prime Minister from 1972-1990]
She only sleep 4 hours a night.
[The "Iron Lady, as UK Prime Minister from 1972-1990]
Huh?
Think about it.
None of it was beauty sleep.
Very strong woman.
I know that.
I'm hungry.
I need to eat something.
I'm hungry, I need to eat something.
Okay.
Let's take a break, come on.
Take it off.
You know, Margaret Thatcher sleep, uh..
...maybe 12 years in her life.
Normal person... sleeping 25 years.
You... 50.
Ow!
Son of a bitch.
- Hello.
- Hello.
What are you doing here?
Just working late.
In the mouse house...
Is that where I am?
These hallways all look the same.
Excuse me.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
He's in pain.
Do something.
Help him.
He's in pain...
What's he doing with you?
Come on...
Uh...
Ah, shit.
I'm sorry.
Okay...
Excuse me I love your genes.
Yes.
Oh, Geoffrey Excellent timing.
Come in.
Take a seat.
Geoffrey Burton Jarek Novak.
Yes.
We've, uh, met.
Jarek and Rebekka made the initial breakthrough with the easter gene.
I presume she's filled you in by now.
Yeah, she mentioned it.
I'm sure Jarek here, can bring you up to speed.
Yes.
You're staying at the guest house, right?
Mm-hmm.
I can just pop by when it suits you.
What is your room number?
Oh, well, just...
I'll call you.
- You have my number?
- No.
I'm sure someone can help you.
Don't mind him Geoff.
He means well, he just forgets, sometimes, he's not the only horse on the track.
Yeah, but do you trust him?
I trust all my staff.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Danke (in German).
[Thank you.]
Danke schön (in German).
[Thank you very much.]
- Bad news?
- Hmm?
Just the usual administrative headaches.
Our funders are very generous, they allow us a good deal of latitude but they're just so impatient.
And that's where I come in?
You're an asset to our team, Geoffrey.
You wouldn't be here if you weren't.
But I do admit, I hope you're excited about what Jarek has to show you Perhaps even enough to give him the benefit of your expertise.
You see, that's where I'm still confused.
I'm sorry, but... are you asking me to collaborate with both Jarek and Rebekka?
Well, that's up to you.
I can hardly tell you to stop your own research,
After all, I mean...
that's why you're here.
But you must admit, this is a rather unique opportunity.
See, I was under the impression that this was Rebekka's project.
That the easter gene was...
her discovery.
You scientists, always bickering over who did what, and when - yeah...
Actually, Geoffrey Just between you and I this is a bit of a tricky situation.
Rebekka has refused to collaborate with him any further.
Yeah?
Why is that?
I don't know, but I can hardly throw him off the project.
So what's he working on down there?
I've got him doing some genotyping...
[Differentiaing genetic make-ups] ...tinkering away alone in the dark.
It's what suits him best.
On mice.
On axolotls.
He does have some...
mice thing his pet project viral vectors, and so forth.
Geoffrey meet with him.
I like to thaw him out, sometimes.
Is there something wrong?
No, no...
I'm just trying to get my bearings, is all.
Excuse me.
I'm just finishing up some embryos.
[Note the "Thank You" card from Geoff to Beka]
[An axolotl]
It's so funny, I thought this morning we are like the Yin Yang of mitosis.
[Mitosis:
Cell replication via separation]
You work on cell proliferation out of control, cancer...
Me, on perfect cell harmony.
So what's the story with that Jarek guy?
What do you mean?
What about him?
I don't know.
Just seems kinda secretive.
It's kinda weird.
I don't know, Samuel thinks he's some kind of genius.
And with you?
What do you mean?
Were you and he ever, uh...
Are you joking?
Just asking.
So what's he actually working on?
I don't know what he's working on.
He doesn't want to tell me.
To be honest, I don't really care.
Something related to the easter gene, maybe.
Scheisse.
[Shit. (German)]
Rebekka, Samuel told me.
- Told you what?
- About the easter gene It wasn't just your discovery, was it?
- It's my discovery.
- But not yours, alone.
I'm not a liar, Geoff.
Look, I just want to know what you're getting me into, here.
You say we're working together, fine But I don't even know whose research it is, anymore.
I-I don't even know who's involved.
Jarek isn't involved in what I'm doing.
- You did work with him.
- Only briefly in the very early stages.
I didn't like his style.
He was too reckless.
He tried to dominate my project.
I threatened to quit if Samuel didn't take him off.
In the end, I won.
Well, according to Samuel, he's still on it.
It's cosmetic.
You might want to see this.
- Where did you get this?
- I retrieved it... ..from the mouse house, and I suggest you change your locks.
Jarek's got a clandestine lab set up, and I'm Yeah, I'm pretty damn sure he's trialling your easter gene on mice.
What do you want to do about it?
- I'll deal with it.
- How?
- I'll talk to Samuel.
- Why?
Why don't we...
- ...just confront...
- It won't help.
It's my research, okay?
I want to deal with it my way.
You have to trust me.
Okay.
Do something, Geoff.
Help him.
I'll take care of it, okay?
I'll fix it.
I'm gonna take just a little bit of blood.
Just a minute.
Hi.
What's with the glove?
I, um just doing some dishes.
So...
what are you doing here?
I'm taking you to the party.
- Haven't you seen the signs?
- No.
It's our big...
Anyal...
- "Annual." - ...
Annual get-together.
You have to come.
Everybody will be there.
I don't think so.
You have no choice You're my date.
Woop!
Looks like you got started early.
Is that wrong?
No.
- You want some more?
- Bitte.
What?
You know what that means, "bitte"?
- No.
- Yeah, I thought so.
[ "bitte" (German) ] [ "please" (English) ]
So what's up with the trench coat?
Holy shit.
It's an axolotl!
Don't you get it?
Me, the axolotl woman...
Woo.
- Right, 'cause...
- It's a costume party!
- I see.
Aww, come on...
- ...
I have an idea for you.
- Oh, god.
Come.
Come on.
Ooh!
I'm sorry!
This is insane.
This guy's trying to steal your...
Geoff, you know, I don't want
To create a fuss, okay?
I know how to handle Jarek.
It has to be done discreetly.
Uh huh.
Listen to me, I know what I saw.
They were fully grown mice, not embryos.
Geoff, please, can you just Can you just leave it?
Just for tonight, please?
I-I...
I want to have some fun.
Feel human for a change, please.
Okay?
Just tonight.
One night?
Promise?
Promise.
Now, hold still.
One more thing...
Just, wait...
What?
You know, it's not Boston.
I'm not your intern, anymore.
You don't have to feel guilty.
Why did you bring me here?
Hm?
Hold still.
Was it for work, or was it to start something again?
What if I said both?
Then I'd say it's not a very good idea.
It's not that I don't think you're attractive;
I do.
It just feels too...
Yeah, okay.
- You're finished.
- What?
- Rebekka...
- Here, put that on.
I'll warm the car.
Hey.
Oh, there they are.
Hey, woo!
Hey!
Have you both met?
I need a drink.
Do you want anything?
Thanks.
They dream.
Did you know that?
When drosophila [fruit fly] lose contact from the ground they fly!
It is instinct.
So we put them in a flight simulator and blow banana wind Smell of banana!
Eventually, they sleep from exhaustion.
Yet we still detect brain activity from olfactory bulbs Representing the patterned reaction to banana smell!
Which means sleeping fruit fly dream of banana!
Are you her new boyfriend?
Think you will get lucky tonight, huh?
You've been there before, right?
Professor's privilege?
By the way I want my mouse back.
"Your" mouse?
Yes. "My" mouse.
Give me one good reason
Why I wouldn't just go to Samuel and tell him what you're up to.
What I'm up to?
Tell me.
What am I up to?
Well, I know you've stolen Rebekka's research.
I saw your stupid lap dog break into the lab.
There is no "her research" or "my research."
We are just one big organism.
Did someone tell you that?
No?
Well, you see, that would make "your mouse" "our mouse", then.
And our mouse tells me that you've been trialling the easter gene on animals.
I also know it's working.
What I don't know, is how you did it.
So, go on.
Tell me how you did it.
I guess you will have to wait and read my paper.
...like everybody else.
Stop!
Stop it!
You want doctor?
It's his own fault.
Fuck him.
Come.
Hello.
I'm sorry.
It's going to need some serious stitches.
You okay?
Hey What?
No.
No.
Geoff, what are you doing?
Let's make it right.
You're awake.
Oh, your fever is gone.
You really scared me last night.
What are you doing?
It's quite the dossier, here.
You always go through people's stuff?
You didn't want me to see it, why is it just lying around?
You know, I saw Jarek at the club.
We had a nice little chat.
Why?
Why did you do that?
Why not?
I saw him grab you, I saw you talkin' to him last night, after work.
That's what I thought.
So, what...
...What do you want me to say?
How about the truth?
Okay, I had a little fling with Jarek.
So what?
It was stupid.
So stupid.
At least I knew who I was fucking.
You called me Sarah last night.
I was delirious.
What's your excuse?
Why do I need one?
Listen, I don't care if you were sleeping with some freak What I do care about is that everything you've been telling me lately sounds like bullshit.
- Bullshit?
- Bullshit.
Okay, then let's just define bullshit for a moment, shall we?
What's bullshit is that you were never going to leave her, despite everything you told me.
I never said anything that would make you...
You think that didn't hurt?
I was frightened.
You know, it wasn't just a little crush on my professor.
I was scared that it could get out, and my career would suffer.
That was a long time ago.
You need to move on.
Get out.
Get out!
You know...
You have no idea what I've had to deal with.
Oh, come on, Geoff Deal with?
You haven't dealt with anything.
- Sarah?
- No, she's not available right now.
- Is this Geoff?
- Just put my wife on, please.
She's not your wife, anymore.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Yes... she does.
Every time you call, you upset her.
- I'm sick of it.
- Just put her on, Ben.
Hey, who the fuck...
Oh, you fucking...
Fucker.
["Squek", misspell of "Squeak"]
"Squek"
Come on.
Answer the phone.
Where's Rebekka?
Up on the roof.
Hi.
I need your help.
Rebekka, please...
What is it you want from me?
I can't tell you here.
Here.
- I need you...
- What's that?
- ...
To do a blood test.
- Yeah, of course.
- You can run a PCR, right?
- Yeah.
[PCR:
Polymerase Chain Reaction]
[Also known as "molecular photocopying"]
[Is to "copy/amplify" small segments of DNA]
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Help me.
Can you please just tell me what's going on?
- You're scaring me.
- I was bitten by a mouse.
- A...
A lab mouse?
- Yes.
And I'm pretty sure I contracted a virus.
That's not possible.
These are the most pathogen-free mice in the world.
Not if they belong to Jarek.
We need a sample from you, too, for the negative.
- I know how it works, Geoff.
- Then do it!
What am I supposed to be looking for?
Your easter gene!
Jarek's using a viral vector to integrate it into the mammal genome.
[The full DNA sequence of an organism]
Not embryos Fully grown mice.
He scooped you on the mammals.
I'm sorry, he did it.
But I don't know how.
What?
I'm the proof.
You know what, you're right.
Screw the test.
- Where are you going?
- Where's Jarek?
I don't know...
Yes, you do.
Probably the mouse house.
Mouse house?
What are you doing?
What do you think?
Please Let me call Samuel.
Oh, now you're gonna call.
Call Samuel, and get him to the mouse house, right now.
Let's think about this.
- I'm done thinking.
- Where're you going?
Stop!
Stop!
"Squeak" is spelled with an "a", asshole!
For your survival Get the hell out of here!
It was infectious.
What are you talking about?
Your mice!
It was infectious!
Get this crazy ass off of me!
Tell me!
Stop it, please!
Stop it!
Jarek!
Get back!
- Jarek...
- Get back.
Jarek...
What's wrong, Jarek?
This is exactly what you wanted, wasn't it?
Huh?
Get back!
What're you gonna do?
I mean it.
Do it.
Get back!
What the hell is going on here?
He just went crazy!
He was attacking us.
Don't listen to him, Samuel.
These guys infected me.
That is a lie.
He's done it to himself.
- Waldemar, tell him.
- Bullshit.
It's true...
- ...
He did.
- Bullshit.
They lured me here.
In fact You all lured me
He used the mouse to infect me.
It made it look unintentional.
Put the scalpel down.
Put the scalpel Down.
Look at his head.
The cut...
- What cut?
- Shit...
Will someone kindly tell me what the hell this is all about?
It's healed.
It works!
It works in humans!
You fucking back off.
Alright, I see what's going on now.
I understand your little collaboration, right?
- Geoffrey...
- No, I get it now.
You're in on this, too.
What is this infection?
- Is it viral?
- Of course, it's fucking viral.
The easter gene is endogenous retrovirus.
[ERV:
DNA sequence derived from viruses...] [that replicate in a host cell]
Even though these two geniuses couldn't work it out.
This is true.
What the hell have you done?
What I have done?
I have just made the discovery of the century!
This is what I have done!
Me, Jarek Novak!
Remember it.
Happy easter.
Discovery is not a cure, right?
That's what you told me.
If the healing has accelerated So has the tumorigenesis.
What do you think I got?
A day?
Maybe two?
Is this contagious?
Ah, it's alright, Samuel
Pretty goddamn sure that it's blood-borne.
No!
N-o-o-o!
No, please!
Stop, let me help him!
Please!
Please, let me help!
No, please!
Please!
Please!
Geoff!
Geoff!
Please...
Oh, please!
Let me go!
Please, please, let me go, please!
Please!
Geoff...
Geoff!
Geoff.
Geoff, please stop.
Stop, please.
Geoff.
Stop!
There's nothing you can do.
Come back with me.
It's your only chance.
No.
I'm going home.
Listen, I...
I made a few changes in the sequence, but, it's it's basically the same.
- Same?
- Yeah.
The same as what?
Burton's syndrome.
What?
I I requested tissue samples when I heard about your son's condition.
My son?
Why?
Why would you do that?
I I thought I Could help you, somehow.
I I don't...
You know, when I started cloning the gene, I I discovered it could regenerate dying cells.
I mean the tumors are actually the symptom of cell regeneration.
It's regeneration, out of control.
That's what happened to your son.
I wanted you here to share it to show it to you, to make you part of it.
I mean, you were a part of it.
I wanted to tell you, I just I was waiting for the right time.
What took you so long, huh?
I was afraid to tell you.
I didn't know how you'd react, or...
I'm sorry, I I went too far with it...
- Why?
Why?
!
- Because Because I love you, Geoff!
Don't you see that?
I love you!
You love me?
I am so sorry, I...
- No, it's fine.
- ...
I never meant for this to happen, I...
I have my own disease.
You know how funny that is?
I have my own disease.
It was just research to help you.
Research That's exactly what I would say to Sarah.
Geoff.

Why...?
Where is she?
- Yeah?
- Where is she?
Geoffrey You're awake.
Well, at least you got your own room.
No No, no.
Don't do that.
You've been very restless, these past few days.
But don't you worry.
Everything is being thoroughly investigated.
Geoffrey You have been very ill.
But, you're all better now.
Your recovery has been remarkable Inspirational, in fact.
Do you remember anything?
Where is she?
She's right here.
Look...
No...
Sarah...
Listen, old chap We're gonna have to keep you in here, for a bit.
You're unique, you see But just for the moment, you're a bit of a danger to yourself.
Now, don't worry You'll be alright.
Hey, you.
You were really sick But you're good now.
You're immune.
Look at this.
Do you see that?
Jarek was right.
Burton syndrome is actually a dormant retrovirus.
[Retrovirus:
Viruses that insert...]
We all have it.
[... a DNA copy of their genome into the host cell...]
It's millions of years old.
[... in order to replicate.]
Only that your son had a very special version of it and now you.
You're a miracle.
And your son was a miracle.
Why didn't your son recover?

Geoffrey Burton comes from the University of Massachusetts, where his research on early detection
Embryonic abnormalities It has certainly proved to be one of the, uh, the most hotly debated furiously scientific community in this decade.
Now, I need not tell you what are the implications of this are The proverbial cure for cancer always eluded us.
Prenatal discovery potential certainly provides the opportunity for a few steps closer.
And Geoffrey has been to continue his research in a much less politicized.
And he will talk to all of us this morning On the status of their work to date.
When ready.
Thank you.
Would you now everyone please join me to welcome Geoffrey Burton.
[Applause]
Thank you.
Thanks, Samuel.
I never intended to become a geneticist.
My PhD was actually in bacterial biochemistry.
But, as I'm sure many of you know
I was drawn to this by my experience with my own son Whose condition led me focus my research on screening embryos traces of rare genetic mutations.
... Like yours.
I want to make one thing very clear:
This is not eugenics.
I'm trying to develop new techniques prescreen people with brown eyes and dark skin Or freckles.
I like freckles.
Diversity ...
One of the things defines us as a species be held.
Mutations That endanger human life ... are not.
For example ...
Here we see the theme in the early stages The disease is not contagious in the traditional sense.
However, while unusually virulent.
I allowed the presumption to call Burton syndrome.
What it did highlight this syndrome was his sudden appearance in what seemed to be a perfect health issue.
Within days, the Symptoms had expressed as a number of neoplasias Exponentially multiplying and growing in size.
These, uh Tumors like appendages eventually cover the entire body, as we can see.
The breathing became increasingly difficult Began to affect the internal organs Crush the heart Constriction of the lungs.
Brain activity ceased shortly thereafter.
[Cough]
From the first symptoms to death, the whole process took just over a week.
What made this unique was that it was not an acquired condition as a virus, but apparently Random genetic mutation Occurring in the RIP-5 gene on chromosome 20.
[Steps resonate]
[Door creaks]
Very well.
Let's take a closer look at some samples of tissue.
[Metal Clang]

I can sit here?
People do not want to know the way things happen.
This fish, for example Nobody wants to think about it Suffocating In agony.
We just want to fry Eat Forget.
Same with science.
People want the cure But research.
It makes them feel uncomfortable, know how it got there, what you had to do.
For what ...
It is true.
I like to live a million years Just to see what we evolved on.
Do we become telepathic?
Do we have wings?
I like wings.
And you What would you like?
I do not know, uh That I can be a time traveler.
You know, travel through time, backwards and forwards ...

Hello.
I Jarek Novak.
Geoffrey Burton.
We actually met yesterday.
Almost Freed mouse.
- I did not know it was you.
- Me.
His lecture, I really like.
Great images.
Thank you ...
I suppose.
I was thinking Perhaps you would like to have a look some things I've been working.
It's like, the same line, you know?
Yes?
Why not?
Good.
We must have a drink.
- Sure.
- How about tonight?
Excuse me a moment.
Excuse me.
Sorry.

You know, I. ..
... I do not want to be uncomfortable.
Not, either.

You know, I've been looking lift.
Read all the papers.
Very impressive.
You are the one with Samuel approach me, right?
You know, I. ..
[Clears throat] ... I felt like I had hit a wall with my research, and You know II found out what I was dealing with in the U.S., so ...
I thought maybe you'd come.
I, uh ...
I do not know, I. ..
To be honest, I expected you to say yes.
What I have said "yes" to?
I can show you.

Pay special attention.
[Tap tap]
It's a joke, right?
That's not possible.
By inserting the gene for Easter
I found accelerate the natural regeneration capacity salamanders road beyond
That could have imagined.
But since then, I have refined further genetic code.
Just ...
Wait a minute.
What Easter gene?
What are you talking about?
Look.
I labeled only transplanted
Easter cells genes A GFP.
They were localized to the area of ?
the wound, but then took over completely.
Look for yourself.

No.
A discovery is not a cure.
Even so, I mean ...
It will not match the absorption in mice.
What happens when you try?
Nothing.
I've been stuck for six months now.
And then I thought, if someone could help me with the molecular mechanism Help me turn in mammals ...
Hmm ...
You know, I'm sorry, I have an appointment with Samuel at this time, but what do you think about, you know, discussing this afternoon, during dinner?
- Yep.
- In my house?
- What are you doing tonight?
- Nothing.
Hm.
I can cook something for you.
- German?
- I like the German.
Do not worry.
Not a date.
[Jingle]
[Dog barking]
[Ding] Hey!
Hey ...
Looks like we'll have a drink tonight, after all.
Not together.
[Beeps and boops]
[Beating]
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I'm not going back to the guest house, so ...
It's cold.
Come on.
Very well.
[Ballad of metal?

Want to try electric cigarette?
Uh, no.
I have mine.
... Real cigarette.
Ah ...
Sorry, but It is a non-smoking car.
Of course.
Sorry.
All right.
Where are we going?
Oh, right ...
Sorry, uh ...
Eh ..
[Fights pronounce] Fodenhau ...
Foten ...
I can see it?
Ah, Pfotenhauerstrasse Yes.
I know that.
Good.
That's where we go.
I know, too ...
- ...
Very well.
- Yes, you do?
- Yes, science.
- Hmm.
We are the same, the two.
How do you know?
You know Taking risks, whatever it takes.
A brave new world.
A brave new world ...
Yes, I have read that.
I have ideas.
You have saved me, uh, brilliant experiments.
You can be part of them.
Well, that's a very kind offer, but A bit of my work a full time thing at this time
Why are we stopping?
You know mosquitoes, bedbugs, fleas, ticks They are all vectors of the disease, right?
But instead of spreading the disease,
Why not change the formula?
Do genetically modified virus carrying Antigens for their own plague.
Imagine releasing this in the third world In Africa.
Hm?
They're going to be bitten, anyway.
Why not let the trap Malaria vaccine instead?
But then, would first have to Inventing the malaria vaccine, right?
Do not you think it's possible?
I did not say that.
You know Stalin, Mao Tse-tung ...?
Only by reputation.
Both believed they could transfer the ideology by breeding a generation indoctrinated to the next.
And finally, you get to genetically programmed Communists.
I mean, I know this sounds maybe a little ... crazy But There were some very good ideas there.
[Vocal inquisitive] [laughter]
[Clears throat]
But, look, uh What good ideas we're talking about, really?
- You're not getting my point.
- What is your point?
It is the idea And not making people believe in the idea.
Uh huh.
And that is the key to scientific freedom.
... And funding.
Exactly.
And it is necessary for freedom order to get good ideas.
Mm-hmm.
Because they can come from the most unexpected places.
Like his son, for example.
[Starting on]
You know ...

I have a lift.
Well, sort of ...
Half a lift.
... Jarek such in high school.
What about this guy?
I have not much to do with it.
Oh.
[Jingle]
Do not you get enough of them at work?
I look beautiful.
You know, are these foreign organisms and witty.
Nothing like them on Earth.
Mm-hmm.
Do not agree?
I saw so always redundant.
You know, the genetic dead ends.
But again, after what I saw today Who knows?
What's this?

What?
Wunderkammer.
[Repeat quietly] Wunderkammer ...
They were used in the old days to show things that had not been classified yet.
I'm creating new wonders.
So you're an artist, now, and a scientist.
Come on, let's eat something.
- All right, go ahead.
- You are not in training, so ...
- Tell me.
- What?
Tell me.
- What?
- What do you think?
Tell her what?
About this Easter gene yours.
Why do you think I'm here?
Mm-kay.
I'll tell you everything, with one condition.
Okay.
You must agree to work with me.
Yes, okay.
Sure.
[Tan] for fruitful collaborations.
- Okay, okay ...
- Agreed.
... Because I need your brain. [Jingle]
Only my brain.
[Sigh]
Okay, a little more ...
You had a great impact on me, you know?
...
Have I?
You were unattainable Sort of Star Scientist Anything.
Smart and Inspiring, and Intimidating, of course, also sometimes.
- Hmm.
- I mean, even now What you're doing is Brave, I guess.
Why is that?
- Forget about it.
- No, no, no, no ...
I think I'm a little drunk.
You tell me.
[Sigh] Just Using your child that The conference I can not imagine what it must be.
Sorry.
- That's fine.
- I did not say that.
Yes you did.
Come on, Geoff.
I'm not criticizing.
You know I have not posted nothing significant in four years?
Publish or perish, remember?
Is not what it used to mean?
They were forcing me out of UMass.
But you knew that, right?
They were cutting my funds to my laboratory was impossible Waiting to resign.
They could not shoot.
That would be bad.
You know, my son He was the only case.
And killed him.
I'm just trying to find something positive out of it.
You know if I do not, then What's the point?
But you have made progress.
I think you should go.
- I'm still a little tired, jet lag ...

Jarek ...
Novak.

We, uh, met.
Jarek and Rebekka made the initial discovery with the gene of Easter.
I guess you have filled by now.
Yes, she said.
I'm sure Jarek, here, you can bring up to speed.
Yes.
You're staying in the guest house, right?
Mm-hmm.
Just pop in when it suits you.
What is your room number?
Oh, well, just ...
I'll call you.
- You have my number?
- No.

And that's where I come in?
You are an asset to our team, Geoffrey.
I would not be here if it was.
But I admit, I hope you're excited
Jarek it has to show Maybe even enough to give him the benefit of their experience.
See, that's where I'm still confused.
Sorry, but ... [Babbling]
Are you asking me to collaborate with both Jarek and Rebekka?
Well, that depends on you.
I can not tell you to stop your own research, after all, I mean ...
That's why we're here.
But you must admit,
This is a unique and singular.
Look, I had the impression that this was the draft Rebekka,
Easter the gene was ... its discovery.
Scientists know ...
- ...
Always arguing about who did what and when
- If ...
[Giggle]
[Sigh]
Actually, Geoffrey Between you and me ..
... This is a bit of a difficult situation.
Rebekka has refused to cooperate with him further.
Yes?
Why is that?
I do not know, but I can not cast him out of the project.
So what are you working down there?
I have what some genotyping ago Retouching away, alone in the dark.
It's what suits you.
In mice.
The axolotl.
He has a bit of ...
The mice His favorite project ...
Viral vectors, ... and so on.

Geoffrey Meet with him.
I like to thaw, sometimes.
Is there something wrong?
No, no ...
I'm Trying to get my bearings, is all.

I'm finishing some embryos.
[Sigh] [giggle]
It's so funny, I thought this morning we are like the yin and yang of mitosis.

So what is the story of that kind Jarek?
What do you mean?
What about him?
No.
It just seems a bit reserved.
It's a little weird.
I do not know, Samuel thinks it's some kind of genius.
And you?
What do you mean?
You and always was, uh ...
Are you kidding?
Just asking.
[Tease]
So what is really working?
I do not know what he is working.
Will not tell me.
To be honest, I really do not care.
Something to do with the gene for Easter, maybe.
Scheisse.
Rebekka, Samuel said.
- I told you?
- The Easter gene It was not just his discovery, right?
- This is my discovery.
- But not yours alone.
I'm not a liar, Geoff.
Look, I just want to know what you're getting into, here.
You say that we are working together, well But I do not even know who Research is more.
II do not even know who is involved.
Jarek is not involved in what I'm doing.
- You've done the work with him.
- Only a short In the early stages.
I do not like his style.
He was too reckless.
Tried to master my project.
He threatened to quit if Samuel did not take off.
In the end, I won.
Well, according to Samuel, who is still in it.
Is cosmetics.
You might want to see this.
- Where did you get that?
- I recovered In the house mouse, and I suggest you change the locks.
What do you mean?
Jarek has a clandestine laboratory setting, and I Yeah, I'm pretty damn sure you're testing the gene Easter in mice.
What do you do?
- I'll take care of it.
- What?
- I'll talk to Samuel.
- Why?
Why not ...
- ...
Just face ...
- It will not help.
Is my research, right?
I want to try it my way.
You have to trust me.

These are most pathogen free mice worldwide.
Not if they belong to Jarek.
We need a sample of that, too, in the negative.
- I know how it works, Geoff.
- Then do it!
What am I supposed to be looking?
Its gene Easter!
Jarek is using a viral vector to integrate in the mammalian genome.
No embryos Fully grown mice.
He took of mammals.
Sorry, I did.
I do not know how.
What?
[RIP]
I'm proof.
You know, you're right.

- Of course it is viral fucking.
The gene is endogenous retrovirus Easter.
Although these two geniuses could not fix.
[Mocking sniff]
This is true.
What the hell have you done?
What I have done?
I just made the discovery of the century!
This is what I've done!
I, Jarek Novak!
Remember that.
Happy Easter.
[Exhale]
Discovery is not a cure, right?
That's what you told me.
If healing has accelerated It has done tumorigenesis.

GRACE:
Previously on The Secret Life of the American Teenager...
If Amy and Ricky got married,
I am really going to be upset with you.
Why?
Why me?
Be upset with them if you want to be upset with anyone.
It's just that I'm not ready to go back to my house and confront everyone.
Part of the reason I wanted to elope was because I'm tired of everyone being involved in our business.
They were roasting marshmallows over a Bunsen burner.
What?
And an hour later, boom, the lab blows up and the school burns down.
I can't keep dating Jack to get information.
I don't love him.
I don't love him at all.
Is Amy okay?
I think maybe she and Ricky eloped last night.
...to talk.
Ben!
Ben!
You think you're going to hell because we kissed?
Is that why you're a Christian again?
That might have something to do with it.
Ashley, do you remember that cooking school you applied to in Italy?
Yeah?
No!
You got accepted.
No, you can't go to Italy.
You don't have any money.
And you're not giving her any.
We got married.
BOY:
Ricky on a stick?
Ricky on a stick?
Ricky on a stick.
Ricky on a stick.
Ricky on a stick?
Rick on a stick?
Ricky on a stick?
Rick on a stick?
Ricky on a stick?
Rick on a stick?
Ricky on a stick.
I'm so happy for you and Ricky and John!
Congratulations, Mrs. Underwood!
Thank you.
Um, it's not that big of a deal though.
We were living together, you know.
Hi, Amy!
Congratulations.
I wanted to give you this gift from me.
It's the book on which your vows are based.
Thanks, Grace.
I just thought you should have it, 'cause you know it is the foundation for a good marriage.
Very nice.
Amy!
Amy!
Wait up!
We heard the good news!
You got married!
Finally, huh?
Yeah, finally.
Um, I guess that's for me?
Who do you think it's for?
Yeah, well, thanks.
That's a very large wedding cake.
My mom insisted on making it, she owns a bakery, you know.
Yeah, I know.
And how sweet of her.
And how sweet of the two of you to bring it in for me.
I really didn't know anything about it.
Hey, how are you?
I heard you were in the hospital.
How am I?
Who cares how I am?
If you had cared how I am, you would have called me to tell me that you got married yourself.
So, I guess...
Good luck to you.
Have a nice life.
You keep the top layer and then freeze it.
Yeah.
Ben, are you all right?
Ricky on a stick?
No.
I'm not.
Do you need to talk to Alice?
No, I don't need to talk to Alice!
He's kind of having an anxiety attack.
But it has nothing to do with you.
Congratulations!
Ben!
Wait!
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
I heard there's going to be some kind of low class flash mob.
Yeah.
I was hoping to get in on it, but I didn't have time to work on it.
It's pretty intense.
It's pretty pathetic.
MADISON:
We're so excited for you!
Yeah, and don't worry about us not getting to see you get married, just as long as you're happy.
What are you so dressed up for?
And why did you change your hair?
Oh.
Um...
You know what they say, blondes have more fun.
Okay, see you, Amy.
I think she's had enough fun.
Bye!
Congratulations!
What is going on?
Congratulations!
We're practically in-laws now, right?
Yeah.
I guess we are.
See ya later, sis.
Yeah, see you later, bro.

Good morning.
Come on, tell me.
Tell you...
I already know.
Know?
You're married!
Oh.
That.
Yeah.
You big knucklehead!
You're supposed to ask the girls to marry you in private and get married in public.
Yeah, well, you're supposed to get married before you have the kid, but we like doing everything backwards.
As long as you're happy.
We're happy.
Congratulations.
Oh, you heard, huh?
I heard.
Eloped, huh?
If that's what you call it, yeah.
I'll let you two talk.
Your mom sent this.
It's a little gift for you and Amy.
Insurance forms?
Amy and John on your insurance with us.
Medical and dental.
Really?
Yeah.
That's wife.
And your son.
And I know Amy at the church nursery, but it's not like this insurance.
This'll take care of everything.
Oh.
Yeah.
This is great.
Thanks.
I want to wish you all the best.
That's really nice of you, Leo.
I really appreciate everything you've done for me, the job, the apartment.
You've been to the staff here, and it's nice to see my family's old apartment, nice to see it come back to life.
And here.
Have a little something for you.
I can't take this.
It's for you and Amy, a little something to get you started.
This looks like to get us started.
Leo, this is way too generous.
Just say "thank you." Thank you.
It's a rare thing to find loyal, honest young man.
You did a good thing, in marrying Amy.
So, when are classes starting?
I've got another couple of days.
And what are you majoring in?
Business.
I think.
Sounds good to me.
What are you hoping to do with it?
I'm not sure.
I'd love for you to consider a career at this company, my company.
Feel free to get more involved in whatever aspect of the business that interests you.
Maybe you want to get a butcher's license, spend a little time at the offices, maybe you want to check into the international aspect of the business.
What are you interested in?
Mostly in not offending anyone in your family.
Like Ben.
Don't worry about it.
He and I have had this conversation a hundred times.
He has other ideas about what he wants to do with his life.
If you want a career here, I'd love to have you.
This is my business, not Ben's.
So, think about it, think about whether or not this is the place for you.
Yes.
You might want to discuss it with your wife.
All right, I'll discuss it with Amy, but she already knows that I would want to be in business with you.
I've told her before, that would be the best thing that could ever happen, if you wanted me to be a part of this business.
Happy to hear it.
Thanks.
So, we'll see you around.
Are you sure about this?
You wanted to see me?
Hey, nice cake.
Thanks.
You want a piece?
Sure.
I thought you and Ricky on the fourth of July.
We were, but then...
I don't know, we just decided to do something else.
This doesn't affect my going to school here or anything, does it?
No, not at all.
It might if you two here, but you're fine.
This is all wonderful news, your getting married.
I mean, why have a big wedding, right?
It costs so much money these days.
Mmm.
Good cake.
Oh.
Thanks.
Ben's girlfriend's mom made it.
Which is a little weird if you ask me, but anyway.
The cafeteria lady wouldn't let me leave it in the lunchroom.
So, maybe you could...
Oh, no.
No, it's too much for my office.
Plus I've got meetings all day.
But, um, look,
I wanted to talk to you about something.
This year, I'm asking each of the seniors to mentor a freshman coming into the school.
Oh, that's a great idea.
I'm glad you think so.
I have a really special girl I want you to meet.
She just moved into the neighborhood and she needs a lot of help.
I have a son, you know.
I'm not really up for taking on someone who needs a lot of help, but...
I think you're for the job.son
Kathy!
Hey!
Ooh.
Cake!
I can't believe you're married.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Well, I am.
Usually guys who knock you up won't marry you, you know.
I know.
I don't like the term "knocked up."
What's wrong with "knocked up"?
It just...
It has "victim" written all over it.
I think it would be great if women could stop seeing themselves as victims so often and take responsibility and control of their lives.
I am a victim.
Oh, my gosh.
I didn't realize.
What, you were...
Oh, geez, you were...
No.
No.
I was talked into having unprotected sex by my nerdy boyfriend who convinced me he had a foolproof scientific birth control method, which depended on him stopping at just the right time.
I knew it didn't sound right.
But you did it anyway.
He was very persuasive.
He made me want to do it, you know what I mean?
I'm giving the baby up for adoption.
I already found a family for her.
I don't want my life to be over just because my boyfriend wasn't as smart as I thought he was.
Look, I don't mind talking to you, but I don't want to be like you.
My life isn't over.
I'm finishing up high school, I'm going to college, and...
And you're 18 and married.
To the guy who knocked you up.
These are your favorite cookies, you know.
If you say so.
I brought them all the way back from Paris.
Just for you.
Well, aren't you nice.
I love Paris.
My husband and I used to go there all the time.
I need to tell you something.
Something I should have told you a long time ago.
Oh, I know.
You've lost your virginity.
You're not fooling anyone, you know.
I know, Mom.
I want to apologize to you for not including you in my wedding.
Oh, that's okay.
You were at mine, though.
What?
Oh, nothing.
There's something else I need to tell you.
Amy ran off and married Ricky.
They eloped.
Oh, honey.
Oh, honey, don't cry.
And, Mom, there's something else I need to tell you.
(SNIFFLES)
I'm gay.
Of course.
Gay Paris.
Oh, it's such a wonderful city.
The City of Lights, you know.
Yeah, that's the one.
My husband loved Paris.
Did I tell you that?
Hey, Mom.
Hey, yourself.
Heard from your bride since she left for school?
No.
Why?
Ethan planned a big surprise for her in the hallway this morning.
She loves surprises.
Does she?
No, not at all.
Well, she's probably gonna love this one.
What is it?
Oh, I'll let Amy tell you.
Or show you.
She probably got it all on her phone.
So you have the day off?
I have the day off but I'm working tonight at the clinic, you know I do that sometimes.
When's Dad back?
On Friday.
And he can't wait to see you.
Why?
Why?
Because you're married.
You're our married son.
And we're very proud of you.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Is that it?
No, that's not it.
I have something for you.
Oh.
No.
Don't give me anything.
You've done enough for me.
And I've got to get over to the campus bookstore.
I want to pick up my books.
I don't want to wait till the last minute.
These were my mother and father's wedding bands.
And I noticed that you and Amy didn't have wedding bands, and...
I can't take these, Mom.
These have to have a lot of sentimental value.
What if we lost them or something?
You're not going to lose your wedding band.
And it would make me feel good to see the two of you wearing my parents' wedding rings.
Uh, but, you know, if you don't want to wear them, that's fine.
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
That's the last thing in the world I want to do.
You know me.
I just feel guilty taking something from you that's this important to you.
You are far more precious to me than any piece of gold.
And now you're married!
No offense, but I am not doing it.
Unless it's a requirement for graduation.
And if it is, I'm getting a lawyer.
I don't think you need a lawyer.
And I doubt that there's anything illegal about this.
It's the new senior program.
Each senior will mentor a freshman.
Not this senior.
Ben, you went to summer school.
You don't have a heavy class load.
You need to get interested in something.
Something other than girlfriends.
I am not the mentor type.
I'm a senior in high school and I'm divorced.
Who needs that kind of mentor?
You're also a guy who has learned from his mistakes.
No, I haven't.
What was your first year like here?
I bet it wasn't easy.
You can say that again.
Well, that's what this program's about.
To make sure freshmen have an easier time adjusting to high school.
To make sure we see trouble coming and do something about it before it's too late.
You're dreaming!
I am not capable of seeing trouble coming.
That's how I keep ending up in trouble.
What do you mean?
Are you in some kind of trouble now?
No!
All right, Ben, this is your senior year.
This should be the best year of high school.
And no matter how bad the other years were, this could be a good year for you.
Or not.
Are you sure you're not in some kind of trouble?
No.
No, you're not sure, or no, you're not in any trouble?
Both.
And stop fishing for information just because I don't want anything to do with your little mentor program.
Okay, well, why don't you take some time to think about this and we'll talk again next week.
Yes, why don't we?
Oh.
Excuse me.
I was just going in there to the counselor's office.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm teaching.
I'm finishing up a requirement for my master's.
What?
Yeah.
I'm teaching here this semester.
You have a thing for young girls, don't you?
Yeah, I knew it.
You're a pervert.
What are you talking about?
Adrian is only 18, you know.
She's almost 19 and I'm 22.
Yeah.
Well, that makes her three years younger than you.
Look, pal, you just stepped over the line.
I'm not some kind of pervert just because I'm dating your ex-wife.
And you better not ever say that within these walls again because that is a very serious accusation.
And I don't like it.
Oh, yeah?
What are you going to do about it?
Punch me?
Go ahead.
I would risk getting arrested as well as lose everything I've worked for at college for the past four years just to punch you?
Pervert.
All right, that does it.
I'm going to report you right now.
I have no choice but to report you right now.
I want this on record.
Otherwise your false accusations could come back to haunt me.
I want the authorities called.
Oh.
Oh, no.
No.
No authorities need to be called.
Yeah, they do.
Oh, come on.
I just...
I momentarily lost my...
My sanity, you know, thinking about you and Adrian.
You're divorced.
You have another girlfriend now.
Not a good one.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm an idiot.
I'm a little on edge.
It's the first day of school.
And it's overwhelming.
I take it all back.
All of it.
You can't take it back.
You accused me of being a pervert and I work at the school.
And you should never accuse any teacher of doing something that you know they didn't do, because it makes it all the harder to go after the few teachers who should be taken out of the classroom and put in jail.
What is wrong with me?
Hey, Ben.
What is wrong with you?
Cake?
No, thank you, Amy.
It's very good cake.
Everyone's been enjoying it.
At least a hundred people have told me it's the best wedding cake they've ever had.
Did you have to get married?
I mean, really, why now?
Was the fourth of July not soon enough?
Are you pregnant again?
What?
Ben!
I've lost the edit function.
I can't keep the words in my mouth.
I love you!
I've always loved you!
Wow.
He accused you of what?
I can't believe this.
It's my first day of school.
Yeah, well, unfortunately, we have to report these things.
Unbelievable.
So what happens now?
The police come in and question me or something?
Oh, no, I don't think so.
It sounds more like a name calling than an actual accusation.
The principal will talk to Ben, and then he'll talk to you, and the principal knows Adrian.
Well, what does that mean?
Adrian is a very nice girl.
Absolutely.
What, did she date one of her teachers?
Has she ever done anything like that?
No.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
There's a lot of that going around today.
I want it on record that I was falsely accused and I haven't done anything.
Okay.
I am a young, black professional, and I'm not going to have my teaching career ruined the first day of school.
I got it.
(SIGHS) Damn.
Hey.
What are we doing?
Ben Boykewich just accused some teacher of being a perv.
Oh, and then he proclaimed his love to Amy Juergens.
He's cracking up.
Yeah.
And why is he cracking up?
Something is going on, something we don't know about.
I bet Raven knows.
I know she knows.
He is not good for Dylan.
Mmm.
He's not good for anybody.
He's a nut.
Why did they have to ruin our senior year?
It's like Invasion of the Skanks.
Just ignore them.
Why do they have to wear those stupid uniforms?
I know.
I wish we had uniforms.
Me, too.
And I just feel so poor now that they're here.
I know.
And we're not poor.
And I feel fat.
Me, too.
They just seem so much cooler than us.
Yeah, well, I know, but what are we going to do about it?
This.
You are kind.
You are smart.
You are important.
Stop quoting The Help.
Can't.
Doesn't it make you feel so much better?
Kind of.
What are you guys doing out here?
I saw Ben walk past class and I went to the restroom.
And then I heard him out here accusing some teacher of being a perv.
And I'm telling you, this guy is no perv.
I think I've seen him somewhere.
But, anyway, Ben challenged him to a fight.
A fight?
Yeah, and this guy is like this huge good-looking guy.
Wait a minute, it wasn't Omar, was it?
Daniel's friend?
He's student teaching here.
Oh, yeah, that was him!
A perv?
Omar is the nicest guy in the world.
His mother is a minister.
Forget Omar.
Tell her the other part, the important part.
What's going on?
Tell her.
Tell me what?
Ben ran into Amy out here in the hallway with her big cake you got her, and he told her he loved her.
And he always has and he's really upset that she got married.
What?
You're dumping him.
He's cracking up and he's dangerous now.
Dangerous how?
You two better tell us what's going on.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
JACK:
Play 23!
Ten-hut!
Pappas is pretty good.
I'm just not sure he has any leadership qualities.
I wouldn't write him off.
He's got solid skills.
We got a lot of guys with solid skills.
He did a good job for us.
He's a Christian, you know.
Hot damn!
Pappas is our Tebow!
Oh, no, he's not a good Christian.
His dad's a minister but I don't think Jack even goes to church anymore.
Get him back in church.
I don't care how you do it.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Uh, could you help me?
I need that book on the top shelf and I can't reach it.
Sure.
I'll get it for you.
Hey, Adrian.
Ricky!
Hi.
Here.
See you around.
Hope so.
Oh, he's married.
Pay no attention to him.
(CHUCKLES) So I guess you heard.
Yeah.
Good for you and Amy.
I hope you'll be very happy.
I know I wasn't happy when I was married, but hey, I'm not married anymore.
I mean, Ben is a nice guy, he's a really nice guy.
It just...
You know, it gets old, being with the same person all the time.
What happened to your boyfriend?
Oh, he got all upset because I kissed Grace.
But he'll come around, they all do.
I'm happy being with Amy, really happy.
So, let me see your schedule.
Do we have any class together?
Mmm, I doubt it.
I'm in the business school.
Still, let me see.
Huh.
Freshman English.
You're kidding.
Oh, loosen up, will you?
We're going to be bumping into each other now and then, and I'm not uncomfortable if you're not uncomfortable, and you shouldn't be uncomfortable.
Unless of course you're still thinking about me.
No, I'm not.
Good.
Because I'm not going to be fooling around here like I did in high school.
I've got a goal.
I'm going to graduate with honors and get into law school.
Sounds good.
And what are your plans?
Other than being married to Amy and raising John?
Any goals?
Not really.
Just want to do the best I can.
So that you can end up doing what?
I don't know.
Okay, well, just in case your goal is to rise to the top of Boykewich International, which I think you'd be great at,
Ben Boykewich is never going to let that happen.
He hates the butcher business, but he hates you more.
See you.
Wait.
Wait.
Ben doesn't hate me, he's my friend.
Why would he hate me?
Are you kidding?
You just married the woman he loves.
Home sick?
Jacob got home sick?
Baby.
I think he panicked when it came to registering for school this morning, and he wanted to go home and see his mom and his friends.
So that's that.
I have a feeling he'll be back.
You would know, half-sister, half-brother.
Will you drop that please?
I'm not half anything.
Half-Christian, half-not-a-Christian.
(CHUCKLING)
That's not funny.
Okay.
Do you mind if I say the blessing before we all just dig in like animals?
Who's an animal?
I'm fine with that.
Say the blessing.
Oh, come on.
Do we have to?
Tom.
Shall we join hands?
Sure.
Dear Lord, bless this house and all that are in it and please watch over our half-brother, Jacob, as he travels back to his home.
Amen.
Bless the food to the nourishment of our bodies and let it give us the strength to abstain from sex outside of marriage.
No amen on that one.
Guide us in our daily choices, helping us to choose what is right over what is wrong and giving us the good sense to know the difference.
Are you finished?
Please help those children whose parents are still children themselves and watch over all the families, all over the world...
Would you guys please stop it?
That's completely sacrilegious.
You asked to say a blessing.
You didn't say anything about a lecture.
Especially by a half-sister, half-brother.
And I thought my family was nuts.
My other family.
My former family.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)
Well, it's my family now, but...
Jack's coach is calling me.
I wonder what he wants.
No phone calls during dinner.
Yeah.
Coach?
I guess I'm gonna have to work my way up to being a stepfather.
Go with half-father.
Half-father, half-mother.
That's one too many, Tom.
You gotta know when to stop.
I'm a grown man.
Okay.
What is this?
Beans and weenies.
Or is it weenies and beans?
Mmm.
Beans and weenies.
No offense, but it's revolting.
Mmm.
I like it.
My mom makes this.
When I was a kid, we used to pretend that we were cowboys eating around a campfire and we'd eat it right out of the pan on the stove.
And the person who picked up the square white thing in their spoon got to wear the cowboy hat.
(SCOFFS) That's a hunk of animal fat, you idiot.
Really?
'Cause I just ate it.
And it was delicious.
That's why it was the prize.
This is why I am going to cooking school in Italy.
I was going to talk to you later about it, but you might be sick later.
I got into that cooking school.
We leave Sunday.
What?
We leave Sunday.
I can't go to Italy on Sunday.
I have to mow the lawn.
And I don't have any money.
And you can't go either.
Excuse me.
Seconds.
I hate it here.
So why should we stay here if we could be in Italy?
Oh, I don't know.
Because this is your family and they love you?
Oh, yeah, this is my family who loves me, you and Nora, the three of us eating beans and a hunk of animal fat.
We have to get out of here before our lives are completely ruined like Ricky's.
You knew I couldn't stay here.
Is that why you slept with me?
So I'd go on another one of your big adventures?
I told you, Ashley, I can't follow you all over the world.
I didn't even know about the school thing when I slept with you the first time.
I don't want to go.
I want to stay here.
I like it here.
Well, I don't.
Ashley, I love you.
And you love me.
Stop running away.
Um, hi, just going to ask this one question.
Ashley, does your dad know you decided to go to this cooking school?
He doesn't have any say in it.
(SIGHS) Great.
Now I've got to go home and convince my parents to pay for me to go halfway around the world so I can be with the girl they don't think I'm having sex with.
Unbelievable!
There's a second white square!
It's my lucky day.
Kind of.
(BABBLING)
Did I tell you that Ashley is going to Italy to cooking school?
Is that the one with the baby?
No, that's Amy.
Amy and Ricky got married.
They eloped.
My daughter eloped too, you know.
I made her feel so bad about that.
I wish I hadn't done that.
My daughter was such a lovely girl.
So lovely and smart.
Do you know my daughter?
I'm getting to know her.
WAITER:
Your salads will be coming up shortly.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
So, what's the plan, Ben?
What do you want to do?
The clock is ticking.
There's nothing I can do.
They're married.
Ben, not about Amy and Ricky.
Forget that.
About the other situation.
What do you think I should do?
Why would you listen to me now?
You never listened to me before.
I told you, you are on your own.
Is that just in regard to the trouble with Dylan or does that include all trouble?
All trouble?
You're in more trouble than that?
I, uh, called one of the teachers a pervert.
Because?
It's Adrian's boyfriend, Omar.
Omar is student teaching.
I didn't know.
It took me by surprise.
I misspoke.
You called him a pervert for absolutely no reason?
Yeah, and, uh, he reported me.
And now there's going to be some sort of investigation.
What happened to you, Ben?
You used to be such a good kid.
And now...
Now you're a good man, Ben, but you just keep doing stupid, stupid things.
I know.
I'm angry.
I'm really angry and just out of control.
Angry about what?
About what happened with you and Adrian, losing the baby?
Are you still upset about that?
That's always going to hurt, but no.
I'm angry that Ricky stole my life.
Amy should have been mine.
Then none of this would have happened.
(SIGHS)
Hello!
I'm here and I'm... (CLEARS THROAT) Hi.
What is going on?
Your friend Omar dropped by.
Just wanted to introduce myself to your parents.
You know, in case we ever decide to go out again or anything.
Oh, really?
Sure you just didn't have a bad first day at school and need legal help?
We heard all about it.
Did you hear all about it?
Ben called me.
We're not going to talk about Ben when we have company over, are we?
No, of course not.
Come on.
Sit down.
Let's eat.
Really, Omar, what are you doing here?
I don't just drop by your parents' house and have dinner with them.
You can if you want, but I got the impression that you're not interested in getting to know my parents.
I, on the other hand, am interested in getting to know yours.
I told you, I'm focusing on school this year.
Well, if anyone would understand that, that would be me since I'm a teacher.
And by the way, my mom's a Protestant minister and my dad's in law enforcement.
He's a detective.
He traced down your dad for me.
I really like you.
Stop trying to impress them.
It's too late.
(SCOFFS)
This is good.
Yeah.
I've eaten so much of it, I feel sick.
I feel sick, too, but not from the cake.
My mother sent insurance forms for us to fill out so the company can put you and John on the insurance.
Hmm.
That's nice.
Yeah, I know.
And then Leo gave us an envelope full of cash and invited me to be a part of the business.
Wait, that's so great.
That's what you've always wanted.
Oh.
Right.
And my mom gave us these.
They belonged to her parents.
Are you going to wear a wedding band?
Are you?
I guess so.
I've been assigned a freshman girl to mentor.
She's six months pregnant.
And I'm supposed to help her make the right decisions.
Boy.
Are you going to change your name?
I don't know how that works.
I mean, everyone is already calling me Mrs. Underwood.
Oh.
There was a surprise wedding shower for me at the nursery.
There are gifts in the car that I didn't bring in.
I just feel so guilty.
Some of these ladies just work part-time and they bought us gifts.
But I suppose we're keeping the gifts.
I suppose we are.
I don't know, Amy.
Did we do the right thing?
It's too late now.
(CHUCKLES)
Got the wedding video in the mail.
(BOTH LAUGH)
You want to see it?
Yeah.
Sure.
PRIEST:
Do not move off the marks.
Stay right where you are.
Do not move off that mark.
You're completely surrounded.
It's going to be a beautiful video.
Here we go.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Oh!
It's the wrong book!
Hold on while I get the right one.
Where did you find this guy?
The Internet.
Got it!
Got it!
Y'all cheer up!
Vows are coming.
Did you write your vows?
No.
We didn't write anything.
Did you get your flowers?
$49.99.
It will last you a lifetime.
It's okay.
No, you should have flowers.
We'll take the flowers.
Silk.
Oh.
$49.99.
Pay as you go.
Here.
Whoo-hoo!
Yee-haw!
Steak night!
Oh, I forgot something.
Rose petal scent.
Can we get on with this?
Oh, you've got your whole life together.
What's the rush?
Slow down.
Okay.
Got it, Dicky?
That's Ricky.
Ricky and Amy.
Got it, Dick.
Let's do a little dance.
What?
A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer in your pants.
Chuckles the Clown.
Mary Tyler Moore?
Oh, forget it.
We got to get the...
We got to get the mood up.
Get the blood flowing.
You're going to need that on your honeymoon.
I'm gonna play y'all a record that inspired all of this.
Amy.
I know.
This is not what I was expecting.
This wasn't on the Internet?
No.

(SONG CONTINUES ON STEREO)
Hallelujah!
I am not dancing.
(PRIEST LAUGHING)
(LAUGHS) I feel stupid.
Because this is stupid.
You really want to do this?
Let this idiot marry us?
Uh... (LAUGHING)
Well, we'll certainly remember it for the rest of our lives.
You want to remember this?
You want this to be our wedding?
Not really.
Me neither.
We don't have to do this, we can go somewhere else, this weekend or another weekend.
I know, but I don't know how to get out of this, and we already paid him.
Let's just make a run for it.
You go,
I'll stop him if he comes after you.
No, I'm too scared.
He's crazy.
Go!
Go!
Are you sure?
Look at him!
He probably doesn't even have a license to marry us.
Run, Amy, run!
Thanks!
We changed our mind!
Oh, wait.
But wait, we're getting to the good part.
Oh.
Ricky, my door is locked.
Sorry, sorry.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I can't believe I didn't open the door for you.
It's okay, it's okay.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Previously on The Secret Life of the American Teenager...
If Amy and Ricky got married,
I am really going to be upset with you.
Why?
Why me?
Be upset with them if you want to be upset with anyone.
It's just that I'm not ready to go back to my house and confront everyone.
Part of the reason I wanted to elope was because I'm tired of everyone being involved in our business.
They were roasting marshmallows over a Bunsen burner.
What?
And an hour later, boom, the lab blows up and the school burns down.
I can't keep dating Jack to get information.
I don't love him.
I don't love him at all.
Is Amy okay?
I think maybe she and Ricky eloped last night.
...to talk.
Ben!
Ben!
You think you're going to hell because we kissed?
Is that why you're a Christian again?
That might have something to do with it.
Ashley, do you remember that cooking school you applied to in Italy?
Yeah?
No!
You got accepted.
No, you can't go to Italy.
You don't have any money.
And you're not giving her any.
We got married.

I'm so happy for you and Ricky and John!
Congratulations, Mrs. Underwood!
Thank you.
Um, it's not that big of a deal though.
We were living together, you know.
Hi, Amy!
Congratulations.
I wanted to give you this gift from me.
It's the book on which your vows are based.
Thanks, Grace.
I just thought you should have it, 'cause you know it is the foundation for a good marriage.
Very nice.
Amy!
Amy!
Wait up!
We heard the good news!
You got married!
Finally, huh?
Yeah, finally.
Um, I guess that's for me?
Who do you think it's for?
Yeah, well, thanks.
That's a very large wedding cake.
My mom insisted on making it, she owns a bakery, you know.
Yeah, I know.
And how sweet of her.
And how sweet of the two of you to bring it in for me.
I really didn't know anything about it.
Hey, how are you?
I heard you were in the hospital.
How am I?
Who cares how I am?
If you had cared how I am, you would have called me to tell me that you got married yourself.
So, I guess...
Good luck to you.
Have a nice life.
You keep the top layer and then freeze it.
Yeah.
Ben, are you all right?
Ricky on a stick?
No.
I'm not.
Do you need to talk to Alice?
No, I don't need to talk to Alice!
He's kind of having an anxiety attack.
But it has nothing to do with you.
Congratulations!
Ben!
Wait!
I heard there's going to be some kind of low class flash mob.
Yeah.
I was hoping to get in on it, but I didn't have time to work on it.
It's pretty intense.
It's pretty pathetic.
We're so excited for you!
Yeah, and don't worry about us not getting to see you get married, just as long as you're happy.
What are you so dressed up for?
And why did you change your hair?
Oh.
Um...
You know what they say, blondes have more fun.
Okay, see you, Amy.
I think she's had enough fun.
Bye!
Congratulations!
What is going on?
Congratulations!
We're practically in-laws now, right?
Yeah.
I guess we are.
See ya later, sis.
Yeah, see you later, bro.

Good morning.
Come on, tell me.
Tell you...
I already know.
Know?
You're married!
Oh.
That.
Yeah.
You big knucklehead!
You're supposed to ask the girls to marry you in private and get married in public.
Yeah, well, you're supposed to get married before you have the kid, but we like doing everything backwards.
As long as you're happy.
We're happy.
Congratulations.
Oh, you heard, huh?
I heard.
Eloped, huh?
If that's what you call it, yeah.
I'll let you two talk.
Your mom sent this.
It's a little gift for you and Amy.
Insurance forms?
Amy and John on your insurance with us.
Medical and dental.
Really?
Yeah.
That's wife.
And your son.
And I know Amy at the church nursery, but it's not like this insurance.
This'll take care of everything.
Oh.
Yeah.
This is great.
Thanks.
I want to wish you all the best.
That's really nice of you, Leo.
I really appreciate everything you've done for me, the job, the apartment.
You've been to the staff here, and it's nice to see my family's old apartment, nice to see it come back to life.
And here.
Have a little something for you.
I can't take this.
It's for you and Amy, a little something to get you started.
This looks like to get us started.
Leo, this is way too generous.
Just say "thank you." Thank you.
It's a rare thing to find loyal, honest young man.
You did a good thing, in marrying Amy.
So, when are classes starting?
I've got another couple of days.
And what are you majoring in?
Business.
I think.
Sounds good to me.
What are you hoping to do with it?
I'm not sure.
I'd love for you to consider a career at this company, my company.
Feel free to get more involved in whatever aspect of the business that interests you.
Maybe you want to get a butcher's license, spend a little time at the offices, maybe you want to check into the international aspect of the business.
What are you interested in?
Mostly in not offending anyone in your family.
Like Ben.
Don't worry about it.
He and I have had this conversation a hundred times.
He has other ideas about what he wants to do with his life.
If you want a career here, I'd love to have you.
This is my business, not Ben's.
So, think about it, think about whether or not this is the place for you.
Yes.
You might want to discuss it with your wife.
All right, I'll discuss it with Amy, but she already knows that I would want to be in business with you.
I've told her before, that would be the best thing that could ever happen, if you wanted me to be a part of this business.
Happy to hear it.
Thanks.
So, we'll see you around.
Are you sure about this?
You wanted to see me?
Hey, nice cake.
Thanks.
You want a piece?
Sure.
I thought you and Ricky on the fourth of July.
We were, but then...
I don't know, we just decided to do something else.
This doesn't affect my going to school here or anything, does it?
No, not at all.
It might if you two here, but you're fine.
This is all wonderful news, your getting married.
I mean, why have a big wedding, right?
It costs so much money these days.
Mmm.
Good cake.
Oh.
Thanks.
Ben's girlfriend's mom made it.
Which is a little weird if you ask me, but anyway.
The cafeteria lady wouldn't let me leave it in the lunchroom.
So, maybe you could...
Oh, no.
No, it's too much for my office.
Plus I've got meetings all day.
But, um, look,
I wanted to talk to you about something.
This year, I'm asking each of the seniors to mentor a freshman coming into the school.
Oh, that's a great idea.
I'm glad you think so.
I have a really special girl I want you to meet.
She just moved into the neighborhood and she needs a lot of help.
I have a son, you know.
I'm not really up for taking on someone who needs a lot of help, but...
I think you're for the job.son
Kathy!
Hey!
Ooh.
Cake!
I can't believe you're married.
Yeah.
Well, I am.
Usually guys who knock you up won't marry you, you know.
I know.
I don't like the term "knocked up."
What's wrong with "knocked up"?
It just...
It has "victim" written all over it.
I think it would be great if women could stop seeing themselves as victims so often and take responsibility and control of their lives.
I am a victim.
Oh, my gosh.
I didn't realize.
What, you were...
Oh, geez, you were...
No.
No.
I was talked into having unprotected sex by my nerdy boyfriend who convinced me he had a foolproof scientific birth control method, which depended on him stopping at just the right time.
I knew it didn't sound right.
But you did it anyway.
He was very persuasive.
He made me want to do it, you know what I mean?
I'm giving the baby up for adoption.
I already found a family for her.
I don't want my life to be over just because my boyfriend wasn't as smart as I thought he was.
Look, I don't mind talking to you, but I don't want to be like you.
My life isn't over.
I'm finishing up high school, I'm going to college, and...
And you're 18 and married.
To the guy who knocked you up.
These are your favorite cookies, you know.
If you say so.
I brought them all the way back from Paris.
Just for you.
Well, aren't you nice.
I love Paris.
My husband and I used to go there all the time.
I need to tell you something.
Something I should have told you a long time ago.
Oh, I know.
You've lost your virginity.
You're not fooling anyone, you know.
I know, Mom.
I want to apologize to you for not including you in my wedding.
Oh, that's okay.
You were at mine, though.
What?
Oh, nothing.
There's something else I need to tell you.
Amy ran off and married Ricky.
They eloped.
Oh, honey.
Oh, honey, don't cry.
And, Mom, there's something else I need to tell you.
I'm gay.
Of course.
Gay Paris.
Oh, it's such a wonderful city.
The City of Lights, you know.
Yeah, that's the one.
My husband loved Paris.
Did I tell you that?
Hey, Mom.
Hey, yourself.
Heard from your bride since she left for school?
No.
Why?
Ethan planned a big surprise for her in the hallway this morning.
She loves surprises.
Does she?
No, not at all.
Well, she's probably gonna love this one.
What is it?
Oh, I'll let Amy tell you.
Or show you.
She probably got it all on her phone.
So you have the day off?
I have the day off but I'm working tonight at the clinic, you know I do that sometimes.
When's Dad back?
On Friday.
And he can't wait to see you.
Why?
Why?
Because you're married.
You're our married son.
And we're very proud of you.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Is that it?
No, that's not it.
I have something for you.
Oh.
No.
Don't give me anything.
You've done enough for me.
And I've got to get over to the campus bookstore.
I want to pick up my books.
I don't want to wait till the last minute.
These were my mother and father's wedding bands.
And I noticed that you and Amy didn't have wedding bands, and...
I can't take these, Mom.
These have to have a lot of sentimental value.
What if we lost them or something?
You're not going to lose your wedding band.
And it would make me feel good to see the two of you wearing my parents' wedding rings.
Uh, but, you know, if you don't want to wear them, that's fine.
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
That's the last thing in the world I want to do.
You know me.
I just feel guilty taking something from you that's this important to you.
You are far more precious to me than any piece of gold.
And now you're married!
No offense, but I am not doing it.
Unless it's a requirement for graduation.
And if it is, I'm getting a lawyer.
I don't think you need a lawyer.
And I doubt that there's anything illegal about this.
It's the new senior program.
Each senior will mentor a freshman.
Not this senior.
Ben, you went to summer school.
You don't have a heavy class load.
You need to get interested in something.
Something other than girlfriends.
I am not the mentor type.
I'm a senior in high school and I'm divorced.
Who needs that kind of mentor?
You're also a guy who has learned from his mistakes.
No, I haven't.
What was your first year like here?
I bet it wasn't easy.
You can say that again.
Well, that's what this program's about.
To make sure freshmen have an easier time adjusting to high school.
To make sure we see trouble coming and do something about it before it's too late.
You're dreaming!
I am not capable of seeing trouble coming.
That's how I keep ending up in trouble.
What do you mean?
Are you in some kind of trouble now?
No!
All right, Ben, this is your senior year.
This should be the best year of high school.
And no matter how bad the other years were, this could be a good year for you.
Or not.
Are you sure you're not in some kind of trouble?
No.
No, you're not sure, or no, you're not in any trouble?
Both.
And stop fishing for information just because I don't want anything to do with your little mentor program.
Okay, well, why don't you take some time to think about this and we'll talk again next week.
Yes, why don't we?
Oh.
Excuse me.
I was just going in there to the counselor's office.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm teaching.
I'm finishing up a requirement for my master's.
What?
Yeah.
I'm teaching here this semester.
You have a thing for young girls, don't you?
Yeah, I knew it.
You're a pervert.
What are you talking about?
Adrian is only 18, you know.
She's almost 19 and I'm 22.
Yeah.
Well, that makes her three years younger than you.
Look, pal, you just stepped over the line.
I'm not some kind of pervert just because I'm dating your ex-wife.
And you better not ever say that within these walls again because that is a very serious accusation.
And I don't like it.
Oh, yeah?
What are you going to do about it?
Punch me?
Go ahead.
I would risk getting arrested as well as lose everything I've worked for at college for the past four years just to punch you?
Pervert.
All right, that does it.
I'm going to report you right now.
I have no choice but to report you right now.
I want this on record.
Otherwise your false accusations could come back to haunt me.
I want the authorities called.
Oh.
Oh, no.
No.
No authorities need to be called.
Yeah, they do.
Oh, come on.
I just...
I momentarily lost my...
My sanity, you know, thinking about you and Adrian.
You're divorced.
You have another girlfriend now.
Not a good one.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm an idiot.
I'm a little on edge.
It's the first day of school.
And it's overwhelming.
I take it all back.
All of it.
You can't take it back.
You accused me of being a pervert and I work at the school.
And you should never accuse any teacher of doing something that you know they didn't do, because it makes it all the harder to go after the few teachers who should be taken out of the classroom and put in jail.
What is wrong with me?
Hey, Ben.
What is wrong with you?
Cake?
No, thank you, Amy.
It's very good cake.
Everyone's been enjoying it.
At least a hundred people have told me it's the best wedding cake they've ever had.
Did you have to get married?
I mean, really, why now?
Was the fourth of July not soon enough?
Are you pregnant again?
What?
Ben!
I've lost the edit function.
I can't keep the words in my mouth.
I love you!
I've always loved you!
Wow.
He accused you of what?
I can't believe this.
It's my first day of school.
Yeah, well, unfortunately, we have to report these things.
Unbelievable.
So what happens now?
The police come in and question me or something?
Oh, no, I don't think so.
It sounds more like a name calling than an actual accusation.
The principal will talk to Ben, and then he'll talk to you, and the principal knows Adrian.
Well, what does that mean?
Adrian is a very nice girl.
Absolutely.
What, did she date one of her teachers?
Has she ever done anything like that?
No.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
There's a lot of that going around today.
I want it on record that I was falsely accused and I haven't done anything.
Okay.
I am a young, black professional, and I'm not going to have my teaching career ruined the first day of school.
I got it.
Damn.
Hey.
What are we doing?
Ben Boykewich just accused some teacher of being a perv.
Oh, and then he proclaimed his love to Amy Juergens.
He's cracking up.
Yeah.
And why is he cracking up?
Something is going on, something we don't know about.
I bet Raven knows.
I know she knows.
He is not good for Dylan.
Mmm.
He's not good for anybody.
He's a nut.
Why did they have to ruin our senior year?
It's like Invasion of the Skanks.
Just ignore them.
Why do they have to wear those stupid uniforms?
I know.
I wish we had uniforms.
Me, too.
And I just feel so poor now that they're here.
I know.
And we're not poor.
And I feel fat.
Me, too.
They just seem so much cooler than us.
Yeah, well, I know, but what are we going to do about it?
This.
You are kind.
You are smart.
You are important.
Stop quoting The Help.
Can't.
Doesn't it make you feel so much better?
Kind of.
What are you guys doing out here?
I saw Ben walk past class and I went to the restroom.
And then I heard him out here accusing some teacher of being a perv.
And I'm telling you, this guy is no perv.
I think I've seen him somewhere.
But, anyway, Ben challenged him to a fight.
A fight?
Yeah, and this guy is like this huge good-looking guy.
Wait a minute, it wasn't Omar, was it?
Daniel's friend?
He's student teaching here.
Oh, yeah, that was him!
A perv?
Omar is the nicest guy in the world.
His mother is a minister.
Forget Omar.
Tell her the other part, the important part.
What's going on?
Tell her.
Tell me what?
Ben ran into Amy out here in the hallway with her big cake you got her, and he told her he loved her.
And he always has and he's really upset that she got married.
What?
You're dumping him.
He's cracking up and he's dangerous now.
Dangerous how?
You two better tell us what's going on.
Play 23!
Ten-hut!
Pappas is pretty good.
I'm just not sure he has any leadership qualities.
I wouldn't write him off.
He's got solid skills.
We got a lot of guys with solid skills.
He did a good job for us.
He's a Christian, you know.
Hot damn!
Pappas is our Tebow!
Oh, no, he's not a good Christian.
His dad's a minister but I don't think Jack even goes to church anymore.
Get him back in church.
I don't care how you do it.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Uh, could you help me?
I need that book on the top shelf and I can't reach it.
Sure.
I'll get it for you.
Hey, Adrian.
Ricky!
Hi.
Here.
See you around.
Hope so.
Oh, he's married.
Pay no attention to him.
So I guess you heard.
Yeah.
Good for you and Amy.
I hope you'll be very happy.
I know I wasn't happy when I was married, but hey, I'm not married anymore.
I mean, Ben is a nice guy, he's a really nice guy.
It just...
You know, it gets old, being with the same person all the time.
What happened to your boyfriend?
Oh, he got all upset because I kissed Grace.
But he'll come around, they all do.
I'm happy being with Amy, really happy.
So, let me see your schedule.
Do we have any class together?
Mmm, I doubt it.
I'm in the business school.
Still, let me see.
Huh.
Freshman English.
You're kidding.
Oh, loosen up, will you?
We're going to be bumping into each other now and then, and I'm not uncomfortable if you're not uncomfortable, and you shouldn't be uncomfortable.
Unless of course you're still thinking about me.
No, I'm not.
Good.
Because I'm not going to be fooling around here like I did in high school.
I've got a goal.
I'm going to graduate with honors and get into law school.
Sounds good.
And what are your plans?
Other than being married to Amy and raising John?
Any goals?
Not really.
Just want to do the best I can.
So that you can end up doing what?
I don't know.
Okay, well, just in case your goal is to rise to the top of Boykewich International, which I think you'd be great at,
Ben Boykewich is never going to let that happen.
He hates the butcher business, but he hates you more.
See you.
Wait.
Wait.
Ben doesn't hate me, he's my friend.
Why would he hate me?
Are you kidding?
You just married the woman he loves.
Home sick?
Jacob got home sick?
Baby.
I think he panicked when it came to registering for school this morning, and he wanted to go home and see his mom and his friends.
So that's that.
I have a feeling he'll be back.
You would know, half-sister, half-brother.
Will you drop that please?
I'm not half anything.
Half-Christian, half-not-a-Christian.
That's not funny.
Okay.
Do you mind if I say the blessing before we all just dig in like animals?
Who's an animal?
I'm fine with that.
Say the blessing.
Oh, come on.
Do we have to?
Tom.
Shall we join hands?
Sure.
Dear Lord, bless this house and all that are in it and please watch over our half-brother, Jacob, as he travels back to his home.
Amen.
Bless the food to the nourishment of our bodies and let it give us the strength to abstain from sex outside of marriage.
No amen on that one.
Guide us in our daily choices, helping us to choose what is right over what is wrong and giving us the good sense to know the difference.
Are you finished?
Please help those children whose parents are still children themselves and watch over all the families, all over the world...
Would you guys please stop it?
That's completely sacrilegious.
You asked to say a blessing.
You didn't say anything about a lecture.
Especially by a half-sister, half-brother.
And I thought my family was nuts.
My other family.
My former family.
Well, it's my family now, but...
Jack's coach is calling me.
I wonder what he wants.
No phone calls during dinner.
Yeah.
Coach?
I guess I'm gonna have to work my way up to being a stepfather.
Go with half-father.
Half-father, half-mother.
That's one too many, Tom.
You gotta know when to stop.
I'm a grown man.
Okay.
What is this?
Beans and weenies.
Or is it weenies and beans?
Mmm.
Beans and weenies.
No offense, but it's revolting.
Mmm.
I like it.
My mom makes this.
When I was a kid, we used to pretend that we were cowboys eating around a campfire and we'd eat it right out of the pan on the stove.
And the person who picked up the square white thing in their spoon got to wear the cowboy hat.
That's a hunk of animal fat, you idiot.
Really?
'Cause I just ate it.
And it was delicious.
That's why it was the prize.
This is why I am going to cooking school in Italy.
I was going to talk to you later about it, but you might be sick later.
I got into that cooking school.
We leave Sunday.
What?
We leave Sunday.
I can't go to Italy on Sunday.
I have to mow the lawn.
And I don't have any money.
And you can't go either.
Excuse me.
Seconds.
I hate it here.
So why should we stay here if we could be in Italy?
Oh, I don't know.
Because this is your family and they love you?
Oh, yeah, this is my family who loves me, you and Nora, the three of us eating beans and a hunk of animal fat.
We have to get out of here before our lives are completely ruined like Ricky's.
You knew I couldn't stay here.
Is that why you slept with me?
So I'd go on another one of your big adventures?
I told you, Ashley, I can't follow you all over the world.
I didn't even know about the school thing when I slept with you the first time.
I don't want to go.
I want to stay here.
I like it here.
Well, I don't.
Ashley, I love you.
And you love me.
Stop running away.
Um, hi, just going to ask this one question.
Ashley, does your dad know you decided to go to this cooking school?
He doesn't have any say in it.
Great.
Now I've got to go home and convince my parents to pay for me to go halfway around the world so I can be with the girl they don't think I'm having sex with.
Unbelievable!
There's a second white square!
It's my lucky day.
Kind of.
Did I tell you that Ashley is going to Italy to cooking school?
Is that the one with the baby?
No, that's Amy.
Amy and Ricky got married.
They eloped.
My daughter eloped too, you know.
I made her feel so bad about that.
I wish I hadn't done that.
My daughter was such a lovely girl.
So lovely and smart.
Do you know my daughter?
I'm getting to know her.
Your salads will be coming up shortly.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
So, what's the plan, Ben?
What do you want to do?
The clock is ticking.
There's nothing I can do.
They're married.
Ben, not about Amy and Ricky.
Forget that.
About the other situation.
What do you think I should do?
Why would you listen to me now?
You never listened to me before.
I told you, you are on your own.
Is that just in regard to the trouble with Dylan or does that include all trouble?
All trouble?
You're in more trouble than that?
I, uh, called one of the teachers a pervert.
Because?
It's Adrian's boyfriend, Omar.
Omar is student teaching.
I didn't know.
It took me by surprise.
I misspoke.
You called him a pervert for absolutely no reason?
Yeah, and, uh, he reported me.
And now there's going to be some sort of investigation.
What happened to you, Ben?
You used to be such a good kid.
And now...
Now you're a good man, Ben, but you just keep doing stupid, stupid things.
I know.
I'm angry.
I'm really angry and just out of control.
Angry about what?
About what happened with you and Adrian, losing the baby?
Are you still upset about that?
That's always going to hurt, but no.
I'm angry that Ricky stole my life.
Amy should have been mine.
Then none of this would have happened.
Hello!
I'm here and I'm...
Hi.
What is going on?
Your friend Omar dropped by.
Just wanted to introduce myself to your parents.
You know, in case we ever decide to go out again or anything.
Oh, really?
Sure you just didn't have a bad first day at school and need legal help?
We heard all about it.
Did you hear all about it?
Ben called me.
We're not going to talk about Ben when we have company over, are we?
No, of course not.
Come on.
Sit down.
Let's eat.
Really, Omar, what are you doing here?
I don't just drop by your parents' house and have dinner with them.
You can if you want, but I got the impression that you're not interested in getting to know my parents.
I, on the other hand, am interested in getting to know yours.
I told you, I'm focusing on school this year.
Well, if anyone would understand that, that would be me since I'm a teacher.
And by the way, my mom's a Protestant minister and my dad's in law enforcement.
He's a detective.
He traced down your dad for me.
I really like you.
Stop trying to impress them.
It's too late.
This is good.
Yeah.
I've eaten so much of it, I feel sick.
I feel sick, too, but not from the cake.
My mother sent insurance forms for us to fill out so the company can put you and John on the insurance.
Hmm.
That's nice.
Yeah, I know.
And then Leo gave us an envelope full of cash and invited me to be a part of the business.
Wait, that's so great.
That's what you've always wanted.
Oh.
Right.
And my mom gave us these.
They belonged to her parents.
Are you going to wear a wedding band?
Are you?
I guess so.
I've been assigned a freshman girl to mentor.
She's six months pregnant.
And I'm supposed to help her make the right decisions.
Boy.
Are you going to change your name?
I don't know how that works.
I mean, everyone is already calling me Mrs. Underwood.
Oh.
There was a surprise wedding shower for me at the nursery.
There are gifts in the car that I didn't bring in.
I just feel so guilty.
Some of these ladies just work part-time and they bought us gifts.
But I suppose we're keeping the gifts.
I suppose we are.
I don't know, Amy.
Did we do the right thing?
It's too late now.
Got the wedding video in the mail.
You want to see it?
Yeah.
Sure.
Do not move off the marks.
Stay right where you are.
Do not move off that mark.
You're completely surrounded.
It's going to be a beautiful video.
Here we go.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Oh!
It's the wrong book!
Hold on while I get the right one.
Where did you find this guy?
The Internet.
Got it!
Got it!
Y'all cheer up!
Vows are coming.
Did you write your vows?
No.
We didn't write anything.
Did you get your flowers?
$49.99.
It will last you a lifetime.
It's okay.
No, you should have flowers.
We'll take the flowers.
Silk.
Oh.
$49.99.
Pay as you go.
Here.
Whoo-hoo!
Yee-haw!
Steak night!
Oh, I forgot something.
Rose petal scent.
Can we get on with this?
Oh, you've got your whole life together.
What's the rush?
Slow down.
Okay.
Got it, Dicky?
That's Ricky.
Ricky and Amy.
Got it, Dick.
Let's do a little dance.
What?
A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer in your pants.
Chuckles the Clown.
Mary Tyler Moore?
Oh, forget it.
We got to get the...
We got to get the mood up.
Get the blood flowing.
You're going to need that on your honeymoon.
I'm gonna play y'all a record that inspired all of this.
Amy.
I know.
This is not what I was expecting.
This wasn't on the Internet?
No.
♪ The day the squirrel went berserk
♪ In the First Self-Righteous Church
See them squirrels, that's what I'm talking about!
Come on, get with it!
Hallelujah!
I am not dancing.
I feel stupid.
Because this is stupid.
You really want to do this?
Let this idiot marry us?
Uh...
Well, we'll certainly remember it for the rest of our lives.
You want to remember this?
You want this to be our wedding?
Not really.
Me neither.
We don't have to do this, we can go somewhere else, this weekend or another weekend.
I know, but I don't know how to get out of this, and we already paid him.
Let's just make a run for it.
You go,
I'll stop him if he comes after you.
No, I'm too scared.
He's crazy.
Go!
Go!
Are you sure?
Look at him!
He probably doesn't even have a license to marry us.
Run, Amy, run!
Thanks!
We changed our mind!
Oh, wait.
But wait, we're getting to the good part.
Oh.
Ricky, my door is locked.
Sorry, sorry.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I can't believe I didn't open the door for you.
It's okay, it's okay.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
We're out of Maple Bacon bars.
What do you mean, you're out of Maple Bacon bars, you little bitch?
Raviva.
Look who turned out to be pro-life.
You had sex with your boss?
Why did I do that?
I want a job.
Welcome to the real world.
Did you do it?
Sorta.
Ooh!
You're here to serve mojitos, and, if you don't have a big boy, wrap it in a tortilla.
So you guys want to meet Rosemary?
Yeah.
Rosemary.
So creepy.
We have become parents.
Destroyers of worlds.
Miles!
Rosemary, say hi to the camera.
Miles!
Careful, girls.
Careful.
Slow down.
You have a baby.
Careful, girls.
Careful.
It's madness.
I know, right?
We are so old.
I always thought Soph would be the first to have a kid.
Me?
Had to have had sex.
Yeah.
Yeah, but I assumed it would have happened by now.
I assume she will very soon.
I'm actually right here, you guys.
Hey.
Hi.
How's it going?
I can't believe I haven't had three of these already.
She's gonna poop again, babe.
She just pooped.
She's making the poop face.
Soph, get another diaper!
Soph!
Um, guys, we are out of diapers.
It's our first time changing her.
- How can we be out of diapers?
- I've been so lucky.
Thanks.
You know what I mean.
No parents have friends like this.
No.
Not like this.
I don't think mine did.
I know mine didn't.
I wish my parents had friends like this that were cool and always around.
They probably would have stayed together.
Mine too.
Mine too.
Let's make a deal.
Let's have, like, an ultimate bat signal so that, if and when any of us ever have kids and we need help, we'll just pssh, like, the ultimate bat signal.
And, no matter what we're doing, we'll just drop it and help each other, right?
I mean, that would be so much better than the way we were raised.
Deal?
Deal.
Deal.
Deal.
Deal.
Yo, yo, daddy-o.
Hey, how's my baby mama doing?
Don't call me baby mama.
But that's what you are.
You're my baby mama.
I'm your baby daddy.
And this is our baby baby.
Hate that you have to go to work.
If this were Norway, you know...
In Norway we would live in an overdesigned environment with a homogeneous population and eat a lot of boiled fish.
Okay, but you are the boss's son.
And can't you take, like, a week off to stay at home with your brand-new baby?
Nope.
Have you seen my phone?
Rosemary wants to know why.
Because daddy asked grandpa for a job after insulting grandpa for the better part of a decade.
Daddy doesn't feel like he should ask grandpa for any time off three days after being hired.
Okay.
She understands.
All right, well, just let's do a quick tour around the house.
You can show me what I can move or toss.
You know, there's literally no room for any of the baby stuff, let alone mine.
Veev...
Just a quick, super quick tour.
Veev, I can't.
Can we talk about this later?
I got to finish getting ready.
Okay.
But we kind of need somewhere to put our stuff, you know.
Veev, can we do this later?
Have you seen my phone?
Thank you.
How long bastard here?
I don't know.
Somewhere between 18 or 36 years.
I can't sleep with wah-wah-wah.
I know, I know, but I think it gets better.
When?
When it get better?
I don't know, Tatiana.
Soon.
Okay?
When we meet, you tell me,
"Tatiana, we go live in Milan."
And that's still on the to-do list.
Now I work for catering, live with bastard and poopy milk smell.
Morning, everybody.
Morning.
Morning.
I no like.
What's wrong with her?
She's just...
Russian.
I'm gonna go.
Hey, bro, would you mind mailing this for me?
Just put some cardboard in there, so it doesn't get bent.
Yeah, sure.
What is it?
Headshot for Mr. Calvin Klein.
He told me to send him one, so who knows, right?
Could go to New York, Milan.
It could happen.
Hell, yeah.
Have a good day.
See ya.
Later, buddy.
Babe, I got to go too.
Wait.
I have an idea.
You know, maybe you can just take today off.
You know, we could take Rosemary around and show her the world, and then maybe we can get some of the stuff we need to make your place, you know, a little more family-friendly.
Veev, I'll be home around 6:00.
Can we talk about this then, please?
Lou, there's, like, a million things to do.
Veev, veev, I'm sorry.
I have to go to work.
Call me whenever you want.
Mwah.
Yeah, yeah, dad, I'm on my way.
Hey, you know what, I'm just gonna go stay at my mom's.
What?
Well, there's no space for us here, you obviously have no time to make space for us here, so we're just gonna go stay at my mom's.
Veev, I have to go to work.
Great, have a wonderful day at work.
- Boom, check it.
- Are you journaling now?
Because the only thing worse than journaling is reading to people from your journal.
It's Rosemary's baby book.
Veev said, 'cause I'm a writer, it's like my job.
She is such a good delegator.
I have got to get on that.
Go.
"Dear Rosemary, this is the story of what it was like during your first days on earth with your mom, dad, and all your friend-aunts and uncles."
Aw.
How's that?
It's okay.
I prefer a story with a little more raunchy, first-time sex in it.
What?
Tell me how Sophia Swanson cashed in her v-card, bitch.
Inquiring mind wants to know.
Sophia, you promised you would tell me.
Now tell me.
Okay, between you and me, though.
Pinky swear, pinky swear.
We went on a date.
Dinner date, drinks date, or "I have no hope of this ever working out" Starbucks tea date?
Drinks date.
Ooh.
It was nice.
Sexy nice, fancy nice, or
"Sophia Swanson from Minnesota" nice?
Sexy nice.
And then what happened?
Well, after several cocktails, we went back to my place and...
You just did it.
"Slammed up against the door" style.
No.
What?
No, we talked for a long time.
And then you did it.
Yeah.
In bed three times.
Sophia Swanson, rock steady.
A triple in your first at-bat.
Was that... was that a bad idea?
Oh, no, no.
After 23 years of nothing, I would say it pretty much couldn't be avoided.
So was he... was he big?
Umm...
Oh, super big.
No.
Oh.
Really small.
No, it's...
What?
It wasn't like tha it was different.
That's all I want to say right now.
Okay, okay, okay.
Please don't tell everyone.
Sophia, darling child, your secret is safe with me.
Hey, sorry to bother you at work.
- Oh, no, thank God you did.
Guess what?
- I'm at work.
What?
Sophia had sex.
Holy crap, with who?
Don't tell anybody, okay?
I can tell Raviva, though, right?
No, no, don't tell anyone else.
What's up?
Well, I'm sorry to do this so soon, but I need to light the bat signal.
Ooh, already?
What happened?
Hang on, I'll tell you.
What's up?
Sophia had sex.
Daph, what the...
Who was the lucky guy?
We don't know, but, shh, don't tell anybody.
- It's a secret.
- That's why you guys called?
No, ultimate bat signal.
Hang on a second.
I kind of can't talk right now.
Hey, Soph, good job.
On what?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I gotta go.
Wait, ultimate bat signal.
Ooh, what happened?
I'll tell you, but this has to be a secret, okay?
A real secret.
We wouldn't tell anybody.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Raviva's all bummed that the place isn't cleaned up and baby-friendly.
I want to surprise her with some stuff tonight, you know?
Make her feel she has more of a home.
Aw, best baby daddy ever.
What can we do?
Daphne, can you get baby clothes?
There's a thrift shop I've heard Raviva talk about.
Ew, I am not going in a thrift shop.
Daph, ultimate bat signal.
Fine.
I'm going in a thrift shop.
Miles, I can meet you on my lunch break, we can get a crib, but can you take it home and build it?
I'll see what I can do.
And, Sophia, this is really important.
I need you to... ooh, I gotta go.
Gotta go.
Sorry.
I'll text you.
Bye.
And, remember, this all has to be a secret.
Hey, there, gossip girl.
May I help you?
I see you finally figured out how to make a conference call.
Yeah, yeah, just in time.
I'm having some baby daddy issues, and I needed to call in some favors, getting her done.
That's a cool story.
Listen, the phone system isn't your personal turntable where you dj your life, brah.
It's a business tool for doing business at work.
- Solid?
- Yeah, we're totally solid.
Great, let's keep it that way.
Oh, and I know you think you're saving the planet with this double-sided crap, but people don't have any place to write their notes on these things.
Single-side, brah.
Single-side.
Hey, Dave...
Tables five, six and ten, even other places sitting, Miles.
Now.
I know, that's I told you.
I'm on it.
Fantastic.
So, what're you still doing here?
I've loved your last toite.
Mine?
I love yours.
Working love the late.
I'm so following that.
- Are you can stalking me?
- Me?
Never.
Are you about to ask to leave you the only one audition or you so following or smth.?
No.
- Actually...
- Nice try.
Mile's staying.
All right, everyone, town hall meeting time.
Feel free to speak your mind, ask for help.
Remember, there's no dumb questions or comments.
Even though I feel like I shouldn't have to say this, no cell phones, please.
Take 'em out.
Great.
Okay.
I'll go first.
There are a lot of chemical-using customers out there that aren't using our chemicals.
They're using other people's chemicals, and I think it would be a lot better if we had a world where the chemical-using customers, they were using our chemicals.
Does anybody have any ideas how to make that happen?
Damn it, Lou, I know that's your phone.
It's in front of you.
Sorry, I thought it was on silent.
Anybody?
Ideas?
Where are we supposed to put all of our stuff, huh?
You have any ideas?
You know what, why don't we start emptying drawers out?
Let's call your dad.
Maybe his schedule has opened up.
Personal call?
Yeah, a personal call with my personal phone.
At work.
Leave a message at the sound of the tone.
Hey, hope you're having a lovely day.
Give me the phone.
What?
Give me the phone.
I'll give it back at the end of the day.
Um, whenever you get a sec, me and Rosemary had a question for you, so give us a call back.
Okay, thanks, bye.
Paul, I got a brand-new baby at home.
And a job that's gonna pay for all the things that baby needs.
It's in your own best interest.
Give me the phone.
Unless you want to go run and tell dad.
You want to tell dad?
Is it in any way possible for me to not attend this I.T. lunch thing?
Like, I pretty much get Google docs.
What's the conflict?
There's no conflict.
My friends had a baby, and they want me to get baby clothes.
I'll be back by, like, 1:00, 1:30, possibly 3:00?
You're kind of putting me in a tough position here, glover.
Is it really that important?
It's a lunch meeting about calendars.
If learning about all the fabulous complexities of syncing calendars is really that important, then why have the meeting at lunch, right?
What I meant, glover, is that, if you're going to miss the meeting and go roaming all over town, I just thought maybe
I should go with you.
Go with me?
Yeah.
Last time we had lunch, we had a lot more than lunch.
And then I found out you had a girlfriend.
But I broke up with her.
It was still a major event in my short but dramatic career.
I'm really, really sorry.
Clean slate?
Clean slate.
Great.
Miss glover, would you please do me the honor of allowing me to accompany you while you shop for baby clothes?
I could maybe do that.
But you would need to create an event on my calendar and invite me.
That's how this works.
Raviva, you have to call him now.
Mom, I have called him.
I've texted him, I've poked him,
I've called him three times, he hasn't picked up once.
You are, like, the only human being who's responded to me all day.
Look at this thug mansion with its pretzel pieces and porn DVDs and nowhere to put even one pair of my underwear.
Baby, it kills me to see you this way.
You have to take control.
I can't take control, mom.
It's their place.
Boys at this age are not mature enough to have a place, let alone be boyfriends or parents.
And, thanks to these video games, they all think they're supposed to stay 13 forever.
For the sake of that little girl, you have to take charge.
You're right.
Let's take charge.
Let's...
let's clean this place up.
Let's make room for me and
Rosemary.
I'm going to yoga.
You clean this place up.
Wait.
No, trust me.
Turn this place into an adult dwelling, and they'll thank you for it.
But, mom...
Gotta go.
Veev, it's me.
Call me on my office phone when you get this.
My douche bag boss took my phone.
Bye.
Hey, Paul.
Tatiana, it's just five tables.
Why you go?
It doesn't matter why I go, okay?
I'm just asking you to do me a favor and take care of my tables.
Why you go?
You have new girl.
No, no.
I'm going to the baby store with Lou.
We're buying a crib, and then he asked me to take it home and build it.
Oh, for baby, I suppo of course for baby.
See, it's already more problem with this baby.
Look, it's not my fault.
It's an ultimate bat signal.
I'm bound by honor to respond.
This baby is ruining my life.
Whoa, you two are having a baby?
No.
We're not having a baby.
And what is this ultimate bat signal?
What... what food for bastard?
Toy for bastard?
Dude.
What?
Pay me, I'll take your tables.
Thank you.
What is ultimate bat signal?
What?
You wouldn't understand.
Tatiana.
Uh, Cheryl.
Hey, hey, I'm sorry.
I think I have to go home.
What is it this time?
Burning diarrhea.
Really?
Yeah.
Last night, my friends and I went for hot wings, and they were like, "let's get the super triple-x," and I was like, "no, that's a bad idea."
Turns out it's a bad idea.
Know what, that's fine.
Just go.
Good luck with that.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Why do people own porn anymore?
Can't they just watch it online?
Seems severely old-fashioned not to just be streaming this crap.
Mm, that looks like it hurts.
I got to tell you, kid, it is not easy being a woman.
Men can talk all they want about love, but, at the end of the day, when everyone goes off to work, it is just you and your baby, baby.
Ladies who munch.
I'm a sucker for a play on words.
Yeah, we'll hang onto this one.
Hmm.
"Slow children at play."
Okay.
I think I'm gonna make an executive decision.
Thinking about this bad boy?
Yeah, it looks pretty good.
Yeah, if you're trying to strangle your baby.
Nah, trust me, these things are jaws.
They'll snap your kid's head straight off.
You boys are gonna want something with a few more safety features than this murder box.
What about that one?
That one... that's the one I like to call the Terminator.
Let's not get that one.
Now this one, this one over here, this is the one that Jay-Z and Beyonce got for Blue Ivy, the Bellini.
Damn.
It's kind of expensive.
Very expensive, but let me ask you boys this... how much do you love your baby?
Oh, yeah, it's not our baby.
Oh, of course it is.
There's all kinds of families.
Look, you guys are gonna do great.
Just get a good crib.
Do you have a store credit card?
Dads, let me snag you an application.
All right, so you're gonna take this home and put it together in your room?
Yes, in my room, where Raviva won't know.
All right.
Do you think I should explain to our friend right there?
No, no, dude, just let it go.
Solidarity.
Pretty soon we have a crib.
We had a baby.
We're having a little one.
Yup, all right, let's go.
Oh my god.
I've should never have calling you.
No niece of mine is ever gonna wear these hepatitis hand-me-downs.
Why do you have to get the clothes from a thrift shop to begin with?
Well, you know, my friends, they're super green about everything, and I guess, if your baby wears clothes that someone else has pooped in, then Al Gore doesn't cry green Jesus tears in heaven.
Ugh.
Look at this.
This is septic.
I think it would look nice on you, though, so...
Don't you think?
You're gonna be a good mom.
You think?
Yeah.
You have a very mom energy.
Let's go to baby gap.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey, I'm Sophia.
I called about the... the device.
Come on in.
Hey.
You're home.
I thought you were gonna be at work all day.
Something came up.
Okay.
Did you hear about Soph?
Mm-hmm.
Daphne called.
Who's the guy?
Nobody knows.
Place looks great.
Thank you.
Took a little initiative in the absence of any meaningful partner to confer with.
What do you think?
Good move.
Thanks.
Where's my sign?
What, the "slow children at play" sign?
Yeah.
Threw it out.
You what?
I put it out in the trash.
Someone already got it.
Oh, of course somebody got it.
You know, it's the coolest sign in the world.
"Slow children at play"?
Should I slow down?
Are the children slow?
It's the only double entendre in the public works system.
This is an adult dwelling now.
I gotta go shake this off.
Wait, Miles.
Can you just leave me alone a minute?
Miles, can I come in?
No!
I'm shaking it off.
Look, I'm all right, I'm fine.
You just can't come in right now 'cause I'm shaking it off.
See ya.
Okay, your hippie friends wanted you to buy used baby clothes.
Yes.
You just bought new baby clothes.
Yes.
I'm starting to see that your challenges executing simple tasks at work might be a part of a pattern.
This is only one phase of a many-phased plan.
How many phases are there?
Unclear.
Are you a member of the washer-dryer-owning community?
As of a few months ago, yes, I finally am.
And, on a scale of one to ten, how much do you not want to go back to the office today?
If I get to be with you?
48.
Okay, so why don't we stop, get a coffee, and just go back to your place?
But no funny stuff.
"You are my boss after all,
Todd, and a bit of a cad, as history's shown."
That's some tricky you're pulling there, mister.
Too far?
Yeah.
But I like it.
Just call daddy, huh?
No big deal.
I'm the only one with a business relationship to you that knows your extension.
That's a personal call.
He's not picking up.
If you answer that, I-I will march your little ass up to your dad's office right now and tell him you do not understand reality.
Damn it.
Let's try your aunt.
How's the bug?
About to lose an Uncle and maybe a mommy if we don't act fast.
We?
Yeah, we.
I kind of need you to steal me sign.
You need me to steal you a sign?
I need you to steal me a street sign.
Look, I threw it out, and Miles is, like, totally, completely pissed at me.
Okay.
Okay.
What kind of street sign?
I have to admit, glover, when you said you wanted to skip the
Google docs meeting, I didn't think this is how it would end.
Yeah, see, no one ever sees the "artificial distressing of baby clothes" thing coming.
But that's why it feels so right when it does.
Bleach?
It's right here, doctor.
Thank you.
And the coffee.
Just to give it all that real free-trade organic poop tone.
There.
Now what do you want to do?
That's not sex.
Or sex-adjacent.
It's like having a puppy.
Where'd you learn to cook like this?
I spend two weeks in Tuscany every summer studying with
Mario Batali.
Seriously?
No, I learned from my grandfather, standing on a stool in the kitchen.
That is sort of painfully adorable.
Sorta.
My parents broke up when I was nine, and they couldn't agree on custody, so I went to go live with my dad's folks at a resort they owned in northern
Minnesota.
Sorry.
That's okay.
Anyway, she did the cleaning, he did the cooking, so I helped him in the kitchen.
Yeah, well, you did good, kid.
So what happened to your mom?
You said you lived with your dad.
Yeah.
She... she ran off with the neighbor when I was five.
No.
That really happens?
Yes, it does.
They live in Hawaii now.
And, you know, I hear from her once a year.
I was just talking with my friends the other night about how we want to be better than our parents.
I mean, I think it just... it must be so hard to stay together.
It's definitely not easy.
The couples I know that have stayed together, it seems to me it takes a combination of hard work, selflessness, and luck.
You have to be lucky enough to find the right person to begin with.
Not everyone does.
What are you doing?
Glover, what are you doing?
Making a big mistake.
You are coming with me.
I was just putting this back.
And done.
I own you, bitch!
Oh, damn.
Extras.
What's up?
Sophia just got arrested.
What?
Whoo-hoo!
Baby's first bailout.
Hey.
Hey.
How was your first solo mission as Amelia Momhart?
Crashed, burned, and was never heard from again because someone doesn't care at all about me or the human being he forced into existence with his sperm.
Sorry.
Where have you been?
Nowhere.
I recognize the look of the recently ravished.
I may have just cavorted.
With the boss dude again?
Yes, but it was only in the service of getting these baby clothes laundered.
Daph, that's not gonna end well.
Ending has never been my strong suit.
I'm more of a beginner.
You know me.
Okay, here's the culprit.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
Because the suspect in question has no record of any previous offenses, we're letting her go.
We will make sure she suffers.
Don't let it happen again.
I won't.
I promise.
Freedom!
Thank God I'm out of there.
Sophia Swanson, what a week.
Oh, right?
Legendary.
I mean, first you get arrested for attempted robbery.
Then you take your first trip to pound town.
Miles!
You told him.
I may have let it slip, yeah.
Sophia, I'm...
I'm sorry.
Daphne, you promised.
Sophia, I'm sorry.
Come on.
Sophia!
Sophia, listen to me.
It's okay.
We all know.
You don't know anything.
You don't know anything!
Just leave me alone.
Sophia.
I may have misplayed that one.
♪
Are you sure you want to leave?
Yes.
I need change.
I'm sorry this isn't simpler.
These guys are my friends, and
I've never really had much of a family.
My friends are my family.
It's okay.
I understand.
Who is that guy?
Arkady.
New boyfriend.
And he rides in a limo?
No.
He drives limo.
Tatiana... look, you are good friend.
Bad boyfriend, but good friend.
And good Uncle to bastard.
I'll see you in Milan.
Maybe.
Be safe.
Who is it?
Everybody's worried about you.
It's you they should be worried about.
I'm gonna kill you.
The only reason I came here was because I knew that, if I went home, there'd be no one to save me from your...
Insufferable charm.
It wasn't like gossip.
I was happy for you.
But you promised not to tell.
I live my life like a reality show.
We all know this.
I screw things up just to keep myself interested, but, if I knew how serious this was for you, I would never have said anything.
I was applying Daphne rules to
Sophia life, and it was a mistake, okay?
I won't do it again.
There'll never be another chance to do it again.
That's the point.
Thank you.
Okay, I'm just...
I'm gonna be honest here real quick.
Just tell me, why are you so secret agenting this thing?
It happens to everybody.
Shh.
Honey, I'm home.
Where have you been?
I know.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I had this stupid...
I've been calling you all day long.
I know.
My boss took my phone.
So you couldn't call me once?
I did.
I left a message.
Didn't get any message.
Well, I definitely left one.
I'm sorry if you didn't...
shoes.
I didn't get any message.
Okay, well, I definitely did leave you a message.
All I wanted was five minutes of conversation.
But then my mom came over and told me to take charge, so I did.
And then I lost Miles's sign, and then Sophia got arrested, and I just hate this day so frickin' much.
I do too.
It's always tough when a friend gets arrested.
Raviva.
I think that Rosemary and I should just go stay at my mom's.
Raviva.
I really...
I'm not mad.
I just think that it would be for the best.
Raviva, come with me.
Where?
What do you...
I have something to show you.
What?
What could you possibly show me that could possibly make up for what I've been through today?
Just wait.
Is it your little thing?
I've seen it.
Raviva.
It's normal size.
Miles, get in here.
What?
What?
What are you doing?
Surprise!
Surprise.
What did you guys... wait, you guys did all of this?
For us?
No, for you.
Yeah, he told us to.
All I did was light the bat signal.
These guys did the rest.
You guys, Lou, I spent the whole day thinking that...
I know.
You weren't...
I know.
Thank you.
This is amazing.
Wow.
God, this crib is amazing.
Miles built it.
Piece of cake.
Turns out I am pretty handy.
These clothes... are you kidding me?
Daphne went to a thrift shop.
No.
Yes, I did.
What?
I know.
Amazing.
They're perfect.
Thank you so much.
- I'm so glad you like them.
- I love them.
Took a lot of searching.
Mm, but it's kind of fun, though, isn't it?
Oh, totally fun.
They look brand-new.
I know, right?
Amazing.
There's one more thing.
Sophia.
Here you go.
What is this?
What is it?
I don't know.
Just open it up.
What is this?
You guys!
A four-track?
What does it do?
'Cause I've been carrying this thing around all day wondering.
A four-track is what you use to record songs.
I can record songs.
Why did you do all of this?
Well, just because you're my baby ma...
co-parent with benefits doesn't mean you're not still gonna rock.
Girl's gotta rock.
Yes, but this must have been super expensive.
I'll sell my fixie to make it back.
I can't ride around with a baby on the back of a fixed-gear bike.
Highly unsafe.
Welcome home.
What?
I am never listening to my mom ever again.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you guys.
Amazing.
"And by the time we all got home from the police station, we were even more tired than before.
Taking care of a baby is tiring, but it's even more tiring when you're pretty much just babies yourselves.
I don't know how people in their 30s do it.
Before I sign off, Rosemary, I want to tell you one last thing.
You have a lot to look forward to in this life you're about to live.
But the best thing of all is something I didn't even know about until just recently.
It's called 'falling in love.' someday you, little Rosemary, you're gonna meet someone who makes you feel this deep rush inside your heart, like your whole life is filling up and speeding up, like there will
never be enough time to do everything.
I'm so excited that you're gonna feel this one day.
Like I said, I just started feeling it now for the first time because I've met a very special person, who just in the space of one week has changed my life completely, and I can't
wait...
To see her again."
Her?
Yeah.
Her.
Good job.
Um, what's... what's that for?
We've had a bet going on for about five years that I just lost.
What are those for?
I don't know.
I hereby induct 'Snoddy' Snodgrass Spencer into full membership of the greatest club in the world... the Comanchero Outlaw Motorcycle Club.
You got a son, I got a club.
That's a way to make a girl feel special.
You know it snows in Texas?
We'd live somewhere down south, where it's warm... you, me, Joely.
Raise some kids.
Are you serious?
I'd love some kids.
I know that.
I mean, about Texas.
Yeah.
Why not?
What... you'd just leave everyone behind?
Wha-hey!
Can you do it again?
I don't want to kill or maim, OK?
I just want to make the enemy aware that we mean business.
Line two!
The Campbells out here in Australia, Jock, are some of the toughest fighters in Sydney.
You never trust a Campbell... ever.
He's not above our law, prez or not.
We take it to the next meeting, vote him down, he loses his colours.
I'm splittin' the club.
I'm startin' another chapter out west.
Are you comin' with me?
Of course I'll go with ya.
I'm a Commo because of you.
You stay here.
I don't want you with me.
So, what's goin' on, Ness?
Got nothin' to do with me.
Or you.
It's between them.
I've got my reasons, Snoddy, OK?
And that's the way it is.
Alright?
I don't give a shit.
You know, one day, Jock, someone's gonna make damn sure you give a shit.
I love the bloody club as much as you do.
But it used to be about ridin' bikes, Jock, and havin' fun.
But that just wasn't enough for you, was it?
Shit!
Bandidos forever!
Bandidos forever!
Get out of the Comancheros while you still can.
And you tell Jock to stay the fuck off our patch or he's a dead man.
That's better.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Ooh!
Lard, wanna set 'em up?
Come on, boys.
What do you want, Davo?
I'm here to have it out with Jock.
What?
Man on man.
Just the two of us.
No weapons.
Just our fists.
Whose idea's this?
Nobody's.
Well, you're lucky he's not here.
You'd better come inside, then... if you're game.
What's the bloody Bandaid doin' here?
Testin' how brave he is.
Ah, should be fun.
Hey, Davo.
When can we come to your joint and share those bloody girls?
You're not goin' to his clubhouse.
If you want to flex your muscles, there's plenty of other clubs.
We're both too big for this.
We're not gonna close you down and you're not gonna close us.
We'll see about that.
I agree with Davo.
Come on, fellas.
We're all Comanchero underneath, aren't we?
You think we ain't heard about Snoddy threatening to kill Jock?
Well, that's not the only bullshit being talked, Leroy.
Now, the best thing for you to do is fuck off while you can!
I just thought there might be someone not as fucked up as everyone else.
I'll have a word with Jock.
At least you came here.
Yeah.
So, you've been to Granville?
Who told ya?
Brothers talk.
Did someone invite ya?
Look, I just thought...
You don't do nothin' unless you're told.
You think Jock or any of them are gonna listen to reason?
Well, probably not.
So, what's the point?
You just look weak.
It's not weak to talk.
If they see weak, this thing will never end.
And if Jock sent someone here, I'd laugh in his face.
So... we're gonna sit and do nothin'.
We're not doin' nothin'.
Fuck off!
You fuckin' prick!
Prick!
- How is he?
- How do you think?
The police have been.
Shit.
Yeah, I know...
you don't talk to the cops.
Well, this is different.
This time, they tried to kill him.
Does he know who it was?
Nuh.
How's the bike?
Cops took it.
Do we care?
You gotta do somethin', Snow.
You gotta make this end.
Why'd you let him split the club?
Everything was fine before that.
You've been makin' allegations.
Who says?
The cops.
You've been talkin' to them, have ya?
They didn't get nothin' from me.
But some bastard gave 'em my phone number.
I don't know nothin' about that.
So, you think we tried to kill Jock, hey?
Run him off the road?
If we wanted him dead... he'd be dead.
And you.
And anyone else.
Well, if you didn't do it, who did?
I don't know.
Why don't you ask a fortune-teller?
Jock's a pretty shithouse rider.
Maybe someone got pissed off with him.
So, it was just some...
crazy straight out there, was it?
Mate, if we wanted to get you... we wouldn't do it at night.
We'd do it right in front of your face.
With these.
Come on.
Come on.
Fuckin' do both of ya.
You're weak as piss.
So's Jock.
# Well, now, baby
# Somethin's goin' on
# Well, now, baby
# There's somethin' goin' on
# Now, tell me, baby
# Where has that good thing gone?
# I'm down here, baby
# On my bended knee
# I'm down here, babe
# On my bended knee... #
Thanks, Snod, for not wearing your colours.
What about him?
It's OK.
They're not causing any trouble.
Three beers and a lemon squash, thanks.
You're in me way.
Somethin' on your mind?
Yeah... that you might hassle the publican like you did the other night.
Wasn't me.
Or bash one of our members.
Wasn't me neither.
You piece of shit.
Even your vice-prez can't go to a swap meet without bashing' one of our blokes.
You fuckin' cowards.
Go and tell someone who cares.
Dickhead.
That's the trouble with you Commos.
You haven't worked out that if you push us, we push back twice as hard.
# Give me one more time
# We could make a new start... #
Aaagh!
Aaagh!
Aaagh!
Aaagh!
# Give me one more time... #
Aaaaagh!
# We could make a new start... #
Aaagh!
Sorry, love.
Tell Bob to send me the bill.
# We could make a new start... #
- Bit unfit, are youse?
- I'll say.
What happened to you?
Bandaids got us at the pub.
What could we do?
They had the numbers.
Fucking cowards...
this is all about the Bandaids tryin' to prove they're harder than we are!
I think they're lookin' for an all-in blue, Jock.
Wouldn't the Campbells love that?
I'll tell you somethin'.
That won't be happenin', alright?
We'll be fightin' this on our own terms, in accordance with the seven elements.
"I will force the enemy to take our strength for weakness
"and our weakness for strength."
And I'll get Foggy to call a council of war, alright?
Nobody... does that to Jock Ross!
Fucking nobody!
We approach by the sea, at night, and come in through the park.
There's a jetty.
Why go through the park?
We have to get around, underneath the back of the house, take three boxes and the detonating device.
And what... blow up the place?
That's mass murder, mate.
Only if you get caught.
If he's doin' it, we'll get caught, Jock.
We'll wait until no-one's there, then we go 'boom'.
Oh, right.
And who makes it go 'boom'?
I do.
I'd have to go out the back.
Oh, shit, that's clever.
Why don't you blow yourself up in the process and destroy the evidence?
Hey, we're discussing possibilities here.
If you've got nothin' to offer, then shut up.
Well, I say we take 'em up on their offer.
Strike Force versus the Campbells.
- I know where I'd put my money.
- Oh, do you?
'Cause mine'd be on them.
Alright, the last thing that we want is a fair fight.
Is that what happened with Dog?
I mean, have a fuckin' look at him.
Alright?
This calls for an escalation.
Yeah, well, I'm against blowing anything up, Jock.
I mean, for Christ sakes, how has it come to this?
I don't know!
Alright?
I suggest you go and ask them.
What do you think, Fogg?
I'm with you, Prez.
Nothin' face to face.
Exactly.
Nothin' face to face.
Which doesn't leave a whole heap of options, does it?
Hey!
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh!
Chopper!
You scared the shit out of me.
Give me a hand, would ya?
Alright.
Box of fire lighters.
Four kilos of bangers.
Two boxes of bourbon.
Should get us through the night.
Nice one.
What'd I miss?
# Astra Wally is a real mean cat

We got 'em good, eh.
I reckon they got the message.
I don't reckon they did.
We need to bash 'em all.
It's enough for now.
I disagree.
You give me the word, I'll take all the blokes and we'll finish it.
You're not thinkin' ahead.
There's more of us and he knows that.
And we're better-lookin'.
Come on, Shadow.
If we're gonna have a chat, we may as well chat to the ladies!

JB Fencing.
Vanessa, hi.
How are you?
Oh, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, is Jock there?
Do you think he might speak to Snod?
Yeah, I don't...
I don't know what about.
Yeah, I can...
I can wait.
It's Lee Denholm.
Snoddy wants to talk to you.
Well, why doesn't he phone me himself?
Will you talk to him or not?
You there, Lee?
Yeah, I'm here.
Put Snoddy on, will ya?
Hello.
Jock?
What do YOU want?
We need to talk.
It's a bit late for that, wouldn't you say?
If we don't, someone's gonna get hurt, real bad.
Someone already has.
You bashed my men at the pub.
That's not where this started.
Well... that's not where it'll finish.
So, now you're taking pot-shots at the clubhouse.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Well, I don't expect you to admit it.
Any more than you'll admit to running me off the road.
We said we didn't do it.
Me neither.
And next...
We need to meet.
Why?
Both clubs, in a football field, and fight it out.
Is this the Campbell plan?
Well... no.
They enjoy that too much.
Well, I never heard you walk away from a blue, Jock.
I'm not backin' away from anything'.
Alright?
I'm just employin' other tactics.
I was going to phone you anyway, to make my own declaration.
What?
Of war.
And there'll be no fights at football grounds or frontal attacks or conventional engagements.
Alright?
This is guerilla warfare... at night, in your home, when you least expect it.
And like all guerilla wars, it's going to be a long one.
A very, very long one.
So, watch your back.
He wanted to tell me officially that we're at war.
A guerilla war.
Bring it on.
I told him we should sort this out the usual way but he rejected me offer.
So, we need to decide what our next move is.
Hit their clubhouse, like they hit ours.
Uh, well, that would involve the cops even more.
But we're not telling them anything, are we?
Maybe we should.
I don't know why we're protecting them.
We're not protecting them.
We're just not squealing.
We gotta do this our own way.
I'll ring Jock and tell him what we think of his declaration.
But if he won't listen, these are the options...
We do nothin'.
We hit their clubhouse like they hit ours.
Yep.
We go to their pub, we bash the shit out of them, we take their colours.
Now you're talkin'.
Alright, meeting's over.
You didn't have much to say for yourself.
Just tell the cops what they need to know, nothin' more.
Alright?
This shit's gettin' out of hand.
You and Jock need to sit down and talk.
Mate, it takes two to tango.
I suppose you're not as stubborn as he is.
That's what you think the problem is?
Me being stubborn?
No, he didn't say that.
We're just tryin' to help.
Well, you can start with some loyalty.
Yes...
And you keep your bloody nose clean.
What's that mean, Snod?
No guns.
We need another 50 of these.
But get Leroy to pick them up, make sure they're cut to length.
You sure he should take 'em to the job?
If it's at the owner's expense.
I'm not paying for any if they go missing.
Are you gonna call Snoddy?
He phoned again.
I spoke with Lee.
Well, you shouldn't have.
They're Bandaids.
He wants you to call.
Anyway, I'm gonna take Holly-Ann to the doctors.
Her throat's not gettin' any better.
You know, she should have her tonsils out.
I'll put the answer phone on.
Don't bother.
If they want to phone back, they can phone back.
No-one wants to talk to a bloody machine.
That was Ness.
Jock got your message.
And?
He's not gonna call.
Why not?
'Cause he's your former prez and you need to go and see him.
Is that what he said?
No, that's what I'm saying.
I'm a president too.
I don't get this shit from other clubs!
Hey, Joel, can you go watch some telly?
Thanks, baby.
He's fuckin' lovin' this.
Yeah, of course he is.
Yeah, he makes his declaration of war and fuck the consequences.
Which is why you have to be better than him.
Well, we're not accepting war.
Fuck him.
We're not backin' down.
Well, that'll work.
Sure.
Oh, Jesus, Lee!
Can you fuckin' help me out here?
!
I'm sorry.
I just...
I'm sorry.
I think you should go and see him, though.
He thinks we're running scared.
And?
We fuckin' outnumber him, 2 to 1.
And he's got guns and he wants to use 'em.
He's prepared.
And so have we.
Is that what you think?
Hang on.
No, no, no.
I thought you said that you weren't gonna do that.
I thought you told him that.
This isn't our idea!
We don't do anything!
He declared on us!
Right.
He declared on you.
We don't want war and we all voted against it.
War.
You don't understand.
I understand.
I understand you bikie clubs are loyal and you take no shit and you look after us, but... are those fuckin' colours worth dyin' for?
Snoddy, are they worth more than you and me?
I don't know what you want me to say.
- Isn't that Foggy's ute?
- Yeah.
What's he doin' on our turf?
Pricks.
Go!
Go!
Fuck!
Come on!
Where was he?
Just here.
What's he doing near my bloody house?
Got no idea.
There he is!
Hey!
Come here!
Fuck!
Come here, you little...
Get down!
You right?
Yeah.
You?
Yeah.
Shit.
Fuck.
So, who was on sentry?
I dunno.
Who was on sentry?
Don't ask him!
You should bloody know!
Jesus Christ!
We got shotgun blasts goin' through the window and you sleep through the whole thing?
We had a...
..pretty big night.
You had a big night?
!
You're a disorganised, useless rabble!
Now, I want sentries 24 hours, alright?
Here and at my house... you got that?
Yes, Prez.
Well, get it organised!
And you...
Right?
You double the fortifications, alright?
I want more barbed wire and I want boards on the windows.
You had a big night!
If you were in the army, they'd take you out and shoot ya!
Fuckin'...
Do you think this is some kind of a fucking joke, do ya?
!
Huh?
This is full-on hostilities, alright?
This is all-out war!
And big nights, Leroy, they're fuckin' cancelled too, alright?
Done!
You take another mouthful of that beer,
I'll bend you over that table and I'll ram it straight up your arse.
Alright?
They're done.
Alright?
Over!
Alright?
You're the sergeant-at-arms.
You stand down the troops!
If you'd call 'em that!
'Cause I wouldn't!
You're a disgrace!
The lot of ya!
Jock Ross?
Who wants to know?
I'm Detective Sergeant Masterson.
This is Detective Constable Moran.
We're making, uh, inquiries about a shooting incident.
We have reason to believe that some of your men might have been involved.
Uh, members of your motorcycle club.
So, what's that got to do with me?
Do you know anything about the incident?
No.
Or... who might have been involved?
You clowns woke me up to ask me this?
'Cause according to our information, various members of your club and another, the Bandidos, are... well, they're taking pot-shots at each other.
Pot-shots?
Oh, right.
Is there, like, a prize?
Are you denying shots were fired at your clubhouse on 18 August?
Pass.
Your neighbours lodged a complaint but... but you didn't.
No. 'Cause I wasn't there.
Several of your men were.
Do you have any weapons on the premises, Mr Ross?
Weapons?
No.
But you have a licence for a number of firearms.
I have a property at Mangrove Mountain.
I got guns up there.
Properly secured?
No.
They're just lyin' around on the fuckin' tables.
Of course they're properly secured!
Why do you have these weapons?
Well, sport.
You know, rabbits, pigs.
Why does anyone have guns?
Now, that's an interesting question.
Don't be smart with me, Ross.
My gang's a whole lot bigger than yours.
Is that a threat?
You bet.
I mean, you can bash each other as much as you like.
But you start firing guns in public places, expect a whole lot of grief from us.
Hmm?
Well, I'm quaking' in me boots.
Right.
Well, we'll be back, hmm?
Alright, good.
Give me some notice and I'll put the kettle on.
Come on.
Inside, darl.
You go play with Joely, alright?
Go and play with Joely.
Hey, Chrissie.
Hey.
Want a beer?
Yeah, sounds good.
Hey.
How are things?
Yeah, good.
Joely, why don't you go outside and play with the girls, mate?
Good boy.
I'm leavin', Snod.
I'm not takin' any more chances with Chris and the kids.
There's me colours.
But we're brothers, mate.
Don't pull that.
They've got me so worried, before Chris takes the kids to school,
I'm checkin' the fuckin' car for bombs.
At night, we're pushin' the couch up against the bloody front door.
It's gonna blow over.
Is it?
Yes.
I got responsibilities.
You know, in case you haven't noticed, they're not right in the fuckin' head.
I can't risk my family, mate.
Neither should you.
You know Jock's gonna see this as a win?
Fuck him.
Are your brothers goin' too?
We haven't talked about it.
But you don't have to worry.
Caes and Shad, they love this shit.
And they're staunch.
Will you think about it... for me?
Will you give me a couple of days?
Look... you feel the same in a week,
I'll let you go.
You got me word.
Go on.
What happened to just... a good root, a bit of a knuckle and a long ride, eh?
One week, Snod.
One week.
OK.
Right, fellas.
First off, I won't be joinin' youse tonight.
I'm on a promise to Lee's family.
Don't worry, Snod.
I'll drink all your beer for you.
Piss off, you bastard.
You do anyway.
The swap meet at the Viking Tavern tomorrow at Milperra... it's a compulsory meeting.
And if the Comanchero are there, we will bash them and we will take their colours and put an end to this.
And you remember, we've got the numbers, so I expect every one of youse there tomorrow to maintain that advantage.
Alright?
Boys, I didn't want this fight.
But I'm not fuckin' backing' away from it either.
I made a promise to the Americans, when we took their colours... that we would wear 'em and we would wear 'em proud.
We're not some tin-pot, made-up club like the fuckin' Comancheros.
We're part of the Bandido Nation... part of a global brotherhood.
Right?
So, I'll see you all tomorrow.
Bandidos forever!
Forever Bandidos!
Bandidos forever!
Forever Bandidos!
Bandidos forever!
Forever Bandidos!
Bandidos forever!
Forever Bandidos!
Bandidos forever!
Forever Bandidos!
Bandidos forever!
Forever Bandidos!
Bandidos forever!
Happy Father's Day.
Oi!
Come on!
Ah, you ducked!
- Yeah, he wants a daughter.
- Why?
'Cause he thinks boys are trouble.
If they start firing?
That's not gonna happen.
So much for a day with the family.
You're bloody obsessed with the Bandidos... not doin' you any good, either.
This is the type of day that can make a club.
It's also the type of day that can break one.
You go hard, you go straight, and you wear these colours with pride!
Comanchero forever!
Forever Comanchero!
That's better.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Ooh!
Lard, wanna set 'em up?
Come on, boys.
What do you want, Davo?
I'm here to have it out with Jock.
What?
Man on man.
Just the two of us.
No weapons.
Just our fists.
Whose idea's this?
Nobody's.
Well, you're lucky he's not here.
You'd better come inside, then... if you're game.
What's the bloody Bandaid doin' here?
Testin' how brave he is.
Ah, should be fun.
Hey, Davo.
When can we come to your joint and share those bloody girls?
You're not goin' to his clubhouse.
If you want to flex your muscles, there's plenty of other clubs.
We're both too big for this.
We're not gonna close you down and you're not gonna close us.
We'll see about that.
I agree with Davo.
Come on, fellas.
We're all Comanchero underneath, aren't we?
You think we ain't heard about Snoddy threatening to kill Jock?
Well, that's not the only bullshit being talked, Leroy.
Now, the best thing for you to do is fuck off while you can!
I just thought there might be someone not as fucked up as everyone else.
I'll have a word with Jock.
At least you came here.
Yeah.
So, you've been to Granville?
Who told ya?
Brothers talk.
Did someone invite ya?
Look, I just thought...
You don't do nothin' unless you're told.
You think Jock or any of them are gonna listen to reason?
Well, probably not.
So, what's the point?
You just look weak.
It's not weak to talk.
If they see weak, this thing will never end.
And if Jock sent someone here, I'd laugh in his face.
So... we're gonna sit and do nothin'.
We're not doin' nothin'.
Fuck off!
You fuckin' prick!
Prick!
- How is he?
- How do you think?
The police have been.
Shit.
Yeah, I know...
you don't talk to the cops.
Well, this is different.
This time, they tried to kill him.
Does he know who it was?
Nuh.
How's the bike?
Cops took it.
Do we care?
You gotta do somethin', Snow.
You gotta make this end.
Why'd you let him split the club?
Everything was fine before that.
You've been makin' allegations.
Who says?
The cops.
You've been talkin' to them, have ya?
They didn't get nothin' from me.
But some bastard gave 'em my phone number.
I don't know nothin' about that.
So, you think we tried to kill Jock, hey?
Run him off the road?
If we wanted him dead... he'd be dead.
And you.
And anyone else.
Well, if you didn't do it, who did?
I don't know.
Why don't you ask a fortune-teller?
Jock's a pretty shithouse rider.
Maybe someone got pissed off with him.
So, it was just some...
crazy straight out there, was it?
Mate, if we wanted to get you... we wouldn't do it at night.
We'd do it right in front of your face.
With these.
Come on.
Come on.
Fuckin' do both of ya.
You're weak as piss.
So's Jock.
# Well, now, baby
# Somethin's goin' on
# Well, now, baby
# There's somethin' goin' on
# Now, tell me, baby
# Where has that good thing gone?
# I'm down here, baby
# On my bended knee
# I'm down here, babe
# On my bended knee... #
Thanks, Snod, for not wearing your colours.
What about him?
It's OK.
They're not causing any trouble.
Three beers and a lemon squash, thanks.
You're in me way.
Somethin' on your mind?
Yeah... that you might hassle the publican like you did the other night.
Wasn't me.
Or bash one of our members.
Wasn't me neither.
You piece of shit.
Even your vice-prez can't go to a swap meet without bashing' one of our blokes.
You fuckin' cowards.
Go and tell someone who cares.
Dickhead.
That's the trouble with you Commos.
You haven't worked out that if you push us, we push back twice as hard.
# Give me one more time
# We could make a new start... #
Aaagh!
Aaagh!
Aaagh!
Aaagh!
# Give me one more time... #
Aaaaagh!
# We could make a new start... #
Aaagh!
Sorry, love.
Tell Bob to send me the bill.
# We could make a new start... #
- Bit unfit, are youse?
- I'll say.
What happened to you?
Bandaids got us at the pub.
What could we do?
They had the numbers.
Fucking cowards...
this is all about the Bandaids tryin' to prove they're harder than we are!
I think they're lookin' for an all-in blue, Jock.
Wouldn't the Campbells love that?
I'll tell you somethin'.
That won't be happenin', alright?
We'll be fightin' this on our own terms, in accordance with the seven elements.

Why not?
'Cause he's your former prez and you need to go and see him.
Is that what he said?
No, that's what I'm saying.
I'm a president too.
I don't get this shit from other clubs!
Hey, Joel, can you go watch some telly?
Thanks, baby.
He's fuckin' lovin' this.
Yeah, of course he is.
Yeah, he makes his declaration of war and fuck the consequences.
Which is why you have to be better than him.
Well, we're not accepting war.
Fuck him.
We're not backin' down.
Well, that'll work.
Sure.
Oh, Jesus, Lee!
Can you fuckin' help me out here?
!
I'm sorry.
I just...
I'm sorry.
I think you should go and see him, though.
He thinks we're running scared.
And?
We fuckin' outnumber him, 2 to 1.
And he's got guns and he wants to use 'em.
He's prepared.
And so have we.
Is that what you think?
Hang on.
No, no, no.
I thought you said that you weren't gonna do that.
I thought you told him that.
This isn't our idea!
We don't do anything!
He declared on us!
Right.
He declared on you.
We don't want war and we all voted against it.
War.
You don't understand.
I understand.
I understand you bikie clubs are loyal and you take no shit and you look after us, but... are those fuckin' colours worth dyin' for?
Snoddy, are they worth more than you and me?
I don't know what you want me to say.
- Isn't that Foggy's ute?
- Yeah.
What's he doin' on our turf?
Pricks.
Go!
Go!
Fuck!
Come on!
Where was he?
Just here.
What's he doing near my bloody house?
Got no idea.
There he is!
Hey!
Come here!
Fuck!
Come here, you little...
Get down!
You right?
Yeah.
You?
Yeah.
Shit.
Fuck.
So, who was on sentry?
I dunno.
Who was on sentry?
Don't ask him!
You should bloody know!
Jesus Christ!
We got shotgun blasts goin' through the window and you sleep through the whole thing?
We had a...
..pretty big night.
You had a big night?
!
You're a disorganised, useless rabble!
Now, I want sentries 24 hours, alright?
Here and at my house... you got that?
Yes, Prez.
Well, get it organised!
And you...
Right?
You double the fortifications, alright?
I want more barbed wire and I want boards on the windows.
You had a big night!
If you were in the army, they'd take you out and shoot ya!
Fuckin'...
Do you think this is some kind of a fucking joke, do ya?
!
Huh?
This is full-on hostilities, alright?
This is all-out war!
And big nights, Leroy, they're fuckin' cancelled too, alright?
Done!
You take another mouthful of that beer,
I'll bend you over that table and I'll ram it straight up your arse.
Alright?
They're done.
Alright?
Over!
Alright?
You're the sergeant-at-arms.
You stand down the troops!
If you'd call 'em that!
'Cause I wouldn't!
You're a disgrace!
The lot of ya!
Jock Ross?
Who wants to know?
I'm Detective Sergeant Masterson.
This is Detective Constable Moran.
We're making, uh, inquiries about a shooting incident.
We have reason to believe that some of your men might have been involved.
Uh, members of your motorcycle club.
So, what's that got to do with me?
Do you know anything about the incident?
No.
Or... who might have been involved?
You clowns woke me up to ask me this?
'Cause according to our information, various members of your club and another, the Bandidos, are... well, they're taking pot-shots at each other.
Pot-shots?
Oh, right.
Is there, like, a prize?
Are you denying shots were fired at your clubhouse on 18 August?
Pass.
Your neighbours lodged a complaint but... but you didn't.
No. 'Cause I wasn't there.
Several of your men were.
Do you have any weapons on the premises, Mr Ross?
Weapons?
No.
But you have a licence for a number of firearms.
I have a property at Mangrove Mountain.
I got guns up there.
Properly secured?
No.
They're just lyin' around on the fuckin' tables.
Of course they're properly secured!
Why do you have these weapons?
Well, sport.
You know, rabbits, pigs.
Why does anyone have guns?
Now, that's an interesting question.
Don't be smart with me, Ross.
My gang's a whole lot bigger than yours.
Is that a threat?
You bet.
I mean, you can bash each other as much as you like.
But you start firing guns in public places, expect a whole lot of grief from us.
Hmm?
Well, I'm quaking' in me boots.
Right.
Well, we'll be back, hmm?
Alright, good.
Give me some notice and I'll put the kettle on.
Come on.
Inside, darl.
You go play with Joely, alright?
Go and play with Joely.
Hey, Chrissie.
Hey.
Want a beer?
Yeah, sounds good.
Hey.
How are things?
Yeah, good.
Joely, why don't you go outside and play with the girls, mate?
Good boy.
I'm leavin', Snod.
I'm not takin' any more chances with Chris and the kids.
There's me colours.
But we're brothers, mate.
Don't pull that.
They've got me so worried, before Chris takes the kids to school,
I'm checkin' the fuckin' car for bombs.
At night, we're pushin' the couch up against the bloody front door.
It's gonna blow over.
Is it?
Yes.
I got responsibilities.
You know, in case you haven't noticed, they're not right in the fuckin' head.
I can't risk my family, mate.
Neither should you.
You know Jock's gonna see this as a win?
Fuck him.
Are your brothers goin' too?
We haven't talked about it.
But you don't have to worry.
Caes and Shad, they love this shit.
And they're staunch.
Will you think about it... for me?
Will you give me a couple of days?
Look... you feel the same in a week,
I'll let you go.
You got me word.
Go on.
What happened to just... a good root, a bit of a knuckle and a long ride, eh?
One week, Snod.
One week.
OK.
Right, fellas.
First off, I won't be joinin' youse tonight.
I'm on a promise to Lee's family.
Don't worry, Snod.
I'll drink all your beer for you.
Piss off, you bastard.
You do anyway.
The swap meet at the Viking Tavern tomorrow at Milperra... it's a compulsory meeting.
And if the Comanchero are there, we will bash them and we will take their colours and put an end to this.
And you remember, we've got the numbers, so I expect every one of youse there tomorrow to maintain that advantage.
Alright?
Boys, I didn't want this fight.
But I'm not fuckin' backing' away from it either.
I made a promise to the Americans, when we took their colours... that we would wear 'em and we would wear 'em proud.
We're not some tin-pot, made-up club like the fuckin' Comancheros.
We're part of the Bandido Nation... part of a global brotherhood.
Right?
So, I'll see you all tomorrow.
Bandidos forever!
Forever Bandidos!
Bandidos forever!
Forever Bandidos!
Bandidos forever!
Forever Bandidos!
Bandidos forever!
Forever Bandidos!
Bandidos forever!
Forever Bandidos!
Bandidos forever!
Forever Bandidos!
Bandidos forever!
Hot in Cleveland is recorded in front of a live studio audience.
Melanie, explain yourself.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, I think you do.
Your hair looks amazing.
When was your last blow out?
I don't know.
Seven, eight days?
Who keeps track?
We do, it's been 12 days.
Who is this magical hairdresser?
We demand to know who's blowing you.
I'd rather not say.
Why not?
Because every time I find a cool, charming Cleveland place, you two do something to ruin it.
What are you talking about?
Ray's dry cleaners.
They were trying to devalue my brand.
They just wanted to put your photo on their wall.
I think it's sweet.
Not when the only other headshots on the wall are of their ugly niece and Klinger.
Actually, I think they're both his niece.
Anyway, every time I go in there,
Ray asks why you don't come around any more.
It's embarrassing.
Who is Ray?
The man who owns "Ray's" dry cleaners.
The place we're talking about.
Oh, come on, Melanie.
That's just Victoria being Victoria.
We all know she can be a cat among pigeons.
English, please.
That is English.
Original English before you people bastardized it with your...
[American accent] Hamburgers...and elevators.
The point is, I don't ruin places.
You told the manager at Gremore's that they needed to incorporate more vegan dishes.
- Well, they should.
- They're a barbecue joint.
Veganism is the new Atkins.
I'm giving them the tools to be relevant.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
You two are always looking down your noses at Cleveland.
Well, of course.
Looking down the nose is flattering to the neckline.
How great is it that we got appointments at the same time?
Now we can gossip with each other.
I just have to get all my talking out before I see Christopher.
He says the sound of my voice makes him wanna kill himself.
No, no, no.
Out of my salon, get out!
But why?
You cut your own bangs.
It is my hair.
No, no, it's my hair.
You're just the dirt from which it grows.
Out!
Are we still on for tonight?
I suppose.
I'll do you, but not your hair.
Scram.
Hi, Christopher.
Ugh!
That voice.
I need to go soothe my nerves.
What a putz.
You really should switch to Pierre.
Oh, I don't know.
Isn't Pierre a little flirty?
Yeah, but it's okay.
He's gay.
Elka, you sexy beast!
I want to snap you in two and suck out the middle.
Oh, Pierre.
Thank you, Pierre.
This is for you.
Put it in the bank, sweetheart.
Thank you very much.
And who is this beautiful creature?
Your sister?
Older sister.
Both of you, come on back and let's get you started.
Oh, wait, no, I don't know if I'm allowed to sit in the chair yet.
You know, Christopher.
Girlfriend, please!
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely sure.
And as for you, if that fabulous tushy isn't in that chair in 20 seconds, it's gonna be in my hands.
It's okay.
He's gay.
Yeah.
Got that.
So much gorgeous in this room, it's like being backstage at a drag show.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, who told you you could sit there?
I did.
I told you never speak to my clients.
I don't like them to feel comfortable talking.
I could go sit in the reception area.
- Really, it's not a problem.
- Now you've upset Melanie.
- Shame on you!
- Yeah, yeah.
Come on, sugarbuns.
Let's go get you shampooed.
Oh, if I could be your bra for one day.
What am I saying?
I'd get nothing done!
What's going on here?
Speak.
Well, it's been about--
Not you, your hair!
What has she done to you?
Run her greasy fingers through you?
Huh?
Try on some hot girl's hat she's 20 years too old for?
It was just a beret, I swear.
Well, well, well, what have we here?
Oh, my God, how did you guys find me?
We have our ways.
You followed me, didn't you?
Yes, that is our way.
I cannot believe you two.
Oh, relax, we just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Still wanna see it.
Excuse me, I don't come to your work and knock the mop out of your hands.
Rude to customers.
Very un-Cleveland.
You, go get shampooed.
You two, time to leave.
Buh-bye.
Yeah.
Buh-bye.
One question before I go.
Is it true that your blow outs last 12 days?
No.
14.
16 if the bitch follows my instructions.
He's so mean.
I know, I love him already.
You have to do my hair, today.
[Chuckles] I'm booked.
Yeah, yeah, there's always room if the price is right.
What do you charge?
$30.
Look, we're not gonna get anywhere if you insist on joking around.
What do you charge?
If your blow outs are as good as I think they are, you could be charging ten times that amount.
Oh, people wouldn't pay that.
Of course they would.
Nothing's more seductive than the illusion of exclusivity.
I have been thinking about taking the salon in a new direction.
Yeah, like out of 1975?
I mean, what is with this area over here with the hooded driers and the dog photos?
Yeah, this area has to go.
That's what I've been thinking.
Pierre, get out here.
- What is it?
- You're fired.
What?
Let me lather, rinse and repeat that.
What?
!
Wait, wait, wait, this is not what I was talking about.
Quiet, robot.
I'm taking the salon in a new direction.
I'm tired of you holding me back.
You want me out?
I'm out.
- Good.
- Good!
- Fine.
- Fine!
What's going on out here?
The pissant fired me.
Somehow he's got an idea that I'm holding him back.
But in the words of Abba, "The winner takes it all."
Now where would Christopher get the idea that Pierre's holding him back?
Wherever Pierre is going, we're going too.
Right, Melanie?
Uh...
Come on, let's just storm out of here.
Yeah, but wouldn't my storming look better if my hair was freshly blown out?
Now, Melanie.
Come on, you guys.
I would, but I think an appointment just opened up.
Skinny, in the chair.
Skinnier, go get shampoo.
Which is which?
He's trying to sow dissention between us.
The man is a genius.
I was minutes away from getting a blow out, and instead I get kicked out with my hair still wet.
My hair dried... naturally.
I think it makes you look young.
Like you went swimming at the beach and drove home in a convertible.
Then... got hit by lightning.
I can't believe you guys showed up at the salon.
Well, if you didn't want us there, then why didn't you say so?
I did.
Like a hundred times.
- Well, I didn't hear it.
- Of course not.
The only way to guarantee you hear anything is to mention your agent called.
Well, I don't know why you're taking this out on me.
Joy's the one who said, "who cares how Melanie feels?
Let's follow her."
I told you that in confidence.
And I didn't say it.
Look, she's the one that got Pierre fired.
No, no, no that was Melanie's fault.
If you hadn't been getting secret blow outs, this never would have happened.
J'accuse!
Okay, let's just stop.
Obviously there's some tension here.
And I think we have all noticed that we have been getting on each other's nerves lately.
So I think it might be a good idea if we just clear the air and vent our frustrations in a calm and respectful manner.
- Okay, that's a good idea.
- I'm willing to try.
And I'll start by saying I love you both.
But, uh, lately, you have a been a little, shall we say, disrespectful.
For example, when--
We're not getting any younger here, Melanie.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
You barely listen to me.
Because you take forever to get to the point.
Now I can say what's wrong with both of you in two words.
You're a wimp and you're a bummer.
In what way am I bummer?
Well, you're always pooh-poohing things and your "can't do" attitude is exhausting.
I will file that under
"things Victoria says that make no sense"
or, to avoid redundancy, "things Victoria says".
Okay, come on, that's not calm and respectful.
Thank God we have Hall Monitor Melanie to keep us in line.
I'll have you know that hall monitor was a respected position in my high school.
If you wanted to go to the bathroom, you had to go through me.
While we're on Melanie, do you have to be so damn friendly to everyone we run into?
You know, just once I would like to be able to go to the grocery store without being introduced to the bag boy.
[Sharp laugh] Like you've ever been to a grocery store.
I'm the one that does all the shopping.
That is so not fair.
I make the lists, you do the shopping, and Joy drinks all the vodka.
How else do you expect me to sit through one of your
"it's so hard being famous" stories?
I'm sorry.
Am I seriously being attacked for being a celebrity?
Newsflash, the ins and outs of the Lifetime Original Movie where you portrayed a sexy manicurist who played by her own rules, aren't as interesting as you think.
I'll have you know that Lifetime had its best ratings of the year with You're Soaking In It.
What exactly were the manicurist rules she was breaking anyway?
And here come the questions.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means living with you is like a never-ending game of Jeopardy.
Everything is in the form of a question!
Where in the world would you get that idea?
And there's our Daily Double.
So what?
Are there worse things in the world?
And yes, I realize those are both questions to which there is one answer.
[Blows raspberry]
Well...
This was certainly productive.
I think I'm done here.
- Me too.
- Me too.
But seriously, did my agent call?
Both:
No!
Hello, traitors.
Pierre, Joy is so very sorry about what happened today.
Yes, Victoria would like to apologize for any part she played in you getting fired.
Please, like the great Gloria Gaynor once said,
I will survive.
Besides, who could be unhappy surrounded by three gorgeous women?
Oh, that's so sweet, but there's four of us here.
I know.
You've got to do something about that hair.
Holy Toledo.
It's a mess!
Let's have a little fun with this, shall we?
Have you ever thought about going a tiny bit shorter?
A little brighter?
Yeah, I have, actually.
Then leave it to Pierre.
Oh, God.
Good lord.
You look fantastic.
All right, done.
But you're gonna have to wear this wig until it grows back.
[Gasps]
Oh, my God, it's perfect.
It looks just like my old hair.
That's 'cause I'm a genius.
- Say it.
- You're a genius.
Stop kissing my ass.
This is a relief.
Normally I'd be excited to go home and show my roommates, but, oh, after the fight we just had...
Let's just say the gloves came off.
We're not even speaking to each other.
I don't care.
It's just that it's not only this one thing.
- Lately they've been--
- Driving me crazy.
I mean it is kind of remarkable that we got along as long as we did.
A lonely British expat, an all-American girl next door, and an underappreciated, though highly sought after actress living away from the limelight.
I won't insult your intelligence by telling you who the beautiful actress is.
Yeah.
I don't care.
Oh, it was a horrible argument.
But in my defense, Melanie is obnoxiously nice.
I don't care.
And Joy, I mean, she has such amazingly low self-esteem.
It's probably why she's always falling into bed with the most unavailable men.
Go on.
I have half a mind to--
Try to find a place of my own.
I don't care.
Listen, sweetie, I got a client coming, so could you, you know, fold up the couch and beat it?
Wait, what about getting my hair blown out?
Oh, babe, sorry, no time.
Come here.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
Call me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[Silently] I love you.
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
- I asked you first.
- I was here first.
It seems that we are at a stalemate.
Well, clearly we're all here for the same reason.
We're all thinking about moving out.
Yes, and obviously we all saw the advertisement for this apartment at the salon.
No, I found it a different way.
You followed us?
That is my way.
Fine, we're all here to find an apartment of our own so let's just look at it on our own.
- Fine.
- Fine.
This place is sad.
Really sad.
This place is where sad comes to hang itself.
Maybe...
I'm just sad because I really hate it when we fight.
- Me too.
- Oh, me too.
Let's not beat ourselves up.
I mean, we've been living together for three years.
We were due.
And it's not the end of the world that we wanna find our own place.
I mean, we are adults.
Exactly.
We all had our own places in L.A.
Mm-hmm, and we can still hang out like we did in L.A.
And have sleepovers like we did in L.A.
And then the next morning, talk about how fun it would be to someday all live together.
Like we do now.
We're actually living our dream.
And to think we were about to throw it away over a bunch of nonsense.
It may be weird that women our age live together,
- but I really like it.
- Me too.
Me too.
Okay, then let's just go home and pretend none of this ever happened.
But we still have a mess to clean up and Elka's still mad at us for getting Pierre fired.
Who's Pierre?
Your agent called.
Pierre is the guy we got fired.
And we have to get him his job back.
Christopher will never take him back, he's too outdated.
So let's give him a makeover.
I look ridiculous.
Without my neckerchief and my white bucks,
I feel a little... gay.
You are two scoops of yummy with a side of ka-pow!
Oh.
Hello, Pierre.
Pierre!
You told me he was dead.
And to think I slept with you.
She'll be back.
What the hell is going on here?
All right, I poached some of your clients.
I thought I could run the salon without you, but then I realized that most of our business is older ladies.
No offense.
All:
Why would I be offended?
It turns out, in this economy, no one wants to pay $300 for a blow dry.
In fact, these three idiots are the only ones that did.
Your hair doesn't look done.
Shh!
Let him talk.
So, uh, you want me back.
Yes, dad.
Dad?
I have so many questions...
That I won't ask.
But no more scented candles.
And then no more yelling at the customers.
Then no more Abba.
And if you get to date the customers, so do I.
Then be my guest.
How about it, sweet cheeks?
Wanna hit the town?
You're interested in me?
Haven't you noticed that I've been hitting on you relentlessly for the past 20 years?
But we all thought that you were...
An insatiable ladies' man?
I get that all the time.
I assure you, I'm a one-woman guy.
Well, how could I possibly say no?
Sweet Barbra Streisand.
I can't wait to get my hands on those buns!
Hurry up!
It's okay.
He's not gay.
To everything going back to just the way it was.
Yes, and, Elka, thank you for this beautiful bottle of champagne.
Actually, I bought it for myself.
To celebrate you guys moving out.
Well, at least you got a new boyfriend.
Hold it down.
He's asleep upstairs.
Wait, Pierre's asleep in one of our rooms?
We goldilocks-ed your place.
Joy's bed was just right.
[Doorbell rings]
I'll get it.
On my way out to buy a new mattress.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Sacre bleu!
Pierre's teaching me French.
[Baby coos]
Do people still leave babies on doorsteps?
Does it matter if it's a done thing?
It's been done.
Well, what are we gonna do?
Good question, Melanie.
Good question.
Okay.
Here we go.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
All right.
Come on, Will.
Hit it and quit it, man.
Let's go, man.
Oh, shut up, Ray.
Baby.
Oh, beautiful!
Don't ever leave me.
Promise.
I promise.
Quit screwin' around.
Let's roll.
Let's go.
You ready?
Come on.
The water's warm.
Come on.
We'll just go up to our knees.
I don't want to.
What is it?
Can't swim.
Smash and grab galore, baby.
Smash and grab.
Check out that place, man.
That is sweet we scouted this last week.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Abby, why didn't you tell me you were afraid of the water?
It's okay.
A lot of people don't like to swim.
You're not mad?
No.
What would make you think that?
Well, you said you wanted to go to the beach.
I don't wanna mess things up.
Oh, no, sweetie.
Your mom just wanted us all to be together.
To the beach, the park, a trip to the moon.
- Anywhere.
- Wherever.
I'll tell you what.
After this, we'll go home, and we'll pop popcorn, and we'll watch a movie.
How's that?
- Okay.
- All right.
Sure you can't come over?
Nah.
I've got a meeting this afternoon.
I have to stop by and pick up my sponsor.
Car's not there.
Let's check it out.
This neighborhood's dead, man.
Let's go do this.
Please be careful, baby.
Hey, I love you.
I love you, too.
Here.
Abby.
What's goin' on back there?
Is there something that you wanna talk about?
I was just thinking about...
When I was little.
What about when you were little?
I was at this big pool.
This girl took me all the way out to the middle.
I said, "don't let my head go under."
And she said she wouldn't.
All of a sudden, she shoved my head.
Held it down.
Like this.
Thought I was gonna drown.
Oh, sweetie, who did that to you?
The girl at my last foster home.
Maybe you could take swimming lessons.
You know, with a teacher who knows how to swim and can teach you.
I suppose.
Okay.
We'll think about it.
- Can I go pick a movie now?
- Of course you can.
Anybody else in this house?
Are you sure?
Okay.
This is very simple.
You both stay very quiet, do exactly as I say, nobody gets hurt.
Is that understood?
Don't you dare hurt her.
Listen to what I say.
Okay, nice and slowly.
Give me your cell phone.
Drop the purse.
Checkbook, bank statements.
Where are they?
- In the bedroom.
- Where's that?
- In the back.
- Okay.
We're going.
Let's go.
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy!
Easy.
- Mommy.
- Make it quick.
Very nice.
You and I are gonna have a good time later.
This is how this is gonna work.
We're gonna go to the banks.
You're gonna empty out those accounts.
I'm gonna be in the backseat of your car on the phone with my partner, who's gonna be here with your kid.
If you do anything suspicious...
And I mean anything, your daughter dies.
- You understand that?
- Yes.
She dies.
Get on your knees.
Get on your knees!
Nice and slowly, you're gonna open up that safe.
That's everything.
One minute!
Let's go.
We don't have all day!
Hey!
Give me a second!
Oh, man.
911.
Get out of my house.
Abby.
- Ray!
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Where's Will?
- Will ain't comin'.
- What?
- We had a little problem.
- What do you mean?
- That bitch shot him!
- What?
!
Will's dead!
You're gonna drive this car now or I'm gonna cut you.
Now let's get outta here.
Abby, open the door, baby.
It's mommy.
Abby.
Abby.
You're safe.
Get off at the next exit.
They're probably all over the freeways right now.
We'll take the back way.
Everything's gonna be cool.
We're just gonna stick with the plan.
Forget the plan, Ray.
My boyfriend is dead because of her.
It's the price of doin' business.
He knew what he was gettin' into.
- How did this happen?
- I have no idea.
I hear a gunshot, I come around the corner, he's layin' dead in front of the fireplace, she's pointing' a gun at me.
Man, I didn't really stick around to ask.
- I wanna go back.
- We're goin' to Reno, okay?
We're never goin' back to L.A.
I want you to forget about that.
You even think about turning' this thing around, I'm gonna beat your ass.
Nicole.
I got here as fast as I could.
Are you okay?
Are you okay, sweetie?
We're hangin' in there.
But I don't think it's hit us yet.
No, no.
Miss Johnson, I need you inside.
I have some questions for you.
All right.
Just a minute, please.
Sure.
Abby.
I'm gonna go inside and talk with the detective.
You're gonna stay here with Eric, okay?
I'll be right back.
Come here, sweetie.
So, uh...
Miss Johnson.
I'm sorry I have to ask you to do this, but...
Do you recognize this man?
Never seen him before.
- You're sure?
- Mm-hmm.
It doesn't surprise me.
Probably cased the neighborhood, and just picked your house at random.
What about that other guy?
What if he comes back?
Ha-ha.
Comes back?
I've been working robbery-homicide for 15 years now.
I've never had one come back.
He's getting as far away from here as possible.
Once we have a positive I.D. On the dead guy, we'll have a better idea and start looking for his friend.
And listen, you're very lucky you knew how to work that gun.
A lot of women in this situation, they get hurt really bad.
Detective.
Excuse me.
Don't ever leave me.
Hey, I love you.
What are you doin'?
I have to pee.
Really?
I didn't know girls went pee-pee.
Make it quick, all right?
Come on, man.
Jade, what the hell you doin'?
Jade, what the hell you doin'?
Chicks, man.
Yo, Jade.
Yo!
Jade.
Jade, quit screwing' around.
I am gonna beat her ass.
Ray?
Thanks for dinner.
Oh, you're welcome, sweetheart.
My pleasure.
You wanna brush your teeth and get ready for bed?
Which one's my room?
Oh, the guest room is down the hall and to the right.
Am I gonna sleep by myself?
No.
No.
I'm gonna be in there in just a few minutes.
- Okay.
- Okay.
I should've been there.
I keep thinking about what those guys could've done to you...
I don't wanna talk about it.
Okay.
I'm sorry, Nic.
It's okay.
I just...
- I just don't wanna talk about it.
- Okay.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
The gate was open.
Oh.
That's okay.
I was just taking this outside.
- Need help?
- No.
I...
Can do it later.
Um... come in.
Thank you.
I thought you might be happy to know the medical examiner was able to make a positive I.D.
On the dead guy.
William Davenport.
He was out on parole for armed robbery.
What was he even doing out?
California prisons are overcrowded.
Good time means early release.
- Even for violent felons?
- Yeah.
Governments broke.
They'll do anything to save a buck, except cut their own perks, of course.
Anyway, we checked out his residence in Fillmore.
He was listed as the sole renter, but we think he might have been living with some other people.
We just haven't been able to I.D. them yet.
So you have no idea who the other guy was.
No, not yet.
Where in Fillmore?
- I can't discuss that.
- Why not?
Don't I have a right to know who broke into my house and threatened my daughter's life?
I think you understand we can't have people out there doing our job.
We'll find this guy.
You just need to be patient and let us handle it.
Put those over there, and be careful.
That's fine china.
Oye, chico, calmate, please.
Nicole, you don't need to be here today.
I told you to go home.
Home is the last place I wanna be right now.
Don't worry.
I've opened five restaurants in my time.
Yeah, well, this is my first.
And we've got it all covered.
Can I give you some advice?
No.
Maybe you should see a therapist.
- I would if I were you.
- I said I'm fine.
I knew you'd be stubborn about this, so I brought you this.
It's a support group.
They meet every Monday over at the Van NUYS community center.
My sister went there after she got robbed.
It helped.
Did you hear back from that pastry guy?
- Nicole!
- What?
I got the message.
I will consider the support group thing
- if it makes you happy.
- Very happy.
And yes, I heard back from the pastry guy, and the bread guy and the meat guy.
Now get outta here.
Okay.
Geo, are you working here or what?
Excuse me.
I could kill you right now, but I won't.
I'm gonna watch you suffer.
Mom?
Abby!
What are you doing?
I got a drink of water.
Oh.
Why do you have a knife?
I... brought it to my room by mistake.
- Are you scared?
- No, sweetie.
Are you?
Just a little.
Abby, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
Ever.
I won't let anything happen to you either, mom.
I can't sleep.
I keep a knife by my bed.
I mean, I worry about my daughter constantly when she's at school.
I want my life back.
I want to do something, help the police catch this guy who got away.
I don't know, something.
I even have these nightmares where I catch him myself, and I... dream about what I would do to him.
That's normal.
Part of recovering or taking your life back is being able to control those thoughts.
Don't let them control you.
Can I say something?
Of course.
I know that you have to move on, and that's the point of all of this.
But it's not that easy.
The day that my husband Kyle was killed, my life changed forever.
I spent a lot of time thinking about what I'd do if I found his killer.
So I know how Nicole feels.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to cut you off.
I just...
No.
Thank you.
Okay, would anyone else like to say something?
How about you?
Okay, well, I've had a real hard time talking about this to my family.
How's the coffee?
- Oh!
- Sorry.
Did I scare you?
That's okay.
It's Megan, right?
Yeah.
Good memory.
Oh, I was very appreciative of what you said back in there.
I thought that a support group would be more... supportive.
One would think.
You didn't get a chance to finish telling your story.
What happened to Kyle?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
- I know...
- No, it's fine.
That's what we're here for, right?
He went to the bank, and someone came in to rob the place.
The security guard started shooting, and he was killed in the crossfire.
I'm so sorry.
What happened to the robber?
Got away.
Police caught up with him in New Mexico.
Shot him.
I think about him every day.
My boyfriend meant the world to me.
I thought you said he was your husband.
Yeah.
We were engaged.
Okay, everybody.
We're ready to start back up again.
So enough about me.
Did you say you were opening a restaurant soon?
Yeah.
This Friday in Pasadena.
It's been hard to focus on it with all this.
That wouldn't be the moon River Cafe, would it?
Yeah.
Actually, it is.
No way.
I live in Glendale.
I was thinking about checking it out.
You should.
My chef Maurice makes the best beef stroganoff.
Sounds great.
I'll definitely come then.
Good.
Hello!
What was your favorite thing that happened in school today?
In science, we made a big volcano.
- Seriously?
- And it blew up.
You are so smart.
You have a little science genius in you.
So when can I tell all my friends that Nicole's my real mom?
Well, if everything goes okay, how about a month?
Awesome!
Abigail, Tricia and I need to talk, so why don't you go get a head start on your homework?
Okay.
Bye, Tricia.
Good-bye, sweetheart.
See you next time.
She seems to be holding up well.
She is.
She's...
An incredibly strong little girl.
How about you?
Keepin' it together.
Trying to set a good example.
Just get things back to normal.
Good.
Nicole, I read the police report.
Why didn't you tell us that you owned a firearm?
Oh, I...
I think I just forgot about it.
You know, it's been in the safe for about five years, and I have never used it.
I'm gonna trust that Abigail doesn't know the combination to the safe, correct?
No.
No.
Is there anything else that we need to know?
Is this going to affect the adoption process in any way?
I don't make the final decision, but just make sure that nothing else goes wrong.
Yeah, but Tricia didn't actually say that it'll hurt your chances, did she?
No, but the look on her face.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
Do you think it would help if you and I made things more permanent?
What do you mean, like get married?
Yeah.
Two-parent family, a dog, a white picket fence.
The whole deal.
It might, but it might just complicate things.
You still think I'm gonna be that guy at the party who embarrasses you and...
Eric, 21 months of sobriety is great.
But when you and I broke up, it was...
It was a blessing.
- Oh.
- Don't get the wrong idea.
I cried for days.
I wanted a family with you.
When I realized that that couldn't happen,
I went looking.
I found the most amazing...
Beautiful little girl.
Breaking up with you allowed Abigail into my life.
Hey, am I incredible or what?
And you know, we can still have that family.
You, me and Abby.
I just want to get things finalized with the county first.
I need to know that Abby is here to stay, and, uh, and then I can start to think about you and me.
All right.
I understand.
Okay, let's go.
Are you ready?
The water's warm.
Let's just go up to our knees.
I don't want to.
- Why not?
- Can't swim.
I want that hot!
That salmon is perfection.
Not scalding.
How are we going on my stroganoff?
Nicole, go eat with your daughter before she leaves.
We got this.
Those two filets for table 12.
We got it.
It's done.
Everything's going great.
It couldn't be better.
I love you.
- All right.
- I love you more than life itself.
Hi.
I'm here to meet a friend.
Can I look around for her?
Sure.
- Hi, mom.
- Hi.
Megan.
I'm so glad you could make it.
Me, too.
You look gorgeous.
Thank you.
So do you.
Eric, this is Megan Hauser.
We met in our support group.
Megan, this is my boyfriend Eric, and my wonderful daughter Abigail.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I was just looking for you.
There's so many people here.
I know.
More than I expected.
Are you here with someone?
No, actually.
It's just me.
- Where are you sitting?
- Over at the bar.
Why don't you sit with us?
- Please.
- Yeah.
- Please.
- Yeah?
We were just about to go get some salad.
You have to try the salad dressing.
It's an old family recipe.
It's fabulous.
Oh, that's...
- Okay.
- Good.
Why don't you try some of the pasta salad?
This is for you.
So Eric, are you in the restaurant business, too?
You mean, other than picking out all the lighting?
And helping me repaint the entire place.
No, I'm not in the restaurant thing.
Architecture and design.
He's wonderful.
He just submitted a proposal on that new art center downtown.
Wow.
That's impressive.
Yeah, well, we'll see.
So... what do you do, Megan?
- I'm a private swim teacher.
- Really?
Yeah.
I go to people's homes and I teach them how to swim one on one.
How about that, Abigail?
Were you thinking of taking swimming lessons?
We were talking about it.
Everybody should know how to swim.
If you're interested, give me a call.
What do you think?
You said you might want to try it.
- Maybe.
- It's a lot of fun.
We play games, and I bring over swim toys.
You even get a trophy after your third lesson.
- Wow.
- I think it's a great idea.
Do I have to go under the water?
No.
You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
Besides, I will be there right next to you the whole time.
- I got your back.
- Okay.
That sounds wonderful.
I have an opening tomorrow afternoon.
- That's perfect.
- Great.
You didn't get any of the pine nut dressing.
Grandmother's secret recipe.
I'm...
I'm actually allergic to nuts.
Oh, I am so sorry.
I will get you some more salad.
Forget it.
To the best new restaurant in L.A..
to the best restaurant in the world.
Hear, hear.
Maurice, I think we're all going to sleep well tonight.
Thank you, thank you.
You knocked it out of the park.
Everything was perfect.
I told you not to worry.
Oh, my God, I owe you big time.
- I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?
- Good-bye.
- You gonna tuck me in?
- Of course I am.
- Let's go.
Ooh.
- Oh, you okay?
- Ooh.
- Mom.
Thanks for taking Abby to Hannah's.
Oh, of course.
No problem.
So what did the doctor say to you, anyway?
She gave me something to settle my stomach.
She doesn't know what it is.
Maybe the flu or something.
- Miss Johnson?
- Yes?
Well, you are good to go.
Remember, if you start throwing up again, just come back and see me, okay?
Thank you, doctor.
By the way, you didn't eat at the Moon River Cafe, did you?
Um, I did.
Why?
A couple of people have been in this morning with the same symptoms.
They both ate dinner there last night.
If I were you, I'd stay away from that place.
Feel better.
So sorry.
After everything that happened this morning,
I just completely forgot about the lesson.
Honestly, it's fine.
And I can come back some other time or something.
No, it's okay.
Abby honey, hurry up, okay?
I really appreciate this.
It's okay, sweetie.
You just do whatever Megan tells you.
She's not gonna let anything bad happen to you, okay?
We're gonna get in and we're gonna start really easy by just blowing some bubbles, okay?
Don't worry.
You can trust me.
Oh, that's probably my lawyer.
Don't worry.
We're fine.
Okay.
Great.
Nicole, a bunch of people have gotten sick.
Well, how many people are we talking about?
Nine so far.
And they all claim to have started to feel ill within three to five hours after eating?
That's right.
This is crazy.
I got you.
Don't worry.
Are any of them still in the hospital?
Mm-hmm.
One elderly lady.
Doctors say she'll recover, but this bug, this contaminant, or whatever it is, made her violently ill.
Maybe it was one of our suppliers.
Okay, now let's try it on one arm.
Good job.
You want to try by yourself?
- Okay.
- Put your hands on the brick.
And put your head underwater.
You should be prepared for the story to hit the press.
No.
Your mom is gonna be so surprised... when she sees you can swim all the way across the pool all by yourself.
I think you can do it.
Maybe if you could help me.
The lawyers are gonna try to scare up more clients.
More plaintiffs means more damages means, you know.
Look at you go.
- Yeah.
- Good job.
You did it.
You're doing it all by yourself.
I'm not even holding.
Cool.
Okay, go back to the wall.
Good job.
Look how good you are.
- You should practice every day.
- With you?
No, I can't be here every day, silly.
But you should practice on your own.
Remember, don't let your mommy see.
You don't want to ruin the surprise, right?
- Right.
- Good girl.
All right.
I'll bring in the insurance policy and the health inspection paperwork.
Good.
We'll figure something out.
Okay.
Thanks, Walter.
I...
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good-bye.
- Abigail?
- Twelve seconds!
All right!
I held my breath for 12 whole seconds.
That's great, sweetie.
She's fearless.
Where can I change?
The bathroom is down the hall on your right.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Did you go under the water?
- Yeah.
I blew bubbles.
- You blew bubbles?
!
- Yeah.
- Did you hold your breath?
Are you gonna turn into a little fish on me?
- Maybe.
- A little dolphin?
- You need a ride?
- No.
Come on.
I think you do.
And what do I have to do for it?
Nothing.
Just smile.
Right.
I'm serious.
That's all I want.
Look, I'm trying to do something nice here.
See?
Now that was sorta pretty.
Sorta.
Look, it's cool if you wanna give me a ride, but that's it.
I wouldn't do anything more if you paid me.
If you begged me to kiss you, that's a different story.
Are you gonna drive or what?
This ride with me could change your life.
I seriously doubt that.
Don't underestimate me, doll.
Doll?
You never told me your name.
It's Jade.
Nice to meet you, Jade.
I'm Will.
Is everything okay?
Sorry.
I just remembered your story from the group.
Is this where he died?
Yeah.
That's where he fell.
Where did you shoot him?
He brought me back here.
Um...
He came closer to me.
And then what?
You and I are gonna have a good time later on.
He made me open the safe.
Made me fill the bag.
How did you get the gun?
It all happened so fast.
His friend yelled something down the hall.
He turned that way, and, um...
And then, that's when I... grabbed it from the safe.
And before he could turn around...
You shot him in the back.
Maybe you should've just given him the money.
I mean, do you ever think about that?
If you had have just done everything that he said, maybe nothing bad would've happened.
I couldn't take that chance.
I had Abby.
I mean, they came into my house and stuck a gun to my head, and put a knife to my daughter's throat.
I'm glad he will never have the chance to do something like that ever again.
I'm sorry.
Do you want some lunch or something?
No.
Thank you.
We'll toss out every tin of food.
We'll scrub every square inch of this place.
Miss Johnson, until we know what kind of contaminant we're dealing with,
- I have to shut you down.
- For how long?
It'll take at least a week to get the results back from the lab, and it might take a few weeks to clean the place up, depending on what the problem is.
Weeks?
!
What about my staff?
They have to work?
I'm sorry.
I'll let you know when the results come in.
Okay.
We have to figure out what happened.
Hey, don't look at me or my staff.
We run a clean kitchen here.
Not that anyone's ever gonna believe it.
Twenty years of my life in this business, and it's come to this.
Maurice, hold on.
This...
Did you read the paper?
That's me.
The poison chef.
Who's gonna hire me now?
Whatever this is, I know it's not your fault.
It was just some freak accident or something.
I don't know, but we can start over.
A year of my life helping launch this place, working for practically nothing.
I can't go through this again.
Maurice.
I'm sorry, Nicole.
I'm done.
Wait.
I can't believe he just quit like that.
Neither can I.
He was one of my oldest friends.
And the thing is, I know it wasn't his fault.
When I was talking to that inspector...
I had this crazy thought.
What if somebody did that on purpose?
- Put poison in the food?
- Who?
What if that guy came back?
The guy who robbed you?
Why would he do that?
To get back at me for killing his friend.
I don't...
Like I said, crazy thought.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.
You're gonna find another crew, find another location, and open a new place.
With what?
I already mortgaged this place to open moon river.
That money's gone.
You could let me help you.
I have some money saved up.
I can't let you do that.
Why not?
Because.
These are my problems, not yours.
You know, every time I bring up the subject of us working together, it's like this wall just comes up.
That's not true.
Look, I have done everything that I can to show you that I've changed.
If that's not good enough, or you don't see some sort of future with me, just let me know now, okay?
Two years ago, when you basically chose alcohol over me, that hurt.
I know it did, and I made a mistake.
You were talking about marriage and commitment then, and then look what happened.
So, yes, it's hard for me to trust you.
And it's hard for me to get excited about the idea of making things permanent.
You have to believe me when I tell you,
I realized going through all that, how important you are to me.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
I don't know why I just went off on you like that.
Don't.
I had it coming.
Mom!
It's been a hell of a day.
I know.
I know you've been through a lot.
It's okay, I understand.
Mommy, help!
Help!
Help!
Abby!
Honey, are you okay?
What were you doing swimming in the pool by yourself?
I told you never to do that.
I know, but I wanted to surprise you.
Surprise me?
You could have died surprising me.
- Megan said to.
- Megan said what?
To practice swimming when you weren't looking.
She said I told her to get in the water alone?
Mm-hmm.
To surprise me.
Oh, my God.
No, that is crazy.
I would never tell her to do that.
I told her to practice when I'm there, and that you'd be surprised at what a good swimmer she's become.
I can't believe she did that.
It's Avery good thing Eric and I were there to hear her crying for help.
No kidding.
The next time I come, I'll make sure to tell her she's supposed to go nowhere near the water by herself.
I think we're going to hold off on the swimming lessons for a while.
No, that is the worst thing that you could do, especially if she almost just drowned.
The longer you wait, the more scared of the water she'll become.
It's just not the right time.
It is though.
That's...
That's what I'm trying to tell you, is until she's completely pool safe...
Megan, we're done.
I'm sorry.
Maybe we can try again next summer.
Sure.
Whatever you think is best.
Are you sure you didn't get it mixed up just a little?
No.
She said to surprise you.
She did, huh?
Well, I don't think she knows how to talk to kids.
Maybe Eric should give you swimming lessons from now on.
Cool.
Are you and Eric gonna get married?
Now what makes you ask that?
My friend Hannah thinks he's kinda cute.
She does, does she?
So you should marry him before she does.
- Would you like that?
- Mm-hmm.
- You would.
- Yeah.
Well, I'll keep that in mind.
Hello.
Honey, wake up.
The restaurant's on fire.
Turn on the TV.
It's on the news.
As you can see, it's a massive fire.
Lots of flame and smoke.
A number of fire crews are on the scene trying to get this under control.
My God.
It looks like they're starting to totally engulf...
It was the second robber, the one that got away.
The one that you can't seem to locate.
So you think he contaminated the food, and he came back and burned down the restaurant.
I do.
We do.
Do you have any evidence?
The fact that my restaurant was perfectly clean.
It passed inspection the week before we opened, and now this fire.
Someone is doing this to me on purpose.
The only person I can think of is the man who broke into my house.
He wants to get back at me for...
For killing his friend.
That's a very interesting theory you have.
Very.
But there's something here that just doesn't add up.
Why?
Why would this man go through the trouble of closing your restaurant, succeeding, and then coming back and burning it down anyway?
Why?
I don't know.
Vindictiveness, maybe.
I actually worked on a case just like this one several years back.
This man owned an old apartment building.
It was declared uninhabitable by the city, and then, just boom.
One day, it magically caught fire.
It wasn't hard for us to figure out exactly who lit that match.
So what are you implying?
Nicole set fire to the restaurant herself?
You had the most to gain, didn't you?
I mean, the restaurant was closed, you realized you weren't gonna recover from the lawsuits and the bad press, so you decided to get out from under it.
It makes perfect sense.
So now I'm the criminal, and the man who broke into my house is gonna get off scot-free.
We're still looking for him, and believe me, we will find him.
But we are also working very closely with arson to find out exactly who torched your restaurant, and believe me, Nicole, we will.
I'll be in touch with you.
Let's get outta here.
It's unbelievable.
I'm at the end, Eric.
I don't know what else to do.
Sweetie, don't say that.
Look, you were right.
The police are worthless.
We need to do this on our own.
You'll help me find him?
Of course I will.
I'll track him down online.
You can't.
I already tried.
He's not listed.
All right, look, you said he lived in Fillmore, right?
That's what the detective said.
I have a friend who lives out there.
I'll give him a call and see if he can help us track him down.
Thank you.
Of course.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hello?
Hello?
Hi.
Is this family welfare services?
Yes, it is.
How may I help you?
My daughter goes to school with a little girl
- who's a foster child.
- Who's that?
- Her name's Abigail.
- Oh, yes.
Apparently, she was involved in some kind of swimming accident.
So she was in the pool alone.
Well, she wasn't supposed to be.
And where were you when it happened?
Eric and I were in the kitchen.
- We thought she was playing in her room.
- So basically, she was unsupervised?
No.
Not exactly.
We were all in the house together, and when we heard her cry, we were there in two seconds.
What if you hadn't heard her, Nicole?
But we did.
Listen, I know you've got a lot on your mind, with the robbery and now the restaurant, but a child requires constant supervision.
I know, and it will not happen again.
Just so you know, this is exactly why
I wanted her to take swimming lessons, so something like this would never happen.
This is a bigger deal than what you realize, Nicole.
I'm sorry, but I have to report it.
Those are the rules.
Report it?
But Tricia, I'm a good mother.
I have been for over a year and a half.
You know that.
I'll come back tomorrow around 4:00, and I'll bring a couple of my department psychologists.
- That work for you?
- Absolutely.
They're gonna want to assess the situation.
- Certainly.
- I'm glad you understand.
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Mom.
What's wrong?
Abby, honey.
Did you tell anyone at school about the swimming accident?
I told Hannah.
And Chelsea.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
Sweetheart, you didn't do anything wrong, okay?
Give me a hug.
They are not gonna take her away.
Abby is the happiest, healthiest she's been in her whole life, and that's because of you.
I don't think it matters.
I screwed up big-time.
No, you didn't.
It's gonna be okay.
You'll see.
I was thinking.
Maybe it would be a good thing if you were here tomorrow when Tricia came by.
Absolutely.
I can tell 'em what happened when Abby snuck off to the pool.
No.
More than that.
I want to show them we're a family.
I'd like that.
Me, too.
You look nice, mom.
Thank you.
So do you.
Now Tricia is gonna be here any minute.
When she gets here, we're all gonna sit down and have a little talk, okay?
What should I say?
- Always tell the truth, honey.
- Okay.
Tricia.
Hi, Mrs. Johnson.
It's Detective Klein.
Detective Klein.
Yes, I'm outside.
I'm sorry for showing up unexpected like this, but I was hoping we could come in and have a little look around.
Why?
What for?
It's just routine.
There's just some loose ends we're trying to tie up.
That's all.
Could you come back at another time?
Does it have to happen now?
It will only take a few minutes, and it would really help us out, Nicole.
Fine.
Maybe afterwards, you could look for the man who broke into my house and burned down my restaurant.
All right, you guys know what you're looking for.
You start on that side of the house.
Come with me.
They better leave before Tricia gets here.
Detective.
Can you explain this?
It's a rock.
Yes, it's a rock.
It's a decorative rock taken from your front yard.
And it's an exact match to this rock, which was thrown through the window of your restaurant
- to make it look like someone broke in.
- What?
And how about this?
Found this on the side of your house.
- You know what this is?
- No, I have no idea.
In a couple of days, the guys in our lab will know exactly what it is, and if this matches the accelerant that was used to set fire to your restaurant, I will be back here with a warrant,
- and I will arrest you.
- Nicole!
What's going on?
Um, Tricia... detective...
This is a big mistake, okay?
Whoever that robber was who got away, he must have put that there.
He's trying to frame me.
Nicole, insurance fraud is a serious offense, and so is arson.
- Who are you?
- Family welfare services.
- Sorry, Nicole.
- Miss Patterson.
- No.
Mommy.
- Wait, wait.
Honey, you're gonna have to come with us.
Tricia.
Please.
Nicole, don't make this any worse on her, please.
- Abby.
- No, mommy.
I don't like this any more than you do, sweetheart.
Just give her a chance to explain.
I'm gonna come get you.
I'm gonna come get you, okay?
- No, mommy.
- Take your hands off her.
- I promise Abby.
- No.
Mama!
- I promise.
- Mommy!
It'll be all right.
Damn it!
I just wanna talk to her,
- to tell her good night.
- Nicole, it's not allowed.
Why?
Okay, why can't I talk to her?
Why is it not allowed?
Those are the rules.
I gotta go now.
- Wait...
- Good-bye.
I just wanted to make sure that everything was okay between us.
I felt like we ended a little weird last time.
This is very nice.
Thank you.
So, how's Abby?
They took her.
What?
Who?
The county.
Why did they do that?
My restaurant burned down, and the police think I'm the one that did it.
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
You definitely don't deserve that.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- Hey.
- Hey, I got the address.
Davenport lived at 2815 Stone River Road near highway 16.
2815 Stone River Road, highway 16.
Okay, do you have time to get out there today?
Yeah, yeah.
I should be home about 1:30.
All right, if you're home at 1:30,
I'll see you there at zoo.
Okay.
Bye.
That was Eric.
I need to go.
That's all right.
I'll see you later.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
'Sup, Jade?
You a little surprised to see me, huh?
A little surprised to see Ray-Ray?
- What's in the hypo?
- It's potassium chloride.
Stops the heart and can't be traced.
Why, you want a hit?
You know what?
I think I'll pass.
What the hell you doing here?
Whose house is this?
Oh, I see.
Let me guess.
Little eye for an eye, huh?
She killed your boyfriend, so you're gonna kill hers?
What the hell?
You burned down the restaurant, right?
Stupid bitch.
He's still alive.
Eric!
Oh, my God!
I need an ambulance.
Um, there's been a fight.
One man may be dead, my boyfriend's unconscious.
It's 8215 mount casaba road.
Please hurry, please.
Paramedics are on the way.
Eric.
I know I never said it much.
I should have said it more.
But I love you.
I love you so much.
Nurse!
Nurse!
Raymond Bulinsky.
He's an acquaintance of William Davenport from Texas.
We think he's been stalking you and Mr. Wallace for several days, and he's most likely the one who poisoned your customers and planted the accelerant, burned down your restaurant.
Nicole.
I owe you an apology.
I was wrong, and it looks like your hunch was right.
And you'll call Tricia and explain all that to her?
Absolutely.
As soon as I get back to the station.
Good.
Because I want Abigail home for the weekend.
I'll do whatever I can to move them along.
Detective.
I gotta tell ya,
I honestly don't remember stabbin' the guy.
That's the concussion talking.
Our crime scene tells a pretty clear story.
You grabbed the knife, you stabbed him.
He hit you in the head several times and knocked you out, tried to get away and you didn't make it.
Doctor said Nicole arrived just in time.
She actually saved your life.
Miss Johnson, congratulations.
You got your man.
- Feel better.
- Thank you.
You really don't remember stabbing him, do you?
No, I don't.
I remember coming in, fighting with the guy, and nothing after that.
This whole thing...
It just doesn't add up.
I thought you said he was your husband.
We were engaged.
Did you say you were opening a restaurant soon?
That wouldn't be the Moon River Cafe, would it?
I'm actually allergic to nuts.
- Megan said to.
- Megan said what?
To practice swimming when you weren't looking.
Is this where he died?
You shot him in the back.
Maybe you should've just given him the money.
I spent a lot of time thinking about what I'd do if I found his killer.
I think it was Megan.
I think she was his girlfriend, and she's been playing us.
It's like some sick game of revenge.
How did she know to pose as a swim instructor?
She got a hold of the video camera.
Remember all that stuff on it about Abigail not wanting to swim?
I think we should call detective Klein.
With what evidence?
A gum wrapper?
He's got a corpse.
This is an open and shut case to him.
And you think she was there at my house?
I think she's the one that killed that guy.
But I think her target was you.
All right.
What do you wanna do about it?
Oh.
Here.
Let me help you.
I'll get it.
Come on.
- Better?
- Yeah.
- I'll be back.
- Okay.
Don't move.
That's far enough.
Everything that you do right now is being videotaped.
Go ahead.
Kill me like you killed Will.
He was your boyfriend, wasn't he?
He wouldn't have hurt you and your daughter.
All he wanted was the money.
And it's not like you don't have enough of it anyway.
Is that what you think?
I got news for you.
That man that you loved so much was about to rape me.
You're a liar.
He put his hands all over me.
- Stop it.
- He put his mouth on me.
I don't believe you.
He said we were gonna have a real fun time.
Shut up!
So you did all of this to me and my little girl for that man.
That's the man that you loved so much.
That's the man that you did all of this for.
You are pathetic.
Call the cops.
911.
What is your emergency?
Yes, we have a break-in at 1246 Hartwood Lane.
Sir?
Hello.
Sir?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm still here.
A woman has just injected herself with something.
- What?
- I don't know what.
- Is she moving?
- No.
She's not moving.
An ambulance is on the way.
Hurry, please.
Eric.
- Eric.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
Go.
Go.
How's your leg?
Oh, it's still a little stiff.
But it's getting better.
Actually, though, the walking helps.
Mom, remember the last time we were here?
Yeah.
I said I was afraid of the water.
I'm not anymore.
Good.
Hey, so Wednesday's the big day, huh?
Yeah, that's the day that we sign the adoption papers.
I can't wait to tell people my new last name.
You might be changing your last name again.
- We both will be.
- We will?
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?
Because we have something we need to tell you, and I think you're gonna like it.

Star Wars:
The Clone Wars
- S04E17 The Box
Original air date February 3, 2012
Male announcer:
Obi-Wan Kenobi in disguise!
Working undercover as assassin Rako Hardeen,
Obi-Wan leads a secret mission to uncover the separatist plot against Chancellor Palpatine.
Using cunning and courage, he gains the trust of bounty hunter Cad Bane and criminal mastermind Moralo Eval, earning him entrance to the stronghold of separatist leader Count Dooku.
Now it is here, on the beautiful planet of Serenno, that a barbaric contest will determine the fate of Obi-Wan Kenobi and possibly the Republic itself.
[Engines whooshing]
[Whooshing]
[Doors whirring]
Count Dooku, I apologize for my delay.
Your careless delay could have ruined my plan, Eval.
I see Cad Bane is with you.
Who is the other one?
This is Rako Hardeen.
When Bane's escape plan failed, we only succeeded thanks to Hardeen.
I thought he might be useful for the tournament.
Enough small talk.
I want my money.
That makes two of us.
You shall have it and perhaps much more, both of you, if you would like to enter our friendly little contest.
I'm in if he's in.
You already owe me for one job, Dooku.
Anything else will cost you triple.
I assure you that if you survive the challenge, the reward will be well worth it.
We have all the contestants we need.
Prepare the tournament.
Yes, my Lord.
You summoned me, Master?
Wrong to deceive you it was.
But much at stake there is.
So I was right.
Obi-Wan is still alive.
Skywalker, a powerful Jedi you are, yet unpredictable and dangerous you can be to both your friends and enemies.
For Obi-Wan, on your patience everything depends.
What if he needs our help?
Mm.
If you leave, help him you could, but his future uncertain is.
Trust in Obi-Wan we must.
So what kind of friendly little contest do you think the Count's got planned?
I'd be surprised if we all survive.
Nice hat.
[Trumpets]
Where did you get it?
[Blaster fires]
[Groans]
What are you looking at?
It's a nice hat.
Welcome to Serenno.
You have been invited here because you are the best bounty hunters in the galaxy.
Kiera Swan, two-time winner of the Obsidian Sphere.
Derrown, known simply as the exterminator.
Sixtat, the Outlands Butcher.
Embo, your bounty tallies were second only to one last season.
Cad Bane, who needs no introduction.
Rako Hardeen, the marksman of Concord Dawn.
Jakoli, known for never bringing anyone back alive.
Onca, you and your brother have been a legendary team.
This challenge may prove difficult for you alone.
Twazzi, your acrobatics once earned you praise from
Chancellor Valorum.
Sinrich, inventor of the holographic disguise matrix.
And finally, Mantu, your people were once a peaceful race.
How far they have fallen.
In a few moments, all 11 of you will enter what we call The Box.
Some of you will not make it out alive.
For those who do, we are looking for the Five most skilled among you.
Any additional survivors will be eliminated to preserve the integrity of the job that awaits you.
Place your weapons here.
For those we choose, you will, of course, be paid most handsomely.
But more than that, you will be a part of an operation remembered as a turning point in the clone wars.
And when we succeed, we will bring the Republic to its pitiful knees.
Listen up.
The Box was designed by me, Moralo Eval, to simulate certain situations that might happen on the job.
Go now.
Enter The Box, if you have the courage.
That's it.
Everyone inside.
Keep moving.
[Elevator whirring]
Before we begin our first challenge, let me say there is only one rule inside The Box.
There are no rules.
Totti cano?
Mataraz prekay?
The point, my friend, is to escape and quickly, because only the survivors will advance to the next challenge.
[Floor tile whirring]
[Gas hissing]
Dioxis.
Breathe it, and you're dead.
[Floor tile whirring]
Every man for himself.
Ah!
Whoa!
That wasn't so hard.
[Tiles whirring]
Ooh!
[Grunting]
Za leep din-raaar!
The way out isn't up.
It's down.
The filters in my helmet can protect me for a short time.
I'll scout a way out.
[Hydraulics hissing]
There's a hole in the floor which gets you below the gas line.
Jump down the hole and follow the tunnel.
What if he's wrong?
You got a better idea?
What took you so long?
Moralo Eval is impressed.
No casualties on the first challenge.
[Chuckles]
I guarantee you that will not be the case in the next.
[Machine whirring]
[Zapping and whirring]
[Grunts]
Impressive.
I sense something different about that one.
Tel me what you know about this Rako Hardeen.
He killed the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi but only with a sniper rifle.
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
[Walls whirring]
I know how to get out.
Show me.
There's a pattern to the blades.
Watch.
That one's next.
If I can time it right, I can climb up to that exit shaft.
Just follow me and time your jump.
Go.
[Grunting]
Get moving.
[Grunts]
[Grunting]
Hardeen has done it again.
I'm beginning to think he may be the best one to lead this operation.
Hardeen is crafty, I will grant you.
But let's see what happens when he is not the key to their survival.
To reach your final challenge, you must pass through my ray shield.
[Shields whirring]
The switch to turn it off is on the other side.
The syringe on the platform contains a highly electrolytic serum that will allow you to pass through the shield.
However, it is toxic to all but one of you.
[Chuckles]
Cano toni.
Passo-gran-sheesay.
So it would seem.
[Shields whirring]
[Platform whirring]
[Screaming]
Hey, who put you in charge?
Sa leep gaj ma ta-reel.
Does anyone know what this gasbag is saying?
I do.
He can get us out of this.
He's a Parwan.
His blood can take the electrolytic serum.
Din rar.
Are you certain?
50/50.
Depends on the blood type of the Parwan.
Great.
[Platform whirring]
Hurry.
Use the serum.
[Syringe zapping]
[Electrical zapping]
[Grunts]
[Grunting]
[Screaming]
Wha-- [Electrical zapping]
[Hydraulics hissing]
His blood, how did you know about it?
I used to kill Parwans for a living.
Ga?
Your box does not appear to be as much of a challenge as I thought.
Perhaps I should put Hardeen in charge of the mission.
But this was my plan.
You promised me the lead role.
You have one last test to change my mind.
Do not fear, Count Dooku.
I will show you who is weak.
The final challenge has arrived.
[Floor tiles whirring]
[Flames whooshing]
Grosso pozzi nix strumpf?
Unfortunately, no.
[Whooshing]
We are going to test your sniper skills.
Hit the target.
Step back, boys.
I'll show you how it's done.
[Blaster clicks]
[Target whirring]
[Blaster firing]
[Grunts]
[Screaming]
[Laughing]
I get it.
If we miss the target, this platform gets smaller.
Soon there won't be any platform left.
[Blaster clicks]
[Blaster firing]
This is not the first time you've saved everybody's skin,
Hardeen.
Five more hits.
Let's see how good you really are.
[Platforms whirring]
[Target whirring]
[Blaster firing]
[Blaster beeping]
[Chuckles]
Oh, what a shame.
Out of charges.
It's also important as a bounty hunter to be lucky, and your luck just ran out.
[Platforms whirring]
Ah!
How dare you defy Moralo Eval?
If you're gonna kill him, do it like a man.
You heard him, Eval.
Show us what you are really made of.
[Groaning]
[Beeping]
[Probe droids whirring]
[Grunting]
Ah!
[Explosion]
You're gonna have to do better than that.
Hmm, you, my friend, have seen nothing yet.
[Chuckles]
Yah!
[Flames whooshing]
[Grunts]
Let's even the playing field.
[Electrical zapping]
[Grunting]
[Both grunting]
Finish him, Hardeen.
[Gagging]
Very disappointing.
All due respect, I just want to do my job and get my money.
It is unfortunate that your leadership skills are so lacking.
Nonetheless, congratulations on surviving The Box.
Tomorrow you will kidnap Chancellor Palpatine at the festival on Naboo.
With the leader of the Republic as our hostage, we will demand the release of all separatist prisoners.
If our demand is not met, the Chancellor will be executed.
Either way, you will help reshape the galaxy.
Once you are all aboard the transport,
Eval will walk you through his plan.
However, the operation on Naboo will be run by Cad Bane.
All of you work for him now. [orchestral fanfare]

Obi-Wan is still alive.
Skywalker, a powerful Jedi you are, yet unpredictable and dangerous you can be.
To both your friends and enemies.
For Obi-Wan, on your patience everything depends.
What if he needs our help?
Hmm.
If you leave, help him you could.
But his future, uncertain is.
Trust in Obi-Wan we must.
HARDEEN:
So what kind of "friendly little contest"
you think the Count's got planned?
I'd be surprised if we all survive.
Nice hat.
(GRUNTS)
Where did you get it?
(GROANS)
What are you looking at?
It's a nice hat.
Welcome to Serenno.
You have been invited here because you are the best bounty hunters in the galaxy.
Kiera Swan, two-time winner of the Obsidian Sphere.
Derrown, known simply as the exterminator.
Sixtat, the Outlands Butcher.
Embo, your bounty tallies were second only to one last season.
Cad Bane, who needs no introduction.
Rako Hardeen, the marksman of Concord Dawn.
Jakoli, known for never bringing anyone back alive.
Onca, you and your brother have been a legendary team.
This challenge may prove difficult for you alone.
Twazzi, your acrobatics once earned you praise from Chancellor Valorum.
Sinrich, inventor of the holographic disguise matrix.
And, finally, Mantu.
-Your people were once a peaceful race.
-(CHUCKLING)
How far they have fallen.
In a few moments, all 11 of you will enter what we call The Box.
Some of you will not make it out alive.
For those who do, we are looking for the five most skilled among you.
Any additional survivors will be eliminated to preserve the integrity of the job that awaits you.
Place your weapons here.
For those we choose, you will, of course, be paid most handsomely.
But more than that, you will be a part of an operation remembered as a turning point in the Clone Wars.
And when we succeed, we will bring the Republic to its pitiful knees.
Listen up!
The Box was designed by me, Moralo Eval, to simulate certain situations that might happen on the job.
Go now, enter The Box, if you have the courage.
That's it, everyone inside.
Keep moving.
Before we begin our first challenge, let me say there is only one rule inside The Box.
There are no rules.
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)
The point, my friend, is to escape and quickly, because only the survivors will advance to the next challenge.
Dioxis!
Breathe it and you are dead!
Every man for himself!
(BOUNTY HUNTERS CRYING OUT)
That wasn't so hard.
(GRUNTING)
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)
The way out isn't up.
It's down.
The filters in my helmet can protect me for a short time.
I'll scout a way out.
(GEARS WHIRRING)
(PANEL OPENING)
There's a hole in the floor which gets you below the gas line.
Jump down the hole and follow the tunnel.
What if he's wrong?
You got a better idea?
What took you so long?
Moralo Eval is impressed.
No casualties on the first challenge.
(CHUCKLING) I guarantee you that will not be the case in the next.
(WHIRRING)
(GROANS)
Impressive.
I sense something different about that one.
Tell me what you know about this Rako Hardeen.
He killed the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi.
But only with a sniper rifle.
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
-I know how to get out!
-BANE:
Show me.
There's a pattern to the blades.
Watch, that one's next.
If I can time it right, I can climb up to that exit shaft.
-Just follow me and time your jump.
-Go!
(GRUNTING)
Get moving!
Hardeen has done it again.
I'm beginning to think he may be the best one to lead this operation.
Hardeen is crafty, I will grant you, but let's see what happens when he is not the key to their survival.
To reach your final challenge, you must pass through my ray shield.
The switch to turn it off is on the other side.
The syringe on the platform contains a highly electrolytic serum that will allow you to pass through the shield.
However, it is toxic to all but one of you.
(CHUCKLING EVILLY)
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)
So it would seem.
Ahhh!
Hey, who put you in charge?
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)
Does anyone know what this gas bag is saying?
I do.
He can get us out of this.
He's a Parwan.
His blood can take the electrolytic serum.
(SPEAKS ALIEN LANGUAGE)
Are you certain?
Fifty-fifty.
Depends on the blood type of the Parwan.
Great.
Hurry, use the serum.
(GROANING)
(SCREAMING)
His blood.
How did you know about it?
I used to kill Parwans for a living.
(EXCLAIMS IN SHOCK)
Your box does not appear to be as much of a challenge as I thought.
Perhaps I should put Hardeen in charge of the mission.
But this was my plan!
You promised me the lead role!
You have one last test to change my mind.
Do not fear, Count Dooku.
I will show you who is weak.
The final challenge has arrived.
(WHIRRING)
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)
Unfortunately, no.
We are going to test your sniper skills.
Hit the target.
Step back, boys, I'll show you how it's done.
(SCREAMING)
(LAUGHING)
HARDEEN:
I get it.
If we miss the target, this platform gets smaller.
Soon there won't be any platform left.
This is not the first time you've saved everybody's skin, Hardeen.
Five more hits.
Let's see how good you really are.
-(BEEPING) -(EVAL LAUGHING)
Oh, what a shame, out of charges.
It's also important as a bounty hunter to be lucky, and your luck just ran out.
(SCREAMING)
How dare you defy Moralo Eval!
If you're gonna kill him, do it like a man.
DOOKU:
You heard him, Eval.
Show us what you are really made of.
(CRYING OUT)
(GRUNTING)
(GRUNTS)
You're going to have to do better than that!
(GRUNTS) You, my friend, have seen nothing yet!
(EVAL LAUGHS)
Let's even the playing field.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Finish him, Hardeen.
(GASPING)
Very disappointing.
All due respect, I just wanna do my job and get my money.
DOOKU:
It is unfortunate that your leadership skills are so lacking.
And the rest, congratulations on surviving The Box.
Tomorrow you will kidnap Chancellor Palpatine at the festival on Naboo.
With the leader of The Republic as our hostage, we will demand the release of all Separatist prisoners.
If our demand is not met, the Chancellor will be executed.
Either way, you will help reshape the galaxy.
Once you are all aboard the transport,
Eval will walk you through his plan.
However, the operation on Naboo will be run by
Cad Bane.
All of you work for him now.

Original air date February 3, 2012
Obi-Wan Kenobi in disguise!
Working undercover as assassin Rako Hardeen,
Obi-Wan leads a secret mission to uncover the separatist plot against Chancellor Palpatine.
Using cunning and courage, he gains the trust of bounty hunter Cad Bane and criminal mastermind Moralo Eval, earning him entrance to the stronghold of separatist leader Count Dooku.
Now it is here, on the beautiful planet of Serenno, that a barbaric contest will determine the fate of Obi-Wan Kenobi and possibly the Republic itself.
Count Dooku, I apologize for my delay.
Your careless delay could have ruined my plan, Eval.
I see Cad Bane is with you.
Who is the other one?
This is Rako Hardeen.
When Bane's escape plan failed, we only succeeded thanks to Hardeen.
I thought he might be useful for the tournament.
Enough small talk.
I want my money.
That makes two of us.
You shall have it and perhaps much more, both of you, if you would like to enter our friendly little contest.
I'm in if he's in.
You already owe me for one job, Dooku.
Anything else will cost you triple.
I assure you that if you survive the challenge, the reward will be well worth it.
We have all the contestants we need.
Prepare the tournament.
Yes, my Lord.
You summoned me, Master?
Wrong to deceive you it was.
But much at stake there is.
So I was right.
Obi-Wan is still alive.
Skywalker, a powerful Jedi you are, yet unpredictable and dangerous you can be to both your friends and enemies.
For Obi-Wan, on your patience everything depends.

Hold it!
Hold it!
Or I'll shoot!
- He is innocent!
- Run!
Why?
He's much faster than me.
- No arrests?
- Of course not, ma'am, you can go.
Should not we stop it?
From this we will not be closer to Julio Olmedohoz,
And I am not in favor of unnecessary action.
It is not enough that I have to catch?
Forget Hernando, live long lives, and there is a dead man, who does not complain.
And by all means if you want to catch someone
I suggest that these two men cuff, until you wake up.
You know, why not stop drinking, waiter?
because when I drink, I forget everything.
But tonight there is something I do not want to forget.
So I stopped drinking.
And so you think through everything.
- This is an opportune moment, sir.
- I fell in love, you know?
I wish you much happiness.
With your permission.
But this is terrible, can I enjoy but do not.
She is married.
At 25
I fell in love with a married woman ...
It is impossible.
It is impossible.
I do not know what to do.
What would you do, if you want to another man's wife?
First, clarify your own feelings.
I can not help but love this feeling.
31,
And I think that ...
I told him my feelings ...
It is wise, Julio.
Javier, go to your room if my mother sees this ...
I doubt that surprised you, Alicia.

Ayala will catch you.
What are you going to do?
Do not say anything.

I have no choice but to leave, Alicia.
I can not allow myself to take into custody.
But the murder, which accused ...
You're not wrong.
And I can prove it?
I do not know.
But we need to be there any way ...
If you run away like you to accept, that you are a sinner.
Maybe I should go, you are not doing the gallows.
You saved my life.
I never said that, but thanks anyway.
Hey, do not worry.
This time I will not ask you to run away with me.
You do not say what's wrong with you?
I also wanted to ask you the same thing.
And just because I did not ask because I have no desire to hear the lies.
This means that you do not trust your wife?
When my wife is hiding from me, more and more difficult to believe him.
I've been to the cemetery.
It's none of your business, so I did not say that.
Everything that concerns you, contact me, Alicia.
What did you do there?
- Do you really not know?
- I ask.
I do not know the deceased, who Who wants to dig a judge, my father?
Can not be that hard to understand that may interest me.
I should say something before you go to bed,

Rules are rules.
Sure.
And implemented, even if they are unjust?
Yes.

If someone wanted to take the body, then this is guilty of something and do not want to discover it.

The witness is Kantaloába can be identified.

I can not let anyone Visit the witness before arrival.
I'm sorry.
What a beautiful woman, right?
And what a mercy that ...

And what are you waiting for?
Go get changed.
The son wanted to ask for a review, Angela.
My opinion: if you want to Senora everything else can wait.
Well, he heard his mother.
Thank you, Angela.
You can go whenever you want.
You can take all personal belongings.
Not only so called, is not it?
No.

And what's good for the hotel, You have to be good to me.
I have to say, I did not expect such a reaction on your part.
The performance matters, Senora brand.
He forgives.
I am Director of the way you wanted.
I hope all will be well, but I do not want to.
There is something strange about it.
Show me the contract.
If the company you owe, the responsible party agrees to pay the shortfall from its own resources.
I do not own my source.
My mother and Diego can not do this.
This is just one item in the contract.
Alfredo.
If you want to sign it, it is something that you would not say.
Call your accountant and ask, how things are going.
I will not do it.
You need to know Diego and what she thought of my mother.
You do not need to call because the accounting here.
Here you are.
The hotel is in debt to the state treasury.
300,000 pesetas.
To be paid within a week.
Cheated, Alfredo.
I renounce the director of the unit.
This would mean the end of the hotel.
Now the hotel is our future.
Do not you see?
That's all we have.
I feel that there is a good choice.
In any case, pay the debt.
Yeah, and what money?
Honey, if we do this, I ask them what you want.

Her husband followed like a shadow.
Well, that's difficult.
What does this mean?
In fact, he's a smart man.
And on my side, or on your belt or?
What if I have almost never the room?
I think it is me.
Well, that's a good sign.
Where it is, I mean ...

You're here not because of love.
Do not try to lie.
Theft for pushing this waiter.
Now leave the room and report to the supervisor.
And see you in jail tomorrow.

Here's the key.
Thank you.
You are beauty.
I do not understand why you hire a safe, once you leave.
I decided to stay here one more night.
Is not it time that the authorities provide the oversight?
Not because Julio told me everything.
To kiss and tried to run away with him and as crazy as he left.
Everything.
He lied to you.
If you like, you can talk to the husband.
Do not touch anything, Hernando.
He received a telegram from Dr. Eshneyderától.
Bad news agency.
Congress traveled to Argentina.
I had been informed.
It was not luck, is not it?
No, Hernando, I do not think that Luck played a role in with a sudden road.
You must have done something We continue Eshneyder instead.
- What?
- This is a multiple
I think that is very common, my friend.
May I call my friend?
Right.
You should read the telegram.
Why?
I know what it says.
No, no.
Well, not everything.
I can not come because of the Argentine Congress.
Pt
I advise you to gain experience.
Pt
Use granulated zinc and sulfuric acid mixture.
Pt
Give me a part ...
- Devil Eshneyder doctor, but we are not professionals!
What are you waiting for, Hernando?
Go ahead, buy all the which is on the list.
There is still a chance.
No, no, agent.
He called the judge that the gravediggers they take the body.
Agent!
How can I help you this time, madam?
I want to report a theft!
And do you know who the thief is?
Cecilia Mieres.
A thief.
Stayed at the Grand Hotel.
And what did he steal?
This one.
But it's here.
- Because I took back.
- How did you return?
I took him to the room.
I know it's wrong, but there was no other way ...
- And the brooch is yours?
No, my mother's brooch.
He should declare the theft.
My mother did not know that the brooch was stolen, I told him that I have.
What?
Protects the thief after you turn him?
There is reason to believe the thief will steal it again!
That night.
- Very good.
Thanks for the information, ma'am.
Thanks for the information?
And that's all you do?
I do not, I recommend you to take a rest and leave the investigation to the police the Grand Hotel.
I'm afraid that his imagination You, Dona Alicia.
Not my imagination, I know that this lady is going to steal it!
Do me a favor, leave the investigation into the hands of those who have to do.
What do you want this kind lady now?
He is a member of the upper class, and too much free time.
My mother always said, this the admirable layer.
Truly admirable.
Waiter, did not you hear that the theft occurred?
Do you know anything about this?
- No, sir.
- Have you noticed anything strange among the employees?
I doubt that anyone on the staff would have one.
Do not tell me.
Remember Christina Olmedora?
Yes, sir.
So, it is the maid who accident suffered, stealing from the hotel.
I do not think anyone it was an accident.
What do you think?
Killed.
And the culprit is exposed.
The coffee, sir.
- This is absurd!
- As you say, sir.
If you want to Alfredo pay a hotel tax of you would have to resign.
And do not try to fool the contract.
I was afraid that Alfredo did not want to help.
I'm sorry.
- My husband - a man of honor.
You know as well as I do.
And the amount you have?
For the common good.
The money is here.
The hotel's safe.
But you know, it's not fair to the Alfredo spending to pay inheritance tax of another.
And nothing.
What do you want?
Just what is fair.
Alfredo rescued from poverty.
Therefore warrants a permanent position as the Director for 10 years.
I do not like it when my daughter is trading with me.
And inherit one-third of the Grand Hotel.
How dare you?
Or maybe you're really honest with me?
Stop this nonsense!
You want to find out whether You hid from him?
Alfredo loves me.
I do not know whether I deserve it or not, but he loves me.
Do you think you would like and, if you find out that megtévesztetted pregnancy?
I do not know.
But I doubt that I would venture to shed light on the whole.
- I am ashamed of you.
- I'm just following your example.
You should be proud.
Do not you think for yourself?
No, Mom.
Madam, the guests arrived.
He is waiting for you.
Neither the word nor the Son does not Alfredonak need to know that I'm here.
What happened Marchioness?
This is not a courtesy visit.
I learned that you will be called Director of the boy.
I see that you are well informed.
And it's not happy?
You know what makes me happy same as you.
I do not know what kind of tricks reached a daughter,
I'm afraid if you want to know more as the name of my son, do not get it.
What does this mean?
Alfredonak no property.
The only thing I inherited the debts.
My husband, God forgive me,
It was a drunkard.
I can assure you that your son has money.
No, the money you put in, of everything that is left over after sold the ingatlanainkat.
Do not say Alfredonak we had to sell the house.
I know we were never friends, but now the same interest.
You do not understand, Teresa?
Our kids conspired take us to ruin.
Both of us, do not let that deceived.
Ready.
That's it.
I hope you're happy.
Yes, mother, a lot.
Let's get some champagne.
Sure, I'll join you.
If you'll excuse me.
I look forward to the charges.
I'd like an explanation, if possible.
It's easy to hand gave one-third of The Grand Hotel and the manager.
This is not the pride of the important but the future of the hotel.
There is a need for his money.
And it was the price.
- But in return for this, ma'am?
Currently there is a márkin?
nk the street property, court staff and without Thanks for your beloved son.
It is very encouraging.
But we have to put up with Alfred, for many years, only the name's sake.
This is exactly what I signed.
If you have a rich Alfredo, would have been a serious contender, but without money and without the property sad and timid character,
easy to get rid of it at any time.
Doña Teresa,
Are you saying ...
- Yes.
When the time is right.
You are a remarkable woman, Madame.
Of 853
Never cease to surprise me.
And I suppose, is aware, Alfredo Alarconnal to a marriage?
If you have to choose for my daughter would be better to love your family and his son.
I know the secret forces him to back off.
No doubt about it.
I bought everything I asked for.
But I am afraid that I was too late.
Hernando, what would you say if you knew to put away a small piece?
Well, at least 10 of these pieces are required.
It is not enough that a small
Greater appetite for both of us.
Hernando's Don Carlos Alarconé.
What little remained of it, right?
In my opinion, we should do Instead Eshneyder.
And what can we expect?
Legal consequences - for anything.
Remember, I am not a doctor, and that the rib can not be here but if luck smiles on us you get closer to the truth.
Since you know?
What does it matter?
Why did not you say so?
And you ask me, son?
You hid from me the baby.
If you find Doña Teresa, takes.
And you ...
- I am your mother.
And a hotel housekeeper.
Yes.
And it is my duty to tell the story of my woman.
Despite this self grandchild?
So, I have two children.

It seems that up.
It's a surprise to me.
What should I do?
- First, do what I did:

There was no other choice.
I did not trust in you.
Really?
You hate me.
And still all that I do, as required.

But you can not stay here any longer with the baby.
You have to go.
There's nowhere to go, you know.

When I noticed, I immediately realize it was who left without paying around the hotel.
- Stop it.
- He saw us.
And what do you say?
I saw them kissing in the dark?
He says that he saw the safe from being here.
What do you think?
To spy on us because he wanted to Prevent the theft?
He does not interfere with the theft.
You have to defeat that do not feel sorry for him.
Come on, go for a champagne.
We have reason to celebrate, and I can not be without champagne.
- Alternatively, if you do not hear the music.
- You make me music?
Yes ...
Come on, make more music.
So I look forward to apologize to me.
It's part of the game, Julio?
I give out all my secrets?
You killed her, and I said, I did it.
Sentenced to death for you.
She saw me and attacked me.
I had no choice but to to kill him.
On the way out I met the manager,
I showed him which way escaped from the killer.
And so I became a witness.
And why do you hide the gun the house, accusing me with this?
You're gone, and it was the only way to find you.
And the only witness who can get him off you.
And deflect suspicion about you?
Yes.
It will not go away.
It is a safe, senoritáé.
987,
Surprised?
What's going on, Julio?
I saw the woman and attacked me.
I had no other choice than to to kill him.
I met the manager out,
I showed him which way escaped from the killer.
You're a bastard.
Look who's talking.
This will be enough for the judge to find you guilty.
Senor Olmedo, remains open.
You bastard!
'll Pay for this!
To 999
I hope you die ...
The only witness will not forgive you.
Somebody had to do it.
And why did not you tell me?
I know Cecilia.
It is very difficult to cheat.
I had to trust me.
And why did you steal the brooch?
It was necessary for the case.
I knew it was right.
I said that I am not a thief.
Do not believe me?
First you steal, even after it is hit!
Alicia never hurt you.
I'm sorry that I could not stop it.
Well, then, for the sake of justice,
I will hit you you As compensation, right?
I think so.
Come on!
Come on!
I kneel here until you hit.
By now, you've had enough.
Are you sure that this should happen?
Yeah, yeah, Hernando.
If you see a black spot in china it has arsenic in it.
Watch!
Don Carlos was killed Alarcont to be exact, was poisoned with arsenic.
Do not be afraid.
I'm not a believer in a duel.
They also lack the courage to.
I did not ask you to forgive me, being in love with your wife.
And who do you think could have done this?
One and the same person whose concentrated in the hands of all and that prevents any investigation.
Doña Teresa Alarcon.
Doña Teresa Alarcon.
In the next section ...
Stay away from me.
Let go.
Let go of me.
Save the phony tears.
Just get back.
Oh, you little fool.
You just stay away from me.
We can't get involved in this.
Hello, Patrick.
How are you?
Good.
So what do you think?
Oh, it's a classic.
You know, it just gets better and better every time.
Yes.
What do you think of my request?
I don't think much of it, really, Patrick.
Really, I don't.
Meaning you can't accomplish it?
Any task can be accomplished, as long as it's broken down into manageable pieces.
So you'll do it?
Look, I know that I'm in your debt.
Okay, so we both agree that you owe me a favor.
Yes, I do.
So let this be my favor to you-- let it go-- the whole idea.
It's just not worth it.
Well, I find this very interesting.
I'm presenting you with a challenge, and yet you're backing away.
It's very unlike you, Mr. Stiles.
Look, if you must know,
I've grown mildly accustomed to you, Patrick.
You make me sit up and pay attention.
I'm very glad you're amused by me.
But what you're planning now, it's...
Well, it's certainly different.
Yes, it is.
If I do what you're asking of me and you get caught, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in a federal prison.
I'm well aware of that.
I just have to make sure I don't get caught.
All right.
Well, it's been a great pleasure knowing you, Mr. Jane.
Good luck.
Well, I-I used some pretty harsh words.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
But naturally, if I'd known...

Hey, come on.
Please.
Just--just get in the car.
This is ridiculous.
Why are you mad at me?
I-I didn't force you to escape from prison.
No, you just tricked me into it.
Oh, come on.
Wait.
You thought it was Red John that got you out, didn't you?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, it wasn't.
I did.
I got you out.
He would have left you in there to rot.
And I took a lot of risks in doing it.
Nobody ever accused you of good judgment.
Well, what about you?
You're the one walking off into the desert 10 miles from a prison you just broke out of.
I'm offering you a ride.
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.
You can dump me at any time.
Fine.
Jane, how many messages do I have to leave you?
Call me back.
Hold on, Tom.
She just walked in.
No.
No, don't inform the Marshals yet.
I want to bring CBI up to speed first.
I'll call you back.
What's going on?
Have you heard about Lorelei Martins yet?
No.
She escaped from federal prison this morning.
Your Mr. Jane was questioning prison transport drivers.
Yes, but no.
He wouldn't.
He wouldn't.
He wouldn't?
Where is he now?
I don't know.
I haven't heard from him since yesterday.
He hasn't answered his phone.
But that doesn't mean he did this.
It would make it much more likely, wouldn't it?
Why is this a Homeland Security issue?
It's complicated.
I mean, if he is with her, he's in a lot of danger.
You know him better than anybody.
Now if he did do this, where would he go?
Any place I could possibly think of is where he wouldn't go.
Uh, would you excuse me for a minute?
I'll be right back.
Has anyone seen Jane?
No.
We need to find him right now.
Put a B.O.L.O. out on his car.
Grace, Cho, I want you to go to his motel room.
Rigs, call his cell phone company.
Get GPS tracking on his phone.
What's going on?
Lorelei Martins escaped from prison this morning.
Was Jane involved?
We don't know yet.
Bob Kirkland, Homeland Security.
He's leading the search to find Martins.
Boss.
Sac P.D. got a report of an abandoned blue Citroen this morning.
Uh, parking lot at 16th and K Street.
Text it to me.
This isn't gonna work.
Well, that's optimistic.
I won't tell you who he is or where he is.
Give it time.
Not now.
Not ever.
Doesn't work.
Really?
I figured that when no sound came out of it.
Yes.
Can we go?
Tell me where.
The ocean.
I wanna see the ocean.
He was leaving a text message.
It's for you.
"Someone after me."
He was being followed.
Looks like he's been abducted.
Jane doesn't have Lorelei.
Lorelei has Jane.
Our fugitive is a known associate of the serial killer Red John.
She's wanted for murder conspiracy, kidnapping, and weapons violations.
We believe that Martins and unknown accomplices abducted CBI consultant Patrick Jane.
Jane led a 6-month undercover operation that resulted in Lorelei's arrest.
Martins may have kidnapped him for payback or to take him to Red John.
Either way, we need to find them.
Martins is a Sacramento girl.
I want systematic searches of old residences, old friends, old coworkers.
You all have information packets.
Study them, and when you're done, contact myself or Agent Kirkland for your assignments.
Thank you.
- Let's start with Lorelei's mother.
- Okay.
I wonder where they're going.
I'm gonna make a fire.
So, what's this about?
Your daughter broke out of prison this morning.
Oh.
Of course.
Have you had any contact with-- with Lorelei recently?
Lorelei hasn't contacted me in years.
Thankfully.
When she does, it's always trouble.
Always.
We have reason to believe that Lorelei has taken a hostage.
His life could be in danger.
Do you have any information that you could give us about where we could find her?
Any, uh, old friends?
Favorite places?
Nope.
I don't have anything to do with her, and she doesn't have anything to do with me.
Do you have any insight as to how she became this way?
Lorelei only ever cared about Lorelei.
What are you gonna do with a kid like that?
Well, you don't feel at all responsible for her?
Now there's a question from a woman without children.
I've satisfied all my duties and responsibilities of motherhood.
I mean, look around.
Lorelei grew up in a beautiful home.
She could be anything.
Is this your father?
That's my husband.
He's away in Munich.
He's away a lot?
Yes.
Oh.
Figures.
I don't like your tone.
Dana, your daughter is the mistress of a psychopathic killer, yet you have no information to give us about how or why she got that way.
Frankly, I don't care if you like my tone.
To hell with you, lady.
What happened to her?
Get out of my house.
Thank you.
You should try it.
Water's lovely.
Eh.
Uh, quickly--go and hide yourself behind those rocks.
Hello, young man.
How you doing?
Was that your campfire?
No, Officer.
I'm not an officer.
I'm a Park Ranger.
So no gun, huh?
Right.
Campfires are illegal on this beach without a permit.
Well, it... it's not mine.
Are you okay, sir?
You seem a little nervous.
Never better.
Are you alone?
Hi, Officer!
I'm over here!
I'm sorry.
I can't come out!
I don't have any clothes on.
Yeah, well, public nudity's prohibited on state beaches.
Yes, uh, I'm sorry!
It won't happen again!
Promise, it-- it won't happen again.
Sorry, sir.
Okay.
You folks have a nice day.
Yeah.
No campfires.
So where to now?
North to Canada?
South to Mexico?
I'm flexible.
I know a place where no one will find us.
Take the I-60 East, but I gotta change my look first.
Find a convenience store.
I like the take-charge attitude.
No, you don't.
I do.
Clearly, you've taken care of someone in your life.
Made all the decisions.
Acted the adult.
I'm guessing you had a vain, selfish, and controlling mother.
But you found the strength to pull away.
Does she resent you for that?
Patrick, do you really want to get to know me?
Of course.
Give the act a rest.
What?
I-I wasn't...
Yes, you were.
Okay.
I knew it.
Soon as I heard that kidnapping report on my radio.
I called it in.
This is the young man I talked to.
Was there a woman with him?
Yes, there most certainly was.
Only I didn't see her on account of she was naked.
At least that what she said.
She was behind that rock there where she was changing.
The young man got kind of jumpy.
Uh-huh.
Asked me if I had a gun.
She probably had a gun on you the whole time.
That's what I figured.
And if he said one wrong word or tried to run--bam.
I mean, she would have shot us both dead.
I'm just thankful he kept his head.
Happen to see what kind of car they were driving?
Yes, sir.
There was only one car on the bluff.
A dark blue 1990s Dynasty Sedan.

Scared you, didn't I?
No.
Saw some cops.
Spooked me.
Well, I'm glad I left you the keys.
You're gonna be a French honey blonde.
- How's that sound?
- Sure.
Did you get snacks?
Sure did.
I have something to say.
Come in.
Sit down, Dana.
What's going on?
Couldn't sleep last night.
Hmm.
My husband mustn't know.
Mustn't know what?
I sold Lorelei's sister.
Sister?
I don't remember reading anything about a sister in Lorelei's file.
Because I sold her.
All right, you're gonna have to help me out here, Dana.
30 years ago, I didn't have the money to raise 2 girls.
I had substance issues.
Go on.
So after... their dad left...
I just stopped functioning, you know?
And, um, Lorelei-- she was 5.
And she held me up, you know?
But...
Miranda-- that was her name...
She was 2.
I mean, what was I gonna do with a 2-year-old?
What did you do?
Well, I knew...
- I knew this rich...
- foreign couple, who...
childless.
So we made a deal under the table.
Why didn't they just adopt her?
We all wanted what we wanted, so we just got it done.
What did you tell Lorelei?
I told her...
I told her all kinds of stuff.
I...
And she never forgave me.
I didn't realize it at the time, but... that day...
I lost two daughters.
Not one.
Want me to get you a tissue?
Hey there.
Looking for a room.
Place to rest my weary bones.
Been on the road since New Mexico.
It's $48 cash, $52 credit.
Oop.
I'll be paying cash.
Okay.
You don't happen to have one without a television?
Uh, TV's busted in 13.
No discount.
Okay.
Have a nice day.
Mm-hmm.
We tried to have our own children.
I could not.
Why didn't you just adopt legally?
Well, I was on work visa from Romania.
And we could not adopt until we were citizens, and that takes years.
Mr. Kirkland, this is Marta and Virgil Roman.
They're just telling me how they came to buy Miranda Martins.
You had to see her.
She was in a bad situation.
Virgil and I knew we could give her a life full of love and opportunity.
But she turned out to be a very troubled girl.
Very unhappy.
So when she was in high school, we sent her to a therapist, and she remembered a lot of things we thought she had forgotten.
Her mother?
No.
She remembered only one name--
Lorelei.
Of course, we found her sister Lorelei and reunited them.
The sisters were so happy, and they were so close.
You've never seen two sisters who were closer.
Where is Miranda now?
We need to talk to her.
She... she was murdered.
She's dead.
Thanks for the dress.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
So, listen, uh...
You gonna tell me where we're going?
To a cabin my sister and I used to go to.
You have a sister?
I did.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
Her death was a gift, sort of.
You want to explain that?
You wouldn't understand.
Well, you could try me.
I mean, I-I'd like to understand.
In case you haven't noticed, healing is not my strong suit.
Losing my sister brought me into my full reality.
I faced my deepest fear.
I have complete awareness.
Nothing can hurt me.
That's nonsense.
Believe me.
Things can hurt you.
Try me.
Mm.
This beer is warm.
I'll get some ice.
Miranda was beautiful, like her sister.
What does the coroner's report say about the cause of death?
Heatstroke.
After she was raped, she was left chained inside of an empty warehouse.
Daytime temperatures reached 120 degrees inside.
Coroner figures she lasted about two days.
And they never found the killer?
The case is still open.
There's no trace evidence, no witnesses.
Just this.
- Hello?
- Hey, Lisbon.
I need your help.
I need to take this.
Could you...
I'll be right back.

Jane, what's going on?
Have you been kidnapped?
Yes.
I'm in fear of my life.
I can't talk long.
Did you know Lorelei had a sister?
Yes.
Miranda.
Her mother gave her up.
Where are you?
If she catches me on the phone, she'll kill me.
What happened to Miranda?
She was murdered.
Abducted, raped, and left for dead five years ago.
- Who did it?
- They don't know.
They don't even have a suspect.
But listen to this-- the police kept back a key detail from the public.
Before Miranda died, she carved a message into the warehouse floor.
What'd it say?
I'm looking at the crime scene photo now.
It says "Roy."
I need a copy of that photo.
Uh, Lisbon, yeah.
Fax it to me at this number...
I'm Katie Riley, and I'll be back with more of your favorite mellow blends right after the news.
State and federal authorities have intensified the search for a Sacramento woman, Lorelei Martins.
Jane, just tell me where you are.
We can help you.
Just fax it to me.
I gotta go.
Gotta go.
According to police, Martins is holding a hostage,
Patrick Jane.
Yesterday, CBI consultant Jane's car was found abandoned by the side of the road.
Everything okay?
Jane just called me.
You lie!
Aah!
Liar!
Filthy liar!
Kidnapped you?
!
Please...
How dare you?
!
You lied!
I didn't lie.
I just didn't tell you everything.
Why didn't you tell me?
I had to protect myself.
Aah!
Oh!
Please.
Just stop.
You had me going, Patrick.
For a second there, I almost trusted you.
You should.
You should trust me.
Oh, stop!
Just stop playing the role.
Yes, I play a role, but not with you.
I'm being honest with you.
Lies on lies!
Lorelei, listen to me.
You have to listen to me.
Your buddy Red John-- he killed your sister.
What are you talking about?
Your sister Miranda.
She wrote a name on the floor of the warehouse where she died.
The name of the man who raped and killed her.
It was never released to the public.
You're making that up.
No.
This is a crime scene photo of your sister's murder.
"Roy."
Yes, Roy.
We both know who uses that alias.
I don't understand.
- Where did you get this?
- It doesn't matter.
Red John raped and killed your sister.
No.
He made you a victim so that he could rescue you.
No.
He preyed on your pain.
- No, it's not true.
- Yes.
You don't want it to be true, but it's true, and you can feel that it's true.
Just stop!
God, you're just like him, you know that?
- Relentless manipulation.
- I am nothing like him.
How would you know?
I know.
I only wonder why the two of you didn't become lifelong friends the moment you shook hands.
Wait!
Where are we going?
We still going to the cabin?
That's where I'm going.
You can go where you like.
We traced Jane's call to a truck stop motel on Route 99 just north of Chico.
Right here.
The fugitive and her hostage were gone by the time deputies got to the motel.

They were moving north.
Let's assume they still are.
Where are they going?
Well, if they take the 97 North, they'll hit the Butter Valley Airport.
One runway.
Public use.
Five takeoffs a day.
They might go for a plane.
Okay, lock it down.
What else?
I've been going through financial records for Lorelei's sister.
She owned a cabin in the Sierras about 200 miles north of that motel.
From what I can see, the cabin was never sold after her death.
An anonymous third party has been paying the taxes on it.
- Red John?
- Call tactical.
I want a chopper here in ten.
It's just up ahead, at the end of the road.
You go ahead.
I'll get the stuff.
Okay.
The key is under the flower pot.
Welcome.
Well, it's a nice place.
Yeah.
Belonged to my sister.
We used to come here to forget about the world.
It's safe.
Red John didn't kill her, Patrick.
You'll never convince me that he did.
I'd kill for a cup of tea right now.
I can make you one.
I'd like that.
But we can't stay here.
Why not?
If Miranda bought this place, the police'll find it.
They're probably on their way here right now.
- Then we have to go.
- No, you have to go.
- I'll stay.
I'll try and delay them.
- What?
Well, like you said, I'm never gonna convince you that Red John killed your sister.
You need to go and find out the truth for yourself.
But, Patrick-- and when you do, when you know the truth...
You know where to find me.
Just call me.
Where are the car keys?
In the car.
Is there a back way out of here?
Um, there's--no.
There's just fire trails.
Okay.
What about this thing?
Does this run?
It's been on a trickle charge.
Yeah, it should.
Okay, you take the 4x4 on the fire road.
They won't be looking for that.
I'm gonna cover for you.
You can't stay here, Patrick.
There's no way they'll believe you were my hostage.
I will make them believe.
You want me to beat you up or something?
- Knock you out?
- Uh, no, thanks.
You gotta go.
Check the cabin.
Search the surrounding woods.
Jane.
He's okay.
Did you get her?
Not yet.
She's, uh, she's on foot.
Agent Kirkland, Homeland Security.
I need rescue hot south of Orr Lake, forest Route 42 North 12.
- Who's that guy?
- Don't talk.
Help's on the way.
Hurts.
Shh.
It's okay.
You'll never know.
I'll never know what?
Whether I engineered the escape and abduction.
Trust me.
I know.
You don't know.
You just guess.
And you didn't tell your new best friend, Kirkland, either.
I don't have any evidence.
If I did, I'd put you in cuffs myself.
No, you wouldn't.
Try me.
What's so funny?
Nothing.
Sorry.
All of it's worth it.
She told me Red John and I are very much alike.
That it's a wonder we weren't best friends from the moment we shook hands.
You've met Red John?
Yes.
He's someone I know.

Our fugitive is a known associate of the serial killer Red John.
She's wanted for murder conspiracy, kidnapping, and weapons violations.
We believe that Martins and unknown accomplices abducted CBI consultant Patrick Jane.
Jane led a 6-month undercover operation that resulted in Lorelei's arrest.
Martins may have kidnapped him for payback or to take him to Red John.
Either way, we need to find them.
Martins is a Sacramento girl.
I want systematic searches of old residences, old friends, old coworkers.
You all have information packets.
Study them, and when you're done, contact myself or Agent Kirkland for your assignments.
Thank you.
- Let's start with Lorelei's mother.
- Okay.
I wonder where they're going.
I'm gonna make a fire.
So, what's this about?
Your daughter broke out of prison this morning.
Oh.
Of course.
Have you had any contact with-- with Lorelei recently?
Lorelei hasn't contacted me in years.
Thankfully.
When she does, it's always trouble.
Always.
We have reason to believe that Lorelei has taken a hostage.
His life could be in danger.
Do you have any information that you could give us about where we could find her?
Any, uh, old friends?
Favorite places?
Nope.
I don't have anything to do with her, and she doesn't have anything to do with me.
Do you have any insight as to how she became this way?
Lorelei only ever cared about Lorelei.
What are you gonna do with a kid like that?
Well, you don't feel at all responsible for her?
Now there's a question from a woman without children.
I've satisfied all my duties and responsibilities of motherhood.
I mean, look around.
Lorelei grew up in a beautiful home.
She could be anything.
Is this your father?
That's my husband.
He's away in Munich.
He's away a lot?
Yes.
Oh.
Figures.
I don't like your tone.
Dana, your daughter is the mistress of a psychopathic killer, yet you have no information to give us about how or why she got that way.
Frankly, I don't care if you like my tone.
To hell with you, lady.
What happened to her?
Get out of my house.
Thank you.
You should try it.
Water's lovely.
Eh.
Uh, quickly--go and hide yourself behind those rocks.
Hello, young man.
How you doing?
Was that your campfire?
No, Officer.
I'm not an officer.
I'm a Park Ranger.
So no gun, huh?
Right.
Campfires are illegal on this beach without a permit.
Well, it... it's not mine.
Are you okay, sir?
You seem a little nervous.
Never better.
Are you alone?
Hi, Officer!
I'm over here!
I'm sorry.
I can't come out!
I don't have any clothes on.
Yeah, well, public nudity's prohibited on state beaches.
Yes, uh, I'm sorry!
It won't happen again!
Promise, it-- it won't happen again.
Sorry, sir.
Okay.
You folks have a nice day.
Yeah.
No campfires.
So where to now?
North to Canada?
South to Mexico?
I'm flexible.
I know a place where no one will find us.
Take the I-60 East, but I gotta change my look first.
Find a convenience store.
I like the take-charge attitude.
No, you don't.
I do.
Clearly, you've taken care of someone in your life.
Made all the decisions.
Acted the adult.
I'm guessing you had a vain, selfish, and controlling mother.
But you found the strength to pull away.
Does she resent you for that?
Patrick, do you really want to get to know me?
Of course.
Give the act a rest.
What?
I-I wasn't...
Yes, you were.
Okay.
I knew it.
Soon as I heard that kidnapping report on my radio.
I called it in.
This is the young man I talked to.
Was there a woman with him?
Yes, there most certainly was.
Only I didn't see her on account of she was naked.
At least that what she said.
She was behind that rock there where she was changing.
The young man got kind of jumpy.
Uh-huh.
Asked me if I had a gun.
She probably had a gun on you the whole time.
That's what I figured.
And if he said one wrong word or tried to run--bam.
I mean, she would have shot us both dead.
I'm just thankful he kept his head.
Happen to see what kind of car they were driving?
Yes, sir.
There was only one car on the bluff.
A dark blue 1990s Dynasty Sedan.

No.

Spooked me.
Well, I'm glad I left you the keys.
You're gonna be a French honey blonde.
- How's that sound?
- Sure.
Did you get snacks?
Sure did.
I have something to say.
Come in.
Sit down, Dana.
What's going on?
Couldn't sleep last night.
Hmm.
My husband mustn't know.
Mustn't know what?
I sold Lorelei's sister.
Sister?
I don't remember reading anything about a sister in Lorelei's file.
Because I sold her.
All right, you're gonna have to help me out here, Dana.
30 years ago, I didn't have the money to raise 2 girls.
I had substance issues.
Go on.
So after... their dad left...
I just stopped functioning, you know?
And, um, Lorelei-- she was 5.
And she held me up, you know?
But...
Miranda-- that was her name...
She was 2.
I mean, what was I gonna do with a 2-year-old?
What did you do?
Well, I knew...
- I knew this rich...
- foreign couple, who...
childless.
So we made a deal under the table.
Why didn't they just adopt her?
We all wanted what we wanted, so we just got it done.
What did you tell Lorelei?
I told her...
I told her all kinds of stuff.
I...
And she never forgave me.
I didn't realize it at the time, but... that day...
I lost two daughters.
Not one.
Want me to get you a tissue?
Hey there.
Looking for a room.
Place to rest my weary bones.
Been on the road since New Mexico.
It's $48 cash, $52 credit.
Oop.
I'll be paying cash.
Okay.
You don't happen to have one without a television?
Uh, TV's busted in 13.
No discount.
Okay.
Have a nice day.
Mm-hmm.
We tried to have our own children.
I could not.
Why didn't you just adopt legally?
Well, I was on work visa from Romania.
And we could not adopt until we were citizens, and that takes years.
Mr. Kirkland, this is Marta and Virgil Roman.
They're just telling me how they came to buy Miranda Martins.
You had to see her.
She was in a bad situation.
Virgil and I knew we could give her a life full of love and opportunity.
But she turned out to be a very troubled girl.
Very unhappy.
So when she was in high school, we sent her to a therapist, and she remembered a lot of things we thought she had forgotten.
Her mother?
No.
She remembered only one name--
Lorelei.
Of course, we found her sister Lorelei and reunited them.
The sisters were so happy, and they were so close.
You've never seen two sisters who were closer.
Where is Miranda now?
We need to talk to her.
She... she was murdered.
She's dead.
Thanks for the dress.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
So, listen, uh...
You gonna tell me where we're going?
To a cabin my sister and I used to go to.
You have a sister?
I did.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
Her death was a gift, sort of.
You want to explain that?
You wouldn't understand.
Well, you could try me.
I mean, I-I'd like to understand.
In case you haven't noticed, healing is not my strong suit.
Losing my sister brought me into my full reality.
I faced my deepest fear.
I have complete awareness.
Nothing can hurt me.
That's nonsense.
Believe me.
Things can hurt you.
Try me.
Mm.
This beer is warm.
I'll get some ice.
Miranda was beautiful, like her sister.
What does the coroner's report say about the cause of death?
Heatstroke.
After she was raped, she was left chained inside of an empty warehouse.
Daytime temperatures reached 120 degrees inside.
Coroner figures she lasted about two days.
And they never found the killer?
The case is still open.
There's no trace evidence, no witnesses.
Just this.
- Hello?
- Hey, Lisbon.
I need your help.
I need to take this.
Could you...
I'll be right back.

Jane, what's going on?
Have you been kidnapped?
Yes.
I'm in fear of my life.
I can't talk long.
Did you know Lorelei had a sister?
Yes.
Miranda.
Her mother gave her up.
Where are you?
If she catches me on the phone, she'll kill me.
What happened to Miranda?
She was murdered.
Abducted, raped, and left for dead five years ago.
- Who did it?
- They don't know.
They don't even have a suspect.
But listen to this-- the police kept back a key detail from the public.
Before Miranda died, she carved a message into the warehouse floor.
What'd it say?
I'm looking at the crime scene photo now.
It says "Roy."
I need a copy of that photo.
Uh, Lisbon, yeah.
Fax it to me at this number...
I'm Katie Riley, and I'll be back with more of your favorite mellow blends right after the news.
State and federal authorities have intensified the search for a Sacramento woman, Lorelei Martins.
Jane, just tell me where you are.
We can help you.
Just fax it to me.
I gotta go.
Gotta go.
According to police, Martins is holding a hostage,
Patrick Jane.
Yesterday, CBI consultant Jane's car was found abandoned by the side of the road.
Everything okay?
Jane just called me.
You lie!
Aah!
Liar!
Filthy liar!
Kidnapped you?
!
Please...
How dare you?
!
You lied!
I didn't lie.
I just didn't tell you everything.
Why didn't you tell me?
I had to protect myself.
Aah!
Oh!
Please.
Just stop.
You had me going, Patrick.
For a second there, I almost trusted you.
You should.
You should trust me.
Oh, stop!
Just stop playing the role.
Yes, I play a role, but not with you.
I'm being honest with you.
Lies on lies!
Lorelei, listen to me.
You have to listen to me.
Your buddy Red John-- he killed your sister.
What are you talking about?
Your sister Miranda.
She wrote a name on the floor of the warehouse where she died.
The name of the man who raped and killed her.
It was never released to the public.
You're making that up.
No.
This is a crime scene photo of your sister's murder.
"Roy."
Yes, Roy.
We both know who uses that alias.
I don't understand.
- Where did you get this?
- It doesn't matter.
Red John raped and killed your sister.
No.
He made you a victim so that he could rescue you.
No.
He preyed on your pain.
- No, it's not true.
- Yes.
You don't want it to be true, but it's true, and you can feel that it's true.
Just stop!
God, you're just like him, you know that?
- Relentless manipulation.
- I am nothing like him.
How would you know?
I know.
I only wonder why the two of you didn't become lifelong friends the moment you shook hands.
Wait!
Where are we going?
We still going to the cabin?
That's where I'm going.
You can go where you like.
We traced Jane's call to a truck stop motel on Route 99 just north of Chico.
Right here.
The fugitive and her hostage were gone by the time deputies got to the motel.

They were moving north.
Let's assume they still are.
Where are they going?
Well, if they take the 97 North, they'll hit the Butter Valley Airport.
One runway.
Public use.
Five takeoffs a day.
They might go for a plane.
Okay, lock it down.
What else?
I've been going through financial records for Lorelei's sister.
She owned a cabin in the Sierras about 200 miles north of that motel.
From what I can see, the cabin was never sold after her death.
An anonymous third party has been paying the taxes on it.
- Red John?
- Call tactical.
I want a chopper here in ten.
It's just up ahead, at the end of the road.
You go ahead.
I'll get the stuff.
Okay.
The key is under the flower pot.
Welcome.
Well, it's a nice place.
Yeah.
Belonged to my sister.
We used to come here to forget about the world.
It's safe.
Red John didn't kill her, Patrick.
You'll never convince me that he did.
I'd kill for a cup of tea right now.
I can make you one.
I'd like that.
But we can't stay here.
Why not?
If Miranda bought this place, the police'll find it.
They're probably on their way here right now.
- Then we have to go.
- No, you have to go.
- I'll stay.
I'll try and delay them.
- What?
Well, like you said, I'm never gonna convince you that Red John killed your sister.
You need to go and find out the truth for yourself.
But, Patrick-- and when you do, when you know the truth...
You know where to find me.
Just call me.
Where are the car keys?
In the car.
Is there a back way out of here?
Um, there's--no.
There's just fire trails.
Okay.
What about this thing?
Does this run?
It's been on a trickle charge.
Yeah, it should.
Okay, you take the 4x4 on the fire road.
They won't be looking for that.
I'm gonna cover for you.
You can't stay here, Patrick.
There's no way they'll believe you were my hostage.
I will make them believe.
You want me to beat you up or something?
- Knock you out?
- Uh, no, thanks.
You gotta go.
Check the cabin.
Search the surrounding woods.
Jane.
He's okay.
Did you get her?
Not yet.
She's, uh, she's on foot.
Agent Kirkland, Homeland Security.
I need rescue hot south of Orr Lake, forest Route 42 North 12.
- Who's that guy?
- Don't talk.
Help's on the way.
Hurts.
Shh.
It's okay.
You'll never know.
I'll never know what?
Whether I engineered the escape and abduction.
Trust me.
I know.
You don't know.
You just guess.
And you didn't tell your new best friend, Kirkland, either.
I don't have any evidence.
If I did, I'd put you in cuffs myself.
No, you wouldn't.
Try me.
What's so funny?
Nothing.
Sorry.
All of it's worth it.
She told me Red John and I are very much alike.
That it's a wonder we weren't best friends from the moment we shook hands.
You've met Red John?
Yes.
He's someone I know.

Oh, you little fool.
You just stay away from me.

(Man) We can't get involved in this.
(Lowered voice) Hello, Patrick.
How are you?
(Lowered voice) Good.
So what do you think?
Oh, it's a classic.
You know, it just gets better and better every time.
Yes.
What do you think of my request?
I don't think much of it, really, Patrick.
Really, I don't.
Meaning you can't accomplish it?
Any task can be accomplished, as long as it's broken down into manageable pieces.
So you'll do it?
Look, I know that I'm in your debt.
Okay, so we both agree that you owe me a favor.
Yes, I do.
So let this be my favor to you-- let it go-- the whole idea.
It's just not worth it.
Well, I find this very interesting.
I'm presenting you with a challenge, and yet you're backing away.
It's very unlike you, Mr. Stiles.
Look, if you must know,
I've grown mildly accustomed to you, Patrick.
You make me sit up and pay attention.
I'm very glad you're amused by me.
But what you're planning now, it's...
Well, it's certainly different.
Yes, it is.
If I do what you're asking of me and you get caught, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in a federal prison.
I'm well aware of that.
I just have to make sure I don't get caught.
(Sighs and chuckles)
All right.
Well, it's been a great pleasure knowing you, Mr. Jane.
Good luck.
Well, I-I used some pretty harsh words.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
But naturally, if I'd known...

Hey, come on.
Please.
Just--just get in the car.
This is ridiculous.
Why are you mad at me?
I-I didn't force you to escape from prison.
No, you just tricked me into it.
Oh, come on.
Wait.
You thought it was Red John that got you out, didn't you?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, it wasn't.
I did.
I got you out.
He would have left you in there to rot.
And I took a lot of risks in doing it.
Nobody ever accused you of good judgment.
Well, what about you?
You're the one walking off into the desert 10 miles from a prison you just broke out of.
I'm offering you a ride.
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.
You can dump me at any time.
Fine.
Jane, how many messages do I have to leave you?
Call me back.
(Speaking inaudibly)
Hold on, Tom.
She just walked in.
No.
No, don't inform the Marshals yet.
I want to bring CBI up to speed first.
I'll call you back.
What's going on?
Have you heard about Lorelei Martins yet?
No.
She escaped from federal prison this morning.
Your Mr. Jane was questioning prison transport drivers.
Yes, but no.
He wouldn't.
He wouldn't.
He wouldn't?
Where is he now?
I don't know.
I haven't heard from him since yesterday.
He hasn't answered his phone.
But that doesn't mean he did this.
It would make it much more likely, wouldn't it?
Why is this a Homeland Security issue?
It's complicated.
I mean, if he is with her, he's in a lot of danger.
You know him better than anybody.
Now if he did do this, where would he go?
Any place I could possibly think of is where he wouldn't go.
Uh, would you excuse me for a minute?
I'll be right back.
Has anyone seen Jane?
No.
We need to find him right now.
Put a B.O.L.O. out on his car.

Boss.
Sac P.D. got a report of an abandoned blue Citroen this morning.
Uh, parking lot at 16th and K Street.

Well, that's optimistic.

So we made a deal under the table. (Clears throat)
Why didn't they just adopt her?
We all wanted what we wanted, so we just got it done.
What did you tell Lorelei?
I told her...
I told her all kinds of stuff.
I... (sniffles)
And she never forgave me.
(Sniffles)
I didn't realize it at the time, but... that day...
I lost two daughters.
Not one.
Want me to get you a tissue?
(Children shouting playfully)
(Child laughs)
Hey there.
Looking for a room.
Place to rest my weary bones.
Been on the road since New Mexico.
It's $48 cash, $52 credit.
Oop.
I'll be paying cash.
Okay.
You don't happen to have one without a television?
Uh, TV's busted in 13.
No discount.
Okay.
(Children continue shouting, ball bouncing)
(Bell dings)
Have a nice day.
Mm-hmm.
We tried to have our own children.
I could not.
Why didn't you just adopt legally?
Well, I was on work visa from Romania.
And we could not adopt until we were citizens, and that takes years.
Mr. Kirkland, this is Marta and Virgil Roman.
They're just telling me how they came to buy Miranda Martins.
You had to see her.
She was in a bad situation.
Virgil and I knew we could give her a life full of love and opportunity.
But she turned out to be a very troubled girl.
Very unhappy.
So when she was in high school, we sent her to a therapist, and she remembered a lot of things we thought she had forgotten.
Her mother?
No.
She remembered only one name--
Lorelei.
Of course, we found her sister Lorelei and reunited them.
The sisters were so happy, and they were so close.
You've never seen two sisters who were closer.
Where is Miranda now?
We need to talk to her.
She... she was murdered.
She's dead.
Thanks for the dress.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
So, listen, uh... (Clears throat)
You gonna tell me where we're going?
To a cabin my sister and I used to go to.
You have a sister?
I did.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
Her death was a gift, sort of.
You want to explain that?
You wouldn't understand.
Well, you could try me.
I mean, I-I'd like to understand.
In case you haven't noticed, healing is not my strong suit.
Losing my sister brought me into my full reality.
I faced my deepest fear.
I have complete awareness.
Nothing can hurt me.
That's nonsense.
Believe me.
Things can hurt you.
Try me.
(Bottle cap fizzes)
(Cap clatters)
Mm.
This beer is warm.
(Bottle clatters)
I'll get some ice.
Miranda was beautiful, like her sister.
What does the coroner's report say about the cause of death?
Heatstroke.
After she was raped, she was left chained inside of an empty warehouse.
Daytime temperatures reached 120 degrees inside.
Coroner figures she lasted about two days.
And they never found the killer?
The case is still open.
There's no trace evidence, no witnesses.
Just this.
(Cell phone chimes)
(Beep)
Hello?
(Jane) Hey, Lisbon.
I need your help.
(Lowered voice) I need to take this.
Could you...
I'll be right back.

Jane, what's going on?
Have you been kidnapped?
Yes.
I'm in fear of my life.
I can't talk long.
Did you know Lorelei had a sister?
Yes.
Miranda.
Her mother gave her up.
Where are you?
If she catches me on the phone, she'll kill me.
What happened to Miranda?
She was murdered.
Abducted, raped, and left for dead five years ago.
- Who did it?
- They don't know.
They don't even have a suspect.
But listen to this-- the police kept back a key detail from the public.
Before Miranda died, she carved a message into the warehouse floor.
What'd it say?
I'm looking at the crime scene photo now.
It says "Roy."
I need a copy of that photo.
Uh, Lisbon, yeah.
Fax it to me at this number... (Female announcer on radio) I'm Katie Riley, and I'll be back with more of your favorite mellow blends right after the news.
(Male announcer) State and federal authorities have intensified the search for a Sacramento woman, Lorelei Martins.
Jane, just tell me where you are.
We can help you.
Just fax it to me.
I gotta go.
Gotta go.
(Receiver clatters)
(Fax machine whirring)
According to police, Martins is holding a hostage,
Patrick Jane.
Yesterday, CBI consultant Jane's car was found abandoned by the side of the road.
(Fax machine whirring)
(Whirring)
Everything okay?
Jane just called me.
(Door squeaks)
You lie!
Aah!
(Grunts)
Liar!
Filthy liar!
Kidnapped you?
!
Please...
How dare you?
!
You lied!
(Panting)
I didn't lie.
I just didn't tell you everything.
Why didn't you tell me?
I had to protect myself.
(Grunts)
Aah!
Oh!
Please.
Just stop.
(Panting)
You had me going, Patrick.
(Panting)
For a second there, I almost trusted you.
You should.
You should trust me.
Oh, stop!
Just stop playing the role.
Yes, I play a role, but not with you.
I'm being honest with you.
Lies on lies!
Lorelei, listen to me.
You have to listen to me.
Your buddy Red John-- he killed your sister.
What are you talking about?
Your sister Miranda.
She wrote a name on the floor of the warehouse where she died.
The name of the man who raped and killed her.
It was never released to the public.
You're making that up.
No.
This is a crime scene photo of your sister's murder.
"Roy."
Yes, Roy.
We both know who uses that alias.
I don't understand.
- Where did you get this?
- It doesn't matter.
Red John raped and killed your sister.
No.
He made you a victim so that he could rescue you.
No.
He preyed on your pain.
- No, it's not true.
- Yes.
You don't want it to be true, but it's true, and you can feel that it's true.
Just stop!
God, you're just like him, you know that?
- Relentless manipulation.
- I am nothing like him.
How would you know?
I know.
I only wonder why the two of you didn't become lifelong friends the moment you shook hands.
(Ice clatters)
(Door slams) Wait!
Where are we going?
We still going to the cabin?
That's where I'm going.
You can go where you like.
We traced Jane's call to a truck stop motel on Route 99 just north of Chico.
Right here.
The fugitive and her hostage were gone by the time deputies got to the motel.

(Kirkland) They were moving north.
Let's assume they still are.
Where are they going?
Well, if they take the 97 North, they'll hit the Butter Valley Airport.
One runway.
Public use.
Five takeoffs a day.
They might go for a plane.
Okay, lock it down.
What else?
I've been going through financial records for Lorelei's sister.
She owned a cabin in the Sierras about 200 miles north of that motel.
From what I can see, the cabin was never sold after her death.
An anonymous third party has been paying the taxes on it.
Red John?
(Kirkland) Call tactical.
I want a chopper here in ten.
It's just up ahead, at the end of the road.
(Shifts gears)
You go ahead.
I'll get the stuff.
Okay.
The key is under the flower pot.
Welcome.
(Gasps)
Well, it's a nice place.
Yeah.
Belonged to my sister.
We used to come here to forget about the world.
(Sighs)
It's safe.
Red John didn't kill her, Patrick.
You'll never convince me that he did.
I'd kill for a cup of tea right now.
I can make you one.
I'd like that.
But we can't stay here.
Why not?
If Miranda bought this place, the police'll find it.
They're probably on their way here right now.
- Then we have to go.
- No, you have to go.
- I'll stay.
I'll try and delay them.
- What?
Well, like you said, I'm never gonna convince you that Red John killed your sister.
You need to go and find out the truth for yourself.
But, Patrick-- and when you do, when you know the truth...
You know where to find me.
Just call me.
Where are the car keys?
In the car.
Is there a back way out of here?
Um, there's--no.
There's just fire trails.
Okay.
What about this thing?
Does this run?
It's been on a trickle charge.
Yeah, it should.
Okay, you take the 4x4 on the fire road.
They won't be looking for that.
I'm gonna cover for you.
You can't stay here, Patrick.
There's no way they'll believe you were my hostage.
I will make them believe.
You want me to beat you up or something?
- Knock you out?
- Uh, no, thanks.
You gotta go.

Did you get her?
Not yet.
She's, uh, she's on foot.
Agent Kirkland, Homeland Security.
I need rescue hot south of Orr Lake, forest Route 42 North 12.
(Static crackles)
- Who's that guy?
- Don't talk.
Help's on the way.
(Exhales) Hurts.
(Groans) Shh.
It's okay.
You'll never know.
I'll never know what?
Whether I engineered the escape and abduction.
Trust me.
I know.
You don't know.
You just guess.
And you didn't tell your new best friend, Kirkland, either.
I don't have any evidence.
If I did, I'd put you in cuffs myself.
No, you wouldn't.
Try me.
(Chuckles)
What's so funny?
Nothing.
Sorry.
All of it's worth it.
She told me Red John and I are very much alike.
That it's a wonder we weren't best friends from the moment we shook hands.
You've met Red John?
Yes.
He's someone I know.

Hello, Patrick.
How are you?
Good.
So, what do you think?
Oh, it's a classic.
You know, it just gets better and better every time.
Yes.
What do you think of my request?
I don't think much of it, really, Patrick.
Really, I don't.
Meaning you can't accomplish it?
Any task can be accomplished as long as it's broken down into manageable pieces.
So you'll do it?
STILES:
Look, I know that I'm in your debt.
Okay, so we both agree that you owe me a favor.
Yes, I do.
So let this be my favor to you.
Let it go, the whole idea.
It's just not worth it.
JANE:
Well, I find this very interesting.
I'm presenting you with a challenge yet you're backing away.
- That's very unlike you, Mr. Stiles.
- Look, if you must know I've grown mildly accustomed to you, Patrick.
You make me sit up and pay attention.
I'm very glad you're amused by me.
But what you're planning now, it's...
- Well, it's certainly different.
- Yes, it is.
If I do what you're asking of me and you get caught you're going to spend the rest of your life in a federal prison.
I'm well aware of that.
I just have to make sure I don't get caught.
[STILES SIGHS]
Heh, all right.
Well, it's been a great pleasure knowing you, Mr. Jane.
Good luck.
Well I...
I used some pretty harsh words.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

You?
Hey, come on, please, just get in the car.
This is ridiculous.
Why are you mad at me?
I didn't force you to escape from prison.
No, you just tricked me into it.
JANE:
Oh, come on.
Wait.
You thought it was Red John that got you out?
LORELEl:
Yeah.
- Well, it wasn't.
I did.
I got you out.
He would've left you in there to rot.
And I took a lot of risks in doing it.
LORELEl:
Nobody ever accused you of good judgment.
JANE:
What about you?
You're walking into the desert 10 miles from a prison you just broke out of.
I'm offering you a ride.
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.
You can dump me at any time.
Fine.
Jane, how many messages do I have to leave you?
Call me back.
Hold on, Tom, she just walked in.
No.
No, don't inform the marshals yet.
I wanna bring CBI up to speed first.
I'll call you back.
What's going on?
- Have you heard about Lorelei Martins yet?
- No.
She escaped from federal prison this morning.
Your Mr. Jane was questioning prison transport drivers.
Yes.
But, no, he wouldn't.
- He wouldn't.
- He wouldn't?
Okay, where is he now?
I don't know.
I haven't heard from him since yesterday.
He hasn't answered his phone.
But that doesn't mean he did this.
It would make it much more likely, wouldn't it?
- Why is this a Homeland Security issue?
- It's complicated.
But if he is with her, he's in a lot of danger.
You know him better than anybody.
If he did do this, where would he go?
Anyplace I could possibly think of is where he wouldn't go.
Uh, would you excuse me for a minute?
I'll be right back.
Has anyone seen Jane?
- No.
LISBON:
We need to find him right now.
Put a BOLO on his car, Grace.
Cho, I want you to go to his motel room.
Rigs, call his cell company, get GPS tracking on his phone.
What's going on?
Lorelei Martins escaped from prison this morning.
- Was Jane involved?
- We don't know yet.
RIGSBY:
Who's that?
Bob Kirkland, Homeland Security.
He's leading the search.
Boss, Sac P.D. Got a report of an abandoned blue Citroen this morning.
- Parking lot at 16th and K Street.
- Text it to me.
This isn't gonna work.
Well, that's optimistic.
I won't tell you who he is or where he is.
- Give it time.
- Not now.
Not ever.
- Doesn't work.
- Really?
I figured that when no sound came out of it.
Yes.
Heh.
Can we go?
Tell me where.
The ocean.
I wanna see the ocean.
He was leaving a text message.
It's for you.
"Someone after me." He was being followed.
Looks like he's been abducted.
Jane doesn't have Lorelei.
Lorelei has Jane.
Our fugitive is a known associate of the serial killer Red John.
She's wanted for murder, conspiracy, kidnapping and weapons violations.
We believe that Martins and unknown accomplices abducted CBI consultant Patrick Jane.
Jane led a six-month undercover operation that resulted in Lorelei's arrest.
Martins may have kidnapped him for payback or to take him to Red John.
We need to find them.
Martins is a Sacramento girl.
I want systematic searches of old residences, old friends, old coworkers.
You all have information packets.
Study them, and when you're done contact myself or Agent Kirkland for your assignments.
Thank you.
- We'll start with Lorelei's mother.
- Okay.
LORELEl:
I wonder where they're going.
I'm gonna make a fire.
So, what's this about?
Ahem.
Your daughter broke out of prison this morning.
DANA:
Oh, great.
Of course.
Have you had any contact with Lorelei recently?
Heh.
Lorelei hasn't contacted me in years.
Thankfully.
When she does it's always trouble.
Always.
We have reason to believe that Lorelei has taken a hostage.
His life could be in danger.
Do you have any information you could give us about where we could find her?
Any, uh, old friends favorite places?
No.
I don't have anything to do with her.
She doesn't have anything to do with me.
Do you have any insight as to how she became this way?
Lorelei only ever cared about Lorelei.
What are you gonna do with a kid like that?
You don't feel at all responsible for her?
Heh.
Now, there's a question from a woman without children.
I've satisfied all my duties and responsibilities of motherhood.
Look around.
Lorelei grew up in a beautiful home.
She could be anything.
Is this your father?
That's my husband.
He's away, in Munich.
- He's away a lot?
- Yes.
Oh, figures.
I don't like your tone.
Dana, your daughter is the mistress of a psychopathic killer yet you have no information to give us about how or why she got that way.
- Frankly, I don't care if you like my tone.
- To hell with you, lady.
- What happened to her?
- Get out of my house!
Thank you.
You should try it.
Water is lovely.
Uh, quickly, go and hide yourself behind those rocks.
- Hello, young man.
JANE:
How you doing?
[RANGER SNIFFING]
Was that your campfire?
No, officer.
I'm not an officer, I'm a park ranger.
JANE:
So no gun, huh?
Right.
Campfires are illegal on this beach without a permit.
It's not mine.
RANGER:
Are you okay, sir?
You seem a little nervous.
Never better.
Are you alone?
Uh, no, she's, uh...
Hi, officer, I'm over here.
I'm sorry, I can't come out.
I don't have any clothes on.
Public nudity is prohibited on state beaches.
Yes, uh, I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
Promise, it won't happen again.
Sorry, sir.
Okay.
- You folks have a nice day.
JANE:
Yeah.
No campfires.
JANE:
So where to now?
North to Canada?
South to Mexico?
I'm flexible.
I know a place where no one will find us.
Take the l-60 east, but I gotta change my look first.
Find a convenience store.
- I like the take-charge attitude.
- Heh, no, you don't.
I do.
Clearly, you've taken care of someone in your life.
Made all the decisions, acted the adult.
I'm guessing you had a vain, selfish and controlling mother.
But you found the strength to pull away.
Did she resent you for that?
Patrick, do you really want to get to know me?
Of course.
Give the act a rest.
- What?
I wasn't...
- Yes, you were.
Okay.
I knew it.
Soon as I heard that kidnapping report on my radio.
I called it in.
This is the young man I talked to.
- Was there a woman with him?
- Yes, sir.
Most certainly was.
Only, I didn't see her on account of she was naked.
At least that's what she said.
She was behind that rock, where she was changing.
- Young man got kind ofjumpy.
LISBON:
Uh-huh.
He asked me if I had a gun.
- Probably had a gun on you the whole time.
RANGER:
That's what I figured.
And if he said one wrong word or tried to run, bam.
She would've shot us both dead.
I'm just thankful he kept his head.
You happen to see the car they were driving?
Yes, sir.
There was only one car on the bluff.
A dark blue 1990s Dynasty sedan.

What's going on?
Heh.
I couldn't sleep last night, heh.
Hmm...
My husband mustn't know.
Mustn't know what?
[CLEARS THROAT]
I sold Lorelei's sister.
A sister?
I don't remember reading anything about a sister in Lorelei's file.
Because I sold her.
All right, you're gonna have to help me out here, Dana.
Thirty years ago, I didn't have the money to raise two girls.
I had substance issues.
Go on.
So after, ahem their dad left I stopped functioning, you know?
And, um Lorelei she was 5 and she held me up, you know?
But Miran...
Miranda.
That was her name.
She was 2.
I mean, what was I gonna do with a 2-year-old?
- What did you do?
- Well, I knew...
I knew this rich, ahem, foreign couple, who...
Childless.
- So we made a deal under the table.
Ahem.
- Why didn't they just adopt her?
We all wanted what we wanted, so we just got it done.
What did you tell Lorelei?
I told her...
I told her all kinds of stuff.
And she never forgave me.
I didn't realize it at the time but that day I lost two daughters not one.
Want me to get you a tissue?
Hey there.
Looking for a room.
A place to rest my weary bones.
Been on the road since New Mexico.
It's $48 cash, 52 credit.
- Oh, well, I will be paying cash.
- Okay.
You don't happen to have one without a television.

Okay.

- Have a nice day.

VIRGIL:
We tried to have our own children.
I could not.

Why didn't you just adopt legally?
I was on a work visa from Romania.
And we could not adopt until we were citizens, and that takes years.
Mr. Kirkland, this is Marta and Virgil Roman.
They're just telling me how they came to buy Miranda Martins.
MARTA:
You had to see her.
She was in a bad situation.
Virgil and I knew we could give her a life full of love and opportunity.
But she turned out to be a very troubled girl.
Very unhappy.
So when she was in high school, we sent her to a therapist and she remembered a lot of things we thought she had forgotten.
- Her mother?
- No.
She remembered only one name.
Lorelei.
Of course, we found her sister, Lorelei, and reunited them.
The sisters were so happy, and they were so close.
You've never seen two sisters who were closer.
Where's Miranda now?
We need to talk to her.
She's...
She was murdered.
She's dead.
JANE:
Well, it's a shame the TV doesn't work.
Thanks for the dress.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
So listen, uh you gonna tell me where we're going?
To a cabin my sister and I used to go to.
- You have a sister?
- I did.

Your buddy Red John, he killed your sister.
What are you talking about?
Your sister wrote a name on the floor of the warehouse where she died.
The name of the man who raped and killed her.
It was never made public.
- You're making that up.
- No.
This is a crime-scene photo of your sister's murder.
- "Roy."
- Yes, Roy.
We both know who uses that alias.
- I don't understand.
Where did you get this?
- It doesn't matter.
Red John raped and killed your sister.
- No.
No.
- Made you a victim so he could rescue you.
- He preyed on your pain.
- No.
- It's not true.
- You don't want it to be, but it's true.
- You can feel it's true.
- Just stop!
God, you're just like him, you know that?
- Relentless manipulation.
- I am nothing like him.
How would you know?
I know.
I wonder why you didn't become lifelong friends the moment you shook hands.
Wait.
Where are we going?
We still going to the cabin?
That's where I'm going.
You go where you like.
[ENGINE STARTS]
We traced Jane's call to a truck-stop motel on Route 99 north of Chico.
Right here.
The fugitive and her hostage were gone by the time deputies got to the motel.
[STATIC CRACKLES ON RADIO]
Heartbroke and busted
That's how you left me, dear
You took my time And without a dime
You left me standing here
They were moving north.
Let's assume they still are.
- Where are they going?
- Lf they take the 97 north they'll hit Butter Valley Airport.
One runway, public use, five takeoffs a day.
They might go for a plane.
Lock it down.
I went through the sister's financial records.
She owned a cabin in the Sierras 200 miles north of that motel.
The cabin was never sold after her death.
An anonymous third party has been paying the taxes.
- Red John?
KIRKLAND:
Call Tactical.
I want a chopper.
It's just up ahead at the end of the road.
[ENGINE STOPS]
You go ahead.
I'll get the stuff.
Okay.
The key is under the flower pot.
Welcome.
- It's a nice place.
- Yeah.
Belonged to my sister.
We used to come here to forget about the world.
It's safe.
Red John didn't kill her, Patrick.
You'll never convince me that he did.
I'd kill for a cup of tea right now.
I can make you one.
I'd like that.
- But we can't stay here.
- Why not?
If Miranda bought this place, the police will find it.
They're probably on their way here right now.
- Then we have to go.
- You have to go.
- I'll stay.
I'll try to delay them.
- What?
Like you said, I'll never convince you Red John killed your sister.
You need to go find out the truth for yourself.
- But, Patrick...
- When you do, when you know the truth you know where to find me.
Just call me.
- Where are the car keys?
- In the car.
Is there a back way out of here?
- Um, there's...
No, there's just fire trails.
- Okay.
What about this thing?
Does this run?
- It's been on a trickle charge.
- Yeah, it should.
You take the four-by-four on the fire road.
They won't look for that.
- I'm gonna cover for you.
- You can't stay here, Patrick.
- They won't believe you were my hostage.
- I will make them believe.
Want me to beat you up?
Knock you out?
Ah, no, thanks.
You gotta go.

[JANE GROANS]
- Did you get her?
- Not yet.
She's, uh...
She's on foot.
Agent Kirkland, Homeland Security.
I need rescue hot south of Orr Lake.
Forest Route 42, north 12.
- Who is that guy?
- Don't talk.
Help is on the way.
Hurts.
[JANE GROANS]
Shh.
It's okay.
You'll never know.
I'll never know what?
Whether I engineered the escape and abduction.
- Trust me, I know.
- You don't know.
You just guess.
And you didn't tell your new best friend, Kirkland, either.
I don't have any evidence.
If I did, I'd put you in cuffs myself.
- No you wouldn't.
- Try me.
[JANE CHUCKLES]
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.
Sorry.
All of it's worth it.
She told me Red John and I are very much alike.
That it's a wonder we weren't best friends from the moment we shook hands.
You've met Red John?
Yes.
He's someone I know.

Just get back.
Oh, you little fool.
You just stay away from me.
(Gun fires, people screaming)
(Man) We can't get involved in this.
(Lowered voice) Hello, Patrick.
How are you?
(Lowered voice) Good.
So what do you think?
Oh, it's a classic.
You know, it just gets better and better every time.
Yes.
What do you think of my request?
I don't think much of it, really, Patrick.
Really, I don't.
Meaning you can't accomplish it?
Any task can be accomplished, as long as it's broken down into manageable pieces.
So you'll do it?
Look, I know that I'm in your debt.
Okay, so we both agree that you owe me a favor.
Yes, I do.
So let this be my favor to you-- let it go-- the whole idea.
It's just not worth it.
Well, I find this very interesting.
I'm presenting you with a challenge, and yet you're backing away.
It's very unlike you, Mr. Stiles.
Look, if you must know,
I've grown mildly accustomed to you, Patrick.
You make me sit up and pay attention.
I'm very glad you're amused by me.
But what you're planning now, it's...
Well, it's certainly different.
Yes, it is.
If I do what you're asking of me and you get caught, you're gonna spend the rest of your life in a federal prison.
I'm well aware of that.
I just have to make sure I don't get caught.
(Sighs and chuckles)
All right.
Well, it's been a great pleasure knowing you, Mr. Jane.
Good luck.
Well, I-I used some pretty harsh words.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
But naturally, if I'd known...

Hey, come on.
Please.
Just--just get in the car.
This is ridiculous.
Why are you mad at me?
I-I didn't force you to escape from prison.
No, you just tricked me into it.
Oh, come on.
Wait.
You thought it was Red John that got you out, didn't you?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, it wasn't.
I did.
I got you out.
He would have left you in there to rot.
And I took a lot of risks in doing it.
Nobody ever accused you of good judgment.
Well, what about you?
You're the one walking off into the desert 10 miles from a prison you just broke out of.
I'm offering you a ride.
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.
You can dump me at any time.
Fine.
Jane, how many messages do I have to leave you?
Call me back.
(Speaking inaudibly)
Hold on, Tom.
She just walked in.
No.
No, don't inform the Marshals yet.
I want to bring CBI up to speed first.
I'll call you back.
What's going on?
Have you heard about Lorelei Martins yet?
No.
She escaped from federal prison this morning.
Your Mr. Jane was questioning prison transport drivers.
Yes, but no.
He wouldn't.
He wouldn't.
He wouldn't?
Where is he now?
I don't know.
I haven't heard from him since yesterday.
He hasn't answered his phone.
But that doesn't mean he did this.
It would make it much more likely, wouldn't it?
Why is this a Homeland Security issue?
It's complicated.
I mean, if he is with her, he's in a lot of danger.
You know him better than anybody.
Now if he did do this, where would he go?
Any place I could possibly think of is where he wouldn't go.
Uh, would you excuse me for a minute?
I'll be right back.
Has anyone seen Jane?
No.
We need to find him right now.
Put a B.O.L.O. out on his car.
Grace, Cho, I want you to go to his motel room.
Rigs, call his cell phone company.
Get GPS tracking on his phone.
What's going on?
Lorelei Martins escaped from prison this morning.
Was Jane involved?
We don't know yet.
Bob Kirkland, Homeland Security.
He's leading the search to find Martins.
Boss.
Sac P.D. got a report of an abandoned blue Citroen this morning.
Uh, parking lot at 16th and K Street.
Text it to me.
This isn't gonna work.
Well, that's optimistic.
I won't tell you who he is or where he is.
Give it time.
Not now.
Not ever.
(Clicks)
Doesn't work.
Really?
I figured that when no sound came out of it.
Yes.
(Chuckles)
Can we go?
Tell me where.
The ocean.
I wanna see the ocean.
(Police radio chatter)
(Car door closes)
(Horn honks)
(Cell phone beeps)
He was leaving a text message.
It's for you.
"Someone after me."
He was being followed.
Looks like he's been abducted.
Jane doesn't have Lorelei.
Lorelei has Jane.
Our fugitive is a known associate of the serial killer Red John.
She's wanted for murder conspiracy, kidnapping, and weapons violations.
We believe that Martins and unknown accomplices abducted CBI consultant Patrick Jane.
Jane led a 6-month undercover operation that resulted in Lorelei's arrest.
Martins may have kidnapped him for payback or to take him to Red John.
Either way, we need to find them.
Martins is a Sacramento girl.
I want systematic searches of old residences, old friends, old coworkers.
You all have information packets.
Study them, and when you're done, contact myself or Agent Kirkland for your assignments.
Thank you.
- Let's start with Lorelei's mother.
- Okay.
(Waves rolling)
(Lorelei) I wonder where they're going.
I'm gonna make a fire.
So, what's this about?
(Clears throat) Your daughter broke out of prison this morning.
Oh.
Of course.
Have you had any contact with-- with Lorelei recently?
(Chuckles) Lorelei hasn't contacted me in years.
Thankfully.
When she does, it's always trouble.
Always.
We have reason to believe that Lorelei has taken a hostage.
His life could be in danger.
Do you have any information that you could give us about where we could find her?
Any, uh, old friends?
Favorite places?
Nope.
I don't have anything to do with her, and she doesn't have anything to do with me.
Do you have any insight as to how she became this way?
(Chuckles)
Lorelei only ever cared about Lorelei.
What are you gonna do with a kid like that?
Well, you don't feel at all responsible for her?
(Chuckles) Now there's a question from a woman without children.
I've satisfied all my duties and responsibilities of motherhood.
I mean, look around.
Lorelei grew up in a beautiful home.
She could be anything.
Is this your father?
(Inhales deeply)
That's my husband.
He's away in Munich.
He's away a lot?
Yes.
Oh.
Figures.
I don't like your tone.
Dana, your daughter is the mistress of a psychopathic killer, yet you have no information to give us about how or why she got that way.
Frankly, I don't care if you like my tone.
To hell with you, lady.
What happened to her?
Get out of my house.
Thank you.
(Waves rolling)
(Crackling)
(Waves crashing)
You should try it.
Water's lovely.
Eh.
Uh, quickly--go and hide yourself behind those rocks.
(Sighs)
Hello, young man.
How you doing?
(Sniffs)
(Sniffs)
Was that your campfire?
No, Officer.
I'm not an officer.
I'm a Park Ranger.
So no gun, huh?
Right.
Campfires are illegal on this beach without a permit.
Well, it... it's not mine.
Are you okay, sir?
You seem a little nervous.
Never better.
Are you alone?
Hi, Officer!
I'm over here!
I'm sorry.
I can't come out!
I don't have any clothes on.
Yeah, well, public nudity's prohibited on state beaches.
Yes, uh, I'm sorry!
It won't happen again!
Promise, it-- it won't happen again.
Sorry, sir.
Okay.
You folks have a nice day.
Yeah.
No campfires.
So where to now?
North to Canada?
South to Mexico?
I'm flexible.
I know a place where no one will find us.
Take the I-60 East, but I gotta change my look first.
Find a convenience store.
I like the take-charge attitude.
No, you don't.
I do.
Clearly, you've taken care of someone in your life.
Made all the decisions.
Acted the adult.
I'm guessing you had a vain, selfish, and controlling mother.
But you found the strength to pull away.
Does she resent you for that?
Patrick, do you really want to get to know me?
Of course.
Give the act a rest.
What?
I-I wasn't...
Yes, you were.
Okay.
I knew it.
Soon as I heard that kidnapping report on my radio.
I called it in.
This is the young man I talked to.
Was there a woman with him?
Yes, there most certainly was.
Only I didn't see her on account of she was naked.
At least that what she said.
She was behind that rock there where she was changing.
The young man got kind of jumpy.
Uh-huh.
Asked me if I had a gun.
She probably had a gun on you the whole time.
That's what I figured.
And if he said one wrong word or tried to run--bam.
I mean, she would have shot us both dead.
I'm just thankful he kept his head.
Happen to see what kind of car they were driving?
Yes, sir.
There was only one car on the bluff.
A dark blue 1990s Dynasty Sedan.

So after... (Clears throat) their dad left... (Inhales deeply)
I just stopped functioning, you know?
And, um, Lorelei-- she was 5.
And she held me up, you know?
But... (Cries)
Miranda-- that was her name...
She was 2.
I mean, what was I gonna do with a 2-year-old?
What did you do?
Well, I knew...
I knew this rich...
(Clears throat) foreign couple, who... (sniffles) childless.
So we made a deal under the table. (Clears throat)
Why didn't they just adopt her?
We all wanted what we wanted, so we just got it done.
What did you tell Lorelei?
I told her...
I told her all kinds of stuff.
I... (sniffles)
And she never forgave me.
(Sniffles)
I didn't realize it at the time, but... that day...
I lost two daughters.
Not one.
Want me to get you a tissue?
(Children shouting playfully)
(Child laughs)
Hey there.
Looking for a room.
Place to rest my weary bones.
Been on the road since New Mexico.
It's $48 cash, $52 credit.
Oop.
I'll be paying cash.
Okay.
You don't happen to have one without a television?
Uh, TV's busted in 13.
No discount.
Okay.
(Children continue shouting, ball bouncing)
(Bell dings)
Have a nice day.
Mm-hmm.
We tried to have our own children.
I could not.
Why didn't you just adopt legally?
Well, I was on work visa from Romania.
And we could not adopt until we were citizens, and that takes years.
Mr. Kirkland, this is Marta and Virgil Roman.
They're just telling me how they came to buy Miranda Martins.
You had to see her.
She was in a bad situation.
Virgil and I knew we could give her a life full of love and opportunity.
But she turned out to be a very troubled girl.
Very unhappy.
So when she was in high school, we sent her to a therapist, and she remembered a lot of things we thought she had forgotten.
Her mother?
No.
She remembered only one name--
Lorelei.
Of course, we found her sister Lorelei and reunited them.
The sisters were so happy, and they were so close.
You've never seen two sisters who were closer.
Where is Miranda now?
We need to talk to her.
She... she was murdered.
She's dead.
Thanks for the dress.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
So, listen, uh... (Clears throat)
You gonna tell me where we're going?
To a cabin my sister and I used to go to.
You have a sister?
I did.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
Her death was a gift, sort of.
You want to explain that?
You wouldn't understand.
Well, you could try me.
I mean, I-I'd like to understand.
In case you haven't noticed, healing is not my strong suit.
Losing my sister brought me into my full reality.
I faced my deepest fear.
I have complete awareness.
Nothing can hurt me.
That's nonsense.
Believe me.
Things can hurt you.
Try me.
(Bottle cap fizzes)
(Cap clatters)
Mm.
This beer is warm.
(Bottle clatters)
I'll get some ice.
Miranda was beautiful, like her sister.
What does the coroner's report say about the cause of death?
Heatstroke.
After she was raped, she was left chained inside of an empty warehouse.
Daytime temperatures reached 120 degrees inside.
Coroner figures she lasted about two days.
And they never found the killer?
The case is still open.
There's no trace evidence, no witnesses.
Just this.
(Cell phone chimes)

(Jane) Hey, Lisbon.

Jane, what's going on?
Have you been kidnapped?
Yes.
I'm in fear of my life.
I can't talk long.
Did you know Lorelei had a sister?
Yes.
Miranda.
Her mother gave her up.
Where are you?
If she catches me on the phone, she'll kill me.
What happened to Miranda?
She was murdered.
Abducted, raped, and left for dead five years ago.
- Who did it?
- They don't know.
They don't even have a suspect.
But listen to this-- the police kept back a key detail from the public.
Before Miranda died, she carved a message into the warehouse floor.
What'd it say?
I'm looking at the crime scene photo now.
It says "Roy."
I need a copy of that photo.
Uh, Lisbon, yeah.
Fax it to me at this number... (Female announcer on radio) I'm Katie Riley, and I'll be back with more of your favorite mellow blends right after the news.
(Male announcer) State and federal authorities have intensified the search for a Sacramento woman, Lorelei Martins.

We can help you.

You had me going, Patrick.
(Panting)
For a second there, I almost trusted you.
You should.
You should trust me.
Oh, stop!
Just stop playing the role.
Yes, I play a role, but not with you.
I'm being honest with you.
Lies on lies!
Lorelei, listen to me.
You have to listen to me.
Your buddy Red John-- he killed your sister.
What are you talking about?
Your sister Miranda.
She wrote a name on the floor of the warehouse where she died.
The name of the man who raped and killed her.
It was never released to the public.
You're making that up.
No.
This is a crime scene photo of your sister's murder.
"Roy."
Yes, Roy.
We both know who uses that alias.
I don't understand.
- Where did you get this?
- It doesn't matter.
Red John raped and killed your sister.
No.
He made you a victim so that he could rescue you.
No.
He preyed on your pain.
- No, it's not true.
- Yes.
You don't want it to be true, but it's true, and you can feel that it's true.
Just stop!
God, you're just like him, you know that?
- Relentless manipulation.
- I am nothing like him.
How would you know?
I know.
I only wonder why the two of you didn't become lifelong friends the moment you shook hands.
(Ice clatters)

Where are we going?
We still going to the cabin?
That's where I'm going.
You can go where you like.
We traced Jane's call to a truck stop motel on Route 99 just north of Chico.
Right here.

(Kirkland) They were moving north.
Let's assume they still are.
Where are they going?
Well, if they take the 97 North, they'll hit the Butter Valley Airport.
One runway.

They might go for a plane.
Okay, lock it down.
What else?
I've been going through financial records for Lorelei's sister.
She owned a cabin in the Sierras about 200 miles north of that motel.
From what I can see, the cabin was never sold after her death.
An anonymous third party has been paying the taxes on it.
Red John?

You need to go and find out the truth for yourself.
But, Patrick-- and when you do, when you know the truth...
You know where to find me.
Just call me.
Where are the car keys?
In the car.
Is there a back way out of here?
Um, there's--no.
There's just fire trails.
Okay.

Does this run?
It's been on a trickle charge.
Yeah, it should.
Okay, you take the 4x4 on the fire road.
They won't be looking for that.

You've met Red John?
Yes.
He's someone I know.
(Chuckles)

Stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
What if I really am seeing people who've died?
You were experimenting.
You made them disappear.
Bedlam Heights failed because you freaked out the customers!
They look confused and lost out there, but in here it's different.
Hate and anger ...
I've never seen that before!
It's ghosts.
You see ghosts, don't you?
We could stop, but would you really feel good about yourself?
All right.
See you later, then.
Good girl.
Wait!
Who are you?
Call Your Girlfriend
Thank you.
Ok.
This is gonna sound really strange, but I think you once came to my school.
It's not strange!
I went to lots of schools.
I was in the Commonwealth Games.
Dominic McConnell.
I was a swimmer.
I did talks for kids.
Right!
I'm Kiera.
Two girls in my class developed an unseemly thing for you.
Sim?
Who was the other one?
Wow.
You're a comedy swimmer.
Retired.
Cass here, she's the real star.
I did this sports psychology module and I wrote an essay on women and exercise addiction.
Is it a real syndrome or...?
I just like winning.
That's definitely a real syndrome.
Why don't I get you both a drinque?
Not for me, thanks.
Cass?
Erm, just orange juice for me, please.
I'll carry on with the unpacking.
See you soon.
Ok.
Nice to meet you!
Right!
Vodca in it, then?
Single or double?
I better not.
Relax!
Vodca never showed up in a drugs test.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, sim, please.
Are you Ok?
Fine.
Because the impact of what happened sometimes doesn't hit till days later.
All I'm saying is, talk about this stuff all you want to or don't talk about it.
Sounds good.
Now hurry up and make my drinque and let's pretend I'm normal.
Come on, let's get another drinque.
No, no, no!
You can't stop serving!
We're on a roll here.
Gosh.
Sorry!
What was I thinking?
Guys, this is Cass, future Olympic champion of the world!
Wow, quite an introduction!
I'm not embarrassed at all!
She gets up at 5ªm to train!
Sim?
I think tomorrow, maybe not.
I've got a brilliant way to clear your head!
Kiera, you're mad!
Dive-bomb!
Come on, Max, don't be a wuss.
It's freezing!
What are you doing?
In you come!
Did you see his face?
Oh, my God.
Where did he go?
It's called karma!
We need to get out of the pool!
Ellie?
Get out of the pool!
What's the problem here?
We've been drinking.
It's not safe to be in the pool.
Paramedics and fun really don't mix!
Ei, Cass, we'll walk you back!
Sorry, er, she lost her key.
It's here somewhere.
This'll set you up for tomorrow.
Mm!
What have we here, Dominic?
Have you been reliving your glory days?
(GIGGLES)
Look, I better be getting to bed.
Really?
So soon?
Wow.
Sarcasm!
Guys, I think it's really sweet that you two found each other.
You're like those couples that dress alike, like it's the '50s!
It was nice to meet you, Cass.
Kiera...
Glad I took the time to do your diet sheets.
It was one night!
And you had to do it four days before a competition.
Well played.
God, he's fit, but talk about control freak!
Sim, he didn't exactly make us feel welcome.
Sim.
Can't really blame her for trying to top herself.
You saw her arms, right?
The scars?
You shouldn't really make assumptions like that.
People should sort out their own problems.

Morning!
Oh!
Sorry!
Can I help you?
Sorry, am I dripping on your carpet?
I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I like what you've done with your room.
It looks like someone actually lives here.
Mine looks a place someone died.
How do you do it?
Try growing up in care.
You learn to make a home wherever you are.
I'd have been better off there.
You don't mean that.
You've never met my family.
It'd be nice to have a family.
Ei!
By the way, skinny-dipping should involve clothes coming off.
Were we shy?
CCTV, mate.
Busted!
Last night, hein?
Sim, crazy!
You saw something, didn't you?
Possibly.
That why you freaked out?
I did not freak out!
You practically dragged us out of the water.
Ei, it's ok.
I think there's something in the pool.
As in revenant?
Maybe.
Do you think we disturbed something?
I don't know, but I don't like it!
Do you want me to go down there with you?
What was it?
Tell me what you saw.
I don't wanna talk about it.
You really didn't have to come.
I know.
I can't resist a nose through other people's things.
Is that awful?
You know, she could come back.
I don't think there's any chance of that.
But she's your daughter.
She's been angry with me since Jed died.
In some ways, it's a relief to get it out in the open.
Well, I guess you won't mind me having this, then?
It's nice, actually!
Have it.
Sim, but, me, in your daughter's clothes...
How is that for you?
Hm?
Stop it.
I'm sorry.
Come here.
There's something you need to see.
I'll take care of this lot.
I got a call.
Stephen Thirsk.
Got his contracts ready, sim?
He pulled out.
Decided it wasn't his sort of place after all.
What?
Why?
Someone's been having fun.
One click and you're through to the ghost-hunting blog.
Oh, for...!
I told you to deal with that!
I am!
It's as good as sorted.
Look at these pictures.
Posted 1.33 this morning.
So, where's he getting them from?
Well, it's obvious.
He must live in the building.
So, what's your plan?
Sit and wait for him to slip up and reveal his identity?
He's slipped up already.
He thinks he's cleverer than I am.
Not funny.
They're gonna get themselves sued.
I've reported it.
I'm fine.
You're better off in a full-size pool.
I'll run you in.
No.
I always run into your old teammates there.
(SIGHS) Better to nearly drown.
I'm ok!
I think I just need to ease off a bit.
I feel like I'm over-training.
I make sure you don't.
Then, I need more breaks!
If you ease of now, where's that gonna leave you next week?
You're not missing it!
You might as well rule yourself out the nationals.
Ok.
I wont let you sabotage yourself because you had a weak moment.
Eve?
What?
I don't have to tell you everything that's going on in my life, ok?
Ok.
Ellie?
I-I'm all right.
Try to remember key images and we'll break it down later.
Was it the pool?
The same people?
No.
Different people?
No, no, no, no!
I don't wanna do this!
Ellie, think of the police.
People forget detail.
If only!
This is about what I walked in on.
You don't understand how hard it is.
The only reason I'm here is to find out what's happening to me.
I understand completely.
Max, if you had a tail, it would be wagging like mad.
I'm helping you.
Well, it's too much!
I'm sorry.
I'm fine on my own.
What do you want from me?
Hello?
Are you Ok?
Sim, sim, I'm fine.
Start in the machine room, sim?
Pool's closed.
Someone got their hair caught in the drain.
Who?
A girl called Cass.
Do you know her?
Sim, kind of.
It'll be open again soon.
Maybe you'll bring a towel next time.
Max, Cass got her hair caught in a drain.
A swimmer as strong as her ...
it doesn't make sense!
Max, what do I do?
I don't wanna butt in on anything.
Stop messing around.
She's in danger.
Are you asking for my help?
Yes, Max, I'm asking for your help.
Please.
Ok.
What do we know beyond doubt?
Activity can be stirred up by interfering with remains.
Cass hasn't touched any.
Just by being in a certain place ...
All the visions happened around the pool.
A girl was being torturede.
Well, there you go.
She's connecting to Cass and for some reason, the revenant does not want her there.
So it's protecting its territory or something?
Maybe.
Why, though?
I don't know.
First thing we need to do is warn Cass, make sure she stays away from that pool.
Come on, then.
I don't know if this is a good ideia, both of us going in.
It might seem a bit weird.
And we'd hate for any of this to seem weird!
Oh, Max!
Ok.
Just don't seem so nervous.
I'm about to go and tell a sane, rational girl she's the victim of a haunting.
What's not to be nervous about?
You can do this, all right?
Give me a break!
I'm not talking about the Ellie that has visions.
I'm talking about the Ellie that's just you.
You're good with people.
Ok, enough!
And obviously a good listener.
To summarise, just be yourself.
Which one?
Clear off.
It looked like you had a fit or something.
No, I-I'm fine.
Ok.
So, how can I help?
Well, erm, the thing is, it's, erm, it's a bit awkward, but, erm, well, I'm here cos...
I'm doing this charity thing.
It's a triathlon, but, erm, well, I need some tips on how to train.
Ok.
Fancy bumping into him on a dark night?
Where did you get these?
Top floor.
There's tons of the stuff rotting up there.
Some of the guys who ran the place, sim?
Was that your dad?
Yes.
What was he like?
What are you doing with them?
I'll email the blogger and pretend I'm another ghost freak, only I've got things he hasn't.
This is creepy.
He'll lap it up.
Once he's hooked, I'll reel him in.
Fine.
Whatever it takes.
Look, it's been a long week.
I've got everything covered here.
Why don't you call it a day?
Have some rest.
Sim.
I'll do that.
I can't remember a time when I wasn't training.
My dad kind of bullied me into it.
I moved in with Dominic as soon as I was old enough.
Didn't that put you off?
No, I loved it.
Once I started winning, there was nothing like it.
I didn't care that I had to be in at 9.30 and I had no friends.
I'd have done it ten times over.
Well, it worked.
Sim, for a while.
You won't find many from the last two years up there.
We had a car crash.
Dom had won gold in some gala.
I was driving home on the motorway, driving way too fast.
We spun and hit a tree.
Dom broke his shoulder.
But he's all right now, though?
He never got his edge back.
He had his sights set on the Olympics, and suddenly he couldn't win local competitions.
That must've been tough on both of you.
Sim.
But he never blamed me.
He said I saved him, in a way.
What do you mean?
I became his protege.
Now he puts all his efforts into me.
I've come full circle, really.
First Dad, now Dominic!
Cass, you need to stay away from that pool.
Why?
Because of what happened with the pool drain?
That's all been sorted...
I just have a really strong feeling that it's not a safe place for you.
Why?
I don't know for sure, but... ..I think there's something down there that wants to harm you.
I'm sorry, you've lost me.
A ghost.
You're kidding, right?
Please don't dismiss what I'm saying just cos you think it's weird.
Listen to yourself!
A ghost?
It's not safe!
I had you down as one of the grownups!
I'm only telling you what I know to be true!
You do realise you sound completely insane?
At your boss's desk?
Is Warren about?
Why?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Not massively, no.
You're working late.
You must be very keen to impress.
You're the expert there.
I'd say if you've settled in for the night, your social life has sadly declined!
Thanks for your concern.
If I get desperate, I've got your number.
Sim.
Ok...
Erm, tell your boss I'm looking for him, all right?
So I'm guessing you lost her at the "G" word.
She thinks I'm a complete fruitloop.
You told her everything, the visions?
I couldn't tell her what I'd just seen.
It's ok.
No, it's not!
It was so real!
It was like it was happening in front of me and there was nothing I could do.
Ei...
It was in the pool, like the others, and she was floating there, dead.
And you didn't get a chance to warn Cass?
She wasn't listening.
What was I supposed to do?
Max?
-Is she there?
-Max!
She's not breathing!
It's ok.
You've inhaled some water, but you're gonna be ok.
What?
I think you must've passed out in the pool, but you're fine, ok?
Did you see anything before you passed out?
No.
Anything?
Max!
It's all right.
You're safe now.
Have you got any ideia what happened?
I think it's your fault, freaking me out with all your ghost stories.
How did you even know I was in trouble?
Just a bad feeling.
I think I saw something before I passed out.
Did you?
I must be cracking up!
Maybe you should put the training aside and focus on yourself for a while.
Why do you say that?
The way you were talking earlier, it didn't sound like you had much free time.
Maybe you should talk to Dominic ...
That'll go down well!
If he loves you, he'll understand.
Do you want me to come with you?
I don't want my life to be like this.
I can't do it any more.
Just make sure you stay out of that pool, ok?
Get some rest.
Sim.
Sim, I will.
I should've rung.
No.
No, it's fine.
It's quite obviously not... fine.
If it's what happened this morning, I know I push my luck sometimes.
It's not that.
Honestly.
I'm really glad you're here.
I'll go.
No.
You wouldn't be saying any of this if it wasn't for her.
Well, that's why I'm here.
Two years, for nothing.
But that's exactly how I feel!
I'm really sorry, but I can't pretend any more.
That's it, ok?
I'm done with swimming.
You've got no photos in here.
Nothing that really says anything about you.
Why do I feel like you're trying to analyse me?
Because I am.
I've always quite fancied you.
That's a bit wrong, isn't it?
Do you want me to agree?
You're supposed to be keeping an eye on me for my folks.
This is my way of getting back at them.
Then again, you're not my first authority figure.
Oh?
When I was in sixth form, a teacher at school.
All the kids knew.
I didn't care.
I quite liked it, actually.
Is this just the same, sticking it to your parents?
Honestly?
Mm.
I don't know.
It doesn't feel like it is.
Do you think this could ever go anywhere?
I'm probably not easy to be close to.
Don't say that.
Why?
I like a challenge.
It'll only encourage me.
Well, congratulations!
You did it all by yourself, which is, of course, as you wanted it.
How about you let it go?
Just as well I didn't go.
I would've landed one on that smug, controlling dickhead!
Max, he'd have decked you!
Well, there is that, of course.
Cheers.
Max, I need to show you something.
I need you not to think it's weird and if you do,
I need you not to freak out.
All right.
The not-freaking-out part is really important.
How about you just show me?
I've had it for as long as I can remember.
Ok.
I keep seeing it in the visions.
What does it mean?
Max, will you say something, please?
I've seen this in the building.
It must mean you're connected to it in some way.
How?
Can I, er...?
I'm sorry.
It's ok.
This isn't about you and me, Dom, this is about the training!
Just everything we built our lives on.
It isn't everything!
So what, you love me, do you?
Cos I'm really feeling it.
Of course I love you.
Of course!
You destroyed my life once and now you're doing it again.
You don't mean that.
You're just saying it to hurt me.
Well, you'd know all about that, wouldn't you?
Dom...
What do you want me to say?
It wasn't your fault?
That I don't resent you for it?
Well, it was.
You did this to me.
If you felt like that, you'd have said it at the time.
You never gave me chance.
You beat me to it with your little cry for help!
That's not what it was and you know it!
What was it?
Just another thing you don't have the guts to follow through with.
The story of your life.
How can you say that?
Just get out.
I can't even look at you.
Max, she killed herself!
The ghost cut her wrists and she's gonna do the same to Cass!
What's it gonna do to her?
Cass...
What have we done?
We let that happen.
That was not our fault.
We thought she was safe.
We're learning.
But we could've saved her!
Max, what we're dealing with is dangerous.
Jed died and now Cass.
Who's next?
This is my life that you're putting on the internet for any weirdo to read!
There's something not right in my head.
The ghost thinks she's disrespecting the institution of marriage.
Max, we can't have another Cass.
We have to stop this wedding.
Have you got your eye on someone?
What if she says no?
-I just feel a bit lonely.
-I know that feeling.
Previously on Once Upon A Time...
Daniel's grave.
He died because of you.
I was very young, and your mother...
She ripped his heart out.
Henry, you're gonna go home with David.
I want you to be here because you want to be here, not because of magic.
I want to redeem myself.
Magic can set you free.
Let me guide you.
And I won't become like her?
That, dearie, is entirely up to you.
It's not safe here.
Cora's still out there.
We found a safe haven.
We must go there now.
Hello, Hook.
I don't know if I can do this.
I'm not a very good liar.
Oh, it's not really a lie, Aurora.
Lancelot did die an honorable death and Cora did escape.
All true.
Just leave the particulars to us.
There's no reason to cause unnecessary panic
- amongst your people.
- I'm not so sure it's unnecessary...
Wait.
The tower.
We always have sentries guarding the entrance.
Stay close.
Oh, my God.
This just can't be.
Our land... we were protected here, hidden.
How did the ogres find us?
Ogres didn't do this.
What?
Cora did.
Their hearts... they were ripped out.
This was her magic... twisted and evil.
We have to stop her.
Too late.
She killed them.
She killed them all.
No, we have to stop her before she hurts anyone else.
Hey.
Hey.
Look.
There's someone under there.
- He's alive.
- Please.
It's okay.
Please help me.
It's okay.
You're safe now.
We won't hurt you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Once Upon A Time: "The Doctor" Season 2 Episode 5
Original air date October 28, 2012
Thank you very much for caring.
See you.
You.
We need to talk.
Oh!
What the hell was that for?
Sleeping with my wife.
- Kathryn?
- Snow.
Look, I didn't know.
All right?
I was cursed.
Yeah, I got it.
What do you want?
So... is it true?
People are saying that you're trying to find a way to build a portal back to your land because that's where you think Emma and Mary Margaret are, that they're alive.
Well, the whispers can stop.
I have no secrets from this town.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
But the land... it's... it's gone, destroyed by the curse.
Apparently not.
Well, you're having any luck?
Not yet.
We're working on it.
Does that mean that all the lands still exist?
Possibly.
So the Queen lied to us.
Again.
Are you sure?
Remember who we're talking about.
Regina.
Are you here to see me?
I've been trying to keep my promise to Henry, but it's been difficult.
To not use magic.
It's been two days.
That's an excellent start.
Come on in.
It's just that magic is the way I've always gotten everything.
Sounds like it's also the way you've lost everything.
Regina, this is your chance to start over, to earn Henry.
Dr. Whale, this is highly inappropriate.
Send me back.
Excuse me?
To my land.
Send me back to my brother.
Why don't you check the "Missing" board like everyone else?
Your curse only brought the living.
Well, then I'm sorry for your loss.
But I'm afraid I can't send anyone anywhere.
Can't or won't?
Dr. Whale, I have to insist.
Please.
Go.
Sorry.
What you said isn't entirely true, is it?
I'm sorry?
About the curse only taking the living.
The grave of your father's here, right?
I don't care about Whale or his brother.
I brought who I wanted.
Anyone else?
If you want help, you have to try and trust me.
Stopping magic is a lot harder than starting.
Now show me what you've learned.
Immobilize it.
There.
I did it.
Excellent work, my apprentice.
Now there's just one last, tiny, tiny, teeny, little detail.
Take its heart.
Like what my mother did to...
Oh, to your true love.
Indeed.
Then you already know how it's done.
Gentle.
If you do it right, no harm will befall it, unless of course, you will it.
I can't.
It's innocent.
Nothing is innocent.
Now it belongs to me.
You see, when you take a heart, it becomes enchanted.
Stronger than a normal heart.
You're not hurting the beast.
You're controlling it.
Now show me you know what to do with that power.
Kill it.
What?
You've seen it done.
Now do it yourself.
Show me you can take the next step in your training.
Crush it.
Dearie, dearie, dearie.
And I had such high hopes.
And I didn't sign up to kill unicorns.
Magic is power.
Until you can take power, you're not learning anything.
Do you want me to teach you or not?
Yes.
Then there's one simple question for you to ponder.
I'll tell you anything.
I don't need the answer.
You do.
What's holding you back?
His name was Daniel.
I preserved his body with an enchantment spell.
He's dead, but frozen, and I've kept him in my family mausoleum.
Because you couldn't let go of him.
If you can't let go of the past, Regina, it's doomed to haunt you.
You know what?
I think this has been quite enough.
Regina, wait.
I...
I can help you.
I doubt it.
Daniel?
All right.
Come on.
What's with the yawn?
This isn't school.
It should be fun.
I couldn't sleep.
Hey.
I know.
I miss 'em, too.
Now just think how happy Emma and Snow will be when they come home to find that you've become a proper knight.
Say hello to your steed.
Is he mine?
This one's yours.
Really?
So... how do I get on him?
Oh, you're not riding today.
- I'm not?
- No.
There's much to learn before you hop in the saddle.
Like what?
Well, every morning, you'll have to muck out his stall.
Then you'll brush him and feed him.
After school, you'll do it again.
Every day, twice a day.
That's not riding.
That's babysitting.
Ah.
Horsesitting.
It builds an essential bond... the trust between knight and steed.
Okay.
But when will I ride him?
When the horse tells you.
I'm gonna go check in on the dwarves, see how the mining's coming.
I'll pick you up later.
So... anything you wanna tell me?
Are you ready to begin?
Oh, I've been ready.
The question is, are you?
Yes, I am.
Tell me why you're really here.
For power...
Stop wasting my time!
What is it you want?
Come on.
You've done all your soul-searching.
Now tell me.
Can you teach me how to use magic to bring back the dead?
That's what this is about?
The stable boy?
I want true happiness.
Then find it elsewhere, dearie.
Magic can do much, but not that.
Dead is dead.
Then I am lost.
And I've had my time wasted.
I'm sorry, but, uh, transcending death is beyond even my reach.
I thought nothing was beyond your reach.
Ah.
- Busy.
Should I...
- No.
No.
Nothing important going on here.
Rumplestiltskin...
Ignore her.
I got what you wanted.
What about the slippers?
Oh.
Couldn't find 'em.
Heard talk they've already been moved to another land.
That's what I needed to get to that other land.
Well, come with me in my hat.
I'm sure we can work something out.
No, no.
Your hat only transports between magical realms.
I need to get to a land without magic.
Why would anyone want that?
My business.
You want the ball or not?
Mm... yes.
Help yourself to as much gold as you deem appropriate.
Oh, and, you.
You can let yourself out.
Our work is done.
Wait.
So that's it?
You're not going to teach me anymore?
So long as you harbor foolish notions of bringing back the dead, so long as you live in the past, you'll never find your future.
Teaching you is a waste of time.
Pardon me... for eavesdropping, but I think you need to look elsewhere for assistance.
What do you know about it?
I hear things.
Jefferson's the name, and I'm a man who travels and sees much, and I know the man who can do what you want... bring back the dead.
He's, um, you might say... a wizard.
I can bring him to you.
At what price?
Always a price indeed.
So here's mine.
Like I said, I'm a man of travels, and I've made many enemies along the way, and I'd like a royal passport so I can have free reign to traverse your kingdom.
How would I do that?
Well, you're the queen... aren't you?
That's right.
I am.
And this wizard... can he really bring someone back from the dead?
Well...
If he can't, no one can.
Have you seen him before?
Yes, I've seen him around.
He's a blacksmith.
Came to our camp a couple months ago.
Said he lost his hand in an ogre attack.
Why would Cora leave a survivor?
It's messy.
Doesn't make sense.
You think he's lying?
I think Cora's tricked us before.
I don't want that to happen again.
Here you go.
I can't thank you enough for your kindness.
Fortune, it seems, has seen fit to show me favor.
An island full of corpses.
You're the only one to escape.
How exactly did that happen?
She attacked at night, slaughtered everyone in one fell swoop.
When she started ripping out people's hearts,
I hid under the bodies of those who had already been killed.
Pretended to be dead myself.
Mercifully, the ruse worked.
So much for fortune favoring the brave.
It was all I could do to survive.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I'm pretty good at knowing when someone is lying to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
We should leave here in case Cora decides to come back.
We should start searching for a new portal back to Storybrooke.
I only got about five minutes with my husband.
Not to mention, my grandson.
You have a grandson?
Long story.
Well, I know this land well.
I can guide you.
You're not gonna guide us anywhere until you tell us who you really are.
Dr. Whale?
Where are you?
Where is he... this wizard?
You promised to bring him to me.
Indeed, and off we shall go to see him, but I warn you, be cautious.
Why?
Is he dangerous?
Not to us.
But bear in mind, he's never been to a world like this before.
He's unfamiliar with our ways, with our magic.
All I care about are his ways, and if they will do what I require.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
May I present to you... your salvation?
You're the wizard?
I prefer "doctor,"
but you're welcome to call me whatever makes you comfortable.
Very well... doctor.
You understand why you've been brought here?
Of course.
Now... show me the patient.
It's remarkable.
It's as if his last breath was drawn just moments ago.
A preservation spell.
Can you bring him back?
Perhaps.
Let's take a look.
It's wonderful.
His condition is ideal... apart from being dead, that is.
Just how many times have you done this, doctor?
You didn't tell her?
Tell... tell me?
Tell me what?
The procedure is experimental.
Success is yet to occur.
But if certain conditions are met, I'm optimistic.
Optimistic?
Just hear him out.
What kind of charlatan are you?
I am no such thing.
I was told the last crucial piece of the puzzle exists in this land.
What else do you need?
A heart.
It's a fragile organ, and I need a strong one.
I've searched the far reaches of my realm for one with the fortitude to stand the shock of my procedure.
None have survived.
But they say in your land, there are hearts transformed by magic.
Hearts made so powerful, they glow.
That's why you've come here?
I need this for my work.
So tell me... how do you change these hearts?
How do you enchant them?
Those who practice the dark arts do it by ripping the organ out of the living while it still beats.
Mm-hmm.
And you can do this?
- No.
- Huh.
You assured me that this queen was some powerful sorceress.
I will not use magic for evil.
Well, if you want your fiancé back, then you're gonna have to find someone who will.
Have I wasted my time here?
No.
I know exactly who can help us.
I know where to get a heart.
Dr. Whale?
Oh!
Oh.
Whale.
Whale.
I know you took Daniel's body, and you took one of my hearts.
Why?
Did you bring him back?
I did it.
He's alive.
Yes.
I brought him back, but... he's not Daniel.
What?
He's... he's a monster.
This... was my mother's.
How sweet, but I'm not interested in heirlooms.
Oh, I believe you will be.
Listen.
To a fireplace?
Just listen.
Where is that coming from?
Her vault.
Take your pick.
These are all... hearts?
My mother was a collector.
Whose hearts are these?
I have no idea.
She took so many, caused so much pain.
It was impossible to keep track.
She was a monster.
Finally.
After all this time.
It's perfect.
What's going on?
I just got a call that Dr. Whale was attacked.
You'll have to ask his doctors.
No.
I am asking you.
I came here to speak with him and discovered he was hurt.
- It's the truth.
- What else?
What did you come here to speak with him about?
Someone from my past.
I believe he's come back.
Daniel.
His name is Daniel.
The man you were supposed to marry.
Snow told me what happened, and... how it was her fault that he died.
Yes.
He did.
Well, then how could he be back?
Whale.
He believed he could bring him back from the grave, and...
I don't know how... but he has.
You don't know how?
Guess.
He practices something more powerful than magic... or so I was told.
All he needed was a heart, and he took one of mine.
You have hearts here?
In my vault.
From our land.
Whose heart did he take?
I have no idea.
I took so many.
It was impossible to keep track.
I need to go.
I have to help him.
No.
Where is he?
Look what he did.
He's dangerous.
Not to me.
He won't hurt anyone else, David, I promise.
You know I can't take that chance.
You have two choices, Regina... tell me where he is, or jail.
I think it's like when...
you awoke from your coma.
He's following his final thoughts to where he last met me... the stables.
No.
Henry.
Henry's at the stables.
Gramps says that you'll tell me when I'm ready to ride you.
So... anytime.
Like, soon?
Aah!
I already told you.
I'm just a blacksmith.
Sure you are.
You don't want to talk to us?
Maybe you'll talk to the ogres while they rip you limb from limb.
- Come on.
- What?
You... you can't just leave me here like this!
What if he's telling the truth?
He's not.
Good for you!
You bested me.
I can count the amount of people who've done that on one hand.
That supposed to be funny?
Who are you?
Killian Jones, but most people have taken to call me by my more colorful moniker...
Hook.
Hook.
Check my satchel.
As in Captain Hook?
Ah, so you've heard of me.
You better hurry up.
They're getting closer.
So unless you wanna be dinner, you better start talking.
Cora wanted me to gain your trust so I could learn everything there is to know about your Storybrooke.
She didn't want any surprises when she finally got over there.
She can't get there.
We destroyed the wardrobe.
Ah, but the enchantment remains.
Cora gathered the ashes.
She's gonna use them to open up a portal.
Now if you'll kindly cut me loose.
No.
We should leave him here to die to pay for all the lives that he took.
That was Cora, not me.
Let's go.
Wait.
Wait!
You need me alive.
Why?
Because we both want the same thing... to get back to your land.
You would say anything to save yourself.
Why are we supposed to believe you now?
I arranged for transport with Cora, but seeing how resourceful you are,
I'll offer you the same deal...
I'll help you if you promise to take me along.
How are you going to help us get home?
The ashes will open a portal, but to find your land, she needs more.
There's an enchanted compass.
Cora seeks it.
I'll help you obtain it before she does.
So Cora won't make it to Storybrooke, and we'll be one step closer to getting home.
Sounds too good to be true.
There's only one way to find out.
You tell me one thing... and whatever you say, I better believe it... why does Captain Hook want to go to Storybrooke?
To exact revenge on the man who took my hand...
Rumplestiltskin.
You... you gotta stop.
You're...
you're scaring the horses.
Are... are... are you hurt?
Can I help you?
Let me help you.
Daniel!
Let him go!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Go.
Go!
It's true.
You're really here.
It won't hold for long.
Can you cast a spell to subdue him?
No.
I won't use magic on him.
What do you think you're doing?
He's a monster, Regina!
If you won't put him down, I will!
David, please!
Just let me talk to him.
It's too big of a risk.
There's no telling what he'll do.
- You have to at least give me a chance!
- Out of the way, Regina!
Now!
No!
I won't let you hurt him!
He'll listen to me!
Please!
Let me talk to my fiancé.
The heart, your majesty.
Thank you.
Now please, wait here.
The procedure is one I must perform alone.
What's he doing back there?
Magic?
He says he wields power greater than magic.
Really?
Why won't he let us see?
In his land, there's much we don't understand, or can't.
If he can't achieve what you seek,
Rumplestiltskin was right.
It can't be done.
Well?
I'm sorry.
I failed.
The heart wasn't strong enough.
It couldn't withstand the procedure.
Daniel.
Stop.
It's me.
I love you.
Regina.
Daniel.
Oh.
I can't believe it's really you.
Oh!
Daniel?
Stop.
Just stop the pain.
How?
Just... let me go.
No.
No, I won't lose you again.
Without you, I'm lost.
Daniel.
Daniel, come back to me.
Can't.
Can't.
But I love you.
Then love again.
Oh.
Good-bye, Daniel.
Up ahead.
We'll find the compass just over the ridge.
Do you get the feeling he's leading us exactly where Cora wants us, that this whole thing's a trap?
It's definitely a trap.
As long as we know they're trying to play us, we can...
Stay one step ahead of them.
Exactly.
Let me guess.
The compass is up there?
Oh, yeah.
So how do we... get to it?
It's not the climb you need to worry about.
It's the giant at the top.
Who's this?
Ah, your replacement, of course.
I needed someone more dedicated.
Dedicated?
Now... where were we?
You're back.
I used magic.
Why don't you come in and tell me what happened?
Enough.
I need to be taken home.
Now I have work to do, and I believe our deal is done.
The deal isn't done until he says it's done.
Now, now.
Patience, please.
Our transaction is, uh, nearly complete.
And are you satisfied with the results?
She did seem rather... heartbroken.
She is.
- She bought my failure.
- You should've seen her tears.
I've seen the aftermath.
Impressive.
Now... my property.
Yeah, here it is.
You'll excuse me if I check.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, the pleasure was mine.
Thanks to your efforts, I've made my monster.
Now I do hope you'll be able to make yours.
I'm not making a monster.
Sure you're not.
Good luck.
If these hearts are as strong as you say, I won't need luck.
Oh, just magic.
No.
What I'm going to accomplish goes far beyond magic.
And yet you need a magical heart to do it.
So small-minded.
I need my powers to transcend the limitations of your magic.
This must be quite a land you hail from if you think your abilities are more powerful.
They are.
Care to wager?
I suspect someday you'll see it my way.
I doubt it.
Now may we go?
Careful, dearie.
Just remember, whatever it is you traffic in, it comes with a price.
We'll see.
When they say I charge an arm and a leg, that's meant as a figure of speech.
Put it back.
You want me to reattach your arm?
Can you do it?
Of course.
But first, tell me why.
Because I want to use it again.
Obviously.
I meant why bring that stable boy back from the dead?
Why now?
I thought...
I thought that if I helped her, she would return me to my world.
I want to see my brother, to try to bring him back again.
Again?
The first time ended badly.
I need to return and try it once more.
Well, it seems that's rather beyond her abilities.
My condolences.
Now my arm.
You said you can do it.
Oh, yes.
But there's a difference between "can" and "will."
Name your price.
Say it.
Say what?
You know what.
You came here, not the hospital.
So say it.
I need magic.
That's all I needed to hear.
Always a pleasure doing business with you, uh, Victor.
Doctor.
You've returned.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Yes.
Look at it.
It's remarkable, isn't it?
The final piece to the puzzle.
I believe so.
Let's begin.
It's alive.
You did it.
Victor, you did it.
Yes.
I believe I have.
Welcome back, brother.
It's magic, Dr. Frankenstein.
No.
Not magic.
Science.
Previously on "Once Upon A Time"...
Daniel's grave.
He died because of you.
I was very young, and your mother...
She ripped his heart out.
Henry, you're gonna go home with David.
I want you to be here because you want to be here, not because of magic.
I want to redeem myself.
Magic can set you free.
Let me guide you.
And I won't become like her?
That, dearie, is entirely up to you.
It's not safe here.
Cora's still out there.
We found a safe haven.
We must go there now.
Hello, Hook.
I don't know if I can do this.
I'm not a very good liar.
Oh, it's not really a lie, Aurora.
Lancelot did die an honorable death and Cora did escape.
All true.
Just leave the particulars to us.
There's no reason to cause unnecessary panic
- amongst your people.
- I'm not so sure it's unnecessary...
Wait.
The tower.
We always have sentries guarding the entrance.
Stay close.
Oh, my God.
This just can't be.
Our land... we were protected here, hidden.
How did the ogres find us?
Ogres didn't do this.
What?
Cora did.
Their hearts... they were ripped out.
This was her magic... twisted and evil.
We have to stop her.
Too late.
She killed them.
She killed them all.
No, we have to stop her before she hurts anyone else.
Hey.
Hey.
Look.
There's someone under there.
- He's alive.
- Please.
It's okay.
Please help me.
It's okay.
You're safe now.
We won't hurt you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Once Upon A Time: "The Doctor" Season 2 Episode 5
Original air date October 28, 2012
Thank you very much for caring.
See you.
You.
We need to talk.
Oh!
What the hell was that for?
Sleeping with my wife.
- Kathryn?
- Snow.
Look, I didn't know.
All right?
I was cursed.
Yeah, I got it.
What do you want?
So... is it true?
People are saying that you're trying to find a way to build a portal back to your land because that's where you think Emma and Mary Margaret are, that they're alive.
Well, the whispers can stop.
I have no secrets from this town.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
But the land... it's... it's gone, destroyed by the curse.
Apparently not.
Well, you're having any luck?
Not yet.
We're working on it.
Does that mean that all the lands still exist?
Possibly.
So the Queen lied to us.
Again.
Are you sure?
Remember who we're talking about.
Regina.
Are you here to see me?
I've been trying to keep my promise to Henry, but it's been difficult.
To not use magic.
It's been two days.
That's an excellent start.
Come on in.
It's just that magic is the way I've always gotten everything.
Sounds like it's also the way you've lost everything.
Regina, this is your chance to start over, to earn Henry.
Dr. Whale, this is highly inappropriate.
Send me back.
Excuse me?
To my land.
Send me back to my brother.
Why don't you check the "Missing" board like everyone else?
Your curse only brought the living.
Well, then I'm sorry for your loss.
But I'm afraid I can't send anyone anywhere.
Can't or won't?
Dr. Whale, I have to insist.
Please.
Go.
Sorry.
What you said isn't entirely true, is it?
I'm sorry?
About the curse only taking the living.
The grave of your father's here, right?
I don't care about Whale or his brother.
I brought who I wanted.
Anyone else?
If you want help, you have to try and trust me.
Stopping magic is a lot harder than starting.
Now show me what you've learned.
Immobilize it.
There.
I did it.
Excellent work, my apprentice.
Now there's just one last, tiny, tiny, teeny, little detail.
Take its heart.
Like what my mother did to...
Oh, to your true love.
Indeed.
Then you already know how it's done.
Gentle.
If you do it right, no harm will befall it, unless of course, you will it.
I can't.
It's innocent.
Nothing is innocent.
Now it belongs to me.
You see, when you take a heart, it becomes enchanted.
Stronger than a normal heart.
You're not hurting the beast.
You're controlling it.
Now show me you know what to do with that power.
Kill it.
What?
You've seen it done.
Now do it yourself.
Show me you can take the next step in your training.
Crush it.
Dearie, dearie, dearie.
And I had such high hopes.
And I didn't sign up to kill unicorns.
Magic is power.
Until you can take power, you're not learning anything.
Do you want me to teach you or not?
Yes.
Then there's one simple question for you to ponder.
I'll tell you anything.
I don't need the answer.
You do.
What's holding you back?
His name was Daniel.
I preserved his body with an enchantment spell.
He's dead, but frozen, and I've kept him in my family mausoleum.
Because you couldn't let go of him.
If you can't let go of the past, Regina, it's doomed to haunt you.
You know what?
I think this has been quite enough.
Regina, wait.
I...
I can help you.
I doubt it.
Daniel?
All right.
Come on.
What's with the yawn?
This isn't school.
It should be fun.
I couldn't sleep.
Hey.
I know.
I miss 'em, too.
Now just think how happy Emma and Snow will be when they come home to find that you've become a proper knight.
Say hello to your steed.
Is he mine?
This one's yours.
Really?
So... how do I get on him?
Oh, you're not riding today.
- I'm not?
- No.
There's much to learn before you hop in the saddle.
Like what?
Well, every morning, you'll have to muck out his stall.
Then you'll brush him and feed him.
After school, you'll do it again.
Every day, twice a day.
That's not riding.
That's babysitting.
Ah.
Horsesitting.
It builds an essential bond... the trust between knight and steed.
Okay.
But when will I ride him?
When the horse tells you.
I'm gonna go check in on the dwarves, see how the mining's coming.
I'll pick you up later.
So... anything you wanna tell me?
Are you ready to begin?
Oh, I've been ready.
The question is, are you?
Yes, I am.
Tell me why you're really here.
For power...
Stop wasting my time!
What is it you want?
Come on.
You've done all your soul-searching.
Now tell me.
Can you teach me how to use magic to bring back the dead?
That's what this is about?
The stable boy?
I want true happiness.
Then find it elsewhere, dearie.
Magic can do much, but not that.
Dead is dead.
Then I am lost.
And I've had my time wasted.
I'm sorry, but, uh, transcending death is beyond even my reach.
I thought nothing was beyond your reach.
Ah.
- Busy.
Should I...
- No.
No.
Nothing important going on here.
Rumplestiltskin...
Ignore her.
I got what you wanted.
What about the slippers?
Oh.
Couldn't find 'em.
Heard talk they've already been moved to another land.
That's what I needed to get to that other land.
Well, come with me in my hat.
I'm sure we can work something out.
No, no.
Your hat only transports between magical realms.
I need to get to a land without magic.
Why would anyone want that?
My business.
You want the ball or not?
Mm... yes.
Help yourself to as much gold as you deem appropriate.
Oh, and, you.
You can let yourself out.
Our work is done.
Wait.
So that's it?
You're not going to teach me anymore?
So long as you harbor foolish notions of bringing back the dead, so long as you live in the past, you'll never find your future.
Teaching you is a waste of time.
Pardon me... for eavesdropping, but I think you need to look elsewhere for assistance.
What do you know about it?
I hear things.
Jefferson's the name, and I'm a man who travels and sees much, and I know the man who can do what you want... bring back the dead.
He's, um, you might say... a wizard.
I can bring him to you.
At what price?
Always a price indeed.
So here's mine.
Like I said, I'm a man of travels, and I've made many enemies along the way, and I'd like a royal passport so I can have free reign to traverse your kingdom.
How would I do that?
Well, you're the queen... aren't you?
That's right.
I am.
And this wizard... can he really bring someone back from the dead?
Well...
If he can't, no one can.
Have you seen him before?
Yes, I've seen him around.
He's a blacksmith.
Came to our camp a couple months ago.
Said he lost his hand in an ogre attack.
Why would Cora leave a survivor?
It's messy.
Doesn't make sense.
You think he's lying?
I think Cora's tricked us before.
I don't want that to happen again.
Here you go.
I can't thank you enough for your kindness.
Fortune, it seems, has seen fit to show me favor.
An island full of corpses.
You're the only one to escape.
How exactly did that happen?
She attacked at night, slaughtered everyone in one fell swoop.
When she started ripping out people's hearts,
I hid under the bodies of those who had already been killed.
Pretended to be dead myself.
Mercifully, the ruse worked.
So much for fortune favoring the brave.
It was all I could do to survive.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I'm pretty good at knowing when someone is lying to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
We should leave here in case Cora decides to come back.
We should start searching for a new portal back to Storybrooke.
I only got about five minutes with my husband.
Not to mention, my grandson.
You have a grandson?
Long story.
Well, I know this land well.
I can guide you.
You're not gonna guide us anywhere until you tell us who you really are.
Dr. Whale?
Where are you?
Where is he... this wizard?
You promised to bring him to me.
Indeed, and off we shall go to see him, but I warn you, be cautious.
Why?
Is he dangerous?
Not to us.
But bear in mind, he's never been to a world like this before.
He's unfamiliar with our ways, with our magic.
All I care about are his ways, and if they will do what I require.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
May I present to you... your salvation?
You're the wizard?
I prefer "doctor,"
but you're welcome to call me whatever makes you comfortable.
Very well... doctor.
You understand why you've been brought here?
Of course.
Now... show me the patient.
It's remarkable.
It's as if his last breath was drawn just moments ago.
A preservation spell.
Can you bring him back?
Perhaps.
Let's take a look.
It's wonderful.
His condition is ideal... apart from being dead, that is.
Just how many times have you done this, doctor?
You didn't tell her?
Tell... tell me?
Tell me what?
The procedure is experimental.
Success is yet to occur.
But if certain conditions are met, I'm optimistic.
Optimistic?
Just hear him out.
What kind of charlatan are you?
I am no such thing.
I was told the last crucial piece of the puzzle exists in this land.
What else do you need?
A heart.
It's a fragile organ, and I need a strong one.
I've searched the far reaches of my realm for one with the fortitude to stand the shock of my procedure.
None have survived.
But they say in your land, there are hearts transformed by magic.
Hearts made so powerful, they glow.
That's why you've come here?
I need this for my work.
So tell me... how do you change these hearts?
How do you enchant them?
Those who practice the dark arts do it by ripping the organ out of the living while it still beats.
Mm-hmm.
And you can do this?
- No.
- Huh.
You assured me that this queen was some powerful sorceress.
I will not use magic for evil.
Well, if you want your fiancé back, then you're gonna have to find someone who will.
Have I wasted my time here?
No.
I know exactly who can help us.
I know where to get a heart.
Dr. Whale?
Oh!
Oh.
Whale.
Whale.
I know you took Daniel's body, and you took one of my hearts.
Why?
Did you bring him back?
I did it.
He's alive.
Yes.
I brought him back, but... he's not Daniel.
What?
He's... he's a monster.
This... was my mother's.
How sweet, but I'm not interested in heirlooms.
Oh, I believe you will be.
Listen.
To a fireplace?
Just listen.
Where is that coming from?
Her vault.
Take your pick.
These are all... hearts?
My mother was a collector.
Whose hearts are these?
I have no idea.
She took so many, caused so much pain.
It was impossible to keep track.
She was a monster.
Finally.
After all this time.
It's perfect.
What's going on?
I just got a call that Dr. Whale was attacked.
You'll have to ask his doctors.
No.
I am asking you.
I came here to speak with him and discovered he was hurt.
- It's the truth.
- What else?
What did you come here to speak with him about?
Someone from my past.
I believe he's come back.
Daniel.
His name is Daniel.
The man you were supposed to marry.
Snow told me what happened, and... how it was her fault that he died.
Yes.
He did.
Well, then how could he be back?
Whale.
He believed he could bring him back from the grave, and...
I don't know how... but he has.
You don't know how?
Guess.
He practices something more powerful than magic... or so I was told.
All he needed was a heart, and he took one of mine.
You have hearts here?
In my vault.
From our land.
Whose heart did he take?
I have no idea.
I took so many.
It was impossible to keep track.
I need to go.
I have to help him.
No.
Where is he?
Look what he did.
He's dangerous.
Not to me.
He won't hurt anyone else, David, I promise.
You know I can't take that chance.
You have two choices, Regina... tell me where he is, or jail.
I think it's like when...
you awoke from your coma.
He's following his final thoughts to where he last met me... the stables.
No.
Henry.
Henry's at the stables.
Gramps says that you'll tell me when I'm ready to ride you.
So... anytime.
Like, soon?
Aah!
I already told you.
I'm just a blacksmith.
Sure you are.
You don't want to talk to us?
Maybe you'll talk to the ogres while they rip you limb from limb.
- Come on.
- What?
You... you can't just leave me here like this!
What if he's telling the truth?
He's not.
Good for you!
You bested me.
I can count the amount of people who've done that on one hand.
That supposed to be funny?
Who are you?
Killian Jones, but most people have taken to call me by my more colorful moniker...
Hook.
Hook.
Check my satchel.
As in Captain Hook?
Ah, so you've heard of me.
You better hurry up.
They're getting closer.
So unless you wanna be dinner, you better start talking.
Cora wanted me to gain your trust so I could learn everything there is to know about your Storybrooke.
She didn't want any surprises when she finally got over there.
She can't get there.
We destroyed the wardrobe.
Ah, but the enchantment remains.
Cora gathered the ashes.
She's gonna use them to open up a portal.
Now if you'll kindly cut me loose.
No.
We should leave him here to die to pay for all the lives that he took.
That was Cora, not me.
Let's go.
Wait.
Wait!
You need me alive.
Why?
Because we both want the same thing... to get back to your land.
You would say anything to save yourself.
Why are we supposed to believe you now?
I arranged for transport with Cora, but seeing how resourceful you are,
I'll offer you the same deal...
I'll help you if you promise to take me along.
How are you going to help us get home?
The ashes will open a portal, but to find your land, she needs more.
There's an enchanted compass.
Cora seeks it.
I'll help you obtain it before she does.
So Cora won't make it to Storybrooke, and we'll be one step closer to getting home.
Sounds too good to be true.
There's only one way to find out.
You tell me one thing... and whatever you say, I better believe it... why does Captain Hook want to go to Storybrooke?
To exact revenge on the man who took my hand...
Rumplestiltskin.
You... you gotta stop.
You're...
you're scaring the horses.
Are... are... are you hurt?
Can I help you?
Let me help you.
Daniel!
Let him go!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Go.
Go!
It's true.
You're really here.
It won't hold for long.
Can you cast a spell to subdue him?
No.
I won't use magic on him.
What do you think you're doing?
He's a monster, Regina!
If you won't put him down, I will!
David, please!
Just let me talk to him.
It's too big of a risk.
There's no telling what he'll do.
- You have to at least give me a chance!
- Out of the way, Regina!
Now!
No!
I won't let you hurt him!
He'll listen to me!
Please!
Let me talk to my fiancé.
The heart, your majesty.
Thank you.
Now please, wait here.
The procedure is one I must perform alone.
What's he doing back there?
Magic?
He says he wields power greater than magic.
Really?
Why won't he let us see?
In his land, there's much we don't understand, or can't.
If he can't achieve what you seek,
Rumplestiltskin was right.
It can't be done.
Well?
I'm sorry.
I failed.
The heart wasn't strong enough.
It couldn't withstand the procedure.
Daniel.
Stop.
It's me.
I love you.
Regina.
Daniel.
Oh.
I can't believe it's really you.
Oh!
Daniel?
Stop.
Just stop the pain.
How?
Just... let me go.
No.
No, I won't lose you again.
Without you, I'm lost.
Daniel.
Daniel, come back to me.
Can't.
Can't.
But I love you.
Then love again.
Oh.
Good-bye, Daniel.
Up ahead.
We'll find the compass just over the ridge.
Do you get the feeling he's leading us exactly where Cora wants us, that this whole thing's a trap?
It's definitely a trap.
As long as we know they're trying to play us, we can...
Stay one step ahead of them.
Exactly.
Let me guess.
The compass is up there?
Oh, yeah.
So how do we... get to it?
It's not the climb you need to worry about.
It's the giant at the top.
Who's this?
Ah, your replacement, of course.
I needed someone more dedicated.
Dedicated?
Now... where were we?
You're back.
I used magic.
Why don't you come in and tell me what happened?
Enough.
I need to be taken home.
Now I have work to do, and I believe our deal is done.
The deal isn't done until he says it's done.
Now, now.
Patience, please.
Our transaction is, uh, nearly complete.
And are you satisfied with the results?
She did seem rather... heartbroken.
She is.
- She bought my failure.
- You should've seen her tears.
I've seen the aftermath.
Impressive.
Now... my property.
Yeah, here it is.
You'll excuse me if I check.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, the pleasure was mine.
Thanks to your efforts, I've made my monster.
Now I do hope you'll be able to make yours.
I'm not making a monster.
Sure you're not.
Good luck.
If these hearts are as strong as you say, I won't need luck.
Oh, just magic.
No.
What I'm going to accomplish goes far beyond magic.
And yet you need a magical heart to do it.
So small-minded.
I need my powers to transcend the limitations of your magic.
This must be quite a land you hail from if you think your abilities are more powerful.
They are.
Care to wager?
I suspect someday you'll see it my way.
I doubt it.
Now may we go?
Careful, dearie.
Just remember, whatever it is you traffic in, it comes with a price.
We'll see.
When they say I charge an arm and a leg, that's meant as a figure of speech.
Put it back.
You want me to reattach your arm?
Can you do it?
Of course.
But first, tell me why.
Because I want to use it again.
Obviously.
I meant why bring that stable boy back from the dead?
Why now?
I thought...
I thought that if I helped her, she would return me to my world.
I want to see my brother, to try to bring him back again.
Again?
The first time ended badly.
I need to return and try it once more.
Well, it seems that's rather beyond her abilities.
My condolences.
Now my arm.
You said you can do it.
Oh, yes.
But there's a difference between "can" and "will."
Name your price.
Say it.
Say what?
You know what.
You came here, not the hospital.
So say it.
I need magic.
That's all I needed to hear.
Always a pleasure doing business with you, uh, Victor.
Doctor.
You've returned.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Yes.
Look at it.
It's remarkable, isn't it?
The final piece to the puzzle.
I believe so.
Let's begin.
It's alive.
You did it.
Victor, you did it.
Yes.
I believe I have.
Welcome back, brother.
It's magic, Dr. Frankenstein.
No.
Not magic.
Science.
Previously on "Once Upon A Time"... (Regina) Daniel's grave.
He died because of you.
(Snow) I was very young, and your mother... (Squish) She ripped his heart out.
Henry, you're gonna go home with David.
I want you to be here because you want to be here, not because of magic.
(Whispers) I want to redeem myself.
Magic can set you free.
Let me guide you.
And I won't become like her?
That, dearie, is entirely up to you.
It's not safe here.
Cora's still out there.
We found a safe haven.
We must go there now.
Hello, Hook.
(Aurora) I don't know if I can do this.
I'm not a very good liar.
(Snow) Oh, it's not really a lie, Aurora.
Lancelot did die an honorable death and Cora did escape.
All true.
Just leave the particulars to us.
There's no reason to cause unnecessary panic
- amongst your people.
- I'm not so sure it's unnecessary...
Wait.
The tower.
We always have sentries guarding the entrance.
(Blade zings)
Stay close.
Oh, my God.
(Mulan) This can't be.
Our land... we were protected here, hidden.
How did the ogres find us?
Ogres didn't do this.
What?
Cora did.
Their hearts... they were ripped out.
This was her magic... twisted and evil.
We have to stop her.
Too late.
She killed them.
She killed them all.
No, we have to stop her before she hurts anyone else.
Hey.
Hey.
Look.
There's someone under there.
- He's alive.
- (Man) Please.
It's okay.
Please help me.
It's okay.
You're safe now.
We won't hurt you.
Thank you.
(Panting) Thank you.
(Panting)
Once Upon A Time 2x05
- The Doctor Original air date October 28, 2012
(indistinct conversations)
Thank you very much for caring.
See you.
(Exhales deeply)
You.
We need to talk.
Oh!
(Sighs) What the hell was that for?
Sleeping with my wife.
- Kathryn?
- Snow.
Look, I didn't know.
All right?
I was cursed.
Yeah, I got it.
What do you want?
(Sighs)
So... is it true?
People are saying that you're trying to find a way to build a portal back to your land because that's where you think Emma and Mary Margaret are, that they're alive.
Well, the whispers can stop.
I have no secrets from this town.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
But the land... it's... it's gone, destroyed by the curse.
Apparently not.
Well, you're having any luck?
Not yet.
We're working on it.
Does that mean that all the lands still exist?
Possibly.
So the Queen lied to us.
Again.
Are you sure?
Remember who we're talking about.
Regina.
Are you here to see me?
I've been trying to keep my promise to Henry, but it's been difficult.
To not use magic.
It's been two days.
That's an excellent start.
Come on in.
It's just that magic is the way I've always gotten everything.
Sounds like it's also the way you've lost everything.
Regina, this is your chance to start over, to earn Henry.
(Door opens)
Dr. Whale, this is highly inappropriate.
Send me back.
Excuse me?
To my land.
Send me back to my brother.
Why don't you check the "Missing" board like everyone else?
Your curse only brought the living.
Well, then I'm sorry for your loss.
But I'm afraid I can't send anyone anywhere.
Can't or won't?
Dr. Whale, I have to insist.
Please.
Go.
Sorry.
What you said isn't entirely true, is it?
I'm sorry?
About the curse only taking the living.
The grave of your father's here, right?
I don't care about Whale or his brother.
I brought who I wanted.
Anyone else?
(Sighs)
If you want help, you have to try and trust me.
Stopping magic is a lot harder than starting.
(Whinnies)
(Rumplestiltskin) Now show me what you've learned.
Immobilize it.
(Whinnies)
(Whoosh)
(Giggles)
There.
I did it.
Excellent work, my apprentice.
Now there's just one last, tiny, tiny, teeny, little detail.
Take its heart.
Like what my mother did to...
Oh, to your true love.
Indeed.
Then you already know how it's done.
Gentle.
If you do it right, no harm will befall it, unless of course, you will it.
(Breathing heavily)
I can't.
It's innocent.
Nothing is innocent.
(Squish)
(Giggles)
(Snorts) (Heart beating rhythmically)
(Sighs)
Now it belongs to me.
You see, when you take a heart, it becomes enchanted.
Stronger than a normal heart.
You're not hurting the beast.
You're controlling it.
Now show me you know what to do with that power.
Kill it.
What?
You've seen it done.
Now do it yourself.
Show me you can take the next step in your training.
Crush it.
(Heart continues beating)
(Heart crackles)
(Groans)
(Exhales)
Dearie, dearie, dearie.
(Blusters)
And I had such high hopes.
And I didn't sign up to kill unicorns.
Magic is power.
Until you can take power, you're not learning anything.
Do you want me to teach you or not?
Yes.
Then there's one simple question for you to ponder.
I'll tell you anything.
(Giggles) I don't need the answer.
You do.
What's holding you back?
(Gasps)
(Sniffles)
His name was Daniel.
I preserved his body with an enchantment spell.
He's dead, but frozen, and I've kept him in my family mausoleum.
Because you couldn't let go of him.
(Sighs) If you can't let go of the past, Regina, it's doomed to haunt you.
(Sniffles)
(Sighs) You know what?
I think this has been quite enough.
Regina, wait.
I...
I can help you.
I doubt it.
(Thunderclaps)
(Horn blares)
(Gasps)
(Thunderclap)
Daniel?
(Thunderclap)
All right.
(Yawns)
(Laughs) Come on.
What's with the yawn?
(Blusters) This isn't school.
It should be fun.
I couldn't sleep.
(Sighs deeply)
Hey.
I know.
I miss 'em, too.
(Horse blusters)
Now just think how happy Emma and Snow will be when they come home to find that you've become a proper knight.
(Horse blusters)
Say hello to your steed.
Is he mine?
(Clicks tongue) (Nickers)
This one's yours.
Really?
(Nickers)
So... how do I get on him?
Oh, you're not riding today.
- I'm not?
- No.
There's much to learn before you hop in the saddle.
Like what?
Well, every morning, you'll have to muck out his stall.
Then you'll brush him and feed him.
After school, you'll do it again.
Every day, twice a day.
(Nickers)
That's not riding.
That's babysitting.
Ah.
Horsesitting.
It builds an essential bond... the trust between knight and steed.
Okay.
But when will I ride him?
When the horse tells you.
(Horse whinnies in distance)
I'm gonna go check in on the dwarves, see how the mining's coming.
I'll pick you up later.
So...
(Nickers) anything you wanna tell me?
(Nickers)
(Birds chirping)
(Crow caws)
(Doors squeak) (Gasps)
(Clears throat)
Are you ready to begin?
Oh, I've been ready.
The question is, are you?
Yes, I am.
(Wheel creaks)
Tell me why you're really here.
For power...
Stop wasting my time!
What is it you want?
Come on.
You've done all your soul-searching.
Now tell me.
Can you teach me how to use magic to bring back the dead?
That's what this is about?
The stable boy?
I want true happiness.
Then find it elsewhere, dearie.
Magic can do much, but not that.
Dead is dead.
(Sighs)
Then I am lost.
And I've had my time wasted.
I'm sorry, but, uh, transcending death is beyond even my reach.
I thought nothing was beyond your reach.
Ah.
- Busy.
Should I...
- No.
No.
Nothing important going on here.
Rumplestiltskin...
Ignore her.
I got what you wanted.
What about the slippers?
Oh.
Couldn't find 'em.
Heard talk they've already been moved to another land.
That's what I needed to get to that other land.
(Bottles clatter)
Well, come with me in my hat.
I'm sure we can work something out.
No, no.
Your hat only transports between magical realms.
I need to get to a land without magic.
Why would anyone want that?
My business.
You want the ball or not?
Mm... yes.
Help yourself to as much gold as you deem appropriate.
(Clears throat)
Oh, and, you.
You can let yourself out.
Our work is done.
Wait.
So that's it?
You're not going to teach me anymore?
So long as you harbor foolish notions of bringing back the dead, so long as you live in the past, you'll never find your future.
Teaching you is a waste of time.
Pardon me...
(Gasps) for eavesdropping, but I think you need to look elsewhere for assistance.
What do you know about it?
I hear things.
Jefferson's the name, and I'm a man who travels and sees much, and I know the man who can do what you want... bring back the dead.
He's, um, you might say... a wizard.
I can bring him to you.
At what price?
Always a price indeed.
So here's mine.
Like I said, I'm a man of travels, and I've made many enemies along the way, and I'd like a royal passport so I can have free reign to traverse your kingdom.
How would I do that?
(Inhales deeply and clicks tongue)
Well, you're the queen... aren't you?
That's right.
I am.
And this wizard... (Sniffles) can he really bring someone back from the dead?
Well...
If he can't, no one can.
(Emma) Have you seen him before?
Yes, I've seen him around.
He's a blacksmith.
Came to our camp a couple months ago.
Said he lost his hand in an ogre attack.
Why would Cora leave a survivor?
It's messy.
Doesn't make sense.
You think he's lying?
I think Cora's tricked us before.
I don't want that to happen again.
Here you go.
I can't thank you enough for your kindness.
Fortune, it seems, has seen fit to show me favor.
An island full of corpses.
You're the only one to escape.
How exactly did that happen?
She attacked at night, slaughtered everyone in one fell swoop.
When she started ripping out people's hearts,
I hid under the bodies of those who had already been killed.
Pretended to be dead myself.
Mercifully, the ruse worked.
So much for fortune favoring the brave.
It was all I could do to survive.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I'm pretty good at knowing when someone is lying to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
We should leave here in case Cora decides to come back.
We should start searching for a new portal back to Storybrooke.
I only got about five minutes with my husband.
Not to mention, my grandson.
You have a grandson?
Long story.
Well, I know this land well.
I can guide you.
(Blade zings) You're not gonna guide us anywhere until you tell us who you really are.
(Pants)
(Door squeaks)
(Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A. in distance)
(Door creaks) Dr. Whale?
Where are you?
Where is he... this wizard?
You promised to bring him to me.
Indeed, and off we shall go to see him, but I warn you, be cautious.
Why?
Is he dangerous?
Not to us.
But bear in mind, he's never been to a world like this before.
He's unfamiliar with our ways, with our magic.
All I care about are his ways, and if they will do what I require.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
May I present to you... your salvation?
You're the wizard?
(Clears throat)
I prefer "doctor,"
but you're welcome to call me whatever makes you comfortable.
Very well... doctor.
You understand why you've been brought here?
Of course.
Now...
(Clears throat) show me the patient.
It's remarkable.
It's as if his last breath was drawn just moments ago.
A preservation spell.
Can you bring him back?
Perhaps.
Let's take a look.
It's wonderful.
His condition is ideal... apart from being dead, that is.
Just how many times have you done this, doctor?
You didn't tell her?
Tell... tell me?
Tell me what?
The procedure is experimental.
Success is yet to occur.
But if certain conditions are met, I'm optimistic.
Optimistic?
Just hear him out.
What kind of charlatan are you?
I am no such thing.
I was told the last crucial piece of the puzzle exists in this land.
What else do you need?
A heart.
It's a fragile organ, and I need a strong one.
I've searched the far reaches of my realm for one with the fortitude to stand the shock of my procedure.
None have survived.
But they say in your land, there are hearts transformed by magic.
Hearts made so powerful, they glow.
That's why you've come here?
I need this for my work.
So tell me... how do you change these hearts?
How do you enchant them?
Those who practice the dark arts do it by ripping the organ out of the living while it still beats.
Mm-hmm.
And you can do this?
- No.
- Huh.
You assured me that this queen was some powerful sorceress.
I will not use magic for evil.
Well, if you want your fiance back, then you're gonna have to find someone who will.
Have I wasted my time here?
No.
I know exactly who can help us.
I know where to get a heart.
Dr. Whale?
(Electricity crackling)
(Gasps)
(Clatter) Oh!
(Lights creaking)
Oh.
(Grunts) Whale.
Whale.
(Grunts)
I know you took Daniel's body, and you took one of my hearts.
Why?
Did you bring him back?
I did it.
He's alive.
Yes.
I brought him back, but... he's not Daniel.
What?
He's... he's a monster.
(Crickets chirping) This... was my mother's.
How sweet, but I'm not interested in heirlooms.
Oh, I believe you will be.
Listen.
(Fire crackling)
To a fireplace?
Just listen.
(Heart beating faintly)
Where is that coming from?
Her vault.
(Whoosh)
(Multiple hearts beating rhythmically)
Take your pick.
These are all... hearts?
My mother was a collector.
Whose hearts are these?
I have no idea.
She took so many, caused so much pain.
It was impossible to keep track.
She was a monster.
(Box scraping)
(Hearts continue beating)
Finally.
After all this time.
(Gasps)
It's perfect.
(Monitor beeping steadily)
(Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.)
What's going on?
I just got a call that Dr. Whale was attacked.
You'll have to ask his doctors.
No.
I am asking you.
I came here to speak with him and discovered he was hurt.
- It's the truth.
- What else?
What did you come here to speak with him about?
Someone from my past.
I believe he's come back.
Daniel.
His name is Daniel.
The man you were supposed to marry.
Snow told me what happened, and... how it was her fault that he died.
Yes.
He did.
(Exhales) Well, then how could he be back?
Whale.
He believed he could bring him back from the grave, and...
I don't know how... (Whispers) but he has.
You don't know how?
Guess.
He practices something more powerful than magic... or so I was told.
All he needed was a heart, and he took one of mine.
You have hearts here?
In my vault.
From our land.
Whose heart did he take?
I have no idea.
I took so many.
It was impossible to keep track.
I need to go.
I have to help him.
No.
Where is he?
Look what he did.
He's dangerous.
Not to me.
He won't hurt anyone else, David, I promise.
You know I can't take that chance.
You have two choices, Regina... tell me where he is, or jail.
I think it's like when...
you awoke from your coma.
He's following his final thoughts to where he last met me... the stables.
No.
Henry.
Henry's at the stables.
Gramps says that you'll tell me when I'm ready to ride you.
So... anytime.
Like, soon?
(Nickers)
(Whinnies)
(Horses whinnying)
(Whinnying)
Aah!
(Horses whinnying)
I already told you.
I'm just a blacksmith.
Sure you are.
(Whistles)
(Growling in distance) You don't want to talk to us?
Maybe you'll talk to the ogres while they rip you limb from limb.
(Ogres growling)
- Come on.
- What?
You... you can't just leave me here like this!
What if he's telling the truth?
He's not.
Good for you!
(Chuckles)
You bested me.
I can count the amount of people who've done that on one hand.
That supposed to be funny?
Who are you?
Killian Jones, but most people have taken to call me by my more colorful moniker...
Hook.
Hook.
Check my satchel.
As in Captain Hook?
Ah, so you've heard of me.
(Clink) (Ogres growling)
You better hurry up.
They're getting closer.
So unless you wanna be dinner, you better start talking.
(Chuckles)
Cora wanted me to gain your trust so I could learn everything there is to know about your Storybrooke.
She didn't want any surprises when she finally got over there.
She can't get there.
We destroyed the wardrobe.
Ah, but the enchantment remains.
Cora gathered the ashes.
She's gonna use them to open up a portal.
(Growling grows louder, thrashing)
Now if you'll kindly cut me loose.
No.
We should leave him here to die to pay for all the lives that he took.
That was Cora, not me.
Let's go.
Wait.
Wait!
(Ogres continue growling)
You need me alive.
Why?
Because we both want the same thing... to get back to your land.
You would say anything to save yourself.
Why are we supposed to believe you now?
I arranged for transport with Cora, but seeing how resourceful you are,
I'll offer you the same deal...
I'll help you if you promise to take me along.
How are you going to help us get home?
The ashes will open a portal, but to find your land, she needs more.
There's an enchanted compass.
Cora seeks it.
I'll help you obtain it before she does.
So Cora won't make it to Storybrooke, and we'll be one step closer to getting home.
Sounds too good to be true.
There's only one way to find out.
(Ogres roaring)
You tell me one thing... and whatever you say, I better believe it... why does Captain Hook want to go to Storybrooke?
(Screech in distance)
To exact revenge on the man who took my hand...
Rumplestiltskin.
(Ogres growling)
(Horses whinnying)
You... you gotta stop.
You're...
you're scaring the horses.
(Whinnying continues)
Are... are... are you hurt?
Can I help you?
(Horse whinnies)
(Heart beating rhythmically)
Let me help you.
(Grunts)
(Horse whinnying) (Grunting)
(Regina) Daniel!
Let him go!
(Thud)
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Go.
Go!
It's true.
You're really here.
(Grunts) (Grunts)
(Latch clicks)
It won't hold for long.
Can you cast a spell to subdue him?
No.
I won't use magic on him.
What do you think you're doing?
(Safety clicks)
He's a monster, Regina!
If you won't put him down, I will!
David, please!
Just let me talk to him.
It's too big of a risk.
There's no telling what he'll do.
- You have to at least give me a chance!
- Out of the way, Regina!
Now!
No!
I won't let you hurt him!
He'll listen to me!
Please!
Let me talk to my fiance.
(Wind whistling)
(Thunderclap)
The heart, your majesty.
(Thunderclap)
Thank you.
Now please, wait here.
The procedure is one I must perform alone.
(Thunderclap)
What's he doing back there?
Magic?
He says he wields power greater than magic.
Really?
(Thunderclap)
Why won't he let us see?
In his land, there's much we don't understand, or can't.
If he can't achieve what you seek,
Rumplestiltskin was right.
It can't be done.
(Thunder crashing)
(Heart beating rhythmically)
(Thunder rumbling)
Well?
I'm sorry.
I failed.
The heart wasn't strong enough.
It couldn't withstand the procedure.
(Crying)
(Thunderclap)
(Gasps)
(Grunts)
(Choking) Daniel.
Stop.
(Grunting)
It's me.
(Whispers) I love you.
(Inhales deeply)
(Gasping and coughing)
(Whispers) Regina.
Daniel.
Oh.
(Exhales)
(Inhales deeply) I can't believe it's really you.
Oh!
Daniel?
(Moaning)
Stop.
Just stop the pain.
How?
Just... let me go.
No.
No, I won't lose you again.
(Crying) Without you, I'm lost.
(Groans)
Daniel.
Daniel, come back to me.
(Weakly) Can't.
Can't.
(Whispers) But I love you.
Then love again.
(Groans)
Oh.
(Sniffles)
(Whoosh)
(Sobs)
(Crying)
Good-bye, Daniel.
Up ahead.
We'll find the compass just over the ridge.
(Snow) Do you get the feeling he's leading us exactly where Cora wants us, that this whole thing's a trap?
It's definitely a trap.
As long as we know they're trying to play us, we can...
Stay one step ahead of them.
Exactly.
Let me guess.
The compass is up there?
Oh, yeah.
(Emma) So how do we... get to it?
It's not the climb you need to worry about.
It's the giant at the top.
(Engine idles)
(Birds chirping)
Who's this?
Ah, your replacement, of course.
I needed someone more dedicated.
Dedicated?
(Squish)
(Heart crackles)
(Thud)
(Giggles)
Now... where were we?
You're back.
(Whispers) I used magic.
Why don't you come in and tell me what happened?
(Sniffles)
(Birds chirping)
Enough.
I need to be taken home.
Now I have work to do, and I believe our deal is done.
The deal isn't done until he says it's done.
Now, now.
Patience, please.
Our transaction is, uh, nearly complete.
And are you satisfied with the results?
She did seem rather... heartbroken.
She is.
(Clears throat)
- She bought my failure.
- You should've seen her tears.
I've seen the aftermath.
Impressive.
Now... my property.
Yeah, here it is.
You'll excuse me if I check.
(Beating rhythmically)
(Lock clicks)
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, the pleasure was mine.
Thanks to your efforts, I've made my monster.
Now I do hope you'll be able to make yours.
I'm not making a monster.
Sure you're not.
Good luck.
If these hearts are as strong as you say, I won't need luck.
Oh, just magic.
No.
What I'm going to accomplish goes far beyond magic.
And yet you need a magical heart to do it.
So small-minded.
I need my powers to transcend the limitations of your magic.
This must be quite a land you hail from if you think your abilities are more powerful.
They are.
Care to wager?
I suspect someday you'll see it my way.
I doubt it.
Now may we go?
Careful, dearie.
Just remember, whatever it is you traffic in, it comes with a price.
(Whooshing)
We'll see.
(Door bells jingle)
(Door closes, bells jingle)
When they say I charge an arm and a leg, that's meant as a figure of speech.
Put it back.
You want me to reattach your arm?
Can you do it?
Of course.
But first, tell me why.
Because I want to use it again.
Obviously.
I meant why bring that stable boy back from the dead?
Why now?
I thought... (Groans)
I thought that if I helped her, she would return me to my world.
I want to see my brother, to try to bring him back again.
Again?
The first time ended badly.
I need to return and try it once more.
Well, it seems that's rather beyond her abilities.
My condolences.
Now my arm.
You said you can do it.
Oh, yes.
But there's a difference between "can" and "will."
Name your price.
Say it.
Say what?
You know what.
You came here, not the hospital.
So say it.
(Scoffs)
I need magic.
That's all I needed to hear.
Always a pleasure doing business with you, uh, Victor.
(Thunderclap)
(Thunder crashing)
Doctor.
You've returned.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Yes.
(Thunderclap)
Look at it.
It's remarkable, isn't it?
The final piece to the puzzle.
I believe so.
(Thunderclap)
Let's begin.
(Thunder crashing)
(Clank, electricity humming)
(Electricity crackles)
(Thunderclap)
(Clank)
(Crackling)
(Bubbling)
(Whirring)
(Electricity crackling)
(Thunder crashing)
It's alive.
You did it.
Victor, you did it.
Yes.
I believe I have.
Welcome back, brother.
(Whispers) It's magic, Dr. Frankenstein.
(Whispering) No.
Not magic.
Science.
Previously on "Once Upon A Time"...
Daniel's grave.
He died because of you.
I was very young, and your mother...
She ripped his heart out.
Henry, you're gonna go home with David.
I want you to be here because you want to be here, not because of magic.
I want to redeem myself.
Magic can set you free.
Let me guide you.
And I won't become like her?
That, dearie, is entirely up to you.
It's not safe here.
Cora's still out there.
We found a safe haven.
We must go there now.
Hello, Hook.
I don't know if I can do this.
I'm not a very good liar.
It's not really a lie, Aurora.
Lancelot did die an honorable death and Cora did escape.
All true.
Just leave the particulars to us.
There's no reason to cause unnecessary panic
- amongst your people.
- I'm not so sure it's unnecessary...
Wait.
The tower.
We always have sentries guarding the entrance.
Stay close.
My God.
This can't be.
Our land... we were protected here, hidden.
How did the ogres find us?
Ogres didn't do this.
What?
Cora did.
Their hearts... they were ripped out.
This was her magic... twisted and evil.
We have to stop her.
Too late.
She killed them.
She killed them all.
No, we have to stop her before she hurts anyone else.
Hey.
Hey.
Look.
There's someone under there.
- He's alive.
- Please.
It's okay.
Please help me.
It's okay.
You're safe now.
We won't hurt you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Once Upon A Time 2x05
- The Doctor Original air date October 28, 2012
Thank you very much for caring.
See you.
You.
We need to talk.
What the hell was that for?
Sleeping with my wife.
- Kathryn?
- Snow.
Look, I didn't know.
All right?
I was cursed.
Yeah, I got it.
What do you want?
So... is it true?
People are saying that you're trying to find a way to build a portal back to your land because that's where you think Emma and Mary Margaret are, that they're alive.
Well, the whispers can stop.
I have no secrets from this town.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
But the land... it's... it's gone, destroyed by the curse.
Apparently not.
Well, you're having any luck?
Not yet.
We're working on it.
Does that mean that all the lands still exist?
Possibly.
So the Queen lied to us.
Again.
Are you sure?
Remember who we're talking about.
Regina.
Are you here to see me?
I've been trying to keep my promise to Henry, but it's been difficult.
To not use magic.
It's been two days.
That's an excellent start.
Come on in.
It's just that magic is the way I've always gotten everything.
Sounds like it's also the way you've lost everything.
Regina, this is your chance to start over, to earn Henry.
Dr. Whale, this is highly inappropriate.
Send me back.
Excuse me?
To my land.
Send me back to my brother.
Why don't you check the "Missing" board like everyone else?
Your curse only brought the living.
Well, then I'm sorry for your loss.
But I'm afraid I can't send anyone anywhere.
Can't or won't?
Dr. Whale, I have to insist.
Please.
Go.
Sorry.
What you said isn't entirely true, is it?
I'm sorry?
About the curse only taking the living.
The grave of your father's here, right?
I don't care about Whale or his brother.
I brought who I wanted.
Anyone else?
If you want help, you have to try and trust me.
Stopping magic is a lot harder than starting.
Now show me what you've learned.
Immobilize it.
There.
I did it.
Excellent work, my apprentice.
Now there's just one last, tiny, tiny, teeny, little detail.
Take its heart.
Like what my mother did to...
To your true love.
Indeed.
Then you already know how it's done.
Gentle.
If you do it right, no harm will befall it, unless of course, you will it.
I can't.
It's innocent.
Nothing is innocent.
Now it belongs to me.
You see, when you take a heart, it becomes enchanted.
Stronger than a normal heart.
You're not hurting the beast.
You're controlling it.
Now show me you know what to do with that power.
Kill it.
What?
You've seen it done.
Now do it yourself.
Show me you can take the next step in your training.
Crush it.
Dearie, dearie, dearie.
And I had such high hopes.
And I didn't sign up to kill unicorns.
Magic is power.
Until you can take power, you're not learning anything.
Do you want me to teach you or not?
Yes.
Then there's one simple question for you to ponder.
I'll tell you anything.
I don't need the answer.
You do.
What's holding you back?
His name was Daniel.
I preserved his body with an enchantment spell.
He's dead, but frozen, and I've kept him in my family mausoleum.
Because you couldn't let go of him.
If you can't let go of the past, Regina, it's doomed to haunt you.
You know what?
I think this has been quite enough.
Regina, wait.
I...
I can help you.
I doubt it.
Daniel?
All right.
Come on.
What's with the yawn?
This isn't school.
It should be fun.
I couldn't sleep.
Hey.
I know.
I miss 'em, too.
Now just think how happy Emma and Snow will be when they come home to find that you've become a proper knight.
Say hello to your steed.
Is he mine?
This one's yours.
Really?
So... how do I get on him?
You're not riding today.
I'm not?
No.
There's much to learn before you hop in the saddle.
Like what?
Well, every morning, you'll have to muck out his stall.
Then you'll brush him and feed him.
After school, you'll do it again.
Every day, twice a day.
That's not riding.
That's babysitting.
Horsesitting.
It builds an essential bond... the trust between knight and steed.
Okay.
But when will I ride him?
When the horse tells you.
I'm gonna go check in on the dwarves, see how the mining's coming.
I'll pick you up later.
So... anything you wanna tell me?
Are you ready to begin?
I've been ready.
The question is, are you?
Yes, I am.
Tell me why you're really here.
For power...
Stop wasting my time!
What is it you want?
Come on.
You've done all your soul-searching.
Now tell me.
Can you teach me how to use magic to bring back the dead?
That's what this is about?
The stable boy?
I want true happiness.
Then find it elsewhere, dearie.
Magic can do much, but not that.
Dead is dead.
Then I am lost.
And I've had my time wasted.
I'm sorry, but, transcending death is beyond even my reach.
I thought nothing was beyond your reach.
- Busy.
Should I...
- No.
No.
Nothing important going on here.
Rumplestiltskin...
Ignore her.
I got what you wanted.
What about the slippers?
Couldn't find 'em.
Heard talk they've already been moved to another land.
That's what I needed to get to that other land.
Well, come with me in my hat.
I'm sure we can work something out.
No, no.
Your hat only transports between magical realms.
I need to get to a land without magic.
Why would anyone want that?
My business.
You want the ball or not?
yes.
Help yourself to as much gold as you deem appropriate.
And, you.
You can let yourself out.
Our work is done.
Wait.
So that's it?
You're not going to teach me anymore?
So long as you harbor foolish notions of bringing back the dead, so long as you live in the past, you'll never find your future.
Teaching you is a waste of time.
Pardon me... for eavesdropping, but I think you need to look elsewhere for assistance.
What do you know about it?
I hear things.
Jefferson's the name, and I'm a man who travels and sees much, and I know the man who can do what you want... bring back the dead.
He's, you might say... a wizard.
I can bring him to you.
At what price?
Always a price indeed.
So here's mine.
Like I said, I'm a man of travels, and I've made many enemies along the way, and I'd like a royal passport so I can have free reign to traverse your kingdom.
How would I do that?
Well, you're the queen... aren't you?
That's right.
I am.
And this wizard... can he really bring someone back from the dead?
Well...
If he can't, no one can.
Have you seen him before?
Yes, I've seen him around.
He's a blacksmith.
Came to our camp a couple months ago.
Said he lost his hand in an ogre attack.
Why would Cora leave a survivor?
It's messy.
Doesn't make sense.
You think he's lying?
I think Cora's tricked us before.
I don't want that to happen again.
Here you go.
I can't thank you enough for your kindness.
Fortune, it seems, has seen fit to show me favor.
An island full of corpses.
You're the only one to escape.
How exactly did that happen?
She attacked at night, slaughtered everyone in one fell swoop.
When she started ripping out people's hearts,
I hid under the bodies of those who had already been killed.
Pretended to be dead myself.
Mercifully, the ruse worked.
So much for fortune favoring the brave.
It was all I could do to survive.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I'm pretty good at knowing when someone is lying to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
We should leave here in case Cora decides to come back.
We should start searching for a new portal back to Storybrooke.
I only got about five minutes with my husband.
Not to mention, my grandson.
You have a grandson?
Long story.
Well, I know this land well.
I can guide you.
You're not gonna guide us anywhere until you tell us who you really are.
Dr. Whale?
Where are you?
Where is he... this wizard?
You promised to bring him to me.
Indeed, and off we shall go to see him, but I warn you, be cautious.
Why?
Is he dangerous?
Not to us.
But bear in mind, he's never been to a world like this before.
He's unfamiliar with our ways, with our magic.
All I care about are his ways, and if they will do what I require.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
May I present to you... your salvation?
You're the wizard?
I prefer "doctor,"
but you're welcome to call me whatever makes you comfortable.
Very well... doctor.
You understand why you've been brought here?
Of course.
Now... show me the patient.
It's remarkable.
It's as if his last breath was drawn just moments ago.
A preservation spell.
Can you bring him back?
Perhaps.
Let's take a look.
It's wonderful.
His condition is ideal... apart from being dead, that is.
Just how many times have you done this, doctor?
You didn't tell her?
Tell... tell me?
Tell me what?
The procedure is experimental.
Success is yet to occur.
But if certain conditions are met, I'm optimistic.
Optimistic?
Just hear him out.
What kind of charlatan are you?
I am no such thing.
I was told the last crucial piece of the puzzle exists in this land.
What else do you need?
A heart.
It's a fragile organ, and I need a strong one.
I've searched the far reaches of my realm for one with the fortitude to stand the shock of my procedure.
None have survived.
But they say in your land, there are hearts transformed by magic.
Hearts made so powerful, they glow.
That's why you've come here?
I need this for my work.
So tell me... how do you change these hearts?
How do you enchant them?
Those who practice the dark arts do it by ripping the organ out of the living while it still beats.
And you can do this?
No.
You assured me that this queen was some powerful sorceress.
I will not use magic for evil.
Well, if you want your fiance back, then you're gonna have to find someone who will.
Have I wasted my time here?
No.
I know exactly who can help us.
I know where to get a heart.
Dr. Whale?
Whale.
Whale.
I know you took Daniel's body, and you took one of my hearts.
Why?
Did you bring him back?
I did it.
He's alive.
Yes.
I brought him back, but... he's not Daniel.
What?
He's... he's a monster.
This... was my mother's.
How sweet, but I'm not interested in heirlooms.
I believe you will be.
Listen.
To a fireplace?
Just listen.
Where is that coming from?
Her vault.
Take your pick.
These are all... hearts?
My mother was a collector.
Whose hearts are these?
I have no idea.
She took so many, caused so much pain.
It was impossible to keep track.
She was a monster.
Finally.
After all this time.
It's perfect.
What's going on?
I just got a call that Dr. Whale was attacked.
You'll have to ask his doctors.
No.
I am asking you.
I came here to speak with him and discovered he was hurt.
- It's the truth.
- What else?
What did you come here to speak with him about?
Someone from my past.
I believe he's come back.
Daniel.
His name is Daniel.
The man you were supposed to marry.
Snow told me what happened, and... how it was her fault that he died.
Yes.
He did.
Well, then how could he be back?
Whale.
He believed he could bring him back from the grave, and...
I don't know how... but he has.
You don't know how?
Guess.
He practices something more powerful than magic... or so I was told.
All he needed was a heart, and he took one of mine.
You have hearts here?
In my vault.
From our land.
Whose heart did he take?
I have no idea.
I took so many.
It was impossible to keep track.
I need to go.
I have to help him.
No.
Where is he?
Look what he did.
He's dangerous.
Not to me.
He won't hurt anyone else, David, I promise.
You know I can't take that chance.
You have two choices, Regina... tell me where he is, or jail.
I think it's like when...
you awoke from your coma.
He's following his final thoughts to where he last met me... the stables.
No.
Henry.
Henry's at the stables.
Gramps says that you'll tell me when I'm ready to ride you.
So... anytime.
Like, soon?
I already told you.
I'm just a blacksmith.
Sure you are.
You don't want to talk to us?
Maybe you'll talk to the ogres while they rip you limb from limb.
- Come on.
- What?
You... you can't just leave me here like this!
What if he's telling the truth?
He's not.
Good for you!
You bested me.
I can count the amount of people who've done that on one hand.
That supposed to be funny?
Who are you?
Killian Jones, but most people have taken to call me by my more colorful moniker...
Hook.
Hook.
Check my satchel.
As in Captain Hook?
So you've heard of me.
You better hurry up.
They're getting closer.
So unless you wanna be dinner, you better start talking.
Cora wanted me to gain your trust so I could learn everything there is to know about your Storybrooke.
She didn't want any surprises when she finally got over there.
She can't get there.
We destroyed the wardrobe.
But the enchantment remains.
Cora gathered the ashes.
She's gonna use them to open up a portal.
Now if you'll kindly cut me loose.
No.
We should leave him here to die to pay for all the lives that he took.
That was Cora, not me.
Let's go.
Wait.
Wait!
You need me alive.
Why?
Because we both want the same thing... to get back to your land.
You would say anything to save yourself.
Why are we supposed to believe you now?
I arranged for transport with Cora, but seeing how resourceful you are,
I'll offer you the same deal...
I'll help you if you promise to take me along.
How are you going to help us get home?
The ashes will open a portal, but to find your land, she needs more.
There's an enchanted compass.
Cora seeks it.
I'll help you obtain it before she does.
So Cora won't make it to Storybrooke, and we'll be one step closer to getting home.
Sounds too good to be true.
There's only one way to find out.
You tell me one thing... and whatever you say, I better believe it... why does Captain Hook want to go to Storybrooke?
To exact revenge on the man who took my hand...
Rumplestiltskin.
You... you gotta stop.
You're...
you're scaring the horses.
Are... are... are you hurt?
Can I help you?
Let me help you.
Daniel!
Let him go!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Go.
Go!
It's true.
You're really here.
It won't hold for long.
Can you cast a spell to subdue him?
No.
I won't use magic on him.
What do you think you're doing?
He's a monster, Regina!
If you won't put him down, I will!
David, please!
Just let me talk to him.
It's too big of a risk.
There's no telling what he'll do.
- You have to at least give me a chance!
- Out of the way, Regina!
Now!
No!
I won't let you hurt him!
He'll listen to me!
Please!
Let me talk to my fiance.
The heart, your majesty.
Thank you.
Now please, wait here.
The procedure is one I must perform alone.
What's he doing back there?
Magic?
He says he wields power greater than magic.
Really?
Why won't he let us see?
In his land, there's much we don't understand, or can't.
If he can't achieve what you seek,
Rumplestiltskin was right.
It can't be done.
Well?
I'm sorry.
I failed.
The heart wasn't strong enough.
It couldn't withstand the procedure.
Daniel.
Stop.
It's me.
I love you.
Regina.
Daniel.
I can't believe it's really you.
Daniel?
Stop.
Just stop the pain.
How?
Just... let me go.
No.
No, I won't lose you again.
Without you, I'm lost.
Daniel.
Daniel, come back to me.
Can't.
Can't.
But I love you.
Then love again.
Good-bye, Daniel.
Up ahead.
We'll find the compass just over the ridge.
Do you get the feeling he's leading us exactly where Cora wants us, that this whole thing's a trap?
It's definitely a trap.
As long as we know they're trying to play us, we can...
Stay one step ahead of them.
Exactly.
Let me guess.
The compass is up there?
Yeah.
So how do we... get to it?
It's not the climb you need to worry about.
It's the giant at the top.
Who's this?
Your replacement, of course.
I needed someone more dedicated.
Dedicated?
Now... where were we?
You're back.
I used magic.
Why don't you come in and tell me what happened?
Enough.
I need to be taken home.
Now I have work to do, and I believe our deal is done.
The deal isn't done until he says it's done.
Now, now.
Patience, please.
Our transaction is, nearly complete.
And are you satisfied with the results?
She did seem rather... heartbroken.
She is.
- She bought my failure.
- You should've seen her tears.
I've seen the aftermath.
Impressive.
Now... my property.
Yeah, here it is.
You'll excuse me if I check.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
The pleasure was mine.
Thanks to your efforts, I've made my monster.
Now I do hope you'll be able to make yours.
I'm not making a monster.
Sure you're not.
Good luck.
If these hearts are as strong as you say, I won't need luck.
Just magic.
No.
What I'm going to accomplish goes far beyond magic.
And yet you need a magical heart to do it.
So small-minded.
I need my powers to transcend the limitations of your magic.
This must be quite a land you hail from if you think your abilities are more powerful.
They are.
Care to wager?
I suspect someday you'll see it my way.
I doubt it.
Now may we go?
Careful, dearie.
Just remember, whatever it is you traffic in, it comes with a price.
We'll see.
When they say I charge an arm and a leg, that's meant as a figure of speech.
Put it back.
You want me to reattach your arm?
Can you do it?
Of course.
But first, tell me why.
Because I want to use it again.
Obviously.
I meant why bring that stable boy back from the dead?
Why now?
I thought...
I thought that if I helped her, she would return me to my world.
I want to see my brother, to try to bring him back again.
Again?
The first time ended badly.
I need to return and try it once more.
Well, it seems that's rather beyond her abilities.
My condolences.
Now my arm.
You said you can do it.
Yes.
But there's a difference between "can" and "will."
Name your price.
Say it.
Say what?
You know what.
You came here, not the hospital.
So say it.
I need magic.
That's all I needed to hear.
Always a pleasure doing business with you, Victor.
Doctor.
You've returned.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Yes.
Look at it.
It's remarkable, isn't it?
The final piece to the puzzle.
I believe so.
Let's begin.
It's alive.
You did it.
Victor, you did it.
Yes.
I believe I have.
Welcome back, brother.
It's magic, Dr. Frankenstein.
No.
Not magic.
Science.
Previously on "Once Upon A Time"... (Regina) Daniel's grave.
He died because of you.
(Snow) I was very young, and your mother... (Squish) She ripped his heart out.
Henry, you're gonna go home with David.
I want you to be here because you want to be here, not because of magic.
(Whispers) I want to redeem myself.
Magic can set you free.
Let me guide you.
And I won't become like her?
That, dearie, is entirely up to you.
It's not safe here.
Cora's still out there.
We found a safe haven.
We must go there now.
Hello, Hook.
(Aurora) I don't know if I can do this.
I'm not a very good liar.
(Snow) Oh, it's not really a lie, Aurora.
Lancelot did die an honorable death and Cora did escape.
All true.
Just leave the particulars to us.
There's no reason to cause unnecessary panic
- amongst your people.
- I'm not so sure it's unnecessary...
Wait.
The tower.
We always have sentries guarding the entrance.
(Blade zings)
Stay close.
Oh, my God.
(Mulan) This can't be.
Our land... we were protected here, hidden.
How did the ogres find us?
Ogres didn't do this.
What?
Cora did.
Their hearts... they were ripped out.
This was her magic... twisted and evil.
We have to stop her.
Too late.
She killed them.
She killed them all.
No, we have to stop her before she hurts anyone else.
Hey.
Hey.
Look.
There's someone under there.
- He's alive.
(Man)
- Please.
It's okay.
Please help me.
It's okay.
You're safe now.
We won't hurt you.
Thank you.
(Panting) Thank you.
(Panting)
Once Upon A Time 2x05
- The Doctor Original air date October 28, 2012
(indistinct conversations)
Thank you very much for caring.
See you.
(Exhales deeply)
You.
We need to talk.
Oh!
(Sighs) What the hell was that for?
Sleeping with my wife.
- Kathryn?
- Snow.
Look, I didn't know.
All right?
I was cursed.
Yeah, I got it.
What do you want?
(Sighs)
So... is it true?
People are saying that you're trying to find a way to build a portal back to your land because that's where you think Emma and Mary Margaret are, that they're alive.
Well, the whispers can stop.
I have no secrets from this town.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
But the land... it's... it's gone, destroyed by the curse.
Apparently not.
Well, you're having any luck?
Not yet.
We're working on it.
Does that mean that all the lands still exist?
Possibly.
So the Queen lied to us.
Again.
Are you sure?
Remember who we're talking about.
Regina.
Are you here to see me?
I've been trying to keep my promise to Henry, but it's been difficult.
To not use magic.
It's been two days.
That's an excellent start.
Come on in.
It's just that magic is the way I've always gotten everything.
Sounds like it's also the way you've lost everything.
Regina, this is your chance to start over, to earn Henry.
(Door opens)
Dr. Whale, this is highly inappropriate.
Send me back.
Excuse me?
To my land.
Send me back to my brother.
Why don't you check the "Missing" board like everyone else?
Your curse only brought the living.
Well, then I'm sorry for your loss.
But I'm afraid I can't send anyone anywhere.
Can't or won't?
Dr. Whale, I have to insist.
Please.
Go.
Sorry.
What you said isn't entirely true, is it?
I'm sorry?
About the curse only taking the living.
The grave of your father's here, right?
I don't care about Whale or his brother.
I brought who I wanted.
Anyone else?
(Sighs)
If you want help, you have to try and trust me.
Stopping magic is a lot harder than starting.
(Whinnies)
(Rumplestiltskin) Now show me what you've learned.
Immobilize it.
(Whinnies)
(Whoosh)
(Giggles)
There.
I did it.
Excellent work, my apprentice.
Now there's just one last, tiny, tiny, teeny, little detail.
Take its heart.
Like what my mother did to...
Oh, to your true love.
Indeed.
Then you already know how it's done.
Gentle.
If you do it right, no harm will befall it, unless of course, you will it.
(Breathing heavily)
I can't.
It's innocent.
Nothing is innocent.
(Squish)
(Giggles)
(Snorts) (Heart beating rhythmically)
(Sighs)
Now it belongs to me.
You see, when you take a heart, it becomes enchanted.
Stronger than a normal heart.
You're not hurting the beast.
You're controlling it.
Now show me you know what to do with that power.
Kill it.
What?
You've seen it done.
Now do it yourself.
Show me you can take the next step in your training.
Crush it.
(Heart continues beating)
(Heart crackles)
(Groans)
(Exhales)
Dearie, dearie, dearie.
(Blusters)
And I had such high hopes.
And I didn't sign up to kill unicorns.
Magic is power.
Until you can take power, you're not learning anything.
Do you want me to teach you or not?
Yes.
Then there's one simple question for you to ponder.
I'll tell you anything.
(Giggles) I don't need the answer.
You do.
What's holding you back?
(Gasps)
(Sniffles)
His name was Daniel.
I preserved his body with an enchantment spell.
He's dead, but frozen, and I've kept him in my family mausoleum.
Because you couldn't let go of him.
(Sighs) If you can't let go of the past, Regina, it's doomed to haunt you.
(Sniffles)
(Sighs) You know what?
I think this has been quite enough.
Regina, wait.
I...
I can help you.
I doubt it.
(Thunderclaps)
(Horn blares)
(Gasps)
(Thunderclap)
Daniel?
(Thunderclap)
All right.
(Yawns)
(Laughs) Come on.
What's with the yawn?
(Blusters) This isn't school.
It should be fun.
I couldn't sleep.
(Sighs deeply)
Hey.
I know.
I miss 'em, too.
(Horse blusters)
Now just think how happy Emma and Snow will be when they come home to find that you've become a proper knight.
(Horse blusters)
Say hello to your steed.
Is he mine?
(Clicks tongue) (Nickers)
This one's yours.
Really?
(Nickers)
So... how do I get on him?
Oh, you're not riding today.
- I'm not?
- No.
There's much to learn before you hop in the saddle.
Like what?
Well, every morning, you'll have to muck out his stall.
Then you'll brush him and feed him.
After school, you'll do it again.
Every day, twice a day.
(Nickers)
That's not riding.
That's babysitting.
Ah.
Horsesitting.
It builds an essential bond... the trust between knight and steed.
Okay.
But when will I ride him?
When the horse tells you.
(Horse whinnies in distance)
I'm gonna go check in on the dwarves, see how the mining's coming.
I'll pick you up later.
So...
(Nickers) anything you wanna tell me?
(Nickers)
(Birds chirping)
(Crow caws)
(Doors squeak) (Gasps)
(Clears throat)
Are you ready to begin?
Oh, I've been ready.
The question is, are you?
Yes, I am.
(Wheel creaks)
Tell me why you're really here.
For power...
Stop wasting my time!
What is it you want?
Come on.
You've done all your soul-searching.
Now tell me.
Can you teach me how to use magic to bring back the dead?
That's what this is about?
The stable boy?
I want true happiness.
Then find it elsewhere, dearie.
Magic can do much, but not that.
Dead is dead.
(Sighs)
Then I am lost.
And I've had my time wasted.
I'm sorry, but, uh, transcending death is beyond even my reach.
I thought nothing was beyond your reach.
Ah.
- Busy.
Should I...
- No.
No.
Nothing important going on here.
Rumplestiltskin...
Ignore her.
I got what you wanted.
What about the slippers?
Oh.
Couldn't find 'em.
Heard talk they've already been moved to another land.
That's what I needed to get to that other land.
(Bottles clatter)
Well, come with me in my hat.
I'm sure we can work something out.
No, no.
Your hat only transports between magical realms.
I need to get to a land without magic.
Why would anyone want that?
My business.
You want the ball or not?
Mm... yes.
Help yourself to as much gold as you deem appropriate.
(Clears throat)
Oh, and, you.
You can let yourself out.
Our work is done.
Wait.
So that's it?
You're not going to teach me anymore?
So long as you harbor foolish notions of bringing back the dead, so long as you live in the past, you'll never find your future.
Teaching you is a waste of time.
Pardon me...
(Gasps) for eavesdropping, but I think you need to look elsewhere for assistance.
What do you know about it?
I hear things.
Jefferson's the name, and I'm a man who travels and sees much, and I know the man who can do what you want... bring back the dead.
He's, um, you might say... a wizard.
I can bring him to you.
At what price?
Always a price indeed.
So here's mine.
Like I said, I'm a man of travels, and I've made many enemies along the way, and I'd like a royal passport so I can have free reign to traverse your kingdom.
How would I do that?
(Inhales deeply and clicks tongue)
Well, you're the queen... aren't you?
That's right.
I am.
And this wizard... (Sniffles) can he really bring someone back from the dead?
Well...
If he can't, no one can.
(Emma) Have you seen him before?
Yes, I've seen him around.
He's a blacksmith.
Came to our camp a couple months ago.
Said he lost his hand in an ogre attack.
Why would Cora leave a survivor?
It's messy.
Doesn't make sense.
You think he's lying?
I think Cora's tricked us before.
I don't want that to happen again.
Here you go.
I can't thank you enough for your kindness.
Fortune, it seems, has seen fit to show me favor.
An island full of corpses.
You're the only one to escape.
How exactly did that happen?
She attacked at night, slaughtered everyone in one fell swoop.
When she started ripping out people's hearts,
I hid under the bodies of those who had already been killed.
Pretended to be dead myself.
Mercifully, the ruse worked.
So much for fortune favoring the brave.
It was all I could do to survive.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I'm pretty good at knowing when someone is lying to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
We should leave here in case Cora decides to come back.
We should start searching for a new portal back to Storybrooke.
I only got about five minutes with my husband.
Not to mention, my grandson.
You have a grandson?
Long story.
Well, I know this land well.
I can guide you.
(Blade zings) You're not gonna guide us anywhere until you tell us who you really are.
(Pants)
(Door squeaks)
(Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A. in distance)
(Door creaks) Dr. Whale?
Where are you?
Where is he... this wizard?
You promised to bring him to me.
Indeed, and off we shall go to see him, but I warn you, be cautious.
Why?
Is he dangerous?
Not to us.
But bear in mind, he's never been to a world like this before.
He's unfamiliar with our ways, with our magic.
All I care about are his ways, and if they will do what I require.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
May I present to you... your salvation?
You're the wizard?
(Clears throat)
I prefer "doctor,"
but you're welcome to call me whatever makes you comfortable.
Very well... doctor.
You understand why you've been brought here?
Of course.
Now...
(Clears throat) show me the patient.
It's remarkable.
It's as if his last breath was drawn just moments ago.
A preservation spell.
Can you bring him back?
Perhaps.
Let's take a look.
It's wonderful.
His condition is ideal... apart from being dead, that is.
Just how many times have you done this, doctor?
You didn't tell her?
Tell... tell me?
Tell me what?
The procedure is experimental.
Success is yet to occur.
But if certain conditions are met, I'm optimistic.
Optimistic?
Just hear him out.
What kind of charlatan are you?
I am no such thing.
I was told the last crucial piece of the puzzle exists in this land.
What else do you need?
A heart.
It's a fragile organ, and I need a strong one.
I've searched the far reaches of my realm for one with the fortitude to stand the shock of my procedure.
None have survived.
But they say in your land, there are hearts transformed by magic.
Hearts made so powerful, they glow.
That's why you've come here?
I need this for my work.
So tell me... how do you change these hearts?
How do you enchant them?
Those who practice the dark arts do it by ripping the organ out of the living while it still beats.
Mm-hmm.
And you can do this?
- No.
- Huh.
You assured me that this queen was some powerful sorceress.
I will not use magic for evil.
Well, if you want your fiance back, then you're gonna have to find someone who will.
Have I wasted my time here?
No.
I know exactly who can help us.
I know where to get a heart.
Dr. Whale?
(Electricity crackling)
(Gasps)
(Clatter) Oh!
(Lights creaking)
Oh.
(Grunts) Whale.
Whale.
(Grunts)
I know you took Daniel's body, and you took one of my hearts.
Why?
Did you bring him back?
I did it.
He's alive.
Yes.
I brought him back, but... he's not Daniel.
What?
He's... he's a monster.
(Crickets chirping) This... was my mother's.
How sweet, but I'm not interested in heirlooms.
Oh, I believe you will be.
Listen.
(Fire crackling)
To a fireplace?
Just listen.
(Heart beating faintly)
Where is that coming from?
Her vault.
(Whoosh)
(Multiple hearts beating rhythmically)
Take your pick.
These are all... hearts?
My mother was a collector.
Whose hearts are these?
I have no idea.
She took so many, caused so much pain.
It was impossible to keep track.
She was a monster.
(Box scraping)
(Hearts continue beating)
Finally.
After all this time.
(Gasps)
It's perfect.
(Monitor beeping steadily)
(Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.)
What's going on?
I just got a call that Dr. Whale was attacked.
You'll have to ask his doctors.
No.
I am asking you.
I came here to speak with him and discovered he was hurt.
- It's the truth.
- What else?
What did you come here to speak with him about?
Someone from my past.
I believe he's come back.
Daniel.
His name is Daniel.
The man you were supposed to marry.
Snow told me what happened, and... how it was her fault that he died.
Yes.
He did.
(Exhales) Well, then how could he be back?
Whale.
He believed he could bring him back from the grave, and...
I don't know how... (Whispers) but he has.
You don't know how?
Guess.
He practices something more powerful than magic... or so I was told.
All he needed was a heart, and he took one of mine.
You have hearts here?
In my vault.
From our land.
Whose heart did he take?
I have no idea.
I took so many.
It was impossible to keep track.
I need to go.
I have to help him.
No.
Where is he?
Look what he did.
He's dangerous.
Not to me.
He won't hurt anyone else, David, I promise.
You know I can't take that chance.
You have two choices, Regina... tell me where he is, or jail.
I think it's like when...
you awoke from your coma.
He's following his final thoughts to where he last met me... the stables.
No.
Henry.
Henry's at the stables.
Gramps says that you'll tell me when I'm ready to ride you.
So... anytime.
Like, soon?
(Nickers)
(Whinnies)
(Horses whinnying)
(Whinnying)
Aah!
(Horses whinnying)
I already told you.
I'm just a blacksmith.
Sure you are.
(Whistles)
(Growling in distance) You don't want to talk to us?
Maybe you'll talk to the ogres while they rip you limb from limb.
(Ogres growling)
- Come on.
- What?
You... you can't just leave me here like this!
What if he's telling the truth?
He's not.
Good for you!
(Chuckles)
You bested me.
I can count the amount of people who've done that on one hand.
That supposed to be funny?
Who are you?
Killian Jones, but most people have taken to call me by my more colorful moniker...
Hook.
Hook.
Check my satchel.
As in Captain Hook?
Ah, so you've heard of me.
(Clink) (Ogres growling)
You better hurry up.
They're getting closer.
So unless you wanna be dinner, you better start talking.
(Chuckles)
Cora wanted me to gain your trust so I could learn everything there is to know about your Storybrooke.
She didn't want any surprises when she finally got over there.
She can't get there.
We destroyed the wardrobe.
Ah, but the enchantment remains.
Cora gathered the ashes.
She's gonna use them to open up a portal.
(Growling grows louder, thrashing)
Now if you'll kindly cut me loose.
No.
We should leave him here to die to pay for all the lives that he took.
That was Cora, not me.
Let's go.
Wait.
Wait!
(Ogres continue growling)
You need me alive.
Why?
Because we both want the same thing... to get back to your land.
You would say anything to save yourself.
Why are we supposed to believe you now?
I arranged for transport with Cora, but seeing how resourceful you are,
I'll offer you the same deal...
I'll help you if you promise to take me along.
How are you going to help us get home?
The ashes will open a portal, but to find your land, she needs more.
There's an enchanted compass.
Cora seeks it.
I'll help you obtain it before she does.
So Cora won't make it to Storybrooke, and we'll be one step closer to getting home.
Sounds too good to be true.
There's only one way to find out.
(Ogres roaring)
You tell me one thing... and whatever you say, I better believe it... why does Captain Hook want to go to Storybrooke?
(Screech in distance)
To exact revenge on the man who took my hand...
Rumplestiltskin.
(Ogres growling)
(Horses whinnying)
You... you gotta stop.
You're...
you're scaring the horses.
(Whinnying continues)
Are... are... are you hurt?
Can I help you?
(Horse whinnies)
(Heart beating rhythmically)
Let me help you.
(Grunts)
(Horse whinnying) (Grunting)
(Regina) Daniel!
Let him go!
(Thud)
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Go.
Go!
It's true.
You're really here.
(Grunts) (Grunts)
(Latch clicks)
It won't hold for long.
Can you cast a spell to subdue him?
No.
I won't use magic on him.
What do you think you're doing?
(Safety clicks)
He's a monster, Regina!
If you won't put him down, I will!
David, please!
Just let me talk to him.
It's too big of a risk.
There's no telling what he'll do.
- You have to at least give me a chance!
- Out of the way, Regina!
Now!
No!
I won't let you hurt him!
He'll listen to me!
Please!
Let me talk to my fiance.
(Wind whistling)
(Thunderclap)
The heart, your majesty.
(Thunderclap)
Thank you.
Now please, wait here.
The procedure is one I must perform alone.
(Thunderclap)
What's he doing back there?
Magic?
He says he wields power greater than magic.
Really?
(Thunderclap)
Why won't he let us see?
In his land, there's much we don't understand, or can't.
If he can't achieve what you seek,
Rumplestiltskin was right.
It can't be done.
(Thunder crashing)
(Heart beating rhythmically)
(Thunder rumbling)
Well?
I'm sorry.
I failed.
The heart wasn't strong enough.
It couldn't withstand the procedure.
(Crying)
(Thunderclap)
(Gasps)
(Grunts)
(Choking) Daniel.
Stop.
(Grunting)
It's me.
(Whispers) I love you.
(Inhales deeply)
(Gasping and coughing)
(Whispers) Regina.
Daniel.
Oh.
(Exhales)
(Inhales deeply) I can't believe it's really you.
Oh!
Daniel?
(Moaning)
Stop.
Just stop the pain.
How?
Just... let me go.
No.
No, I won't lose you again.
(Crying) Without you, I'm lost.
(Groans)
Daniel.
Daniel, come back to me.
(Weakly) Can't.
Can't.
(Whispers) But I love you.
Then love again.
(Groans)
Oh.
(Sniffles)
(Whoosh)
(Sobs)
(Crying)
Good-bye, Daniel.
Up ahead.
We'll find the compass just over the ridge.
(Snow) Do you get the feeling he's leading us exactly where Cora wants us, that this whole thing's a trap?
It's definitely a trap.
As long as we know they're trying to play us, we can...
Stay one step ahead of them.
Exactly.
Let me guess.
The compass is up there?
Oh, yeah.
(Emma) So how do we... get to it?
It's not the climb you need to worry about.
It's the giant at the top.
(Engine idles)
(Birds chirping)
Who's this?
Ah, your replacement, of course.
I needed someone more dedicated.
Dedicated?
(Squish)
(Heart crackles)
(Thud)
(Giggles)
Now... where were we?
You're back.
(Whispers) I used magic.
Why don't you come in and tell me what happened?
(Sniffles)
(Birds chirping)
Enough.
I need to be taken home.
Now I have work to do, and I believe our deal is done.
The deal isn't done until he says it's done.
Now, now.
Patience, please.
Our transaction is, uh, nearly complete.
And are you satisfied with the results?
She did seem rather... heartbroken.
She is.
(Clears throat)
- She bought my failure.
- You should've seen her tears.
I've seen the aftermath.
Impressive.
Now... my property.
Yeah, here it is.
You'll excuse me if I check.
(Beating rhythmically)
(Lock clicks)
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, the pleasure was mine.
Thanks to your efforts, I've made my monster.
Now I do hope you'll be able to make yours.
I'm not making a monster.
Sure you're not.
Good luck.
If these hearts are as strong as you say, I won't need luck.
Oh, just magic.
No.
What I'm going to accomplish goes far beyond magic.
And yet you need a magical heart to do it.
So small-minded.
I need my powers to transcend the limitations of your magic.
This must be quite a land you hail from if you think your abilities are more powerful.
They are.
Care to wager?
I suspect someday you'll see it my way.
I doubt it.
Now may we go?
Careful, dearie.
Just remember, whatever it is you traffic in, it comes with a price.
(Whooshing)
We'll see.
(Door bells jingle)
(Door closes, bells jingle)
When they say I charge an arm and a leg, that's meant as a figure of speech.
Put it back.
You want me to reattach your arm?
Can you do it?
Of course.
But first, tell me why.
Because I want to use it again.
Obviously.
I meant why bring that stable boy back from the dead?
Why now?
I thought... (Groans)
I thought that if I helped her, she would return me to my world.
I want to see my brother, to try to bring him back again.
Again?
The first time ended badly.
I need to return and try it once more.
Well, it seems that's rather beyond her abilities.
My condolences.
Now my arm.
You said you can do it.
Oh, yes.
But there's a difference between "can" and "will."
Name your price.
Say it.
Say what?
You know what.
You came here, not the hospital.
So say it.
(Scoffs)
I need magic.
That's all I needed to hear.
Always a pleasure doing business with you, uh, Victor.
(Thunderclap)
(Thunder crashing)
Doctor.
You've returned.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Yes.
(Thunderclap)
Look at it.
It's remarkable, isn't it?
The final piece to the puzzle.
I believe so.
(Thunderclap)
Let's begin.
(Thunder crashing)
(Clank, electricity humming)
(Electricity crackles)
(Thunderclap)
(Clank)
(Crackling)
(Bubbling)
(Whirring)
(Electricity crackling)
(Thunder crashing)
It's alive.
You did it.
Victor, you did it.
Yes.
I believe I have.
Welcome back, brother.
(Whispers) It's magic, Dr. Frankenstein.
(Whispering) No.
Not magic.
Science.
NARRATOR:
Previously on Once Upon A Time...
Daniel's grave.
REGINA:
He died because of you.
SNOW WHITE:
I was very young, and your mother...
REGINA:
She ripped his heart out.
REGINA:
Henry, you're gonna go home with David.
I want you to be here because you want to be here.
Not because of magic.
I want to redeem myself.
Magic can set you free.
Let me guide you.
And I won't become like her?
That, dearie, is entirely up to you.
It's not safe here.
Cora's still out there.
We found a safe haven.
We must go there now.
Hello, Hook.
AURORA:
I don't know if I can do this.
I'm not a very good liar.
SNOW WHITE:
It's not really a lie, Aurora.
Lancelot did die an honorable death and Cora did escape.
All true.
Just leave the particulars to us.
There's no reason to cause unnecessary panic amongst your people.
AURORA:
I'm not so sure it's unnecessary...
Wait.
The tower.
We always have sentries guarding the entrance.
(DRAWS BLADE)
Stay close.
SNOW WHITE:
Oh, my God.
MULAN:
This can't be.
Our land, we were protected here, hidden.
How did the Ogres find us?
- Ogres didn't do this.
- What?
Cora did.
Their hearts, they were ripped out.
This is her magic, twisted and evil.
We have to stop her.
We're too late.
She killed them.
She killed them all.
But we have to stop her before she hurts anyone else.
Hey.
Hey.
Look.
There's someone under there!
He's alive.
- MAN:
Please.
- It's okay.
Please help me.
It's okay.
You're safe now.
We won't hurt you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
DAVID:
That's great.
I really appreciate it.
MAN:
Thank you very much.
All right.
See you.
You.
We need to talk.
Oh!
What the hell was that for?
Sleeping with my wife.
- Kathryn?
- Snow.
Look, I didn't know, all right?
I was cursed.
Yeah.
I got it.
What do you want?
(SIGHS)
So...is it true?
People are saying that you're trying to find a way to build a portal back to your land because that's where you think Emma and Mary Margaret are, that they're alive.
Well, the whispers can stop.
I have no secrets from this town.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
But the land, it's gone.
Destroyed by the curse.
Apparently not.
Well, you having any luck?
Not yet.
We're working on it.
Does that mean that all the lands still exist?
Possibly.
So the Queen lied to us, again.
Are you sure?
Remember who we're talking about.
ARCHIE:
Regina.
Are you here to see me?
I've been trying to keep my promise to Henry, but it's been difficult.
To not use magic.
It's been two days.
That's an excellent start.
Come on in.
It's just that magic is the way I've always gotten everything.
It sounds like it's also the way you've lost everything.
Regina, this is your chance to start over, to earn Henry.
(DOOR OPENS)
Dr. Whale, this is highly inappropriate.
Send me back.
Excuse me?
To my land.
Send me back to my brother.
Why don't you check the missing board, like everyone else?
Your curse only brought the living.
Well, then, I'm sorry for your loss.
But I'm afraid I can't send anyone anywhere.
Can't or won't?
Dr. Whale, I have to insist, please.
Go.
Sorry.
What you said isn't entirely true, is it?
I'm sorry?
About the curse only taking the living.
The grave of your father's here, right?
I don't care about Whale or his brother.
I brought who I wanted.
Anyone else?
(SIGHS)
If you want help, you have to try and trust me.
Stopping magic is a lot harder than starting.
(WHINNIES)
RUMPLESTILTSKIN:
Now, show me what you've learned.
Immobilize it.
(WHINNIES)
(WHOOSH)
(GIGGLES)
REGINA: (LAUGHING) There, I did it.
Excellent work, my apprentice.
Now there's just one last, tiny, tiny, teeny little detail.
Take its heart.
Like what my mother did to...
Oh, to your true love.
Indeed.
Then you already know how it's done.
Gentle.
If you do it right, no harm will befall it.
Unless, of course, you will it.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I can't.
It's innocent.
Nothing is innocent.
(SQUISHING)
(GIGGLES)
(SNORTS)
(SIGHS)
Now, it belongs to me.
You see, when you take a heart, it becomes enchanted.
Stronger than a normal heart.
You're not hurting the beast.
You're controlling it.
Now, show me you know what to do with that power.
(REGINA GASPS)
Kill it.
What?
You've seen it done.
Now do it yourself.
Show me you can take the next step in your training.
Crush it.
(HEART CRACKLES)
(UNICORN GROANS)
(EXHALES)
Dearie, dearie, dearie, and I had such high hopes.
I didn't sign up to kill unicorns.
Magic is power.
Until you can take power, you're not learning anything.
Do you want me to teach you or not?
Yes.
Then there's one simple question for you to ponder.
I'll tell you anything.
(GIGGLES) I don't need the answer.
You do.
What's holding you back?
(GASPS)
(SNIFFLES)
REGINA:
His name was Daniel.
I preserved his body with an enchantment spell.
He's dead but frozen.
And I've kept him in my family mausoleum.
Because you couldn't let go of him.
(SIGHS)
If you can't let go of the past, Regina, it's doomed to haunt you.
(SNIFFLES)
(SIGHS) You know what, I think this has been quite enough.
Regina, wait, I can help you.
I doubt it.
(THUNDERCLAPS)
(HORN BLARES)
(GASPS)
(THUNDERCLAP)
Daniel?
(THUNDERCLAP)
All right.
(YAWNS)
(LAUGHS) Come on.
What's with the yawn?
This isn't school, it should be fun.
I couldn't sleep.
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
Hey.
I know.
I miss them, too.
(HORSE SNORTS)
Now, just think how happy Emma and Snow will be when they come home to find that you've become a proper knight.
(HORSES SNORTING)
Say hello to your steed.
Is he mine?
(DAVID CLICKS TONGUE)
(HORSE NICKERS)
This one's yours.
Really?
So how do I get on him?
You're not riding today.
I'm not?
No, there's much to learn before you hop in the saddle.
Like what?
Well, every morning you'll have to muck out his stall.
Then you'll brush him and feed him.
After school, you'll do it again.
- Every day, twice a day.
- (HORSE NICKERS)
That's not riding, that's babysitting.
Ah.
Horse sitting.
It builds an essential bond, the trust between knight and steed.
Okay, but when will I ride him?
When the horse tells you.
(HORSE WHINNIES IN DISTANCE)
I'm gonna go check in on the dwarfs, see how the mining's coming.
I'll pick you up later.
So, anything you wanna tell me?
(NICKERS)
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
(KEYS JANGLE)
(CROW CAWS)
(DOORS SQUEAK)
(GASPS)
(CLEARS THROAT)
Are you ready to begin?
Oh, I've been ready.
The question is, are you?
Yes, I am.
(WHEEL CREAKS)
Tell me why you're really here.
For power.
Stop wasting my time.
What is it you want?
Come on.
You've done all your soul searching.
Now, tell me.
Can you teach me how to use magic to bring back the dead?
That's what this is about?
The stable boy?
I want true happiness.
Then find it elsewhere, dearie.
Magic can do much, but not that.
Dead is dead.
(SIGHS) Then I am lost.
And I've had my time wasted.
I'm sorry, but, uh, transcending death is beyond even my reach.
I thought nothing was beyond your reach.
- RUMPLESTILTSKIN:
Ah.
- Busy?
Should I...
No, no, nothing important going on here.
Rumplestiltskin...
Ignore her.
I got what you wanted.
What about the slippers?
Oh.
Couldn't find them.
Heard talk they've already been moved to another land.
That's what I needed to get to that other land.
(BOTTLES CLATTER)
Well, come with me in my hat.
I'm sure we can work something out.
No, no, your hat only transports between magical realms.
I need to get to a land without magic.
Why would anyone want that?
My business.
You want the ball or not?
Mm...
Yes.
Help yourself to as much gold as you deem appropriate.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Oh, and you.
You can let yourself out.
Our work is done.
Wait, so that's it?
You're not going to teach me anymore?
So long as you harbor foolish notions of bringing back the dead, so long as you live in the past, you'll never find your future.
Teaching you is a waste of time.
- Pardon me...for eavesdropping, - (GASPS) but I think you need to look elsewhere for assistance.
What do you know about it?
I hear things.
Jefferson's the name, and I'm a man who travels and sees much.
And I know the man who can do what you want, bring back the dead.
He's, um, you might say...a wizard.
I can bring him to you.
At what price?
Always a price, indeed.
So here's mine.
Like I said, I'm a man of travels, and I've made many enemies along the way.
And I'd like a royal passport, so I can have free reign to traverse your kingdom.
How would I do that?
(INHALES AND CLICKS TONGUE)
Well, you're the Queen...aren't you?
That's right, I am.
And this wizard... (SNIFFS)
Can he really bring someone back from the dead?
Well, if he can't, no one can.
EMMA:
Have you seen him before?
MULAN:
Yes, I've seen him around.
He's a blacksmith, came to our camp a couple of months ago.
Said he lost his hand in an Ogre attack.
Why would Cora leave a survivor?
It's messy.
It doesn't make sense.
You think he's lying.
I think Cora's tricked us before.
I don't want that to happen again.
Here you go.
I cannot thank you enough for your kindness.
Fortune, it seems, has seen fit to show me favor.
An island full of corpses, you're the only one to escape.
How exactly did that happen?
She attacked at night.
Slaughtered everyone in one fell swoop.
When she started ripping out people's hearts,
I hid under the bodies of those who had already been killed.
Pretended to be dead myself.
Mercifully, the ruse worked.
So much for fortune favoring the brave.
It was all I could do to survive.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I'm pretty good at knowing when someone is lying to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
We should leave here in case Cora decides to come back.
We should start searching for a new portal back to Storybrooke.
I only got about five minutes with my husband, not to mention my grandson.
You have a grandson?
Long story.
Well, I know this land well.
I can guide you... (BLADE ZINGS)
You're not gonna guide us anywhere until you tell us who you really are.
(PANTS)
(DOOR SQUEAKS)
Dr. Whale?
Where are you?
Where is he, this wizard?
You promised to bring him to me.
Indeed, and off we shall go to see him.
But I warn you, be cautious.
Why?
Is he dangerous?
Not to us.
But bear in mind, he's never been to a world like this before.
He's unfamiliar with our ways, with our magic.
All I care about are his ways, and if they will do what I require.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
May I present to you, your salvation.
You're the wizard?
(CLEARS THROAT)
I prefer Doctor.
But you're welcome to call me whatever makes you comfortable.
Very well.
Doctor.
You understand why you've been brought here?
Of course.
Now... (CLEARS THROAT)
Show me the patient.
It's remarkable.
It's as if his last breath was drawn just moments ago.
A preservation spell.
Can you bring him back?
Perhaps.
Let's take a look.
It's wonderful.
His condition is ideal.
Apart from being dead, that is.
Just how many times have you done this, Doctor?
You didn't tell her.
Tell...
Tell me?
Tell me what?
The procedure is experimental.
Success has yet to occur.
But if certain conditions are met, I'm optimistic.
Optimistic?
Just hear him out.
What kind of charlatan are you?
I am no such thing.
I was told the last crucial piece of the puzzle exists in this land.
What else do you need?
A heart.
It's a fragile organ.
And I need a strong one.
I've searched the far reaches of my realm for one with the fortitude to withstand the shock of my procedure.
None have survived.
But they say in your land, there are hearts transformed by magic.
Hearts made so powerful, they glow.
That's why you've come here?
I need this for my work.
So, tell me, how do you change these hearts?
How do you enchant them?
Those who practice the dark arts do it by ripping the organ out of the living while it still beats.
Mm-hmm.
And you can do this?
No.
Huh.
You assured me that this Queen was some powerful sorceress.
I will not use magic for evil.
Well, if you want your fiancé back, then you're gonna have to find someone who will.
Have I wasted my time here?
No.
I know exactly who can help us.
I know where to get a heart.
Dr. Whale?
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
(GASPS)
- (CLATTERS)
- Oh!
(LIGHTS CREAKING)
Oh!
(GRUNTS)
Whale.
Whale.
I know you took Daniel's body, and you took one of my hearts.
Why?
Why?
Did you bring him back?
I did it.
- He's alive?
- Yes.
I brought him back, but he's not Daniel.
What?
He's a monster.
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
This was my mother's.
How sweet, but I'm not interested in heirlooms.
Oh, I believe you will be.
Listen.
(FIRE CRACKLING)
To a fireplace?
Just listen.
(HEART BEATING FAINTLY)
Where's that coming from?
Her vault.
- (WHOOSH) - (STONE DRAGGING)
Take your pick.
(MULTIPLE HEARTS BEATING)
These are all hearts?
My mother was a collector.
Whose hearts are these?
I have no idea.
She took so many, caused so much pain, it was impossible to keep track.
She was a monster.
(BOX SCRAPING)
Finally, after all this time.
(GASPS)
It's perfect.
(MONITOR BEEPING)
What's going on?
I just got a call that Dr. Whale was attacked.
You'll have to ask his doctors.
No.
I am asking you.
I came here to speak with him and discovered he was hurt.
- It's the truth.
- What else?
What did you come here to speak with him about?
Someone from my past.
I believe he's come back.
Daniel.
His name is Daniel.
The man you were supposed to marry.
Snow told me what happened and how it was her fault that he died.
Yes.
He did.
(SCOFFS) Well, then how could he be back?
Whale.
He believed he could bring him back from the grave.
And I don't know how... (WHISPERING)...but he has.
You don't know how?
Guess.
He practices something more powerful than magic.
Or so I was told.
All he needed was a heart.
And he took one of mine.
You have hearts here?
In my vault.
From our land.
Whose heart did he take?
I have no idea.
I took so many.
It was impossible to keep track.
I need to go.
I have to help him.
No.
Where is he?
Look what he did.
He's dangerous.
Not to me.
He won't hurt anyone else, David, I promise.
You know I can't take that chance.
You have two choices, Regina.
Tell me where he is, or jail.
I think it's like when you awoke from your coma.
He's following his final thoughts, to where he last met me.
The stables.
No.
Henry.
Henry's at the stables.
Gramps says that you'll tell me when I'm ready to ride you.
So, anytime.
Like, soon?
(WHINNIES)
(ALL WHINNYING)
(GRUNTS)
I already told you.
I'm just a blacksmith.
Sure you are.
(WHISTLES)
- (DISTANT GROWLING)
- You don't want to talk to us?
Maybe you'll talk to the Ogres while they rip you limb from limb.
(OGRES GROWLING)
- Come on.
- What...
You can't just leave me here like this.
- What if he's telling the truth?
- He's not.
Good for you. (CHUCKLES) You bested me.
I can count the amount of people who've done that on one hand.
That supposed to be funny?
Who are you?
Killian Jones.
But most people have taken to calling me by my more colorful moniker.
- Hook.
- Hook!
Check my satchel.
As in Captain Hook?
Ah, so you've heard of me.
- (CLINK) - (OGRES GROWLING)
(CRASHING)
You better hurry up, they're getting closer.
So unless you wanna be dinner, you better start talking.
(CHUCKLES)
Cora wanted me to gain your trust so I could learn everything there is to know about your Storybrooke.
She didn't want any surprises when she finally got over there.
She can't get there.
We destroyed the wardrobe.
Ah, but the enchantment remains.
Cora gathered the ashes, she's gonna use them to open up a portal.
(GROWLING AND THRASHING)
Now if you'll kindly cut me loose...
No.
We should leave him here to die, to pay for all the lives that he took.
That was Cora, not me.
Let's go.
Wait.
Wait!
(LOUD GROWL)
You need me alive.
Why?
Because we both want the same thing.
To get back to your land.
You will say anything to save yourself.
Why are we supposed to believe you now?
I arranged for transport with Cora, but seeing how resourceful you are, I'll offer you the same deal.
I'll help you if you promise to take me along.
How are you going to help us get home?
The ashes will open a portal.
But to find your land, she needs more.
There's an enchanted compass.
Cora seeks it.
I'll help you obtain it before she does.
So Cora won't make it to Storybrooke, and we'll be one step closer to getting home.
Sounds too good to be true.
There's only one way to find out.
(OGRES ROARING)
You tell me one thing.
And whatever you say, I better believe it.
Why does Captain Hook want to go to Storybrooke?
(SCREECHING)
To exact revenge on the man who took my hand.
Rumplestiltskin.
(ROARING)
(HORSES WHINNYING)
You...
You gotta stop.
Listen, you're scaring the horses.
(WHINNYING CONTINUES)
Are...
Are you hurt?
Can I help you?
(HORSE WHINNIES)
(HEART BEATING)
- Let me help you.
- (GRUNTS)
- (HORSE WHINNYING) - (GRUNTING)
Please.
REGINA:
Daniel!
Let him go.
(THUD)
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Go.
Go!
It's true.
You're really here.
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTS)
(LATCH CLICKS)
It won't hold for long.
Can you cast a spell to subdue him?
No, I won't use magic on him.
- What do you think you're doing?
- (SAFETY CLICKS)
He's a monster, Regina.
If you won't put him down, I will!
David, please!
Just let me talk to him.
It's too big of a risk.
There's no telling what he'll do.
You have to at least give me a chance.
Out of the way, Regina, now!
No!
I won't let you hurt him.
He'll listen to me!
(SOBBING) Please!
Let me talk to my fiancé.
(WIND WHISTLING)
(THUNDERCLAP)
The heart, Your Majesty?
(THUNDERCLAP)
Thank you.
Now, please.
Wait here.
The procedure is one I must perform alone.
What's he doing back there?
Magic?
He says he wields power greater than magic.
REGINA:
Really?
(THUNDERCLAP)
Why won't he let us see?
JEFFERSON:
In his land, there's much we don't understand.
Or can't.
If he can't achieve what you seek, Rumplestiltskin was right.
It can't be done.
(THUNDER CRASHING)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Well?
I'm sorry.
I failed.
The heart wasn't strong enough.
It couldn't withstand the procedure.
(REGINA CRYING)
(REGINA GASPS)
(GRUNTS)
(CHOKING) Daniel.
Please stop.
(GRUNTING)
It's me.
(WHISPERS) I love you.
(INHALES DEEPLY AND COUGHS)
(GASPING AND COUGHING)
(WHISPERS) Regina.
Daniel.
Oh!
(PANTING)
(REGINA INHALES)
I can't believe it's really you.
Ah!
Daniel?
(MOANING)
Stop.
Just stop the pain.
How?
Let me go.
No.
No, I won't lose you again.
Without you I'm lost.
(GROANS)
Daniel.
Daniel, come back to me.
(WEAKLY) Can't...
I can't.
(WHISPERS) But I love you.
Then love again.
(GROANS)
Oh!
(WHOOSH)
(SOBS)
(CRYING)
Goodbye, Daniel.
Up ahead.
We'll find the compass just over the ridge.
SNOW WHITE:
Do you get the feeling he's leading us exactly where Cora wants us?
That this whole thing's a trap?
EMMA:
It's definitely a trap.
As long as we know they're trying to play us, we can...
Stay one step ahead?
Exactly.
Let me guess.
The compass is up there?
HOOK:
Oh, yeah.
EMMA:
So how do we get to it?
It's not the climb you need to worry about.
It's the giant at the top.
(ENGINE IDLES)
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Who's this?
Ah, your replacement, of course.
- I needed someone more dedicated.
- Dedicated?
(SQUISH)
(HEART CRACKLES)
(THUD)
(GIGGLES)
Now, where were we?
You're back.
(WHISPERS) I used magic.
Why don't you come in and tell me what happened?
(REGINA SNIFFS)
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Enough.
I need to be taken home.
Now.
I have work to do and I believe our deal is done.
The deal isn't done until he says it's done.
Now, now, patience, please.
Our transaction is nearly complete.
And are you satisfied with the results?
She did seem rather...heartbroken.
WHALE:
She is.
(CLEARS THROAT)
She bought my failure.
You should've seen her tears.
I've seen the aftermath.
Impressive.
Now, my property?
Yeah, here it is.
You'll excuse me if I check?
(HEART BEATING)
(LOCK CLICKS)
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, the pleasure was mine.
Thanks to your efforts, I've made my monster.
Now I do hope you'll be able to make yours?
I'm not making a monster.
Sure you're not.
Good luck.
If these hearts are as strong as you say, I won't need luck.
Oh, just magic?
No.
What I'm going to accomplish goes far beyond magic.
And yet, you need a magical heart to do it.
WHALE:
So small-minded.
I need my powers to transcend the limitations of your magic.
This must be quite a land you hail from, if you think your abilities are more powerful.
- They are.
- Care to wager?
I suspect someday you'll see it my way.
I doubt it.
Now, may we go?
(JEFFERSON SIGHS)
RUMPLESTILTSKIN:
Careful, dearie, just remember.
Whatever it is you traffic in, it comes with a price.
(WHOOSHING)
WHALE:
We'll see.
(DOOR CHIME JINGLES)
(DOOR CLOSES, CHIMES JINGLE)
When they say I charge an arm and a leg, that's meant as a figure of speech.
Put it back.
GOLD:
You want me to reattach your arm?
Can you do it?
Of course.
But first, tell me why?
Because I want to use it again.
Obviously.
I meant, why bring that stable boy back from the dead?
Why now?
I thought...
I thought that if I helped her, she would return me to my world.
I want to see my brother.
To try to bring him back again.
Again?
The first time ended badly.
I need to return and try once more.
Well, it seems that's rather beyond her abilities.
My condolences.
Now my arm?
You said you can do it.
Oh, yes.
But there's a difference between "can" and "will."
Name your price.
- Say it.
- Say what?
You know what.
You came here, not the hospital.
So say it.
(SCOFFS)
I need magic.
That's all I needed to hear.
Always a pleasure doing business with you, Victor.
(THUNDERCLAP)
(THUNDER CRASHING)
Doctor, you've returned.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Yes.
Look at it.
It's remarkable, isn't it?
The final piece to the puzzle.
I believe so.
Let's begin.
(THUNDER CRASHING)

It's alive.
IGOR:
You did it.
Victor, you did it.
Yes, I believe I have.
Welcome back, brother.
It's magic, Dr. Frankenstein.
(WHISPERING) No, not magic.
Science.
Previously on Once Upon A Time...
Daniel's grave.
He died because of you.
I was very young, and your mother...
She ripped his heart out.
Henry, you're gonna go home with David.
I want you to be here because you want to be here, not because of magic.
I want to redeem myself.
Magic can set you free.
Let me guide you.
And I won't become like her?
That, dearie, is entirely up to you.
It's not safe here.
Cora's still out there.
We found a safe haven.
We must go there now.
Hello, Hook.
I don't know if I can do this.
I'm not a very good liar.
Oh, it's not really a lie, Aurora.
Lancelot did die an honorable death and Cora did escape.
All true.
Just leave the particulars to us.
There's no reason to cause unnecessary panic
- amongst your people.
- I'm not so sure it's unnecessary...
Wait.
The tower.
We always have sentries guarding the entrance.
Stay close.
Oh, my God.
This can't be.
Our land... we were protected here, hidden.
How did the ogres find us?
Ogres didn't do this.
What?
Cora did.
Their hearts... they were ripped out.
This was her magic... twisted and evil.
We have to stop her.
Too late.
She killed them.
She killed them all.
No, we have to stop her before she hurts anyone else.
Hey.
Hey.
Look.
There's someone under there.
- He's alive.
- Please.
It's okay.
Please help me.
It's okay.
You're safe now.
We won't hurt you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Once Upon A Time 2x05
- The Doctor Original air date October 28, 2012
Thank you very much for caring.
See you.
You.
We need to talk.
Oh!
What the hell was that for?
Sleeping with my wife.
- Kathryn?
- Snow.
Look, I didn't know.
All right?
I was cursed.
Yeah, I got it.
What do you want?
So... is it true?
People are saying that you're trying to find a way to build a portal back to your land because that's where you think Emma and Mary Margaret are, that they're alive.
Well, the whispers can stop.
I have no secrets from this town.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
But the land... it's... it's gone, destroyed by the curse.
Apparently not.
Well, you're having any luck?
Not yet.
We're working on it.
Does that mean that all the lands still exist?
Possibly.
So the Queen lied to us.
Again.
Are you sure?
Remember who we're talking about.
Regina.
Are you here to see me?
I've been trying to keep my promise to Henry, but it's been difficult.
To not use magic.
It's been two days.
That's an excellent start.
Come on in.
It's just that magic is the way I've always gotten everything.
Sounds like it's also the way you've lost everything.
Regina, this is your chance to start over, to earn Henry.
Dr. Whale, this is highly inappropriate.
Send me back.
Excuse me?
To my land.
Send me back to my brother.
Why don't you check the "Missing" board like everyone else?
Your curse only brought the living.
Well, then I'm sorry for your loss.
But I'm afraid I can't send anyone anywhere.
Can't or won't?
Dr. Whale, I have to insist.
Please.
Go.
Sorry.
What you said isn't entirely true, is it?
I'm sorry?
About the curse only taking the living.
The grave of your father's here, right?
I don't care about Whale or his brother.
I brought who I wanted.
Anyone else?
If you want help, you have to try and trust me.
Stopping magic is a lot harder than starting.
Now show me what you've learned.
Immobilize it.
There.
I did it.
Excellent work, my apprentice.
Now there's just one last, tiny, tiny, teeny, little detail.
Take its heart.
Like what my mother did to...
Oh, to your true love.
Indeed.
Then you already know how it's done.
Gentle.
If you do it right, no harm will befall it, unless of course, you will it.
I can't.
It's innocent.
Nothing is innocent.
Now it belongs to me.
You see, when you take a heart, it becomes enchanted.
Stronger than a normal heart.
You're not hurting the beast.
You're controlling it.
Now show me you know what to do with that power.
Kill it.
What?
You've seen it done.
Now do it yourself.
Show me you can take the next step in your training.
Crush it.
Dearie, dearie, dearie.
And I had such high hopes.
And I didn't sign up to kill unicorns.
Magic is power.
Until you can take power, you're not learning anything.
Do you want me to teach you or not?
Yes.
Then there's one simple question for you to ponder.
I'll tell you anything.
I don't need the answer.
You do.
What's holding you back?
His name was Daniel.
I preserved his body with an enchantment spell.
He's dead, but frozen, and I've kept him in my family mausoleum.
Because you couldn't let go of him.
If you can't let go of the past, Regina, it's doomed to haunt you.
You know what?
I think this has been quite enough.
Regina, wait.
I...
I can help you.
I doubt it.
Daniel?
All right.
Come on.
What's with the yawn?
This isn't school.
It should be fun.
I couldn't sleep.
Hey.
I know.
I miss 'em, too.
Now just think how happy Emma and Snow will be when they come home to find that you've become a proper knight.
Say hello to your steed.
Is he mine?
This one's yours.
Really?
So... how do I get on him?
Oh, you're not riding today.
- I'm not?
- No.
There's much to learn before you hop in the saddle.
Like what?
Well, every morning, you'll have to muck out his stall.
Then you'll brush him and feed him.
After school, you'll do it again.
Every day, twice a day.
That's not riding.
That's babysitting.
Ah.
Horsesitting.
It builds an essential bond... the trust between knight and steed.
Okay.
But when will I ride him?
When the horse tells you.
I'm gonna go check in on the dwarves, see how the mining's coming.
I'll pick you up later.
So... anything you wanna tell me?
Are you ready to begin?
Oh, I've been ready.
The question is, are you?
Yes, I am.
Tell me why you're really here.
For power...
Stop wasting my time!
What is it you want?
Come on.
You've done all your soul-searching.
Now tell me.
Can you teach me how to use magic to bring back the dead?
That's what this is about?
The stable boy?
I want true happiness.
Then find it elsewhere, dearie.
Magic can do much, but not that.
Dead is dead.
Then I am lost.
And I've had my time wasted.
I'm sorry, but, uh, transcending death is beyond even my reach.
I thought nothing was beyond your reach.
Ah.
- Busy.
Should I...
- No.
No.
Nothing important going on here.
Rumplestiltskin...
Ignore her.
I got what you wanted.
What about the slippers?
Oh.
Couldn't find 'em.
Heard talk they've already been moved to another land.
That's what I needed to get to that other land.
Well, come with me in my hat.
I'm sure we can work something out.
No, no.
Your hat only transports between magical realms.
I need to get to a land without magic.
Why would anyone want that?
My business.
You want the ball or not?
Mm... yes.
Help yourself to as much gold as you deem appropriate.
Oh, and, you.
You can let yourself out.
Our work is done.
Wait.
So that's it?
You're not going to teach me anymore?
So long as you harbor foolish notions of bringing back the dead, so long as you live in the past, you'll never find your future.
Teaching you is a waste of time.
Pardon me... for eavesdropping, but I think you need to look elsewhere for assistance.
What do you know about it?
I hear things.
Jefferson's the name, and I'm a man who travels and sees much, and I know the man who can do what you want... bring back the dead.
He's, um, you might say... a wizard.
I can bring him to you.
At what price?
Always a price indeed.
So here's mine.
Like I said, I'm a man of travels, and I've made many enemies along the way, and I'd like a royal passport so I can have free reign to traverse your kingdom.
How would I do that?
Well, you're the queen... aren't you?
That's right.
I am.
And this wizard... can he really bring someone back from the dead?
Well...
If he can't, no one can.
Have you seen him before?
Yes, I've seen him around.
He's a blacksmith.
Came to our camp a couple months ago.
Said he lost his hand in an ogre attack.
Why would Cora leave a survivor?
It's messy.
Doesn't make sense.
You think he's lying?
I think Cora's tricked us before.
I don't want that to happen again.
Here you go.
I can't thank you enough for your kindness.
Fortune, it seems, has seen fit to show me favor.
An island full of corpses.
You're the only one to escape.
How exactly did that happen?
She attacked at night, slaughtered everyone in one fell swoop.
When she started ripping out people's hearts,
I hid under the bodies of those who had already been killed.
Pretended to be dead myself.
Mercifully, the ruse worked.
So much for fortune favoring the brave.
It was all I could do to survive.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I'm pretty good at knowing when someone is lying to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
We should leave here in case Cora decides to come back.
We should start searching for a new portal back to Storybrooke.
I only got about five minutes with my husband.
Not to mention, my grandson.
You have a grandson?
Long story.
Well, I know this land well.
I can guide you.
You're not gonna guide us anywhere until you tell us who you really are.
Dr. Whale?
Where are you?
Where is he... this wizard?
You promised to bring him to me.
Indeed, and off we shall go to see him, but I warn you, be cautious.
Why?
Is he dangerous?
Not to us.
But bear in mind, he's never been to a world like this before.
He's unfamiliar with our ways, with our magic.
All I care about are his ways, and if they will do what I require.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
May I present to you... your salvation?
You're the wizard?
I prefer "doctor,"
but you're welcome to call me whatever makes you comfortable.
Very well... doctor.
You understand why you've been brought here?
Of course.
Now... show me the patient.
It's remarkable.
It's as if his last breath was drawn just moments ago.
A preservation spell.
Can you bring him back?
Perhaps.
Let's take a look.
It's wonderful.
His condition is ideal... apart from being dead, that is.
Just how many times have you done this, doctor?
You didn't tell her?
Tell... tell me?
Tell me what?
The procedure is experimental.
Success is yet to occur.
But if certain conditions are met, I'm optimistic.
Optimistic?
Just hear him out.
What kind of charlatan are you?
I am no such thing.
I was told the last crucial piece of the puzzle exists in this land.
What else do you need?
A heart.
It's a fragile organ, and I need a strong one.
I've searched the far reaches of my realm for one with the fortitude to stand the shock of my procedure.
None have survived.
But they say in your land, there are hearts transformed by magic.
Hearts made so powerful, they glow.
That's why you've come here?
I need this for my work.
So tell me... how do you change these hearts?
How do you enchant them?
Those who practice the dark arts do it by ripping the organ out of the living while it still beats.
Mm-hmm.
And you can do this?
- No.
- Huh.
You assured me that this queen was some powerful sorceress.
I will not use magic for evil.
Well, if you want your fiance back, then you're gonna have to find someone who will.
Have I wasted my time here?
No.
I know exactly who can help us.
I know where to get a heart.
Dr. Whale?
Oh!
Oh.
Whale.
Whale.
I know you took Daniel's body, and you took one of my hearts.
Why?
Did you bring him back?
I did it.
He's alive.
Yes.
I brought him back, but... he's not Daniel.
What?
He's... he's a monster.
This... was my mother's.
How sweet, but I'm not interested in heirlooms.
Oh, I believe you will be.
Listen.
To a fireplace?
Just listen.
Where is that coming from?
Her vault.
Take your pick.
These are all... hearts?
My mother was a collector.
Whose hearts are these?
I have no idea.
She took so many, caused so much pain.
It was impossible to keep track.
She was a monster.
Finally.
After all this time.
It's perfect.
What's going on?
I just got a call that Dr. Whale was attacked.
You'll have to ask his doctors.
No.
I am asking you.
I came here to speak with him and discovered he was hurt.
- It's the truth.
- What else?
What did you come here to speak with him about?
Someone from my past.
I believe he's come back.
Daniel.
His name is Daniel.
The man you were supposed to marry.
Snow told me what happened, and... how it was her fault that he died.
Yes.
He did.
Well, then how could he be back?
Whale.
He believed he could bring him back from the grave, and...
I don't know how... but he has.
You don't know how?
Guess.
He practices something more powerful than magic... or so I was told.
All he needed was a heart, and he took one of mine.
You have hearts here?
In my vault.
From our land.
Whose heart did he take?
I have no idea.
I took so many.
It was impossible to keep track.
I need to go.
I have to help him.
No.
Where is he?
Look what he did.
He's dangerous.
Not to me.
He won't hurt anyone else, David, I promise.
You know I can't take that chance.
You have two choices, Regina... tell me where he is, or jail.
I think it's like when...
you awoke from your coma.
He's following his final thoughts to where he last met me... the stables.
No.
Henry.
Henry's at the stables.
Gramps says that you'll tell me when I'm ready to ride you.
So... anytime.
Like, soon?
Aah!
I already told you.
I'm just a blacksmith.
Sure you are.
You don't want to talk to us?
Maybe you'll talk to the ogres while they rip you limb from limb.
- Come on.
- What?
You... you can't just leave me here like this!
What if he's telling the truth?
He's not.
Good for you!
You bested me.
I can count the amount of people who've done that on one hand.
That supposed to be funny?
Who are you?
Killian Jones, but most people have taken to call me by my more colorful moniker...
Hook.
Hook.
Check my satchel.
As in Captain Hook?
Ah, so you've heard of me.
You better hurry up.
They're getting closer.
So unless you wanna be dinner, you better start talking.
Cora wanted me to gain your trust so I could learn everything there is to know about your Storybrooke.
She didn't want any surprises when she finally got over there.
She can't get there.
We destroyed the wardrobe.
Ah, but the enchantment remains.
Cora gathered the ashes.
She's gonna use them to open up a portal.
Now if you'll kindly cut me loose.
No.
We should leave him here to die to pay for all the lives that he took.
That was Cora, not me.
Let's go.
Wait.
Wait!
You need me alive.
Why?
Because we both want the same thing... to get back to your land.
You would say anything to save yourself.
Why are we supposed to believe you now?
I arranged for transport with Cora, but seeing how resourceful you are,
I'll offer you the same deal...
I'll help you if you promise to take me along.
How are you going to help us get home?
The ashes will open a portal, but to find your land, she needs more.
There's an enchanted compass.
Cora seeks it.
I'll help you obtain it before she does.
So Cora won't make it to Storybrooke, and we'll be one step closer to getting home.
Sounds too good to be true.
There's only one way to find out.
You tell me one thing... and whatever you say, I better believe it... why does Captain Hook want to go to Storybrooke?
To exact revenge on the man who took my hand...
Rumplestiltskin.
You... you gotta stop.
You're...
you're scaring the horses.
Are... are... are you hurt?
Can I help you?
Let me help you.
Daniel!
Let him go!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Go.
Go!
It's true.
You're really here.
It won't hold for long.
Can you cast a spell to subdue him?
No.
I won't use magic on him.
What do you think you're doing?
He's a monster, Regina!
If you won't put him down, I will!
David, please!
Just let me talk to him.
It's too big of a risk.
There's no telling what he'll do.
- You have to at least give me a chance!
- Out of the way, Regina!
Now!
No!
I won't let you hurt him!
He'll listen to me!
Please!
Let me talk to my fiance.
The heart, your majesty.
Thank you.
Now please, wait here.
The procedure is one I must perform alone.
What's he doing back there?
Magic?
He says he wields power greater than magic.
Really?
Why won't he let us see?
In his land, there's much we don't understand, or can't.
If he can't achieve what you seek,
Rumplestiltskin was right.
It can't be done.
Well?
I'm sorry.
I failed.
The heart wasn't strong enough.
It couldn't withstand the procedure.
Daniel.
Stop.
It's me.
I love you.
Regina.
Daniel.
Oh.
I can't believe it's really you.
Oh!
Daniel?
Stop.
Just stop the pain.
How?
Just... let me go.
No.
No, I won't lose you again.
Without you, I'm lost.
Daniel.
Daniel, come back to me.
Can't.
Can't.
But I love you.
Then love again.
Oh.
Good-bye, Daniel.
Up ahead.
We'll find the compass just over the ridge.
Do you get the feeling he's leading us exactly where Cora wants us, that this whole thing's a trap?
It's definitely a trap.
As long as we know they're trying to play us, we can...
Stay one step ahead of them.
Exactly.
Let me guess.
The compass is up there?
Oh, yeah.
So how do we... get to it?
It's not the climb you need to worry about.
It's the giant at the top.
Who's this?
Ah, your replacement, of course.
I needed someone more dedicated.
Dedicated?
Now... where were we?
You're back.
I used magic.
Why don't you come in and tell me what happened?
Enough.
I need to be taken home.
Now I have work to do, and I believe our deal is done.
The deal isn't done until he says it's done.
Now, now.
Patience, please.
Our transaction is, uh, nearly complete.
And are you satisfied with the results?
She did seem rather... heartbroken.
She is.
- She bought my failure.
- You should've seen her tears.
I've seen the aftermath.
Impressive.
Now... my property.
Yeah, here it is.
You'll excuse me if I check.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, the pleasure was mine.
Thanks to your efforts, I've made my monster.
Now I do hope you'll be able to make yours.
I'm not making a monster.
Sure you're not.
Good luck.
If these hearts are as strong as you say, I won't need luck.
Oh, just magic.
No.
What I'm going to accomplish goes far beyond magic.
And yet you need a magical heart to do it.
So small-minded.
I need my powers to transcend the limitations of your magic.
This must be quite a land you hail from if you think your abilities are more powerful.
They are.
Care to wager?
I suspect someday you'll see it my way.
I doubt it.
Now may we go?
Careful, dearie.
Just remember, whatever it is you traffic in, it comes with a price.
We'll see.
When they say I charge an arm and a leg, that's meant as a figure of speech.
Put it back.
You want me to reattach your arm?
Can you do it?
Of course.
But first, tell me why.
Because I want to use it again.
Obviously.
I meant why bring that stable boy back from the dead?
Why now?
I thought...
I thought that if I helped her, she would return me to my world.
I want to see my brother, to try to bring him back again.
Again?
The first time ended badly.
I need to return and try it once more.
Well, it seems that's rather beyond her abilities.
My condolences.
Now my arm.
You said you can do it.
Oh, yes.
But there's a difference between "can" and "will."
Name your price.
Say it.
Say what?
You know what.
You came here, not the hospital.
So say it.
I need magic.
That's all I needed to hear.
Always a pleasure doing business with you, uh, Victor.
Doctor.
You've returned.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Yes.
Look at it.
It's remarkable, isn't it?
The final piece to the puzzle.
I believe so.
Let's begin.
It's alive.
You did it.
Victor, you did it.
Yes.
I believe I have.
Welcome back, brother.
It's magic, Dr. Frankenstein.
No.
Not magic.
Science.
Previously on Once Upon A Time...
Regina:
Daniel's grave.
He died because of you.
Snow:
I was very young, and your mother... (Squish) She ripped his heart out.
Henry, you're gonna go home with David.
I want you to be here because you want to be here, not because of magic.
(Whispers) I want to redeem myself.
Magic can set you free.
Let me guide you.
And I won't become like her?
That, dearie, is entirely up to you.
It's not safe here.
Cora's still out there.
We found a safe haven.
We must go there now.
Hello, Hook.
Aurora:
I don't know if I can do this.
I'm not a very good liar.
Snow:
Oh, it's not really a lie, Aurora.
Lancelot did die an honorable death and Cora did escape.
All true.
Just leave the particulars to us.
There's no reason to cause unnecessary panic
- amongst your people.
- I'm not so sure it's unnecessary...
Wait.
The tower.
We always have sentries guarding the entrance.
(Blade zings)
Stay close.
Oh, my God.
Mulan:
This can't be.
Our land... we were protected here, hidden.
How did the ogres find us?
Ogres didn't do this.
What?
Cora did.
Their hearts... they were ripped out.
This was her magic... twisted and evil.
We have to stop her.
Too late.
She killed them.
She killed them all.
No, we have to stop her before she hurts anyone else.
Hey.
Hey.
Look.
There's someone under there.
- He's alive.
Man:
- Please.
It's okay.
Please help me.
It's okay.
You're safe now.
We won't hurt you.
Thank you.
(Panting) Thank you.
(Panting)
Once Upon A Time 2x05
- The Doctor Original air date October 28, 2012
(indistinct conversations)
Thank you very much for caring.
See you.
(Exhales deeply)
You.
We need to talk.
Oh!
(Sighs) What the hell was that for?
Sleeping with my wife.
- Kathryn?
- Snow.
Look, I didn't know.
All right?
I was cursed.
Yeah, I got it.
What do you want?
(Sighs)
So... is it true?
People are saying that you're trying to find a way to build a portal back to your land because that's where you think Emma and Mary Margaret are, that they're alive.
Well, the whispers can stop.
I have no secrets from this town.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
But the land... it's... it's gone, destroyed by the curse.
Apparently not.
Well, you're having any luck?
Not yet.
We're working on it.
Does that mean that all the lands still exist?
Possibly.
So the Queen lied to us.
Again.
Are you sure?
Remember who we're talking about.
Regina.
Are you here to see me?
I've been trying to keep my promise to Henry, but it's been difficult.
To not use magic.
It's been two days.
That's an excellent start.
Come on in.
It's just that magic is the way I've always gotten everything.
Sounds like it's also the way you've lost everything.
Regina, this is your chance to start over, to earn Henry.
(Door opens)
Dr. Whale, this is highly inappropriate.
Send me back.
Excuse me?
To my land.
Send me back to my brother.
Why don't you check the "Missing" board like everyone else?
Your curse only brought the living.
Well, then I'm sorry for your loss.
But I'm afraid I can't send anyone anywhere.
Can't or won't?
Dr. Whale, I have to insist.
Please.
Go.
Sorry.
What you said isn't entirely true, is it?
I'm sorry?
About the curse only taking the living.
The grave of your father's here, right?
I don't care about Whale or his brother.
I brought who I wanted.
Anyone else?
(Sighs)
If you want help, you have to try and trust me.
Stopping magic is a lot harder than starting.
(Whinnies)
Rumplestiltskin:
Now show me what you've learned.
Immobilize it.
(Whinnies)
(Whoosh)
(Giggles)
There.
I did it.
Excellent work, my apprentice.
Now there's just one last, tiny, tiny, teeny, little detail.
Take its heart.
Like what my mother did to...
Oh, to your true love.
Indeed.
Then you already know how it's done.
Gentle.
If you do it right, no harm will befall it, unless of course, you will it.
(Breathing heavily)
I can't.
It's innocent.
Nothing is innocent.
(Squish)
(Giggles)
(Snorts) (Heart beating rhythmically)
(Sighs)
Now it belongs to me.
You see, when you take a heart, it becomes enchanted.
Stronger than a normal heart.
You're not hurting the beast.
You're controlling it.
Now show me you know what to do with that power.
Kill it.
What?
You've seen it done.
Now do it yourself.
Show me you can take the next step in your training.
Crush it.
(Heart continues beating)
(Heart crackles)
(Groans)
(Exhales)
Dearie, dearie, dearie.
(Blusters)
And I had such high hopes.
And I didn't sign up to kill unicorns.
Magic is power.
Until you can take power, you're not learning anything.
Do you want me to teach you or not?
Yes.
Then there's one simple question for you to ponder.
I'll tell you anything.
(Giggles) I don't need the answer.
You do.
What's holding you back?
(Gasps)
(Sniffles)
His name was Daniel.
I preserved his body with an enchantment spell.
He's dead, but frozen, and I've kept him in my family mausoleum.
Because you couldn't let go of him.
(Sighs) If you can't let go of the past, Regina, it's doomed to haunt you.
(Sniffles)
(Sighs) You know what?
I think this has been quite enough.
Regina, wait.
I...
I can help you.
I doubt it.
(Thunderclaps)
(Horn blares)
(Gasps)
(Thunderclap)
Daniel?
(Thunderclap)
All right.
(Yawns)
(Laughs) Come on.
What's with the yawn?
(Blusters) This isn't school.
It should be fun.
I couldn't sleep.
(Sighs deeply)
Hey.
I know.
I miss 'em, too.
(Horse blusters)
Now just think how happy Emma and Snow will be when they come home to find that you've become a proper knight.
(Horse blusters)
Say hello to your steed.
Is he mine?
(Clicks tongue) (Nickers)
This one's yours.
Really?
(Nickers)
So... how do I get on him?
Oh, you're not riding today.
- I'm not?
- No.
There's much to learn before you hop in the saddle.
Like what?
Well, every morning, you'll have to muck out his stall.
Then you'll brush him and feed him.
After school, you'll do it again.
Every day, twice a day.
(Nickers)
That's not riding.
That's babysitting.
Ah.
Horsesitting.
It builds an essential bond... the trust between knight and steed.
Okay.
But when will I ride him?
When the horse tells you.
(Horse whinnies in distance)
I'm gonna go check in on the dwarves, see how the mining's coming.
I'll pick you up later.
So...
(Nickers) anything you wanna tell me?
(Nickers)
(Birds chirping)
(Crow caws)
(Doors squeak) (Gasps)
(Clears throat)
Are you ready to begin?
Oh, I've been ready.
The question is, are you?
Yes, I am.
(Wheel creaks)
Tell me why you're really here.
For power...
Stop wasting my time!
What is it you want?
Come on.
You've done all your soul-searching.
Now tell me.
Can you teach me how to use magic to bring back the dead?
That's what this is about?
The stable boy?
I want true happiness.
Then find it elsewhere, dearie.
Magic can do much, but not that.
Dead is dead.
(Sighs)
Then I am lost.
And I've had my time wasted.
I'm sorry, but, uh, transcending death is beyond even my reach.
I thought nothing was beyond your reach.
Ah.
- Busy.
Should I...
- No.
No.
Nothing important going on here.
Rumplestiltskin...
Ignore her.
I got what you wanted.
What about the slippers?
Oh.
Couldn't find 'em.
Heard talk they've already been moved to another land.
That's what I needed to get to that other land.
(Bottles clatter)
Well, come with me in my hat.
I'm sure we can work something out.
No, no.
Your hat only transports between magical realms.
I need to get to a land without magic.
Why would anyone want that?
My business.
You want the ball or not?
Mm... yes.
Help yourself to as much gold as you deem appropriate.
(Clears throat)
Oh, and, you.
You can let yourself out.
Our work is done.
Wait.
So that's it?
You're not going to teach me anymore?
So long as you harbor foolish notions of bringing back the dead, so long as you live in the past, you'll never find your future.
Teaching you is a waste of time.
Pardon me...
(Gasps) for eavesdropping, but I think you need to look elsewhere for assistance.
What do you know about it?
I hear things.
Jefferson's the name, and I'm a man who travels and sees much, and I know the man who can do what you want... bring back the dead.
He's, um, you might say... a wizard.
I can bring him to you.
At what price?
Always a price indeed.
So here's mine.
Like I said, I'm a man of travels, and I've made many enemies along the way, and I'd like a royal passport so I can have free reign to traverse your kingdom.
How would I do that?
(Inhales deeply and clicks tongue)
Well, you're the queen... aren't you?
That's right.
I am.
And this wizard... (Sniffles) can he really bring someone back from the dead?
Well...
If he can't, no one can.
Emma:
Have you seen him before?
Yes, I've seen him around.
He's a blacksmith.
Came to our camp a couple months ago.
Said he lost his hand in an ogre attack.
Why would Cora leave a survivor?
It's messy.
Doesn't make sense.
You think he's lying?
I think Cora's tricked us before.
I don't want that to happen again.
Here you go.
I can't thank you enough for your kindness.
Fortune, it seems, has seen fit to show me favor.
An island full of corpses.
You're the only one to escape.
How exactly did that happen?
She attacked at night, slaughtered everyone in one fell swoop.
When she started ripping out people's hearts,
I hid under the bodies of those who had already been killed.
Pretended to be dead myself.
Mercifully, the ruse worked.
So much for fortune favoring the brave.
It was all I could do to survive.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I'm pretty good at knowing when someone is lying to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
We should leave here in case Cora decides to come back.
We should start searching for a new portal back to Storybrooke.
I only got about five minutes with my husband.
Not to mention, my grandson.
You have a grandson?
Long story.
Well, I know this land well.
I can guide you.
(Blade zings) You're not gonna guide us anywhere until you tell us who you really are.
(Pants)
(Door squeaks)
(Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A. in distance)
(Door creaks) Dr. Whale?
Where are you?
Where is he... this wizard?
You promised to bring him to me.
Indeed, and off we shall go to see him, but I warn you, be cautious.
Why?
Is he dangerous?
Not to us.
But bear in mind, he's never been to a world like this before.
He's unfamiliar with our ways, with our magic.
All I care about are his ways, and if they will do what I require.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
May I present to you... your salvation?
You're the wizard?
(Clears throat)
I prefer "doctor,"
but you're welcome to call me whatever makes you comfortable.
Very well... doctor.
You understand why you've been brought here?
Of course.
Now...
(Clears throat) show me the patient.
It's remarkable.
It's as if his last breath was drawn just moments ago.
A preservation spell.
Can you bring him back?
Perhaps.
Let's take a look.
It's wonderful.
His condition is ideal... apart from being dead, that is.
Just how many times have you done this, doctor?
You didn't tell her?
Tell... tell me?
Tell me what?
The procedure is experimental.
Success is yet to occur.
But if certain conditions are met, I'm optimistic.
Optimistic?
Just hear him out.
What kind of charlatan are you?
I am no such thing.
I was told the last crucial piece of the puzzle exists in this land.
What else do you need?
A heart.
It's a fragile organ, and I need a strong one.
I've searched the far reaches of my realm for one with the fortitude to stand the shock of my procedure.
None have survived.
But they say in your land, there are hearts transformed by magic.
Hearts made so powerful, they glow.
That's why you've come here?
I need this for my work.
So tell me... how do you change these hearts?
How do you enchant them?
Those who practice the dark arts do it by ripping the organ out of the living while it still beats.
Mm-hmm.
And you can do this?
- No.
- Huh.
You assured me that this queen was some powerful sorceress.
I will not use magic for evil.
Well, if you want your fiance back, then you're gonna have to find someone who will.
Have I wasted my time here?
No.
I know exactly who can help us.
I know where to get a heart.
Dr. Whale?
(Electricity crackling)
(Gasps)
(Clatter) Oh!
(Lights creaking)
Oh.
(Grunts) Whale.
Whale.
(Grunts)
I know you took Daniel's body, and you took one of my hearts.
Why?
Did you bring him back?
I did it.
He's alive.
Yes.
I brought him back, but... he's not Daniel.
What?
He's... he's a monster.
(Crickets chirping) This... was my mother's.
How sweet, but I'm not interested in heirlooms.
Oh, I believe you will be.
Listen.
(Fire crackling)
To a fireplace?
Just listen.
(Heart beating faintly)
Where is that coming from?
Her vault.
(Whoosh)
(Multiple hearts beating rhythmically)
Take your pick.
These are all... hearts?
My mother was a collector.
Whose hearts are these?
I have no idea.
She took so many, caused so much pain.
It was impossible to keep track.
She was a monster.
(Box scraping)
(Hearts continue beating)
Finally.
After all this time.
(Gasps)
It's perfect.
(Monitor beeping steadily)
(Woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.)
What's going on?
I just got a call that Dr. Whale was attacked.
You'll have to ask his doctors.
No.
I am asking you.
I came here to speak with him and discovered he was hurt.
- It's the truth.
- What else?
What did you come here to speak with him about?
Someone from my past.
I believe he's come back.
Daniel.
His name is Daniel.
The man you were supposed to marry.
Snow told me what happened, and... how it was her fault that he died.
Yes.
He did.
(Exhales) Well, then how could he be back?
Whale.
He believed he could bring him back from the grave, and...
I don't know how... (Whispers) but he has.
You don't know how?
Guess.
He practices something more powerful than magic... or so I was told.
All he needed was a heart, and he took one of mine.
You have hearts here?
In my vault.
From our land.
Whose heart did he take?
I have no idea.
I took so many.
It was impossible to keep track.
I need to go.
I have to help him.
No.
Where is he?
Look what he did.
He's dangerous.
Not to me.
He won't hurt anyone else, David, I promise.
You know I can't take that chance.
You have two choices, Regina... tell me where he is, or jail.
I think it's like when...
you awoke from your coma.
He's following his final thoughts to where he last met me... the stables.
No.
Henry.
Henry's at the stables.
Gramps says that you'll tell me when I'm ready to ride you.
So... anytime.
Like, soon?
(Nickers)
(Whinnies)
(Horses whinnying)
(Whinnying)
Aah!
(Horses whinnying)
I already told you.
I'm just a blacksmith.
Sure you are.
(Whistles)
(Growling in distance) You don't want to talk to us?
Maybe you'll talk to the ogres while they rip you limb from limb.
(Ogres growling)
- Come on.
- What?
You... you can't just leave me here like this!
What if he's telling the truth?
He's not.
Good for you!
(Chuckles)
You bested me.
I can count the amount of people who've done that on one hand.
That supposed to be funny?
Who are you?
Killian Jones, but most people have taken to call me by my more colorful moniker...
Hook.
Hook.
Check my satchel.
As in Captain Hook?
Ah, so you've heard of me.
(Clink) (Ogres growling)
You better hurry up.
They're getting closer.
So unless you wanna be dinner, you better start talking.
(Chuckles)
Cora wanted me to gain your trust so I could learn everything there is to know about your Storybrooke.
She didn't want any surprises when she finally got over there.
She can't get there.
We destroyed the wardrobe.
Ah, but the enchantment remains.
Cora gathered the ashes.
She's gonna use them to open up a portal.
(Growling grows louder, thrashing)
Now if you'll kindly cut me loose.
No.
We should leave him here to die to pay for all the lives that he took.
That was Cora, not me.
Let's go.
Wait.
Wait!
(Ogres continue growling)
You need me alive.
Why?
Because we both want the same thing... to get back to your land.
You would say anything to save yourself.
Why are we supposed to believe you now?
I arranged for transport with Cora, but seeing how resourceful you are,
I'll offer you the same deal...
I'll help you if you promise to take me along.
How are you going to help us get home?
The ashes will open a portal, but to find your land, she needs more.
There's an enchanted compass.
Cora seeks it.
I'll help you obtain it before she does.
So Cora won't make it to Storybrooke, and we'll be one step closer to getting home.
Sounds too good to be true.
There's only one way to find out.
(Ogres roaring)
You tell me one thing... and whatever you say, I better believe it... why does Captain Hook want to go to Storybrooke?
(Screech in distance)
To exact revenge on the man who took my hand...
Rumplestiltskin.
(Ogres growling)
(Horses whinnying)
You... you gotta stop.
You're...
you're scaring the horses.
(Whinnying continues)
Are... are... are you hurt?
Can I help you?
(Horse whinnies)
(Heart beating rhythmically)
Let me help you.
(Grunts)
(Horse whinnying) (Grunting)
Regina:
Daniel!
Let him go!
(Thud)
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Go.
Go!
It's true.
You're really here.
(Grunts) (Grunts)
(Latch clicks)
It won't hold for long.
Can you cast a spell to subdue him?
No.
I won't use magic on him.
What do you think you're doing?
(Safety clicks)
He's a monster, Regina!
If you won't put him down, I will!
David, please!
Just let me talk to him.
It's too big of a risk.
There's no telling what he'll do.
- You have to at least give me a chance!
- Out of the way, Regina!
Now!
No!
I won't let you hurt him!
He'll listen to me!
Please!
Let me talk to my fiance.
(Wind whistling)
(Thunderclap)
The heart, your majesty.
(Thunderclap)
Thank you.
Now please, wait here.
The procedure is one I must perform alone.
(Thunderclap)
What's he doing back there?
Magic?
He says he wields power greater than magic.
Really?
(Thunderclap)
Why won't he let us see?
In his land, there's much we don't understand, or can't.
If he can't achieve what you seek,
Rumplestiltskin was right.
It can't be done.
(Thunder crashing)
(Heart beating rhythmically)
(Thunder rumbling)
Well?
I'm sorry.
I failed.
The heart wasn't strong enough.
It couldn't withstand the procedure.
(Crying)
(Thunderclap)
(Gasps)
(Grunts)
(Choking) Daniel.
Stop.
(Grunting)
It's me.
(Whispers) I love you.
(Inhales deeply)
(Gasping and coughing)
(Whispers) Regina.
Daniel.
Oh.
(Exhales)
(Inhales deeply) I can't believe it's really you.
Oh!
Daniel?
(Moaning)
Stop.
Just stop the pain.
How?
Just... let me go.
No.
No, I won't lose you again.
(Crying) Without you, I'm lost.
(Groans)
Daniel.
Daniel, come back to me.
(Weakly) Can't.
Can't.
(Whispers) But I love you.
Then love again.
(Groans)
Oh.
(Sniffles)
(Whoosh)
(Sobs)
(Crying)
Good-bye, Daniel.
Up ahead.
We'll find the compass just over the ridge.
Snow:
Do you get the feeling he's leading us exactly where Cora wants us, that this whole thing's a trap?
It's definitely a trap.
As long as we know they're trying to play us, we can...
Stay one step ahead of them.
Exactly.
Let me guess.
The compass is up there?
Oh, yeah.
Emma:
So how do we... get to it?
It's not the climb you need to worry about.
It's the giant at the top.
(Engine idles)
(Birds chirping)
Who's this?
Ah, your replacement, of course.
I needed someone more dedicated.
Dedicated?
(Squish)
(Heart crackles)
(Thud)
(Giggles)
Now... where were we?
You're back.
(Whispers) I used magic.
Why don't you come in and tell me what happened?
(Sniffles)
(Birds chirping)
Enough.
I need to be taken home.
Now I have work to do, and I believe our deal is done.
The deal isn't done until he says it's done.
Now, now.
Patience, please.
Our transaction is, uh, nearly complete.
And are you satisfied with the results?
She did seem rather... heartbroken.
She is.
(Clears throat)
- She bought my failure.
- You should've seen her tears.
I've seen the aftermath.
Impressive.
Now... my property.
Yeah, here it is.
You'll excuse me if I check.
(Beating rhythmically)
(Lock clicks)
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, the pleasure was mine.
Thanks to your efforts, I've made my monster.
Now I do hope you'll be able to make yours.
I'm not making a monster.
Sure you're not.
Good luck.
If these hearts are as strong as you say, I won't need luck.
Oh, just magic.
No.
What I'm going to accomplish goes far beyond magic.
And yet you need a magical heart to do it.
So small-minded.
I need my powers to transcend the limitations of your magic.
This must be quite a land you hail from if you think your abilities are more powerful.
They are.
Care to wager?
I suspect someday you'll see it my way.
I doubt it.
Now may we go?
Careful, dearie.
Just remember, whatever it is you traffic in, it comes with a price.
(Whooshing)
We'll see.
(Door bells jingle)
(Door closes, bells jingle)
When they say I charge an arm and a leg, that's meant as a figure of speech.
Put it back.
You want me to reattach your arm?
Can you do it?
Of course.
But first, tell me why.
Because I want to use it again.
Obviously.
I meant why bring that stable boy back from the dead?
Why now?
I thought... (Groans)
I thought that if I helped her, she would return me to my world.
I want to see my brother, to try to bring him back again.
Again?
The first time ended badly.
I need to return and try it once more.
Well, it seems that's rather beyond her abilities.
My condolences.
Now my arm.
You said you can do it.
Oh, yes.
But there's a difference between "can" and "will."
Name your price.
Say it.
Say what?
You know what.
You came here, not the hospital.
So say it.
(Scoffs)
I need magic.
That's all I needed to hear.
Always a pleasure doing business with you, uh, Victor.
(Thunderclap)
(Thunder crashing)
Doctor.
You've returned.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Yes.
(Thunderclap)
Look at it.
It's remarkable, isn't it?
The final piece to the puzzle.
I believe so.
(Thunderclap)
Let's begin.
(Thunder crashing)
(Clank, electricity humming)
(Electricity crackles)
(Thunderclap)
(Clank)
(Crackling)
(Bubbling)
(Whirring)
(Electricity crackling)
(Thunder crashing)
It's alive.
You did it.
Victor, you did it.
Yes.
I believe I have.
Welcome back, brother.
(Whispers) It's magic, Dr. Frankenstein.
(Whispering) No.
Not magic.
Science.
[It starts with one]
One thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
[All I know]
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
[It's so unreal]
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
Wasted it all just to
[Watch you go]
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme, to remind myself how
[I tried so hard]
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it
[Got so far]
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
[In the end]
You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter.
I dreamed I was missing,
You were so scared,
But no one would listen,
'Cause no one else cared.
After my dreaming,
I woke with this fear.
What am I leaving?
When I'm done here?
So if you're asking me, I want you to know...
When my time comes,
Forget the wrong that I've done,
Help me leave behind some, reasons to be missed.
And don't resent me,
And when you're feeling empty,
Keep me in your memory,
Leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest...
Don't be afraid,
I've taken my beating,
I've shared what I've made,
I'm strong on the surface,
Not all the way through.
I've never been perfect,
But neither have you.
So if you're asking me, I want to know...
When my time comes,
Forget the wrong that I've done,
Help me leave behind some, reasons to be missed...
Don't resent me,
And when you're feeling empty,
Keep me in your memory.
Leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest...
Forgetting,
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well.
Pretending,
Someone else can come and save me from myself.
I can't be who you are...
When my time comes,
Forget the wrong that I've done,
Help me leave behind some, reasons to be missed.
Don't resent me,
And when you're feeling empty,
Keep me in your memory.
Leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest.
Forgetting,
All the hurt inside, you've learned to hide so well.
Pretending,
Someone else can come and save me from myself.
I can't be who you are,
I can't be who you are.

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again
Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a Nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
And show me how to be whole again
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything else I need to be
'Cause I'm only a crack
In this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
For you to see

I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me...
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur...
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me...
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough
To reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide...
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide...
In every loss, in every lie
In every truth, that you'd deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect the space between
Let it be enough
To reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide...
Across this new divide...
Across this new divide...

You were standing in the wake of devastation
You were waiting on the edge of the unknown
With the cataclysm raining down
Insides crying "Save me now"
You were there, impossibly alone
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go...
Let it go...
And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace
Falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go...
Let it go...
[Let it go]

Yeah!
Yeah!
You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed so taken
So conditioned, I could never let go
Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid I couldn't let myself see
That I could never be held
Back or up no I hold myself
Check the rep yep you know mine well
Forget the rest let them know my hell
There and back yet my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up the best they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there saying
- In these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go
Go
Go
Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Ya'll go hard I go smart
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So you can let it be known
I don't hold back I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't c-flat, It ain't my tone
I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
That I was there saying
- In these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie, I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go
Go, go...
No!
You can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how
I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped all I know go hard
Won't forget how I got this far
That I was there saying
- In these promises broken
Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie, I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go
Go
Go
Go
Go
Go
Go

I'm Sheila Temple, and welcome to the "Temple of Justice."
Hillary Stone was released from prison today...
Get back.
Get back.
after she was acquitted by judge Joan Hunt...
Move!
Move!
of the brutal and senseless murder of her own 5-year-old son Simon.
And today, she's a free woman.
Free to kill again.
You guys need to back up off the car!
Stay tuned.
Are you trying to create a circus atmosphere?
Rain is still in the forecast.
And it will preserve the scene if the skies open up.
Where's your better half?
Sam's in Harrisburg at a wedding.
It's really too bad.
You know how much she loves the big top.
Rain stopped at 2:00 A.M.
Jogger cutting through the site found the body at, uh... 7:30.
And how did you know that?
The sun has been up long enough to cake the dirt, but the work shift hadn't started yet.
That puts discovery at about an hour after sunrise.
Got blood on the backhoe.
So the victim probably hit their head on it and then fell in the hole that it dug the day before.
All right.
Let's dig him up.
We don't dig, detective.
We excavate.
Oh, God.
That's Hillary Stone.
I don't think anybody's gonna want to solve this murder.
May I remind you, she was acquitted?
That doesn't make her innocent.
People saw her on that bridge, they saw her drop the sack into the river.
Come on.
You know she did it.
All I know is, someone did this.
That's my only concern.
I'm Sheila Temple from "Temple of Justice."
In a shocking turn, Hillary Stone, who yesterday was a free woman, is now a dead woman.
We are here at the construction site where the body is now being uncovered.
And our chief medical examiner has just arrived on the scene.
Dr. Murphy, Dr. Murphy,
- care to comment?
- No.
Not even about your choice of medical examiner?
Dr. Hunt is the best our office has.
Isn't that the same thing that the mayor said about her mother...
Judge Joan Hunt?
This is gonna be gold.
This is gonna be gold.
Oh, and here come the news choppers.
Choppers and an accused murderer under the big top... still think this isn't a circus?
I've got lesions at the frontotemporal region.
So C.O.D. could be subdural hematoma.
There's also patterned bruising around the neck, which raises the possibility of strangulation.
1.5 million.
What?
That's the population of our fair city.
That's how many suspects we've got.
We are now standing outside the offices of the Philadelphia Medical Examiner.
And guess who's been tasked to examine the body.
Why, none other than Judge Joan Hunt's daughter...
Megan Hunt.
Conspiracy, conflict of interest, maybe a little bit of both?
Stay tuned.
Ugh!
Are you crazy?
You could've broken my nose.
And if I was carrying evidence or pushing a body, you coulda just broken a case.
Actually, I just did.
That old woman that you posted...
Doris Roth.
She died from complications of Crohn's.
Great.
Let me see it.
Ethan, this ain't my report.
This is the "Temple of Justice" web site.
Well, I like to stay informed.
If following Sheila Temple means you informed,
I don't want to know nothin' about nothin'.
You should bone up on this case, because it's about to become our nightmare.
Hmm.
Oh, you see.
I got this.
Hey, boys, Dr. Ethan Gross.
- How you doing?
- Hell no.
- Let's go...
- You can back your ass
- right back in that elevator.
- Oh, come on, guys.
Just a couple of questions.
- Unh-unh.
I got a couple of answers.
- Just a couple of questions.
- I'd love to.
I just...
- Say it walking.
- Dr. Ethan Gross.
- Move.
- Fine, fine.
- I'm sorry.
Move.
You know, you're a real people person.
It's your gift.
You might want to hold on to this.
This case is gonna suck you in.
Mm-hmm.
Hillary Stone.
Chalk this up to a problem that solved itself.
What does that sign say?
"This is where I get a lecture"
"from Dr. Megan Hunt."
The... oh, I'm sorry.
That's... it's...
"this is where death rejoices to teach the living."
It is never a place where the living disparage the dead, so keep your opinions to yourself and focus on the facts.
Both translations seem to work.
Don't encourage him.
Now...
Yeah.
- Dr. Gross.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Light, patterned abrasions on the right side of her face, cheek and orbit.
Which means the killer might have worn gloves when he hit her.
A theory supported by the indistinct hand impressions on her neck.
Hmm.
Contusions on the posterior lower back, bilaterally, and... she has a 6-inch laceration on her left calf.
Looks like there's trace.
Get a sample and take it to the lab.
And get them to process a sexual assault kit.
We have a tear.
Beaten down and possibly raped.
Somebody really had their way with her.
You don't know the half of it.
She had dirt underneath her eyelids.
So?
So that means she was blinking.
Hillary Stone was buried alive.
Body of Proof 2x13
- Sympathy for the Devil Original air date January 17, 2012
The world's waiting on your determination.
Oh, great.
You know how much I love publicity.
Want me to take it?
Additional findings support the theory that Hillary was beaten and then buried alive.
The only thing she doesn't have are defensive wounds.
It just freaks me out that this hand ended a 5 year old's life.
Alright, Dr. Gross, since you are so fascinated by this case,
I would like you to section all of the organs and then write up the autopsy report.
Get to know Hillary better.
- Trust me.
I know her.
- No, you do not.
You only know what's been said about her.
This is Hillary.
All right.
Can we release cause of death?
My preliminary determination is asphyxiation contributed by agonal aspiration of gastric contents and dirt.
Isn't Bud supposed to be present for this?
Yeah, he's heading downstairs.
Hillary's mother's here.
Ruth Stone has just arrived to identify the body of her dead daughter.
Philly P.D.
Make a path!
I'm not gonna say it twice!
You all right?
They slashed my tires, cracked my windshield, egged my house.
Lord knows what they're gonna do to me.
Well, they'll have to go through me.
- Mrs. Stone.
- Come on.
Mrs. Stone, are you finally ready to break your silence?
Please don't.
Well, what are you feeling right now, Mrs. Stone, grief or relief?
We are so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Stone.
May I see her?
No.
I'm...
I'm afraid that's not possible while the case is ongoing, but soon.
Do you have any idea where your daughter may have gone after her release yesterday morning?
We were supposed to get together... uh, on the weekend.
We hoped that the hubbub would've died down.
Hil had a hard life.
She was always a little bit wild but sweet and joyous.
Then she... entered high school and she met Craig.
He got her pregnant and led her down the wrong path.
I'm sure that you did the very best you could.
But sometimes, holding them close creates more of a distance.
I thought when my beautiful grandson Simon was born, maybe that would've grounded her.
Now they're both gone.
What's she doing here?
Uh, that is my mother.
Your mother must be very proud to have such an accomplished daughter.
Please know that I care about justice for Hillary just as much as she did.
If you'll excuse me?
Have you read the paper today?
I've had enough of the media, thank you.
Well, they wrote an op-ed about me, and it is not flattering.
Mother, everybody knows you handled that case impeccably.
Well, as usual, you've missed the point.
I came here to forbid you to talk to the press, either on your behalf or to defend me.
My election is tomorrow, and this case is poison.
Oh, my God.
Just write a rebuttal.
Get ahead of it.
That's exactly why I'm here, because you think that's a good idea.
No talking, no press.
Okay?
Got it.
Always a pleasure, Joan.
Judge Joan's bungling of the case left Hillary a free woman.
Well, citizens of Philadelphia, let's give her a little brotherly payback.
- Her reelection's up...
- Your mom's taking a bath.
I'm sure her opponent's thrilled.
She doesn't have one.
Huh?
It is a yea or nay vote whether to reconfirm her for another ten years.
So she could lose to nobody?
Isn't there something you should be doing?
Oh, finished sectioning.
Uh, the organs are bagged and back in the body.
I'm just waiting for the lab to e-mail me the, uh, sexual assault results.
In the break room?
Welcome to generation "I."
I mean, here I am, out of the office, still connected.
Why does everybody keep doing that?
Oh, look, you got them five minutes ago.
And they are positive.
What the hell, Ethan?
I'm s... s...
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
Okay, well, maybe I'm not.
Hillary Stone killed her little boy.
She then put him in a sack and dumped him in the river.
Now I know I'm not supposed to let my personal feelings seep in, but... it took a year for them to try to get justice for Simon, and then it didn't happen.
So what's another five minutes?
You may feel that way,
- but get over it.
- Why?
Because we don't pay you to waste my time.
- So I'll call Bud.
- No, you will not.
I'll do it.
I got Hillary's tox results.
I dug around into her personal history.
Do you know, when she was 7, the police found her next to her mother's unconscious body?
Her father's fists were so swollen, he couldn't turn the knob to let the cops in.
Abuse does terrible things to people.
Yeah, and 99% of them channel their damage in other ways.
But they're still damaged, Kate, which is probably why we found booze and Diazepam in her system.
That explains why she didn't fight back.
This whole case just breaks my heart.
Listen, Kojak.
I done it to that wraith.
First of all, my name is detective Morris.
And second of all, no, you didn't.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I took that bitch down.
I don't know why you ain't listening to me.
Maybe because most killers don't voluntarily confess, you know?
Well, it's my conscience.
It's killing me.
Detective Morris...
Oh, no, no.
You got this one.
Every nut job in the city wants credit for offing Hillary.
Yeah, except for the actual killer.
Yeah.
Sexual assault results came back positive on Craig Bena.
Ooh, the ex.
Uh, I'll rustle up an address.
Sadly, I saw a minute of "Temple of Justice" last night.
He's on her show today.
Please, help me find the killer.
They're my family.
And they've been taken away from me.
And the killer is still out there.
What if the same person got both of them?
What if I'm next?
- Just wait right there.
- Thank you.
Uh... someone has to do something.
So please... please... if you know anything...
Uh, Craig, here you go.
You accused the media of vilifying you, yet, here you are on my show, begging for sympathy over Hillary's death.
You invited me.
Oh, apples and oranges, Craig.
Who accepted the offer, huh?
Well, let's ask the pros.
Randy, can I have the mic?
Thank you.
Here is a man some of you may remember as gallantly protecting Hillary's mother this morning, one of Philadelphia's finest.
And then we have Dr. Megan Hunt, daughter of the judge who helped create this mess in the first place.
What have you to say for yourself?
You missed a spot.
Every bit as charming as her mother.
We'll be right back.
- Ronnie, thank you.
- And we're clear.
All right.
So... are you here to finally give me the interview your mother wouldn't?
Right.
Well, whenever you're ready, you know where to find me.
Mm.
Under a rock.
And until then, I think I'll just get back to my guest.
Actually, uh, this interview is over.
What?
Why?
Because it's our turn to talk to the killer.
I am impressed.
Take to the airwaves, profess your innocence, throw the guilt out there somewhere, except everybody knows that... you know that Hillary killed your son.
That is not true.
Hillary's mom certainly thinks so, says you're the reason she went down the wrong path.
Yeah, and she always had it out for me, hated that I actually made her daughter happy.
Do you think that, uh,
Mrs. Stone knows about yesterday?
Because we certainly know you had sex with Hillary.
Care to tell us how that... came to pass, Craig?
The day she got released, she showed up at my place, had a few drinks, and then we made love.
Love?
Well, this... doesn't look... like love to me.
Those marks look like your hands around her neck.
Hil liked it a little rough.
Buried alive kind of rough?
I didn't kill her.
Afterwards, we both fell asleep.
When I woke up, she was gone.
Y... you want me to believe that she just showed up, had her way with you, and then just disappeared?
Yes.
That was life with Hil.
I know it sounds crazy.
It does.
What little I've gleaned from your legendary teaching methods,
I know that only oxygen deprivation can cause darkened cells like that.
Did I teach you that?
Mm.
Hmm.
And, yes, the anoxic brain damage certainly supports asphyxiation.
But you're looking for bigger answers, aren't you?
Not the cause of death, but the cause of life.
Well, everyone says Hillary was such a monster, that she did all these horrible things without any bit of remorse.
Even if that is true, maybe there's something identifiable in the brain.
Sometimes crazy is just crazy.
- It's just in the genes.
- I cannot accept that.
I have the result from the trace on Hillary's leg.
It's a polyepoxide copolymer with a hint of... wait for it... triethylenetetramine.
That's a resin that's used as a sealant around the windows on boats.
- Did I teach you that, too?
- No, believe it or not, my dad did.
Well, get yourself to the marina, skipper, because there's one about a mile from the crime scene.
S... skipper.
Go to work.
Yes.
And why exactly have I met you here?
The cut on Hillary's leg is probably from her being put through a boat window, so if we find a broken one, we could possibly find the killer.
- Okay.
- Are you the cop from TV?
Oh, yes, ladies, this is him, in the flesh.
I told you it was him.
You totally protected that old lady in her car, even though she raised that psycho.
Are you looking for the killer?
Girls, best just let us do our jobs.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Tweet you later.
Bud Morris, you're a superhero.
Notoriety's a double-edged sword, my friend.
Take that old lady who raised her psycho daughter and grandson and had both of them taken away.
What's she left with... slashed tires, egg on her house?
A mother's love turns into a public's hate.
Hey.
You think I killed Hillary?
You're a prison guard.
I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt, but from where I sit, it looks pretty bad, Ms. Raymond.
Look, we bonded during her trial.
That girl... she was innocent.
So I told her, if she needed a safe haven, she could find it on my boat.
Well, it worked like gangbusters.
And then what happened?
Two days ago, Hillary shows up.
I'm headed off to work.
She's messed up, definitely drunk.
- Mm-hmm.
- So I gave her a couple of sedatives.
I locked her in.
I...
I love your concept of safe haven.
It sounds exactly like jail.
It was for her own good.
I didn't want her wandering off, finding herself in harm's way.
She must have woke up and freaked out.
You drugged her and you locked her in.
What did you think was gonna happen?
Come on.
Me and you, we... we're on the same team.
Can't we just see eye to eye?
Are you kidding?
We're processing your boat as we speak.
I'm still trying to figure out Hillary's actions on the day of her release.
She gets out, goes to see her ex-boyfriend, has sex with him, and then comes here.
Why?
Combo lock.
It means that Hillary couldn't get out, but anyone who had the number could enter.
Well, I bet somebody did, otherwise, why would you kick out a window with your bare feet?
Okay, I've got what looks like epithelials.
Collect, label, and let's get out of this dump.
You know what?
My dad would've loved to own a boat like this.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He really couldn't afford to have another kid.
I was adopted because he really wanted a boy.
Some people are meant to be parents.
This case is really bothering you, huh?
The one that bothers me is the one we didn't get to investigate.
So the info about the boat is out there, on Twitter, as a matter of fact, with a hunky picture of Bud attached.
And the media is now trying to align you with your mother, which is doing this office no favors.
Sheila Temple's right outside, waiting for us to trip up.
Uh, I may have something.
Uh, the flakes on the pillowcase contain sebaceous secretions of malassezia furfur and tragacanth.
Dandruff.
Something that Hillary did not have.
Maybe Tanya does.
No, she doesn't.
Just came from holding where I personally checked myself.
We may have her on unlawfully restraining Hillary, but we don't have her on flaky scalp.
So who else was on that boat?
I'll be right back.
Bless you, Amanda,
- and thank you for watching.
- Thank you.
All right?
And good luck.
Mm-hmm, and thank you for coming by.
We'll be here all day.
Ms. Temple.
Oh, are you finally ready for your interview?
Uh, no, no, I would just like a moment in private, please.
Well, whatever you say to me, you can say to my public.
Are you rolling?
Ladies and gentlemen, the interview that only I could score.
Dr. Megan Hunt...
a name which may ring a bell... because she shares it with the woman who let Hillary go free.
My mother adjudicated without bias or error.
Oh, come on.
Including suppressing the bag that was found near poor little Simon's body, which had Hillary's D.N.A. on it?
Wait.
You mean the bag that the prosecution failed to disclose, then lost, then found again?
Judge Hunt did her job, just as I am doing mine.
Well, I'm sure that brings us all a great degree of comfort.
There has been a major break in the case.
Evidence has been found linking someone to the disappearance of Hillary Stone and possibly her murder.
You heard it here first.
Who is it?
You.
Cut.
What is this, some kind of publicity stunt?
Oh, we don't need theatrics, Ms. Temple, because we actually have evidence to back up our claims.
Like what?
You have eczema, which your makeup guy tried to cover, but, mm, really didn't do a very good job.
And because of that, you have to use natural hair spray like naturecoat, which contains tragacanth, flakes of which we found on Tanya Raymond's boat.
A lot of people use natural hairspray, Sherlock.
I would be very happy to scrape your scalp to confirm.
You see, Ms. Temple, we don't take callers or commercial breaks... just confessions.
I had seen the shaky evidence against Hillary.
I knew the case would never make, but I also knew that Hillary would never grant me an interview when she got out.
So you paid her prison guard to get close to her, gain her trust.
That's really classy.
I offered incentives in exchange for drawing Hillary in.
Imagine my delight when Tanya called me on the very day of Hillary's release.
We showed up at the boat with the cameras rolling, burst in.
Al Capone's vault.
I'm gonna need to see that footage, Ms. Temple.
It is your alibi.
Fine.
Oh, my goodness.
The polls are open.
My condolences to your mother's career.
Wow.
Big turnout.
I see you didn't take my advice.
You appeared on that show yesterday and again this morning, stumping for me.
Both times, case related.
That's always your excuse, isn't it?
Well, you just added fuel to the fire.
Mother, you of all people should understand that I want justice for Hillary.
Well, welcome to my world, darling.
The court of public opinion convenes and convicts before charges are brought.
You gotta be kidding me.
You really working that "woe is me" angle?
Do I know you?
No, but I know you.
You put killers back on the street.
I got kids.
I'd like them to be able to walk around without fearing for their lives.
Okay, come on, mom.
No.
No, Megan.
No hooligan is gonna scare me off.
You're going down, just like that bitch you set free.
Behind this door lies an unsuspecting Hillary Stone.
Well, Hillary, get ready... for last call.
It is time to face the...
Oh, for the love of Pete.
She must have gone out the window.
Well, cut, cut, cut.
I am so tired of this sugar!
- You happy?
- No.
I'd like to see everything you shot, please.
My first amendment rights...
Okay, you say first amendment.
I say obstruction of justice.
The judge will say contempt of court.
How long you gonna spend in jail?
Well, you heard him, Mr. man.
Scoot.
Yes, ma'am.
I used to watch you, you know, back when you were a real journalist.
Oh, past tense?
Ouch.
What happened?
Success.
Bigger cases.
You see it, too, detective.
What we do isn't all that different.
Mm.
You're really gonna try that line on me?
You hate me, don't you?
No comment.
Well, off the record...
I don't totally love who I've become either.
Go back to journalism.
We could use you.
What's stopping you?
All cued up to the crime scene, Ms. Temple.
And here are your glasses.
Thank you, Ronnie.
Uh, actually, it's... it's Dan.
But you're welcome, Ms. Temple.
Darren, what are you doing?
I swear to God, the body's over there.
If you do not get me a shot of that body, you're gonna be back shooting bar mitzvahs next week.
Could you stop it right there, please?
Well, I'll be damned.
He was there before the story broke.
I told you, I did her.
I want credit for it.
Walk me through what happened.
Uh, it's... it's, like, dusk.
I'm cutting through the site on my way over to... it don't matter where.
I see this chick.
She's kinda hot.
Looks lost.
Holy crap, it's that baby-killing skank.
So I took her down.
How?
You hit her, kick her, what?
Kicked her first.
Where?
The left, on her left side.
And she bounced off that backhoe.
And then?
And then what?
She lay in the hole and dies like the dog that she was.
That's all I'm saying.
Let's go.
Gotta say, his story holds up.
His story is just what the media's been reporting.
Ah, but that's why I asked about the kick.
Your preliminary autopsy report said that there was a kidney puncture and bruising on the left.
The media doesn't have that detail.
Since when do you read the prelims?
It may surprise you to know, but always.
Are you sure it was the left side?
I know your reports better than you do?
I didn't write it.
That doesn't sound like you.
You're right.
It doesn't.
Contusions and lacerations on the left kidney, just like Victor said.
Something's not right.
What, like you being wrong for once?
I am never wrong.
The body is always right.
And I just don't know Hillary as well as I should.
Left kidney, right kidney.
Left's got the puncture.
Yes, but the rib is fractured on the right.
Call Ethan.
Why?
Because I'm gonna kill him.
What's up, guys?
I'm missing the last frame of league night.
Tell me, Dr. Gross...
Is it possible for a rib to jump across the body and lacerate the opposite kidney?
What?
No.
Then please explain your findings in the autopsy report... mislabeled organs, misattributed injuries, and possibly, the entire case compromised.
Uh...
Uh-oh.
Left side triangles, right side squares... you cut them into different shapes so you do not make rookie mistakes, which you did!
I'm...
I'm...
I'm really sorry.
I'm gonna fix this...
No, you will not touch a thing!
I am sick of your damn attitude, your disrespect towards me, and especially, your disrespect towards Hillary.
Dr. Gross... come with me.
Please find a tech and pull Hillary's body out of the drawer.
Thanks.
I thought I was about to end up on a table.
Still with the jokes, really?
You know, Megan had every right to rip your head off.
What you did is either sabotage, incompetence, or at the very least, negligence.
D... it was one mistake.
On a case where you have made your opinion abundantly known.
Dr. Murphy, I'm so...
You know what, Ethan?
This is a big city.
We're gonna catch big cases.
If you can't handle this kind of thing,
I can recommend a few fellowship programs in Allegheny County.
No, no, no.
I love it here.
It...
I... look, I don't know what it was... the... the media, the pressure, I just...
I took my eye off the ball.
Lame excuses aren't really helping.
Okay.
You're right.
I...
I hate this woman.
I hate that we have to put somebody in jail for this.
So you think, sometimes, it's okay to kill?
Well, no, but she... she...
No, I don't.
I don't.
I'm gonna go apologize to Dr. Hunt.
No, Ethan, you're gonna take the night, clear your head, and we will see you in the morning.
What about you?
You think Hillary Stone killed her son?
Yeah, I do.
And it doesn't matter.
We'll see you in the morning.
Oh, damn it.
So you've heard?
I am so sorry.
I came to tell you myself, but I...
I guess I'm going to have to learn that the media beats you every time.
You okay?
How does the Internet say I'm dealing with it?
Mother, come on.
I never imagined that an entire career could be... undone by two days of bad press.
Frankly, I'm...
I'm shell-shocked.
Mom...
Uh, Hillary's ready for you.
You said it yourself...
I did my job.
Now you go do yours.
I'm really sorry about your mom.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
My mother's tough, so I'm tough.
It's all in the genes, remember?
Ah, there's one.
Two.
Left kidney, no presenting damage, consistent with my original findings.
Right... lacerated and contused.
So Victor didn't do it.
He was just looking for a little fame.
And you were right, as usual.
No, I wasn't.
There is a perinephric hematoma around the vasculature that I missed before.
But a rib can't do that, can it?
No, it can't.
This is usually caused by a dramatic change in momentum.
Like her fall out the boat window.
No, it would take more force than that.
Probably all of the injuries on her left side are from the fall and on the right... the broken jaw, the rib, the lacerated kidney... that comes from some kind of rapid deceleration.
Okay, so?
So this is the missing piece of the puzzle.
Hillary didn't walk to the construction site.
She caught a ride with her killer.
We finally know the timeline of Hillary's last day.
After she was released, she went to see her ex-boyfriend Craig.
Who she slept with, and then for reasons unknown, left to go to Tanya's, where she was taken prisoner, drugged, escaped, and then someone, possibly a stranger...
Or Craig...
Or Craig drove her to the construction site, stopping suddenly enough to send her into the dash.
Which is most likely the patterned impression we found on her jaw.
She was then dragged into a predug hole, which became her grave.
Then we need to find that driver.
Ethan.
Dr. Gross, back in the house.
Dr. Hunt, I...
I apologize for my earlier transgressions.
Let's find this tool.
Knowing we're looking for a vehicle,
I focused on the tread marks from Peter's photos of the crime scene.
Now after, uh, examining Hillary's momentum injuries,
I discovered that she had been traveling at about 35 miles per hour.
So you're looking for a short skid.
I found one.
Two sets of tires, short skid.
Could be the killer's car.
They're clean, unbroken.
It means the car didn't have antilock brakes.
One problem... skid marks don't give tire tread.
You have a shot just past the marks?
Right there.
That's the car driving away, and those are the treads.
Hey, Ethan.
Zoom in.
Enhance.
No, something's wrong.
One is very different from the other three.
Now why would that be?
I might know.
This model doesn't have antilock brakes.
This tire's different.
After it got slashed, she probably got the cheapest replacement.
Detective Morris, Dr. Hunt?
I...
I wasn't expecting you, was I?
I think maybe you were, Mrs. Stone.
You drove Hillary to the construction site.
Your tire treads will place you there.
You didn't come by the morgue to I.D. your daughter, did you?
You came to see her body after what you'd done.
May I see her now?
No.
I'm sorry.
Not under these circumstances.
I'm gonna need to place you under arrest, Mrs. Stone.
Please let me see her.
If you do, I'll tell you everything.
The day she was released, she called me in a panic.
I picked her up at the marina, and I was driving her home.
She told me about her day.
I couldn't... couldn't understand why... why she didn't stay with Craig.
Why?
Then she said... she didn't want to be with Craig.
She just wanted to sleep with him to have another baby.
That's what you said, isn't it, honey?
That you wanted to get it right next time?
And at that moment,
I knew... she'd killed Simon.
I must have... slammed on the brakes.
Hillary...
flew into the dashboard, and... and I reached out to... to see if she was okay.
She looked at me.
She jumped out of the car and... she was running away, and...
I tried to stop her, but... she tripped and... she hit her head.
And when I got to her, she was... lying in that hole.
You weren't moving, honey.
And so I covered you.
We...
I wanted peace for you.
I'm so sorry, baby girl.
I'm so sorry.
It's over now.
It's over.
Oh, my baby.
Ohh.
Yet another shocking turn in the Stone family murders, as grandmother and mother to the victims is arrested in connection with the death of acquitted killer Hillary Stone.
The very woman who sat behind her every day in court...
- Poor woman.
- now sits behind bars...
We're gonna have to put her through the system just like her daughter.
I've been doing this job for many years, people, but today is different.
I've had a real wakeup call.
I may have made missteps... professionally... and personally.
I think I got through to her at least.
So...
I've taken a moment to reflect.
You may be right.
And I've realized that I am disgusted with the likes of Trent Wilcoe, who set his wife on fire... just because she burnt his roast.
Reality check, people.
I'm not the bad guy.
He is.
So join us next week for the trial of the century.
I fell for it just like everybody else.
Until then, goodnight and be good.
I called your office.
They said you were taking a personal day?
I recused myself from the bench effective immediately.
Nobody wants a lame-duck judge.
Mother, I...
I am...
I'm really sorry if anything I said or... or... or did caused you to...
No apology necessary.
I'm making jam.
You are making jam.
Yeah, well, no time like the present.
After all, I need a new career.
Mom... you remember that accident that we had?
When I was about Lacey's age, you were driving me to swim practice, and you skidded on that patch of wet leaves.
Yeah, I hurt my knee because I rear-ended that pickup truck.
Yeah, but I was okay because you did that thing that you do with your arm... reach out and protect me.
Do you know you did that yesterday when you stood up to that idiot?
- I did?
- Yeah.
You mean I still have some maternal instincts?
Nothing stronger.
Well, now there... there may be.
What, jam?
It's mostly bourbon.
Oh, my God.
Whoa.
It's good.
I know.
I've had it all day.
(Crows caw)
(Toto's "Rosanna" playing)
(Singing along) ♪ all I wanna do when I wake up in the morning ♪
♪ is see your eyes ♪
♪ Rosanna, Rosanna ♪
(Frankie) I know what you're thinking.
What am I doing on a walk?
Well, there's only so much you can do when you get fired.
I already laid on the couch, I already ate all the chips.
Actually, I was walking to the store to get more when I discovered walking clears your head.
It really opens your mind to what's around you.
Yep, you never know where a walk will lead.
(Axl and Sue grunting) Oh, right.
Here.
Mom!
Axl ate my cheese and sausage display!
Mom's fault!
Now that she's home, she eats all our food.
I need this display, Axl!
Mom and dad only pay for half my trip to Cincinnati, and we are responsible for fund-raising the other half ourselves.
Oh, this is for you to leave?
How much to get you to Alaska?
Thank you guys so much.
It's a really big deal for the mascot to be asked on the band trip.
Unprecedented, actually.
I am making up a whole new routine for the competition.
Look.
Don't show us too much.
We... wanna be surprised when we see the tape.
I just wish you were still at Ehlert's.
Do you think you're gonna get a new job anytime soon?
Well, it's a big decision, going back to school.
I want to make the right choice.
Hey, what do you think about me being a crime scene investigator, huh?
(Door closes)
A CSI sounds pretty cool at cocktail parties.
There's no crime in Orson...
or cocktail parties. (Liquid spilling)
Brick, why don't you use a bowl?
A plate of water just has a nice ring to it.
So I guess it's my turn to feed the bunny again?
It's always your turn.
It's your bunny.
I didn't ask for it, I didn't buy it, and yet I'm stuck feeding it.
Yeah, join the club.
Mm.
Mm!
(Water spills)
You're making a mess.
Here, give that to me.
You've gotta get to school.
Actually, I was thinking about taking a personal day.
Why?
What's going on in school?
It's just we're getting the human development talk today.
I guess they put girls in one room, boys in the other, and make us all watch this movie,
"what's going on down there?"
And then we talk about it.
Do I have to go?
It's embarrassing.
You don't need a movie.
Here's all you need to know-- before, after. (Laughs) (Crunches)
Don't sweat it, Brick.
You're just growing up.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
And anyway, you already know the basics.
You did have the talk with him, didn't you?
I thought so.
I-I can't remember.
You must have, 'cause I know I talked to Sue.
- Didn't I?
- I don't know.
- But I definitely talked to Axl.
- Okay.
Hang on.
Well, that's what school's for.
(Cereal rattles)
Ha!
Brainstorm.
Since mom has no current place of business, and I already hit all the neighbors, why don't I come to the quarry after school and sell my cheese and sausage there?
Uh, no, Sue, I don't wanna do that.
The guys will feel obligated to buy from you 'cause I'm the boss.
Exactly.
Sorry about this.
You know, kids.
Yeah, kids.
When mine wanted to sell wrapping paper here, you said there was a no soliciting policy at work.
Door's open now, Mike.
My girl's selling popcorn tins again.
She's the only one in her troop that didn't get to meet Jane Pauley last year because of you.
(Lowered voice) I got a hunch she'll be going this year.
Payday.
Mike Heck around?
Uh, no.
He's with the yellow hat guys.
But I'm his daughter.
You can leave it with me.
("Rosanna" playing) You know, this walking thing could really become a habit.
I was noticing things I'd never noticed before.
The Johnsons are growing zinnias, the Butterfields painted their mailbox to look like a cow.
(Door slams)
(Crow cawing)
(Cans clatter)
And Rita Glossner's back.
So guess what I saw on my walk?
Yeah, yeah.
Mailbox like a cow.
You told me.
No.
You're not gonna believe it.
Rita Glossner.
She's back.
Really?
Are we sure she was ever gone?
I don't know, but she's back. (Sighs)
Well, leave her alone.
Just don't start anything.
(Mouth full) Oh, I didn't.
When I saw her, I ran right home.
Good.
Don't even make eye contact.
Aw, Frankie!
I know!
I tried not to, but I think I did.
My eyes were just looking that way, and then she was there, and her eyes were there.
And before I knew it, I was looking at her, and I think she saw me, too.
I didn't mean to!
Oh, stupid eyes.
(Door opens and closes)
(Brick) Ugh.
Thank God that's over.
(Bottles clinking) Oh, right.
How'd the big talk go?
(Refrigerator closes)
Well... (Sighs) The nurse made us watch a movie where a boy kept running around a track.
It was boring, so Dillon Murray made an inappropriate shadow puppet, and everybody giggled and the nurse yelled at us.
Yep, sounds about right.
Then when she put the movie back on, the boy took a cheerleader roller skating and bought her some ice cream.
After he got home, he took a long shower, and a doctor told us not to feel bad about our urges.
Then the girls came back in and they had little pink gift bags that we didn't get.
That doesn't seem fair.
Well, at least you got through it.
Not really.
They're making us have a follow-up discussion next week.
When does all this sex stuff end?
It... tapers off.
Okay.
Well, I guess I'll go look at your bras now.
I'm not sure why, but apparently, it's totally normal.
And you guys are always after me to be normal, so...
Car salesman?
There's a class for that?
Guess I should have taken it.
(Doorbell rings)
I want my hose back.
- What?
- My hose.
You took it.
Now what am I supposed to do, wait for the rain to fill up my pool?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't have your hose.
Right.
I seen you casing my house, walking by, staring at me.
No, no.
I was just...
looking.
N-not even a look.
Just a glance.
Just 'cause we didn't know you were back in town.
You've been gossiping about me behind my back?
No, no.
No one did that.
We were just wondering, you know, a-about your kids.
You got no business wondering about my kids.
My kids were fine.
People was looking in on 'em.
Good.
Good.
That's responsible.
Looking in.
Hey, you know, m-maybe you should ask one of them about your hose.
Maybe one of your boys has it.
You think my kids stole it?
Is that what you're hinting at?
No, no.
I-I never said "stole."
You know, I ought to punch your boobs in.
But I won't, 'cause I'm a lady.
But if that hose ain't back in my yard by tomorrow,
I'm gonna rain fire down on your house.
Well, I won't be able to put it out!
(Clatter)
'Cause I didn't take your hose!
She can't really rain fire, can she?
I mean, she'd have to be Zeus to pull that off.
Oh, Sue, your check and your permission slip are on the table.
But tell 'em not to cash it till Friday.
Oh... yeah.
Turns out I won't need it after all.
I'm not going.
What?
Why not?
Did the trip get canceled?
Uh, they decided mascots weren't allowed anymore.
Oh, well.
Really?
And you were so excited.
What happened?
Uh, yeah.
Apparently they had some concerns.
Uh, it's really hot this year.
Mascots are dropping like flies, and they think we distract from the music.
Also, they're really worried about mascot safety, because too many hours in the giant head can hurt your spine.
That's actually a big one.
I should have said that one first.
Oh, honey, that really sucks.
I know how much you were looking forward--
(Clattering, motor revving)
Mike wanted to call the cops, but I knew that'd only make things worse.
So the next day,
I asked Axl to keep an eye on the house-- a job he took surprisingly seriously.
Okay.
I checked the whole neighborhood, but this is all the poop I could find.
I was hoping for more ammo, but that'll do.
Water balloon?
It's not water. (Laughs) You know.
(Rustling)
It's me, Sue.
You guys...
I have to tell you something.
I don't know if I should say, but it's just so big, I can't hold it in anymore.
Mom and dad have been keeping a terrible secret from us.
We're poor!
Oh, no.
What'll they say at the club?
It's the truth, Axl.
I accidentally peeked at dad's paycheck and saw how much money he makes.
Sue, we go out after tornadoes looking for clothes.
We know.
We have to do something to help.
I gave up my trip so they don't have to pay for it, and you guys better start thinking of ways we can save money, too.
No way.
It's their fault.
They don't know how to budget.
They should have stopped having kids after me.
You guys are the real money drain with your braces and your special school.
I don't go to a special school.
You don't?
I just feel so bad for them.
They must be so worried all the time.
That's probably why they're so cranky.
Right.
These might not even be their real personalities.
They could be lovely people.
We don't know.
Oh, I just wish I'd never looked at that stupid paycheck.
Stop whining.
It's about time you joined the real world.
Welcome to adulthood.
Now arm yourselves with a poop bomb and get ready to throw.
Ugh.
Mm.
Here.
Take these outside.
The boys are eating in the bunker tonight.
Frankie...
Well, we can't just abandon it.
It's almost dark.
That's prime Glossner time.
Our kids are living in an old picnic table.
Even for us, that's weird.
Look, I've got a plan to fix this.
Let's say we buy her a new hose, just to keep the peace.
We can't do that.
That's admitting guilt.
Rain of fire, Mike.
Rain of fire.
So that's it?
This is our life now?
Pretty much.
Unless I end up being a really successful... car salesman.
Seriously?
(Both crunching)
(Exhales)
You know, I should probably stay here and keep guard tomorrow, too.
Guess I'll never know what's going on down there.
Dude, you're gonna want to know that stuff.
Trust me, one day, you're gonna be just as excited about girls as you are about books.
I don't really see that happening.
Okay.
When you go a day without reading a book, how do you feel?
Like I'm going crazy.
I just wanna get my hands on one.
Exactly.
That's how you're gonna feel about girls some day.
I don't know.
I'm still confused about all that stuff in the movie.
Maybe I should just go to the library and research it.
You don't need the library.
That's what the ax-man's for.
Huh?
Let me break this down for you...
So over the next two hours, Axl explained everything... in graphic detail.
And that's... why you gotta pretend to listen when chicks talk about their feelings.
I know, I know.
Not my best moment.
Mike's usually pretty smart about things.
But if you ask me,
$13.99 is a small price to pay for peace.
Like the Peyton Manning football I gave him that wasn't really signed by Peyton Manning, he just doesn't need to know.
Wow.
For someone with such big feet, she sure is quiet.
What are you doing in my yard?
Oh, I, uh, was, uh, walking at night, you know, like I always do.
You've probably seen me.
And I noticed that, uh, oh, your hose is here after all.
Isn't that funny?
(Laughs)
That's not my hose.
Oh, I don't know.
I'm pretty sure it is.
It looks like it.
Squirts water.
Mine's orange.
Really?
Huh.
Who would have guessed?
That's such a rare color.
Well, a hose is a hose.
Here, go ahead.
Take it.
I don't want that crappy hose.
Well, yeah, this is even better.
I mean, your hose was old and beaten up, and look-- this is all shiny and brand-new.
You sure do know a lot about my hose for someone who didn't take it.
Hose thief!
Okay, that's it.
I am a good neighbor.
I don't steal.
My family doesn't steal.
Your family's the one who steals!
I don't like what you're implying.
I'm not implying anything.
It's a fact.
Your kids are a bunch of hooligans!
They take everything in the neighborhood-- bikes, toys, shrubbery.
Don't you talk about my kids.
Them's good boys.
- Where you been at?
!
- None of your damn business.
(Burps)
You expect me to believe that you're dumb enough to bring back a hose that you didn't even take in the first place?
Fine.
You know what?
I tried to be nice, but I'm done.
I'm taking it home.
It's my hose now.
Oh, so you're gonna steal it a second time?
You said you didn't want it!
It's on my property!
No!
I'm taking it back!
Let go!
You let go!
It's not your hose, lady!
You said you didn't want it!
Give it!
Uhh!
(Clink)
Ow. (Exhales)
Morning.
Morning.
Is there coffee?
Yep.
Somethin' wrong?
(Pouring coffee) Okay, if I tell you, you have to promise not to get mad.
I can't make that promise.
(Coffeepot clatters) Something happened last night.
What the hell?
- How'd you do that?
- I went over to the Glossners'.
Frankie, I told you that was a bad idea.
She didn't hit you, did she?
No, the hose did.
What, she found the hose?
Not exactly.
(Sighs) Look, I know you didn't love the idea, but I bought her a new hose and went over there to leave it.
But Rita caught me, and she called me a thief, which, I mean, come on.
So we got in a fight, and the hose chipped my tooth.
Listen, I don't want to hear a bunch of "I told you sos."
How many do I get?
Give me a number.
Look, I did the honorable thing and snuck over there in the middle of the night.
Could you cover your mouth while you talk?
It's that noticeable?
You're actually starting to look like you're in our income bracket.
(Sighs) It's that bad, huh?
Ah, I'd better call the dentist and see if he can squeeze me in before Ehlert realizes I'm still on his insurance.
(Doorbell rings)
Mr. Heck, how are you?
Fine.
Sue, your friends are here!
(Sue) Be out in a minute!
Brad and I are taking Sue to the mall, but don't worry, we're not gonna spend any money.
Because things don't make you happy.
People do.
But if Sue wants a Fro-Yo, I can pay for it with the money I made juggling at the ren fair this summer.
That's short for "renaissance."
You don't have to explain everything.
Oh!
I almost forgot.
I come bearing gifts.
For Brick, some of my favorite hand-me downs.
For Mrs. Heck, the Ali MacGraw yoga workout.
It's like an antidepressant in a VHS tape.
And for you, Mr. Heck, a hug.
Hey, Sue!
You don't want to keep your friends waiting!
Anyway, uh, it's nice of you guys to get Sue out of the house.
She's been kind of down since they told her that the mascots can't go on that trip.
What?
Yeah, they can.
No, I think you're wrong, Carly.
You know what?
Uh, you guys go on ahead.
I gotta talk to Sue about something.
Okay, but remember, Mr. Heck,
I'm not just her friend.
I'm here for you, too, 24/7.
Tweet me.
We can also Facebook, Skype, G-Chat.
- You want me to write this all down?
- I'm good.
(Whispers) Okay.
Hey.
So I was just wondering, who exactly decided you couldn't go on this trip?
I saw your paycheck, okay?
(Gasps)
I am so, so sorry.
It was just sitting there on the desk, a-and they didn't lick the sticky part, so it was open, and I looked, and I saw how much you make, and my trip costs too much money.
I don't wanna go!
What?
Sue, what are you talking about?
I know you don't get paid a lot of money.
A-and I am a horrible person because I am always asking for stuff, and mom doesn't have a job, and you work all the time, and our TV has a weird, squiggly line down the middle.
But just last week, I had mom buy me a "girls rule the world" pencil case.
I am so selfish!
Sue, you're not selfish.
You're a normal kid.
But I already know girls rule the world.
So do I really need to read it on a pencil case?
It's like I am just throwing money away!
Hey, hey, stop.
Okay, listen, you're right.
I am?
Yeah.
We don't have a lot of extra money right now.
Oh.
Okay.
But it's not your job to worry about it.
I'm the dad.
It's my job.
And I say "no" to plenty of stuff.
And this trip is a big deal.
You worked hard.
So... we can do it.
But your paycheck.
If that's what you make every two weeks, my trip is too expensive.
Sue, you didn't look close enough.
I get paid every week.
You do?
Yeah.
Now go get your costume.
The band needs its chicken.
Are you sure?
Go, honey.
Have a good time.
I'm going to a band competition in Cincinnati!
How could I not?
!
Aah!
(Chuckles)
(Sighs)
You get paid every two weeks.
Yeah.
But just like that autographed Justin Bieber hat we got her, she doesn't need to know.
(Southern accent) It's a mighty fine thing you done.
Go get that fixed.
(Normal voice) On my way.
(Water flowing)
(Scoffs) Are you kidding me?
Brick, where did you get this?
Oh, I took it from the Glossners.
What?
And the whole time I've been talking about the hose that Rita thinks I stole, you didn't say anything?
Oh, I thought you were talking about panty hose.
(Engine starts)
Okay, look, we just have to get rid of this before anybody finds out.
Are you sure it's even the Glossners'?
I think they might have stolen it from the Donahues.
Yeah, well the Donahues aren't gonna punch my boobs in, so we're getting rid of it anyway.
(Shifts gears) And, Brick, we never speak of this again.
Just like that autographed X Games posters we got Axl.
(Tires screech)
Seriously, how does she keep doing that?
(Crows cawing)
Where are you both sneakin' off to?
Just going to the dentist to get my tooth fixed. (Chuckles)
I did that once on a cop's belt.
(Laughs)
That's really funny.
Well, we should go.
Nobody to watch him, so he's gotta come with me.
Not that our house is empty right now.
I know where my hose is.
(Chuckles nervously) We don't.
(High-pitched voice) Whoop.
(Whispering) Whoop.
I'm lying.
Somebody put it back on my lawn.
The orange one?
Oh.
Well... huh.
Wow.
That's great that you got it back.
When us Glossners make a mistake, we admit it.
That's why so many of us is in jail.
We've got integrity.
Oh, yeah.
That's-- that is honorable.
I appreciate it.
So I want you all to come over Sunday for a pool party.
That's not necessary.
I don't want to owe you nothing.
You're coming.
Okay.
Great.
(Chuckles) See you then.
I never did find out how that hose got to Rita. (Tires screech)
Probably some other scared neighbor.
But it's the Glossners, so Brick and I made ours disappear, just in case.
Brick and I never talked about that night again.
But he did have a lot to say on another subject.
Does anyone have any questions?
When chicks "want it,"
do they want it right away, or can I finish my book first?
He told the kids everything Axl had told him.
And the nurse told us... and we told Axl.
At least he had the right info, 'cause it turned out, we hadn't talked to any of the kids.
Yep.
You start going off on a walk, and you never know where it'll lead.
If I hadn't gone for a walk that day,
I wouldn't have chipped my tooth, which sent me to the dentist's office, where I learned the girl that put the squirty thing in my mouth is well paid and gets to wear comfy shoes all day... which led me to finally settle on my new career--
dental assistant.
'Cause believe me, if there's one thing I've learned, teeth are important.
- Another beer?
- Sure.
Then run over to your house and get us some.
I'll keep an eye on your kids.
(Children shouting playfully)
- So where'd you grow up?
- Everywhere.
Nowhere.
I grew up in a fairground.
I can't get it out of me head.
I saw him!
The day he went missing!
I am not gay.
- I'm sorry, Mia.
- What for?
I'm so sorry.
Both jobs need to be done on the same day.
You know how it works.
If I don't kill them, they'll kill you.
-This job's really important, Mia.
- I know.
Come on.
No, I'll wait here for you.
You'll miss all the fun.
Look!
Are you next?
Whoo!
Go on, Ryan.
Where you going?
Home.
I don't feel well.
- Go on, Ryan.
You can win.
- Go on, Ryan.
Line it up.
- Yeah!
Go on, Ryan.
- Whoo!
Who's next?
Come on, six shots and you win a teddy bear.
Come on, now.
Mum, it's me.
It's Ryan.
Ryan's gone.
It's me, Mum.
It's Ryan.
Hello, Mum.
Who's your friend?
It's your brother.
Hello, Philip.
Ryan?
It's Mia now.
Dad was right.
You are a freak.
And you're a cunt, just like he was.
Get out, you little freak.
I've come to see Mum.
And I said get out!
Come on, Mum.
You're coming with me.
Mum.
- Ryan!
- Get out!
Say that you're a real boy.
A real boy.
You know what it is.
Say it.
Say that you're a real boy.
If you don't, I'll fucking scalp you,
I...
I swear to God.
Say it.
Say it.
I'm a real boy.
I'm a real boy.
There's a good boy.
There's a good boy.
Riley, what are you doing here?
I don't know.
Are you ok?
They found John.
He's dead.
Whoo!
I did it, Penny.
I killed John.
I said I killed John.
- Where the fuck is she?
- She'll come back.
When?
She's been ages.
- She might be working.
- She would have told us.
What happens if she's in another accident?
Stop following me, Liam.
Stupid bitch.
I knew something like this'd happen.
I knew she'd fuck up sooner or later.
I'm gonna tell her as well when she gets back.
Ryan.
Is Mia here?
No, she's not, mate.
Why?
We don't know where she is.
She went missing at the fair the other night.
Right.
Come on.
Have you seen our Mia, Levi?
No.
Levi?
- What are you doing here?
- Never mind about that.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for Mia.
She's gone missing.
How did you know where to find me?
-Mia brought us here one time.
- How'd you get here now?
Ben brought me.
Fuck's sake.
- Try there.
- Thanks.
Tell her I need to speak to her.
D'you want me to come with you?
You've got things to do here.
I'll see you at home later, yeah?
Fuck!
Who is it?
It's me!
Ryan?
Mia?
What's happened?
Mia, are you ok?
-What are you doing here, Ben?
- Mia, please listen.
Please.
I were pissed and I were...
I were confused about us.
But... it's made me realise how much I like you.
And how much I want you.
So you're not confused any more?
It's all ok, is it?
You're ok with me, with what I am?
- Was she good, by the way?
- Mia, don't...
Just get out, Ben.
Are you coming back?
Please come home, Dad.
How'd you find out where my place was?
I went to see Eddie.
He said he needs to speak to you.
And Levi was there, at Eddie's.
"Where the fuck have you been?"
- Something came up.
- "What?
What came up?"
I don't wanna talk about it.
What about the second job?
You were supposed to do them on the same day.
"We could be in deep shit if you don't get it done soon."
I know.
I'm sorry.
It'll get done tomorrow.
Yeah, make sure it does.
And no fuck-ups.
What's going on?
- They're arresting Riley!
- What for?
They wanna question her about John's murder.
- Eh?
- Fucking wanker.
Stop it.
She didn't do it.
How do you know?
Do you know who did?
Did Uncle Liam kill John?
- No.
- So who did, then?
I don't know.
Why did he say he did?
He must have had a good reason to.
Why are you still working for Eddie when I asked you not to?
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's got everything to do with me.
So are you gonna tell us what happened?
Where have you been?
I found out family's got fuck all to do with blood.
Where you going?
Hello?
Lee, what have you done?
I want Uncle Liam.
- Ryan.
- What...
You know why you love yourself so much.
Cos you haven't got the capacity to love anyone else.
You're not human.
You're a fucking animal.
A heartless coward fuck.
Do you wanna come with me, Mum?
You're an animal, Ryan.
You're just like he is.
You're just like your father was.
Do you know why he's like that, Mum, why I'm like this?
Because you let it happen.
And you were right the first time.
Ryan's gone.
I'm sorry, Mia.
Let's go.
Uncle Liam's gonna be fine, baby.
Sometimes having a brother is better than having a superhero.
Who's she?
This is my mum.
Mum, this is my son.
Ryan.
Do you want me to show you around?
That'd be nice, Ryan.
It's happening.
I give you my word.
We'll sort it tomorrow.
- She better fucking had.
- Mia?
What's she gotta do?
How many times do I have to tell you about asking fucking questions?
Don't talk to me like a piece of shit, Eddie.
Who the fuck d'you think you're talking to?
Shut up!
Shut up!
Mum?
What you doing?
What you doing?
I think she's had a shit.
Is your baby gonna smell like that?
All babies smell like that.
-Have you got any nappies?
- No.
Have you got anything?
Why'd you bring her here?
Mum can't cope.
Right, you get the food out of t'bucket and put it in t'trays.
Mummy said Uncle Liam's gonna be fine.
We'll go and visit him as soon as we can, ok?
Just off to work.
See you all later.
We'll have a party, yeah?
Show Mum how we do things round here?
- I booked a room.
-Certainly, sir.
Your name, please?
- Simon Richie.
-How many nights' duration was it?
- Three.
-And how will you be paying?
Cash.
Fuck.
Pack your things.
We gotta leave.
What's happened?
I can't explain.
Just please go pack.
Tell us why.
Levi, please, just trust me.
- Are we in trouble?
- No, just...
-We're going away for a little while.
- Where to?
- I don't know.
- Fuck that.
-I'm going nowhere without Sophie.
- Levi.
Levi...
Shit.
Come on, let's go.
I'll get it!
- Who is it?
- It's me.
What?
What the fuck?
Don't upset her any more.
Aye.
What are you packing for?
We're leaving.
Mia, please, don't go.
We can sort this out.
Don't flatter yourself, Ben.
I'm not going because of you.
I love you.
What happened?
Ryan, he... he hit me.
He said I'd best not upset you.
Mia, I am so sorry for what I did.
It's not about that, Ben.
This can't work, can it?
I don't care.
Are you ready to go?
We're not going anywhere without Levi.
Ryan, where are you going?
I'm going to say goodbye to the pigs.
Still not back?
One on one.
One at a time, right?
Go on.
Go on.
And another.
I'm sorry, Mia, but if I don't kill you...
They'll kill you.

All units, A-25 reports they have a suspect fitting the description in custody at 2nd Street and Manhattan Place.
L.A.P.D. officers start every shift knowing they might only have a fraction of a second to make a difficult choice.
The ramifications will last their whole lives.
Good to know.
Doctor say when the bandage is gonna come off?
A couple days.
They check you for rabies?
Never know.
Well, if I start frothing at the mouth, you can just call an ambulance.
Yeah.
I was gonna call animal control.
It's too bad your neck mobility is compromised.
I was gonna let you drive today.
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.
Missed my lucky day.
- Jessica Tang?
- Yeah?
I'm really sorry.
My dad's a cop -- 25 years, N.Y.P.D.
You've been served.
Sorry again.
Good morning!
Need a nap already, Sherman?
We were both up half the night, John.
Only difference is, I was with a girl, as opposed to looking at one online.
Hey, you didn't go to that country-girl bar again, did you?
That dump is STD Central.
I met her at the gym.
At Curves.
She's a yoga instructor.
Let me tell you, her downward dog is amazing.
Hello.
The best part is, she works for Princess Cruises, so, uh, she's not gonna be back for the next three weeks.
Binge and purge.
You are my guru, Sherman.
Ai-yee.
Let's roll, man.
What's up with him?
If my partner was getting laid like that,
I wouldn't want to hear about it, either.
You're right.
Breakfast of champions.
Got a call.
Lincoln Heights.
Uh, step into my office before you head out.
It will only take a sec.
You want to tell me why you've been here, burning the midnight oil?
There's no approval for overtime, you know.
I'm not gonna sue the city, if that's what you're worried about.
I just got a little behind.
I'm catching up.
You feeling any better?
What?
You've been dragging.
Heard you weren't feeling well.
It's just a bug.
You can level with me, Lydia.
Woman to woman.
I'll let you know if something comes up.
I got to go.
That traffic is gonna be a bear.
What's up?
We got a body in Lincoln Heights.
Okay.
Let's go to Lincoln Heights.
You hear that shit about Cooper?
It's crazy, right?
Some asshole latched on to his neck like a Pterodactyl.
The R.A. got to him just in time.
I signed, you know.
Closed the deal on the house.
Signed all the paperwork last night.
I'm all in.
Even got my Costco card.
Can't get much more "all in" than that.
What's up, Ben?
Merkle.
Thank God we got that thing with the pipe worked out, right?
Oh.
Dodged a bullet there, didn't we, chief?
Imagine how many of these assholes are telling the truth.
- Kind of scary, isn't it?
- Get lost, man.
What's your problem?
Little lovers' quarrel with your girlfriend there?
I'm glad you guys got to catch up, but me -- I'm sick of paying little Nate's babysitter overtime, so let's finish on time today.
What do you say, Benji?
We, uh -- we in a hurry to get somewhere?
Not doing anything to dispel the, uh, Asian-driver stereotype.
Got an invitation to my, uh,
Academy reunion.
Kind of hoping they wouldn't get around to it.
Started out with 90.
There's 21 of us left.
Rather do shots of battery acid than spend the night with some of those guys.
Look, a subpoena's a real rough way to start the day, all right?
I know a lawyer downtown.
Helped me with some legal matters once.
He's a piece of work, but, uh, the kind you don't mind having on your side.
I'm not getting sued.
Black S.U.V.
Roll up on him.
I'll have him move.
You gonna write him a ticket?
Yeah.
Jerks like this -- they cause bottlenecks.
Sir, you realize you're backing up traffic all the way around the block?
I'm sorry.
I'm picking up my wife.
She has a broken leg.
Yeah.
I'm gonna issue a citation.
I'll -
- I'll just move the car right now.
No.
License, registration, proof of insurance, please.
Oh, here she comes.
License, registration, proof of insurance, sir.
Registration.
My license.
I'm sorry.
I --
All around the block!
I'm sorry.
I...
Let me get that for you, ma'am.
Thanks, officer.
You got it.
Honey, just hand me the crutches.
Hey, you.
Sign here, please.
Okay.
I'm really sorry.
We looked for a spot.
You know what?
Apology's just not gonna cut it right now.
C-can you just make sure that the girls don't tape over it?
Especially not with that Kardashian garbage.
Thank you, baby.
That is why I love you.
See you tonight.
It's the game tonight.
What the hell did we do before DVRs?
You a hoops fan?
You say something to Fernandez?
About what?
Me not feeling well.
Oh, you mean that...
Looking seasick, making 20 bathroom breaks a day?
Look, I'm sorry.
I know it's a touchy subject.
Somebody's saying something.
Hey, it ain't me.
It ain't my business.
How you doing?
Robinson.
Adams.
Bellia.
Victim's over here.
He just got out of county last week.
For what?
Eight months.
Possession with intent.
Word is he went right back to the streets, working out of the alley.
Drugs still on him?
- No.
- Robbery?
Maybe, or a deal gone south.
Any witnesses?
No.
How many hits?
I counted eight.
Whoever put him down did not want him to get back up.
So, did you, uh, have to dust off this citation book before you wrote that ticket?
Jerk knew he was breaking the law.
Well, you know, it is a slippery slope.
First it's double parking, then it's triple homicide.
Got to really keep your eyes open for them jaywalkers.
I need coffee.
What?
Nothing.
Got a problem with my caffeine intake?
Nope.
Knock yourself out.
My husband's divorcing me, in case you were wondering what was in the envelope.
I didn't even know you were married.
Yeah.
Six years.
In sickness and in health, till irreconcilable differences do us part.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah.
Deadbeat's gonna get half my pension.
I guess that year of couples' counseling was time well spent.
Any available unit, neighbor dispute at 660 Barton Avenue.
A-57, show us handling.
A-57, Roger.
Yoga instructor has a friend.
Teaches Pilates.
Gorgeous.
I talked you up.
I got her number for you.
There it is.
Oh.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Calmate.
Calm down.
What happened?
Hey, don't worry about it, bro.
I'll make sure they don't go hungry.
We had a truck together.
He steals my molé negro and starts his own!
I didn't steal nothing, bitch.
Now he takes space?
You snooze, you lose, bro.
He ain't even Oaxacan!
He's from Glendale!
Okay.
Whose truck is this?
That's mine.
I put everything I had into it.
I'm here every day.
Those are my customers!
Okay, listen.
I am very sorry, but he was here first.
There's nothing you can do.
As long as he keeps the meter full, you're gonna have to move your truck.
Sorry, bro.
Hey, you should call la migra, man.
That bitch ain't legal.
This isn't Arizona, pal.
And you know what?
For the record...
Yeah?
I didn't steal that fool's molé, man.
He's high.
All right.
Thanks.
No, no, no, no!
Not my truck, man!
Oh, son of a bitch!
Hey!
Ohh!
Son of a bitch!
Get back!
Oh, man!
Turn it off!
Turn off the car!
Demolition derby's over!
Get out of here!
Come here.
Come here!
He made me do it.
Bitch, you wrecked my truck for molé?
!
- Back off!
- I'm pressing charges!
I'm gonna sue his ass!
Good luck.
All my money's back in Oaxaca.
What?
!
Come on.
Let's go.
- We were supposed to be partners.
- Idiot!
You thought you knew the guy, huh?
Never expected a knife in the back?
He took everything from me.
Yeah, well, some guys you just can't trust.
All right, look.
I get it, okay?
I shouldn't have accused you of anything, all right?
Mea culpa.
My bad.
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.
I'm sorry, all right?
!
- Officer.
- Hey, not right now, buddy!
I paid for my burrito, but he rammed the other little guy's truck before I could get it!
Yeah.
You know what?
There's a Taco Bell across the street.
A-36, requesting a traffic unit at our location --
Boyle Avenue and 1st Street.
You know who shot him?
Not yet.
Someone trying to steal your boyfriend's supply, maybe.
I asked Cam to stop dealing, but he just wouldn't give it up, even after I told him the news.
Brenda, when's the last time you saw him?
Couple days ago.
Did he mention anyone after him or getting into any arguments?
Too many arguments to count.
Cam said the only way to survive on the streets -- never let anyone push you around.
I never would have made it without him.
I was 15 when I left home.
He dealt.
I shot up.
Just the way we got by.
What about when you got pregnant?
I gave rehab a try when he went to jail.
Been clean eight months.
Good for you.
Thanks.
I work at the Vons now -- full time.
And I get benefits...
for my baby.
I turned things around, but Cam just...
He just couldn't.
Things have been tough for you.
And you're gonna get through this, too.
Brenda, can you think of anyone he might have gotten into an argument with?
Easy cream, easy sugar?
Jess?
Hispanic male by the Chevy.
Hey, let me see your hands!
Hi.
Hey, put your hands, both of them, on the top of the car.
Let's go.
What?
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Kick your legs open.
Kick them open!
What are you doing?
I wasn't doing anything.
Following directions?
Huh?
What were you doing near the vehicle, sir?
It's my car.
Yeah?
Let's see the registration, then.
I can't.
My keys are locked inside.
I can't get in.
I'll go get the slim Jim.
Did you get lost?
Where were you?
Courtyard behind the bank.
They got benches over there.
Tried you on the radio.
Yeah, I don't know.
You ready to roll?
You didn't want to eat lunch with me?
What are you, in the 3rd grade?
Look, I said I was sorry.
What do you want me to do, get down on my knees?
I'm not really in the mood for a blowjob, but thanks.
You gonna do this passive-aggressive shit all day?
Can we talk about this?
Talk about what?
What happened!
All right.
Let's start with the fact that every day,
I got to watch my back -- guns, knives, people with camera phones, hoping that we, uh, screw up.
This car's the one place where somebody's supposed to have my back.
Instead, you question my integrity.
My partner.
You know what?
I'm glad you did it, 'cause now I know where we stand.
Don't sweat it.
He's not gonna file a complaint.
He resisted.
Resisted?
You slammed him up against his car because he misplaced his keys.
Look, I get it, all right?
Most people, when they get blindsided by bad news, they just hide behind their computer and phone their job in.
We don't get that luxury.
I wasn't blindsided.
What?
Divorce -- it didn't come out of the blue.
I think he only hung on as long as he did because I got the shit beat out of me.
Yeah, he would have been a real bastard if he had dumped me while I was in traction.
Let's go.
I really jacked someone up, huh?
For locking himself out of the car?
Pretty much.
We'll, uh, go get drinks tonight.
You can bitch all you want.
Your parents home?
What took you so long?
I called over an hour ago.
You called a noise complaint in on yourself.
Hurry up.
Come in.
This your party?
Yeah.
Mazel tov.
Where are your parents?
I told them they were cramping my style.
So they left you here alone?
For a couple hours.
Look, I need you to shut it down.
What?
Shut the party down?
You saying you want us to end your Bar Mitzvah party?
Could you throw me up against the wall and cuff me, too?
That would be so badass.
I-I'm trying to work this girl, and I need to do something epic.
How 'bout you turn the music down now before we call the parents of every kid in here and epically embarrass you?
S-she's way out of my league.
Wait a sec.
Which one?
Red dress.
Sure you can handle it?
I'm a man now.
I can take it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, turn that music down!
Turn the music down!
Up against the wall.
You're under arrest, okay?
Whoa.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you do or say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak with an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
Do you understand these rights as they have been read to you?
Huh, punk?
I'm not an idiot!
Yeah?
I think you are an idiot.
I think you're trouble!
Nothing but trouble!
We'll drop him off down the block, make his year.
Let's go!
Oh, the liquor store down the street from the murder scene -- they have a surveillance camera.
You catch anything?
We're checking.
An energy bar for lunch?
Come on.
No.
Have half of my sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly?
No, thank you.
What's wrong with -- my wife made this.
Did ballistics check those shell casings?
They were .40 caliber.
I put the word out, but there's really no shortage of lowlifes willing to put a bullet in a dealer for his stash, you know?
Not a bullet -- eight, at close range.
That doesn't sound like a robbery to me.
That sounds personal.
Well, I'll check with narcotics, see if our victim was stepping on anybody's turf.
Maybe it's payback -- like, he pissed somebody off in jail.
It's a damn shame, too, 'cause I bet he probably would have been father of the year.
You know, back in the '30s, some prisons used to sterilize their female prisoners to prevent them from having babies?
Mm.
That's screwed up.
Not saying it's cool.
I'm just saying -- addict mom, dealer dad.
Chances are, this kid is just gonna follow in his parents' footsteps.
I wouldn't give up on the mom quite yet.
She was barely holding it together.
Yeah, well, after living a life like that, she's got to be pretty tough.
All I'm saying is I've seen it too many times.
Clock's ticking till this kid ends up in foster care.
Adams.
Yeah.
Be right down.
Surveillance caught a car on camera.
We got a plate.
Mm.
All units, home invasion in progress -- 216 Gramercy Place.
A-57, show us responding.
216 Gramercy Place.
Roger, 57, handle code 3.
He's going.
Gun!
A-57, requesting backup!
216 Gramercy Place!
Blue Toyota headed south toward Wilshire!
License plate 2-Sam-Adam-Mary-5-6-4!
I'll cut him off!
A-57 in foot pursuit eastbound towards Western!
Aah!
Way!
Go in the house!
Lock the door -- now!
A-57, we now have shots fired.
All units, A-25 reports they have a suspect fitting the description in custody at 2nd Street and Manhattan Place.
A-57, I need an R.A. Unit at my location.
Victim of a gunshot wound.
Jess!
Saw a gun.
Fired.
The ambulance is on its way.
What are you doing?
Triage.
He's breathing, but it's shallow.
We need to stop the bleeding.
Here.
You apply pressure.
I'll start CPR.
Okay.
Stay with me, all right?
You okay?
Yeah.
He had a gun.
I just...
Well, gray hoodie.
I just came back, turned the corner, there's a man pointing a gun at me...
Yeah.
It was a clean shooting.
Was something down by his feet?
What?
When I came in, you were down by his feet.
Yeah.
I was securing his gun.
I mean, who -- who, you know, hears sirens and runs out with a toy gun?
Coop, Tang.
I need you to separate.
Shuman from F.I.D. is on his way.
All right, you know the rules.
Separate corners until after the debrief.
Tang.
Let's go.
See you later.
There's our silver Ford Focus.
Mm-hmm.
Rhonda Owens?
I figured you'd show up here eventually.
He's a good boy.
He didn't mean no harm.
Cam Huggins.
Who?
No, my son.
Stealing the cable TV so I could watch "Monday Night Football."
Oh.
Is that your car in the driveway?
Yeah.
When's the last time you drove it?
When I went to vote for Obama!
Have you lent anybody your car recently?
If five years ago is recent.
No.
It's not.
This is not about the cable TV?
No plates.
Uh, no, ma'am.
And, uh, we're sorry to have bothered you.
Thank you.
Football.
I came through the driveway and around the corner.
I saw a dark-dressed individual here with a gun.
I fired one round from my service weapon, aimed for center mass, saw the suspect go down.
And when you saw it wasn't the suspect?
I radioed for an R.A. Unit, and I immediately tried to stop the bleeding.
Kid has a record.
Three months in juvie.
Broke a teacher's nose.
You believe that?
You want some coffee or something?
Something to eat?
No.
Come on, man.
I hate babysitting as much as you hate being babysitted, but that's the rules.
At least put me to good use.
Stupid kids, running around with toy guns.
When they gonna take them damn things off the shelf, anyway?
I mean, how the hell are you supposed to tell the difference between that and a real Sig 9mm...
From here?
Cooper.
We're gonna be a while.
We'll talk back at the station.
My car's out front.
What happened?
!
Is it Derrick?
Where is he?
!
He's at Mercy.
We'll take you.
He was doing better, back in school.
He swore he wouldn't take the tip off that toy gun.
Promised me.
Shooter was smart.
He used the old lady's plates just in case his car was spotted.
Premeditated.
At least we know he drove a Focus.
We can cross-check it with other dealers and ex-cons in the area.
Detective Adams.
Hey, Ross.
How's your mom?
In remission.
Doing good.
Thanks.
Listen, were you on the lookout for a .40 caliber?
Yeah, for a murder in Lincoln Heights.
Well, we just picked up a punk -- had three baggies of heroin and a .40 caliber Ruger on him.
Know what part of town he worked?
Or if he ever spent any time in county?
No.
Claims he bought the gun this morning.
Well, take the gun to ballistics, and we'll see if it's a match.
What?
Uh, says he bought it off some pregnant lady.
Thanks, Ross.
Hey, John.
You almost done in there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just, uh...
Finishing up.
They're ready for you.
Look, you have every right to be pissed off, okay?
I would be, if it were me.
For what it's worth,
I've been beating myself up about it.
Sam.
Crazy Carol.
Tried to get her help, but they're not gonna take her at St. Joe's again.
She's got a hell of a right hook.
Yeah.
She's only a danger to herself.
Carol!
Officer Bryant.
Remember me?
You raped me.
No, I did not rape you, okay?
Let's -- let's get you out of the street.
No, don't come near me!
No!
He raped me!
Ohh!
Carol, don't do that to yourself.
Should we take her in?
There's no law against beating the crap out of yourself.
She's got to do it somewhere else.
Come on, man!
I got a meeting!
If you're important, they'll wait!
Keep your taser in the holster.
Give me that can.
What?
Just do it.
I got an idea.
Hey, Carol, now, how many times we been over this?
Look at this.
You want this?
Now, you know the deal.
I give you the can, you get out of the street, right?
Carol, do we have a deal?
We got a deal?
Okay.
You raped me.
Carol, get your stuff and move along, okay?
Get your stuff and move along.
See?
Now, that's how you handle it.
You raped me!
Sammy!
Don't touch me!
Drop it.
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!
You'll be all right.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be okay.
Damn it, Carol.
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
All right, I'm gonna need to get you up.
I didn't do anything -- anything at all.
Can you stand up?
No.
Can you stand up?
I didn't do anything.
You need anything before we get started?
Water?
How's the kid?
Critical condition.
How's it look?
He's in surgery.
Okay.
Let's get started.
So, what did you observe when you got to the scene?
We got a radio call.
He raped me!
You all saw it!
Getting pretty desperate there, Bryant.
She's not my type.
He said, she said.
Just search her.
Put her in the holding tank.
We'll, uh, we'll book her when we get back.
Thanks.
Do you need to go to the hospital?
I need a tailor, not a doctor.
No stitches necessary.
So, you ready?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Thanks, man.
Yeah, no need to thank me or anything.
For what?
Saving your life.
No Biggie.
Right.
She could have sliced your carotid artery.
You're lucky I don't tell the guys you got cut by a 60-year-old homeless woman.
Let's go!
Hey.
You find who did it?
Think so.
We just need to come in and ask you a few follow-up questions.
What kind of questions?
What kind of car do you drive?
I don't own a car.
Your boyfriend owned a silver Ford Focus.
You ever borrow it from him?
No.
There's a silver Ford Focus parked down this street.
Are we gonna find your prints at the wheel?
Unh.
Be my guest.
Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey.
- Come on, come on.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Easy, easy, easy.
Let me go!
I didn't do anything!
Easy!
I didn't do anything!
Easy.
Brenda.
Book crazy Carol.
I got to go change and pick up the kid.
That's it?
I had your back.
You want extra credit for doing your job?
Just cut me some slack, man.
What do I have to do, take a bullet for you?
What you did back there is what you're supposed to do.
It doesn't win you a get-out-of-jail-free card.
Hey, is there an E.T.A. on when you're gonna get past this?
What do you want, a mulligan?
No, I'm not asking you to forget what I said.
Just move on.
12 hours a day, we ride together.
In that time, I'll do everything in my power to make sure we both get home safe.
But when the shift ends, this ends, okay?
Don't expect me to go out and eat up your stories of female conquest over burgers and beers.
Nate never made a mistake?
I'm sorry I don't live up to the standards set by your former partner, but I'm just about out of sorries.
Savor this one.
It's the last you're gonna hear.
Take off the cuffs.
I'm not going anywhere.
We're gonna take you to county, have a doctor check you out.
So what if I took his car for a spin?
I didn't do anything wrong.
We have the gun.
Ballistics matched.
So?
So, the guy you sold the gun to I.D.'d you.
If you did your job, people like me wouldn't have to protect ourselves.
People like you?
How's that?
Ones trying to live right.
You don't care if Cam jumped right back into dealing...
If he brought guns and needles and thugs into my house, where my child's gonna be.
You should have kicked him out.
You think I didn't try?
I changed the locks.
He knocked out two of my molars.
Doctor at the clinic said I could have lost my baby.
Call 911.
Press charges.
So he'd serve what -- a couple of months?
What were you gonna do to protect me when he got out -- protect my baby?
Restraining orders don't work.
I didn't want to kill him.
Had to, for my girl.
What's gonna happen to her?
She'll be given to a relative.
And if I don't have any?
Foster care.
Hey.
Hey.
I could use that drink.
What about you?
How was, uh, F.I.D.?
I've known Larry 12 years.
He's fair.
What'd they want to know?
What I saw.
What'd you tell him?
Came in on you doing triage.
What were you doing when I caught up?
I was managing the situation the best I could.
His or yours?
It was an accidental shooting.
You didn't need to do anything.
The department -- they wouldn't have thrown you under the bus.
It's an accident.
It could have happened to any of us.
You go back in to the investigator.
You tell him you were served with divorce papers, and you had a bad day.
- Had a bad day.
- Yeah,bad day.
I had a bad day.
You go back in there, and you tell him the truth.
Or what?
You will?
What happened today was a tragedy.
But I am a first-rate officer.
Go back to F.I.D.
Stick to what you saw!
I assume you're waiting for me to tell you you were right.
Oh, the anticipation is killing me.
Fine.
You were right about Brenda's baby.
Happy?
About another kid entering foster care?
No.
I don't know if "happy" is necessarily the word I'm looking for.
The kid wouldn't even be in the system if the mom didn't pull the trigger.
She shot her ex so many times, she almost had to reload.
All right.
I hear you.
I hear you.
Look, don't worry about it.
I don't mind staying late.
Permission to give you some advice?
When you worked patrol, you remember the surest way to find out if someone was carrying?
Roll up on them and see if they ran.
Mm-hmm.
Look Fernandez rolled up on you this morning.
Stop working late, drawing attention to yourself.
Just act normal.
Then people won't wonder why you're not...feeling well.
Unless, of course, you can't fit behind the steering wheel anymore.
I thought you had a game to watch.
I saw the news downstairs.
I already know who won.
Oh, that's too bad.
There's another game tomorrow.
And, boss...
If there ever was something that you felt like you wanted to tell me, it will never leave this desk.
Good night.
See you tomorrow...
Partner.
Hey.
Hey.
I need something now.
Oxy?
Vicodin?
Doesn't matter.
I just need something.
Just...
I feel like I'm losing my grip.
Rough day?
It's cool, man.
I got something for you.
You know what this is?
10 years clean.
You expect this to be easy.
You got to earn this.
You got to go through hell to get one of these.
You did the right thing, calling me.
That's the way this program's supposed to work, John.
I've been where you are.
I doubt that.
Well, what's eating you?
I saw something.
I just can't shake it.
On the job?
I thought you'd seen everything.
Uh-huh.
Well, whatever it is, it's between us.
You got to tell somebody.
When you ready.
Tonight, you can just listen.
Come on.
The meeting's about to start.
It's good to see you.

All units, A-25 reports they have a suspect fitting the description in custody at 2nd Street and Manhattan Place.
[ Breathing heavily ]
Man:
L.A.P.D. officers start every shift knowing they might only have a fraction of a second to make a difficult choice.
The ramifications will last their whole lives.
John:
Good to know.
Doctor say when the bandage is gonna come off?
A couple days.
They check you for rabies?
Never know.
Well, if I start frothing at the mouth, you can just call an ambulance.
Yeah.
I was gonna call animal control.
[ Babbles mockingly ]
It's too bad your neck mobility is compromised.
[ Chuckling ] I was gonna let you drive today.
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.
Missed my lucky day.
[ Laughs ]
- Jessica Tang?
- Yeah?
I'm really sorry.
My dad's a cop -- 25 years, N.Y.P.D.
You've been served.
Sorry again.
John: [ Singsong voice ] Good morning!
[ Sighs, sniffs ]
Jones:
Need a nap already, Sherman?
[ Scoffs ] We were both up half the night, John.
Only difference is, I was with a girl, as opposed to looking at one online.
[ Man laughs ]
Fischer:
Hey, you didn't go to that country-girl bar again, did you?
That dump is STD Central.
I met her at the gym.
Parsons:
At Curves.
[ Laughter ]
She's a yoga instructor.
Let me tell you, her downward dog is amazing.
Hello.
The best part is, she works for Princess Cruises, so, uh, she's not gonna be back for the next three weeks.
Binge and purge.
You are my guru, Sherman.
Ai-yee.
Sammy:
Let's roll, man.
Parsons:
What's up with him?
If my partner was getting laid like that,
I wouldn't want to hear about it, either.
Man:
You're right.
[ Laughter ]
Breakfast of champions.
Got a call.
Lincoln Heights.
Uh, step into my office before you head out.
It will only take a sec.
You want to tell me why you've been here, burning the midnight oil?
There's no approval for overtime, you know.
[ Scoffs ] I'm not gonna sue the city, if that's what you're worried about.
I just got a little behind.
I'm catching up.
You feeling any better?
What?
You've been dragging.
Heard you weren't feeling well.
[ Scoffs ] It's just a bug.
You can level with me, Lydia.
Woman to woman.
I'll let you know if something comes up.
I got to go.
That traffic is gonna be a bear.
What's up?
We got a body in Lincoln Heights.
Okay.
Let's go to Lincoln Heights.
You hear that shit about Cooper?
It's crazy, right?
Some asshole latched on to his neck like a Pterodactyl.
The R.A. got to him just in time.
[ Siren walls in distance ]
I signed, you know.
Closed the deal on the house.
Signed all the paperwork last night.
I'm all in.
Even got my Costco card.
Can't get much more "all in" than that.
Merkle:
What's up, Ben?
Merkle.
Thank God we got that thing with the pipe worked out, right?
[ Chuckles ] Oh.
Dodged a bullet there, didn't we, chief?
Imagine how many of these assholes are telling the truth.
- Kind of scary, isn't it?
- Get lost, man.
What's your [bleep] problem?
[ Sighs ]
Little lovers' quarrel with your girlfriend there?
I'm glad you guys got to catch up, but me -- I'm sick of paying little Nate's babysitter overtime, so let's finish on time today.
What do you say, Benji?
[ Engine turns over ]
[ Police radio chatter ]
We, uh -- we in a hurry to get somewhere?
[ Chuckling ] Not doing anything to dispel the, uh, Asian-driver stereotype.
[ Police radio chatter ]
Got an invitation to my, uh,
Academy reunion.
Kind of hoping they wouldn't get around to it.
Started out with 90.
There's 21 of us left.
[ Chuckles softly ]
Rather do shots of battery acid than spend the night with some of those guys.
Look, a subpoena's a real rough way to start the day, all right?
I know a lawyer downtown.
Helped me with some legal matters once.
He's a piece of work, but, uh, the kind you don't mind having on your side.
I'm not getting sued.
Black S.U.V.
Roll up on him.
I'll have him move.
You gonna write him a ticket?
Yeah.
Jerks like this -- they cause bottlenecks.
[ Seatbelt disengages ]
Sir, you realize you're backing up traffic all the way around the block?
I'm sorry.
I'm picking up my wife.
She has a broken leg.
Yeah.
I'm gonna issue a citation.
I'll -
- I'll just move the car right now.
No.
License, registration, proof of insurance, please.
Oh, here she comes.
License, registration, proof of insurance, sir.
Registration.
My license.
I'm sorry.
I --
All around the block!
I'm sorry.
I...
John:
Let me get that for you, ma'am.
Man:
Thanks, officer.
You got it.
Honey, just hand me the crutches.
Hey, you.
[ Giggles ] [ Laughs ]
Sign here, please.
Okay.
I'm really sorry.
We looked for a spot.
You know what?
Apology's just not gonna cut it right now.
C-can you just make sure that the girls don't tape over it?
Especially not with that Kardashian garbage.
Thank you, baby.
That is why I love you.
See you tonight.
It's the game tonight.
What the hell did we do before DVRs?
You a hoops fan?
You say something to Fernandez?
About what?
Me not feeling well.
Oh, you mean that...
Looking seasick, making 20 bathroom breaks a day?
[ Chuckles ]
Look, I'm sorry.
I know it's a touchy subject.
Somebody's saying something.
Hey, it ain't me.
It ain't my business.
How you doing?
Robinson.
Adams.
Bellia.
Victim's over here.
He just got out of county last week.
For what?
Eight months.
Possession with intent.
Word is he went right back to the streets, working out of the alley.
Drugs still on him?
No.
Ruben:
Robbery?
Maybe, or a deal gone south.
Any witnesses?
No.
How many hits?
I counted eight.
Whoever put him down did not want him to get back up.
So, did you, uh, have to dust off this citation book before you wrote that ticket?
Jerk knew he was breaking the law.
Well, you know, it is a slippery slope.
First it's double parking, then it's triple homicide.
Got to really keep your eyes open for them jaywalkers.
I need coffee.
[ Inhales sharply ]
What?
Nothing.
Got a problem with my caffeine intake?
Nope.
Knock yourself out.
My husband's divorcing me, in case you were wondering what was in the envelope.
I didn't even know you were married.
Yeah.
Six years.
In sickness and in health, till irreconcilable differences do us part.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah.
Deadbeat's gonna get half my pension.
I guess that year of couples' counseling was time well spent.

Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Calmate.

What happened?
Hey, don't worry about it, bro.
I'll make sure they don't go hungry.
We had a truck together.
He steals my molé negro and starts his own!
I didn't steal nothing, bitch.
Now he takes space?
You snooze, you lose, bro.
He ain't even Oaxacan!
He's from Glendale!
Okay.
Whose truck is this?
That's mine.
I put everything I had into it.
I'm here every day.
Those are my customers!
Okay, listen.
I am very sorry, but he was here first.
There's nothing you can do.
As long as he keeps the meter full, you're gonna have to move your truck.
[ Pedro chuckles ]
Pedro:
Sorry, bro.
Hey, you should call la migra, man.
That bitch ain't legal.
This isn't Arizona, pal.
And you know what?
For the record...
Yeah?
I didn't steal that fool's molé, man.
He's high.
All right.
Thanks.
No, no, no, no!
Not my truck, man!
Oh, son of a bitch!
Hey!
Ohh!
Son of a bitch!
Sammy:
Get back!
Oh, man!
Turn it off!
Turn off the car!
Ben:
Demolition derby's over!
Get out of here!
Come here.
Come here!
He made me do it.
Bitch, you wrecked my truck for molé?
!
- Back off!
- I'm pressing charges!
I'm gonna sue his ass!
Good luck.
All my money's back in Oaxaca.
What?
!
Sammy:
Come on.
Let's go.
- We were supposed to be partners.
- Idiot!
You thought you knew the guy, huh?
Never expected a knife in the back?
He took everything from me.
Yeah, well, some guys you just can't trust.
All right, look.
I get it, okay?
I shouldn't have accused you of anything, all right?
Mea culpa.
My bad.
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.
I'm sorry, all right?
!
- Officer.
- Hey, not right now, buddy!
I paid for my burrito, but he rammed the other little guy's truck before I could get it!
Yeah.
You know what?
There's a Taco Bell across the street.
A-36, requesting a traffic unit at our location --
Boyle Avenue and 1st Street.
[ Sighs ]
You know who shot him?
Not yet.
Someone trying to steal your boyfriend's supply, maybe.
I asked Cam to stop dealing, but he just wouldn't give it up, even after I told him the news.
Brenda, when's the last time you saw him?
Couple days ago.
Did he mention anyone after him or getting into any arguments?
Too many arguments to count.
Cam said the only way to survive on the streets -- never let anyone push you around.
I never would have made it without him.
I was 15 when I left home.
He dealt.
I shot up.
Just the way we got by.
What about when you got pregnant?
I gave rehab a try when he went to jail.
Been clean eight months.
Good for you.
Thanks.
I work at the Vons now -- full time.
And I get benefits...
for my baby.
I turned things around, but Cam just...
[ Voice breaking ] He just couldn't.
Things have been tough for you.
And you're gonna get through this, too.
[ Sniffles, cries ]
Brenda, can you think of anyone he might have gotten into an argument with?
[ Police radio chatter ]
Easy cream, easy sugar?
Jess?
Hispanic male by the Chevy.
Hey, let me see your hands!
Hi.
Hey, put your hands, both of them, on the top of the car.
Let's go.
What?
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Kick your legs open.
Kick them open!
What are you doing?
I wasn't doing anything.
Following directions?
Huh?
What were you doing near the vehicle, sir?
It's my car.
Yeah?
Let's see the registration, then.
I can't.
My keys are locked inside.
I can't get in.
I'll go get the slim Jim.
Ben:
Did you get lost?
Where were you?
Courtyard behind the bank.
They got benches over there.
Tried you on the radio.
Yeah, I don't know.
You ready to roll?
You didn't want to eat lunch with me?
What are you, in the 3rd grade?
Look, I said I was sorry.
What do you want me to do, get down on my knees?
I'm not really in the mood for a blowjob, but thanks.
You gonna do this passive-aggressive shit all day?
Can we talk about this?
Talk about what?
What happened!
All right.
Let's start with the fact that every day,
I got to watch my back -- guns, knives, people with camera phones, hoping that we, uh, screw up.
This car's the one place where somebody's supposed to have my back.
Instead, you question my integrity.
My partner.
You know what?
I'm glad you did it, 'cause now I know where we stand.
[ Car door closes ]
[ Engine turns over ]
Don't sweat it.
He's not gonna file a complaint.
[ Scoffs ] He resisted.
Resisted?
You slammed him up against his car because he misplaced his keys.
Look, I get it, all right?
Most people, when they get blindsided by bad news, they just hide behind their computer and phone their job in.
We don't get that luxury.
I wasn't blindsided.
What?
Divorce -- it didn't come out of the blue.
I think he only hung on as long as he did because I got the shit beat out of me.
Yeah, he would have been a real bastard if he had dumped me while I was in traction.
Let's go.
I really jacked someone up, huh?
For locking himself out of the car?
Pretty much.
We'll, uh, go get drinks tonight.
You can bitch all you want.
[ Grunts ]
[ Rap music playing and dog barking in distance ]
[ Music and barking continue ]
Your parents home?
What took you so long?
I called over an hour ago.
You called a noise complaint in on yourself.
Hurry up.
Come in.
[ Sighs ]
Sammy:
This your party?
Yeah.
Mazel tov.
Where are your parents?
I told them they were cramping my style.
So they left you here alone?
For a couple hours.
Look, I need you to shut it down.
What?
Shut the party down?
You saying you want us to end your Bar Mitzvah party?
Could you throw me up against the wall and cuff me, too?
That would be so badass.
[ Chuckles ]
I-I'm trying to work this girl, and I need to do something epic.
How 'bout you turn the music down now before we call the parents of every kid in here and epically embarrass you?
S-she's way out of my league.
Wait a sec.
Which one?
Red dress.
Sure you can handle it?
I'm a man now.
I can take it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, turn that music down!
Turn the music down!
Up against the wall.
You're under arrest, okay?
Whoa.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you do or say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak with an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
Do you understand these rights as they have been read to you?
Huh, punk?
I'm not an idiot!
Yeah?
I think you are an idiot.
I think you're trouble!
Nothing but trouble!
We'll drop him off down the block, make his year.
Let's go!
[ Music continues ]
Oh, the liquor store down the street from the murder scene -- they have a surveillance camera.
You catch anything?
We're checking.
[ Plastic rustles ]
An energy bar for lunch?
Come on.
No.
Have half of my sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly?
No, thank you.
What's wrong with -- my wife made this.
Did ballistics check those shell casings?
They were .40 caliber.
I put the word out, but there's really no shortage of lowlifes willing to put a bullet in a dealer for his stash, you know?
Not a bullet -- eight, at close range.
That doesn't sound like a robbery to me.
That sounds personal.
Well, I'll check with narcotics, see if our victim was stepping on anybody's turf.
Maybe it's payback -- like, he pissed somebody off in jail.
It's a damn shame, too, 'cause I bet he probably would have been father of the year.
[ Chuckles ] You know, back in the '30s, some prisons used to sterilize their female prisoners to prevent them from having babies?
Mm.
That's screwed up.
Not saying it's cool.
I'm just saying -- addict mom, dealer dad.
Chances are, this kid is just gonna follow in his parents' footsteps.
I wouldn't give up on the mom quite yet.
She was barely holding it together.
Yeah, well, after living a life like that, she's got to be pretty tough.
All I'm saying is I've seen it too many times.
Clock's ticking till this kid ends up in foster care.
[ Telephone rings ]
Adams.
Yeah.
Be right down.
Surveillance caught a car on camera.
We got a plate.
Mm.

Saw a gun.
Fired.
The ambulance is on its way.
What are you doing?
Triage.
He's breathing, but it's shallow.
We need to stop the bleeding.
Here.
You apply pressure.
I'll start CPR.
Okay.
Stay with me, all right?
John:
You okay?
Yeah.
He had a gun.
I just...
Well, gray hoodie.
I just came back, turned the corner, there's a man pointing a gun at me...
Yeah.
It was a clean shooting.
John:
Was something down by his feet?
What?
When I came in, you were down by his feet.
Yeah.
I was securing his gun.
[ Breathes deeply ] I mean, who -- who, you know, hears sirens and runs out with a toy gun?
Brill:
Coop, Tang.
I need you to separate.
Shuman from F.I.D. is on his way.
All right, you know the rules.
Separate corners until after the debrief.
Tang.
Let's go.
See you later.
There's our silver Ford Focus.
[ Car door closes ]
Ruben:
Mm-hmm.
[ Police radio chatter ]
[ Knock on door ]
Rhonda Owens?
I figured you'd show up here eventually.
He's a good boy.
He didn't mean no harm.
Cam Huggins.
Who?
No, my son.
Stealing the cable TV so I could watch "Monday Night Football."
Oh.
Is that your car in the driveway?
Yeah.
When's the last time you drove it?
When I went to vote for Obama!
[ Exhales sharply ]
Have you lent anybody your car recently?
If five years ago is recent.
No.
It's not.
This is not about the cable TV?
No plates.
Uh, no, ma'am.
And, uh, we're sorry to have bothered you.
Thank you.
Football.
I came through the driveway and around the corner.
I saw a dark-dressed individual here with a gun.
I fired one round from my service weapon, aimed for center mass, saw the suspect go down.
Shuman:
And when you saw it wasn't the suspect?
I radioed for an R.A. Unit, and I immediately tried to stop the bleeding.
Kid has a record.
Three months in juvie.
Broke a teacher's nose.
You believe that?
You want some coffee or something?
Something to eat?
No.
[ Sighs ] Come on, man.
I hate babysitting as much as you hate being babysitted, but that's the rules.
At least put me to good use.
Stupid kids, running around with toy guns.
When they gonna take them damn things off the shelf, anyway?
I mean, how the hell are you supposed to tell the difference between that and a real Sig 9mm...
From here?
Shuman:
Cooper.
We're gonna be a while.
We'll talk back at the station.
My car's out front.
Shannon:
What happened?
!
Is it Derrick?
[ Crying ] Where is he?
!
He's at Mercy.
We'll take you.
He was doing better, back in school.
He swore he wouldn't take the tip off that toy gun.
Promised me.
Lydia:
Shooter was smart.
He used the old lady's plates just in case his car was spotted.
Premeditated.
At least we know he drove a Focus.
We can cross-check it with other dealers and ex-cons in the area.
Detective Adams.
Hey, Ross.
How's your mom?
In remission.
Doing good.
Thanks.
Listen, were you on the lookout for a .40 caliber?
Yeah, for a murder in Lincoln Heights.
Well, we just picked up a punk -- had three baggies of heroin and a .40 caliber Ruger on him.
Know what part of town he worked?
Or if he ever spent any time in county?
No.
Claims he bought the gun this morning.
Well, take the gun to ballistics, and we'll see if it's a match.
[ Chuckles ] What?
Uh, says he bought it off some pregnant lady.
Thanks, Ross.
[ Door opens ]
Brill:
Hey, John.
You almost done in there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just, uh...
Finishing up.
They're ready for you.
[ Door closes ]
[ Exhales slowly ]
[ Toilet flushes ]
Look, you have every right to be pissed off, okay?
I would be, if it were me.
[ Sighs ] For what it's worth,
I've been beating myself up about it.
Sam.
[ Exhales slowly ]
Crazy Carol.
Tried to get her help, but they're not gonna take her at St. Joe's again.
She's got a hell of a right hook.
Yeah.
She's only a danger to herself.
Carol!
Officer Bryant.
Remember me?
You raped me.
No, I did not rape you, okay?
Let's -- let's get you out of the street.
No, don't come near me!
No!
He raped me!
Ohh!
Carol, don't do that to yourself.
Should we take her in?
There's no law against beating the crap out of yourself.
She's got to do it somewhere else.
Man:
Come on, man!
I got a meeting!
If you're important, they'll wait!
Keep your taser in the holster.
Give me that can.
What?
Just do it.
I got an idea.
Hey, Carol, now, how many times we been over this?
[ Carol shudders ]
Look at this.
You want this?
Now, you know the deal.
I give you the can, you get out of the street, right?
Carol, do we have a deal?
We got a deal?
[ Breathing heavily ]
Okay.
[ Lips smack ]
You raped me.
[ Huffing ]
Carol, get your stuff and move along, okay?
Get your stuff and move along.
See?
Now, that's how you handle it.
You raped me!
Sammy!
Don't touch me!
[ Yelling ]
Drop it.
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!
[ Sobbing ]
You'll be all right.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be okay.
Damn it, Carol.
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
All right, I'm gonna need to get you up.
I didn't do anything -- anything at all.
[ Crying ]
Can you stand up?
No.
Can you stand up?
[ Carol whimpering ]
I didn't do anything.
[ Scoffs lightly ]
You need anything before we get started?
Water?
How's the kid?
Critical condition.
How's it look?
He's in surgery.
Okay.
Let's get started.
So, what did you observe when you got to the scene?
We got a radio call.
He raped me!
You all saw it!
Getting pretty desperate there, Bryant.
She's not my type.
He said, she said.
Just search her.
Put her in the holding tank.
We'll, uh, we'll book her when we get back.
Thanks.
[ Car door closes, engine turns over ]
Do you need to go to the hospital?
I need a tailor, not a doctor.
No stitches necessary.
So, you ready?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Thanks, man.
Yeah, no need to thank me or anything.
For what?
Saving your life.
No Biggie.
[ Sarcastically ] Right.
She could have sliced your carotid artery.
You're lucky I don't tell the guys you got cut by a 60-year-old homeless woman.
Let's go!
Hey.
You find who did it?
Think so.
We just need to come in and ask you a few follow-up questions.
What kind of questions?
What kind of car do you drive?
I don't own a car.
Your boyfriend owned a silver Ford Focus.
You ever borrow it from him?
No.
There's a silver Ford Focus parked down this street.
Are we gonna find your prints at the wheel?
Unh.
Be my guest.
[ Sighs ]
Whoa!
[ Brenda grunts ]
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, come on.
Lydia:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Easy, easy, easy.
Let me go!
I didn't do anything!
Easy!
I didn't do anything!
Easy.
Brenda.
[ Sighs ]
Book crazy Carol.
I got to go change and pick up the kid.
That's it?
I had your back.
You want extra credit for doing your job?
Just cut me some slack, man.
What do I have to do, take a bullet for you?
What you did back there is what you're supposed to do.
It doesn't win you a get-out-of-jail-free card.
Hey, is there an E.T.A. on when you're gonna get past this?
What do you want, a mulligan?
No, I'm not asking you to forget what I said.
Just move on.
12 hours a day, we ride together.
In that time, I'll do everything in my power to make sure we both get home safe.
But when the shift ends, this ends, okay?
Don't expect me to go out and eat up your stories of female conquest over burgers and beers.
Nate never made a mistake?
I'm sorry I don't live up to the standards set by your former partner, but I'm just about out of sorries.
Savor this one.
It's the last you're gonna hear.
[ Door opens, closes ]
Take off the cuffs.
I'm not going anywhere.
We're gonna take you to county, have a doctor check you out.
So what if I took his car for a spin?
I didn't do anything wrong.
We have the gun.
Ballistics matched.
So?
So, the guy you sold the gun to I.D.'d you.
If you did your job, people like me wouldn't have to protect ourselves.
People like you?
How's that?
Ones trying to live right.
You don't care if Cam jumped right back into dealing...
If he brought guns and needles and thugs into my house, where my child's gonna be.
You should have kicked him out.
You think I didn't try?
I changed the locks.
He knocked out two of my molars.
Doctor at the clinic said I could have lost my baby.
Call 911.
Press charges.
So he'd serve what -- a couple of months?
What were you gonna do to protect me when he got out -- protect my baby?
Restraining orders don't work.
I didn't want to kill him.
Had to, for my girl.
What's gonna happen to her?
She'll be given to a relative.
And if I don't have any?
Foster care.
Hey.
Hey.
I could use that drink.
What about you?
How was, uh, F.I.D.?
I've known Larry 12 years.
He's fair.
What'd they want to know?
What I saw.
What'd you tell him?
Came in on you doing triage.
What were you doing when I caught up?
I was managing the situation the best I could.
His or yours?
It was an accidental shooting.
You didn't need to do anything.
The department -- they wouldn't have thrown you under the bus.
It's an accident.
It could have happened to any of us.
You go back in to the investigator.
You tell him you were served with divorce papers, and you had a bad day.
- Had a bad day.
- Yeah,bad day.
I had a bad day.
You go back in there, and you tell him the truth.
Or what?
You will?
What happened today was a tragedy.
But I am a first-rate officer.
Go back to F.I.D.
Stick to what you saw!
[ Car horn honks in distance ]
[ Engine turns over ]
[ Chuckles ]
I assume you're waiting for me to tell you you were right.
Oh, the anticipation is killing me.
Fine.
You were right about Brenda's baby.
Happy?
About another kid entering foster care?
No.
I don't know if "happy" is necessarily the word I'm looking for.
The kid wouldn't even be in the system if the mom didn't pull the trigger.
She shot her ex so many times, she almost had to reload.
All right.
I hear you.
I hear you.
Look, don't worry about it.
I don't mind staying late.
[ Sighs ]
Permission to give you some advice?
When you worked patrol, you remember the surest way to find out if someone was carrying?
Roll up on them and see if they ran.
Mm-hmm.
Look Fernandez rolled up on you this morning.
Stop working late, drawing attention to yourself.
Just act normal.
Then people won't wonder why you're not...feeling well.
Unless, of course, you can't fit behind the steering wheel anymore.
I thought you had a game to watch.
I saw the news downstairs.
I already know who won.
Oh, that's too bad.
There's another game tomorrow.
[ Breathes deeply ]
And, boss...
If there ever was something that you felt like you wanted to tell me, it will never leave this desk.
Good night.
See you tomorrow...
Partner.
Man:
Hey.
Hey.
I need something now.
Oxy?
Vicodin?
Doesn't matter.
I just need something.
Just...
I feel like I'm losing my grip.
Rough day?
[ Chuckles ]
It's cool, man.
I got something for you.
You know what this is?
10 years clean.
You expect this to be easy.
You got to earn this.
You got to go through hell to get one of these.
You did the right thing, calling me.
That's the way this program's supposed to work, John.
I've been where you are.
I doubt that.
Well, what's eating you?
I saw something.
I just can't shake it.
On the job?
I thought you'd seen everything.
Uh-huh.
Well, whatever it is, it's between us.
You got to tell somebody.
When you ready.
Tonight, you can just listen.
Come on.
The meeting's about to start.
[ John exhales sharply ]
It's good to see you.

All units, A-25 reports they have a suspect fitting the description in custody at 2nd Street and Manhattan Place.
L.A.P.D. officers start every shift knowing they might only have a fraction of a second to make a difficult choice.
The ramifications will last their whole lives.
Good to know.
Doctor say when the bandage is gonna come off?
A couple days.
They check you for rabies?
Never know.
Well, if I start frothing at the mouth, you can just call an ambulance.
Yeah.
I was gonna call animal control.
It's too bad your neck mobility is compromised.
I was gonna let you drive today.
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.
Missed my lucky day.
- Jessica Tang?
- Yeah?
I'm really sorry.
My dad's a cop -- 25 years, N.Y.P.D.
You've been served.
Sorry again.
Good morning!
Need a nap already, Sherman?
We were both up half the night, John.
Only difference is, I was with a girl, as opposed to looking at one online.
Hey, you didn't go to that country-girl bar again, did you?
That dump is STD Central.
I met her at the gym.
At Curves.
She's a yoga instructor.
Let me tell you, her downward dog is amazing.
Hello.
The best part is, she works for Princess Cruises, so, uh, she's not gonna be back for the next three weeks.
Binge and purge.
You are my guru, Sherman.
Ai-yee.
Let's roll, man.
What's up with him?
If my partner was getting laid like that,
I wouldn't want to hear about it, either.
You're right.
Breakfast of champions.
Got a call.
Lincoln Heights.
Uh, step into my office before you head out.
It will only take a sec.
You want to tell me why you've been here, burning the midnight oil?
There's no approval for overtime, you know.
I'm not gonna sue the city, if that's what you're worried about.
I just got a little behind.
I'm catching up.
You feeling any better?
What?
You've been dragging.
Heard you weren't feeling well.
It's just a bug.
You can level with me, Lydia.
Woman to woman.
I'll let you know if something comes up.
I got to go.
That traffic is gonna be a bear.
What's up?
We got a body in Lincoln Heights.
Okay.
Let's go to Lincoln Heights.
You hear that shit about Cooper?
It's crazy, right?
Some asshole latched on to his neck like a Pterodactyl.
The R.A. got to him just in time.
I signed, you know.
Closed the deal on the house.
Signed all the paperwork last night.
I'm all in.
Even got my Costco card.
Can't get much more "all in" than that.
What's up, Ben?
Merkle.
Thank God we got that thing with the pipe worked out, right?
Oh.
Dodged a bullet there, didn't we, chief?
Imagine how many of these assholes are telling the truth.
- Kind of scary, isn't it?
- Get lost, man.
What's your problem?
Little lovers' quarrel with your girlfriend there?
I'm glad you guys got to catch up, but me -- I'm sick of paying little Nate's babysitter overtime, so let's finish on time today.
What do you say, Benji?
We, uh -- we in a hurry to get somewhere?
Not doing anything to dispel the, uh, Asian-driver stereotype.
Got an invitation to my, uh,
Academy reunion.
Kind of hoping they wouldn't get around to it.
Started out with 90.
There's 21 of us left.
Rather do shots of battery acid than spend the night with some of those guys.
Look, a subpoena's a real rough way to start the day, all right?
I know a lawyer downtown.
Helped me with some legal matters once.
He's a piece of work, but, uh, the kind you don't mind having on your side.
I'm not getting sued.
Black S.U.V.
Roll up on him.
I'll have him move.
You gonna write him a ticket?
Yeah.
Jerks like this -- they cause bottlenecks.
Sir, you realize you're backing up traffic all the way around the block?
I'm sorry.
I'm picking up my wife.
She has a broken leg.
Yeah.
I'm gonna issue a citation.
I'll -
- I'll just move the car right now.
No.
License, registration, proof of insurance, please.
Oh, here she comes.
License, registration, proof of insurance, sir.
Registration.
My license.
I'm sorry.
I --
All around the block!
I'm sorry.
I...
Let me get that for you, ma'am.
Thanks, officer.
You got it.
Honey, just hand me the crutches.
Hey, you.
Sign here, please.
Okay.
I'm really sorry.
We looked for a spot.
You know what?
Apology's just not gonna cut it right now.
C-can you just make sure that the girls don't tape over it?
Especially not with that Kardashian garbage.
Thank you, baby.
That is why I love you.
See you tonight.
It's the game tonight.
What the hell did we do before DVRs?
You a hoops fan?
You say something to Fernandez?
About what?
Me not feeling well.
Oh, you mean that...
Looking seasick, making 20 bathroom breaks a day?
Look, I'm sorry.
I know it's a touchy subject.
Somebody's saying something.
Hey, it ain't me.
It ain't my business.
How you doing?
Robinson.
Adams.
Bellia.
Victim's over here.
He just got out of county last week.
For what?
Eight months.
Possession with intent.
Word is he went right back to the streets, working out of the alley.
Drugs still on him?
- No.
- Robbery?
Maybe, or a deal gone south.
Any witnesses?
No.
How many hits?
I counted eight.
Whoever put him down did not want him to get back up.
So, did you, uh, have to dust off this citation book before you wrote that ticket?
Jerk knew he was breaking the law.
Well, you know, it is a slippery slope.
First it's double parking, then it's triple homicide.
Got to really keep your eyes open for them jaywalkers.
I need coffee.
What?
Nothing.
Got a problem with my caffeine intake?
Nope.
Knock yourself out.
My husband's divorcing me, in case you were wondering what was in the envelope.
I didn't even know you were married.
Yeah.
Six years.
In sickness and in health, till irreconcilable differences do us part.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah.
Deadbeat's gonna get half my pension.
I guess that year of couples' counseling was time well spent.

What happened?
Hey, don't worry about it, bro.
I'll make sure they don't go hungry.
We had a truck together.
He steals my molé negro and starts his own!
I didn't steal nothing, bitch.
Now he takes space?
You snooze, you lose, bro.
He ain't even Oaxacan!
He's from Glendale!
Okay.
Whose truck is this?
That's mine.
I put everything I had into it.
I'm here every day.
Those are my customers!
Okay, listen.
I am very sorry, but he was here first.
There's nothing you can do.
As long as he keeps the meter full, you're gonna have to move your truck.
Sorry, bro.
Hey, you should call la migra, man.
That bitch ain't legal.
This isn't Arizona, pal.
And you know what?
For the record...
Yeah?
I didn't steal that fool's molé, man.
He's high.
All right.
Thanks.
No, no, no, no!
Not my truck, man!
Oh, son of a bitch!
Hey!
Ohh!
Son of a bitch!
Get back!
Oh, man!
Turn it off!
Turn off the car!
Demolition derby's over!
Get out of here!
Come here.
Come here!
He made me do it.
Bitch, you wrecked my truck for molé?
!
- Back off!
- I'm pressing charges!
I'm gonna sue his ass!
Good luck.
All my money's back in Oaxaca.
What?
!
Come on.
Let's go.
- We were supposed to be partners.
- Idiot!
You thought you knew the guy, huh?
Never expected a knife in the back?
He took everything from me.
Yeah, well, some guys you just can't trust.
All right, look.
I get it, okay?
I shouldn't have accused you of anything, all right?
Mea culpa.
My bad.
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.
I'm sorry, all right?
!
- Officer.
- Hey, not right now, buddy!
I paid for my burrito, but he rammed the other little guy's truck before I could get it!
Yeah.
You know what?
There's a Taco Bell across the street.
A-36, requesting a traffic unit at our location --
Boyle Avenue and 1st Street.
You know who shot him?
Not yet.
Someone trying to steal your boyfriend's supply, maybe.
I asked Cam to stop dealing, but he just wouldn't give it up, even after I told him the news.
Brenda, when's the last time you saw him?
Couple days ago.
Did he mention anyone after him or getting into any arguments?
Too many arguments to count.
Cam said the only way to survive on the streets -- never let anyone push you around.
I never would have made it without him.
I was 15 when I left home.
He dealt.
I shot up.
Just the way we got by.
What about when you got pregnant?
I gave rehab a try when he went to jail.
Been clean eight months.
Good for you.
Thanks.
I work at the Vons now -- full time.
And I get benefits...
for my baby.
I turned things around, but Cam just...
He just couldn't.
Things have been tough for you.
And you're gonna get through this, too.
Brenda, can you think of anyone he might have gotten into an argument with?
Easy cream, easy sugar?
Jess?
Hispanic male by the Chevy.
Hey, let me see your hands!
Hi.
Hey, put your hands, both of them, on the top of the car.
Let's go.
What?
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Kick your legs open.
Kick them open!
What are you doing?
I wasn't doing anything.
Following directions?
Huh?
What were you doing near the vehicle, sir?
It's my car.
Yeah?
Let's see the registration, then.
I can't.
My keys are locked inside.
I can't get in.
I'll go get the slim Jim.
Did you get lost?
Where were you?
Courtyard behind the bank.
They got benches over there.
Tried you on the radio.
Yeah, I don't know.
You ready to roll?
You didn't want to eat lunch with me?
What are you, in the 3rd grade?
Look, I said I was sorry.
What do you want me to do, get down on my knees?
I'm not really in the mood for a blowjob, but thanks.
You gonna do this passive-aggressive shit all day?
Can we talk about this?
Talk about what?
What happened!
All right.
Let's start with the fact that every day,
I got to watch my back -- guns, knives, people with camera phones, hoping that we, uh, screw up.
This car's the one place where somebody's supposed to have my back.
Instead, you question my integrity.
My partner.
You know what?
I'm glad you did it, 'cause now I know where we stand.
Don't sweat it.
He's not gonna file a complaint.
He resisted.
Resisted?
You slammed him up against his car because he misplaced his keys.
Look, I get it, all right?
Most people, when they get blindsided by bad news, they just hide behind their computer and phone their job in.
We don't get that luxury.
I wasn't blindsided.
What?
Divorce -- it didn't come out of the blue.
I think he only hung on as long as he did because I got the shit beat out of me.
Yeah, he would have been a real bastard if he had dumped me while I was in traction.
Let's go.
I really jacked someone up, huh?
For locking himself out of the car?
Pretty much.
We'll, uh, go get drinks tonight.
You can bitch all you want.
Your parents home?
What took you so long?
I called over an hour ago.
You called a noise complaint in on yourself.
Hurry up.
Come in.
This your party?
Yeah.
Mazel tov.
Where are your parents?
I told them they were cramping my style.
So they left you here alone?
For a couple hours.
Look, I need you to shut it down.
What?
Shut the party down?
You saying you want us to end your Bar Mitzvah party?
Could you throw me up against the wall and cuff me, too?
That would be so badass.
I-I'm trying to work this girl, and I need to do something epic.
How 'bout you turn the music down now before we call the parents of every kid in here and epically embarrass you?
S-she's way out of my league.
Wait a sec.
Which one?
Red dress.
Sure you can handle it?
I'm a man now.
I can take it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, turn that music down!
Turn the music down!
Up against the wall.
You're under arrest, okay?
Whoa.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you do or say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak with an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
Do you understand these rights as they have been read to you?
Huh, punk?
I'm not an idiot!
Yeah?
I think you are an idiot.
I think you're trouble!
Nothing but trouble!
We'll drop him off down the block, make his year.
Let's go!
Oh, the liquor store down the street from the murder scene -- they have a surveillance camera.
You catch anything?
We're checking.
An energy bar for lunch?
Come on.
No.
Have half of my sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly?
No, thank you.
What's wrong with -- my wife made this.
Did ballistics check those shell casings?
They were .40 caliber.
I put the word out, but there's really no shortage of lowlifes willing to put a bullet in a dealer for his stash, you know?
Not a bullet -- eight, at close range.
That doesn't sound like a robbery to me.
That sounds personal.
Well, I'll check with narcotics, see if our victim was stepping on anybody's turf.
Maybe it's payback -- like, he pissed somebody off in jail.
It's a damn shame, too, 'cause I bet he probably would have been father of the year.
You know, back in the '30s, some prisons used to sterilize their female prisoners to prevent them from having babies?
Mm.
That's screwed up.
Not saying it's cool.
I'm just saying -- addict mom, dealer dad.
Chances are, this kid is just gonna follow in his parents' footsteps.
I wouldn't give up on the mom quite yet.
She was barely holding it together.
Yeah, well, after living a life like that, she's got to be pretty tough.
All I'm saying is I've seen it too many times.
Clock's ticking till this kid ends up in foster care.
Adams.
Yeah.
Be right down.
Surveillance caught a car on camera.
We got a plate.
Mm.
All units, home invasion in progress -- 216 Gramercy Place.
A-57, show us responding.
216 Gramercy Place.
Roger, 57, handle code 3.
He's going.
Gun!
A-57, requesting backup!
216 Gramercy Place!
Blue Toyota headed south toward Wilshire!
License plate 2-Sam-Adam-Mary-5-6-4!
I'll cut him off!
A-57 in foot pursuit eastbound towards Western!
Aah!
Way!
Go in the house!
Lock the door -- now!
A-57, we now have shots fired.
All units, A-25 reports they have a suspect fitting the description in custody at 2nd Street and Manhattan Place.
A-57, I need an R.A. Unit at my location.
Victim of a gunshot wound.
Jess!
Saw a gun.
Fired.
The ambulance is on its way.
What are you doing?
Triage.
He's breathing, but it's shallow.
We need to stop the bleeding.
Here.
You apply pressure.
I'll start CPR.
Okay.
Stay with me, all right?
You okay?
Yeah.
He had a gun.
I just...
Well, gray hoodie.
I just came back, turned the corner, there's a man pointing a gun at me...
Yeah.
It was a clean shooting.
Was something down by his feet?
What?
When I came in, you were down by his feet.
Yeah.
I was securing his gun.
I mean, who -- who, you know, hears sirens and runs out with a toy gun?
Coop, Tang.
I need you to separate.
Shuman from F.I.D. is on his way.
All right, you know the rules.
Separate corners until after the debrief.
Tang.
Let's go.
See you later.
There's our silver Ford Focus.
Mm-hmm.
Rhonda Owens?
I figured you'd show up here eventually.
He's a good boy.
He didn't mean no harm.
Cam Huggins.
Who?
No, my son.
Stealing the cable TV so I could watch "Monday Night Football."
Oh.
Is that your car in the driveway?
Yeah.
When's the last time you drove it?
When I went to vote for Obama!
Have you lent anybody your car recently?
If five years ago is recent.
No.
It's not.
This is not about the cable TV?
No plates.
Uh, no, ma'am.
And, uh, we're sorry to have bothered you.
Thank you.
Football.
I came through the driveway and around the corner.
I saw a dark-dressed individual here with a gun.
I fired one round from my service weapon, aimed for center mass, saw the suspect go down.
And when you saw it wasn't the suspect?
I radioed for an R.A. Unit, and I immediately tried to stop the bleeding.
Kid has a record.
Three months in juvie.
Broke a teacher's nose.
You believe that?
You want some coffee or something?
Something to eat?
No.
Come on, man.
I hate babysitting as much as you hate being babysitted, but that's the rules.
At least put me to good use.
Stupid kids, running around with toy guns.
When they gonna take them damn things off the shelf, anyway?
I mean, how the hell are you supposed to tell the difference between that and a real Sig 9mm...
From here?
Cooper.
We're gonna be a while.
We'll talk back at the station.
My car's out front.
What happened?
!
Is it Derrick?
Where is he?
!
He's at Mercy.
We'll take you.
He was doing better, back in school.
He swore he wouldn't take the tip off that toy gun.
Promised me.
Shooter was smart.
He used the old lady's plates just in case his car was spotted.
Premeditated.
At least we know he drove a Focus.
We can cross-check it with other dealers and ex-cons in the area.
Detective Adams.
Hey, Ross.
How's your mom?
In remission.
Doing good.
Thanks.
Listen, were you on the lookout for a .40 caliber?
Yeah, for a murder in Lincoln Heights.
Well, we just picked up a punk -- had three baggies of heroin and a .40 caliber Ruger on him.
Know what part of town he worked?
Or if he ever spent any time in county?
No.
Claims he bought the gun this morning.
Well, take the gun to ballistics, and we'll see if it's a match.
What?
Uh, says he bought it off some pregnant lady.
Thanks, Ross.
Hey, John.
You almost done in there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just, uh...
Finishing up.
They're ready for you.
Look, you have every right to be pissed off, okay?
I would be, if it were me.
For what it's worth,
I've been beating myself up about it.
Sam.
Crazy Carol.
Tried to get her help, but they're not gonna take her at St. Joe's again.
She's got a hell of a right hook.
Yeah.
She's only a danger to herself.
Carol!
Officer Bryant.
Remember me?
You raped me.
No, I did not rape you, okay?
Let's -- let's get you out of the street.
No, don't come near me!
No!
He raped me!
Ohh!
Carol, don't do that to yourself.
Should we take her in?
There's no law against beating the crap out of yourself.
She's got to do it somewhere else.
Come on, man!
I got a meeting!
If you're important, they'll wait!
Keep your taser in the holster.
Give me that can.
What?
Just do it.
I got an idea.
Hey, Carol, now, how many times we been over this?
Look at this.
You want this?
Now, you know the deal.
I give you the can, you get out of the street, right?
Carol, do we have a deal?
We got a deal?
Okay.
You raped me.
Carol, get your stuff and move along, okay?
Get your stuff and move along.
See?
Now, that's how you handle it.
You raped me!
Sammy!
Don't touch me!
Drop it.
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!
You'll be all right.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be okay.
Damn it, Carol.
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
All right, I'm gonna need to get you up.
I didn't do anything -- anything at all.
Can you stand up?
No.
Can you stand up?
I didn't do anything.
You need anything before we get started?
Water?
How's the kid?
Critical condition.
How's it look?
He's in surgery.
Okay.
Let's get started.
So, what did you observe when you got to the scene?
We got a radio call.
He raped me!
You all saw it!
Getting pretty desperate there, Bryant.
She's not my type.
He said, she said.
Just search her.
Put her in the holding tank.
We'll, uh, we'll book her when we get back.
Thanks.
Do you need to go to the hospital?
I need a tailor, not a doctor.
No stitches necessary.
So, you ready?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Thanks, man.
Yeah, no need to thank me or anything.
For what?
Saving your life.
No Biggie.
Right.
She could have sliced your carotid artery.
You're lucky I don't tell the guys you got cut by a 60-year-old homeless woman.
Let's go!
Hey.
You find who did it?
Think so.
We just need to come in and ask you a few follow-up questions.
What kind of questions?
What kind of car do you drive?
I don't own a car.
Your boyfriend owned a silver Ford Focus.
You ever borrow it from him?
No.
There's a silver Ford Focus parked down this street.
Are we gonna find your prints at the wheel?
Unh.
Be my guest.
Whoa!
Hey, hey, hey.
- Come on, come on.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Easy, easy, easy.
Let me go!
I didn't do anything!
Easy!
I didn't do anything!
Easy.
Brenda.
Book crazy Carol.
I got to go change and pick up the kid.
That's it?
I had your back.
You want extra credit for doing your job?
Just cut me some slack, man.
What do I have to do, take a bullet for you?
What you did back there is what you're supposed to do.
It doesn't win you a get-out-of-jail-free card.
Hey, is there an E.T.A. on when you're gonna get past this?
What do you want, a mulligan?
No, I'm not asking you to forget what I said.
Just move on.
12 hours a day, we ride together.
In that time, I'll do everything in my power to make sure we both get home safe.
But when the shift ends, this ends, okay?
Don't expect me to go out and eat up your stories of female conquest over burgers and beers.
Nate never made a mistake?
I'm sorry I don't live up to the standards set by your former partner, but I'm just about out of sorries.
Savor this one.
It's the last you're gonna hear.
Take off the cuffs.
I'm not going anywhere.
We're gonna take you to county, have a doctor check you out.
So what if I took his car for a spin?
I didn't do anything wrong.
We have the gun.
Ballistics matched.
So?
So, the guy you sold the gun to I.D.'d you.
If you did your job, people like me wouldn't have to protect ourselves.
People like you?
How's that?
Ones trying to live right.
You don't care if Cam jumped right back into dealing...
If he brought guns and needles and thugs into my house, where my child's gonna be.
You should have kicked him out.
You think I didn't try?
I changed the locks.
He knocked out two of my molars.
Doctor at the clinic said I could have lost my baby.
Call 911.
Press charges.
So he'd serve what -- a couple of months?
What were you gonna do to protect me when he got out -- protect my baby?
Restraining orders don't work.
I didn't want to kill him.
Had to, for my girl.
What's gonna happen to her?
She'll be given to a relative.
And if I don't have any?
Foster care.
Hey.
Hey.
I could use that drink.
What about you?
How was, uh, F.I.D.?
I've known Larry 12 years.
He's fair.
What'd they want to know?
What I saw.
What'd you tell him?
Came in on you doing triage.
What were you doing when I caught up?
I was managing the situation the best I could.
His or yours?
It was an accidental shooting.
You didn't need to do anything.
The department -- they wouldn't have thrown you under the bus.
It's an accident.
It could have happened to any of us.
You go back in to the investigator.
You tell him you were served with divorce papers, and you had a bad day.
- Had a bad day.
- Yeah,bad day.
I had a bad day.
You go back in there, and you tell him the truth.
Or what?
You will?
What happened today was a tragedy.
But I am a first-rate officer.
Go back to F.I.D.
Stick to what you saw!
I assume you're waiting for me to tell you you were right.
Oh, the anticipation is killing me.
Fine.
You were right about Brenda's baby.
Happy?
About another kid entering foster care?
No.
I don't know if "happy" is necessarily the word I'm looking for.
The kid wouldn't even be in the system if the mom didn't pull the trigger.
She shot her ex so many times, she almost had to reload.
All right.
I hear you.
I hear you.
Look, don't worry about it.
I don't mind staying late.
Permission to give you some advice?
When you worked patrol, you remember the surest way to find out if someone was carrying?
Roll up on them and see if they ran.
Mm-hmm.
Look Fernandez rolled up on you this morning.
Stop working late, drawing attention to yourself.
Just act normal.
Then people won't wonder why you're not...feeling well.
Unless, of course, you can't fit behind the steering wheel anymore.
I thought you had a game to watch.
I saw the news downstairs.
I already know who won.
Oh, that's too bad.
There's another game tomorrow.
And, boss...
If there ever was something that you felt like you wanted to tell me, it will never leave this desk.
Good night.
See you tomorrow...
Partner.
Hey.
Hey.
I need something now.
Oxy?
Vicodin?
Doesn't matter.
I just need something.
Just...
I feel like I'm losing my grip.
Rough day?
It's cool, man.
I got something for you.
You know what this is?
10 years clean.
You expect this to be easy.
You got to earn this.
You got to go through hell to get one of these.
You did the right thing, calling me.
That's the way this program's supposed to work, John.
I've been where you are.
I doubt that.
Well, what's eating you?
I saw something.
I just can't shake it.
On the job?
I thought you'd seen everything.
Uh-huh.
Well, whatever it is, it's between us.
You got to tell somebody.
When you ready.
Tonight, you can just listen.
Come on.
The meeting's about to start.
It's good to see you.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
All units, A-25 reports they have a suspect fitting the description in custody at 2nd Street and Manhattan Place.
L.A.P.D. officers start every shift knowing they might only have a fraction of a second to make a difficult choice.
The ramifications will last their whole lives.
Good to know.
Doctors say when bandages come off?
- About a couple of days.
- Check you for rabies?
You never know.
If I start frothing, just call an ambulance.
Yeah, I was gonna call animal control.
Ha.
Too bad your neck mobility is compromised.
I was gonna let you drive.
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.
- Missed my lucky day.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Jessica Tang?
- Yeah.
I'm really sorry.
My dad's a cop.
Twenty-five years, N.Y.P.D.
You've been served.
Sorry, again.
Good morning.
Need a nap already, Sherman?
We're both up half the night, Jones.
Only difference is, I was with a girl as opposed to looking at one online.
You didn't go to that Country Girl bar again, did you?
That dump is STD central.
- I met her at the gym.
- Curves?
She's a yoga instructor.
Let me tell you, her downward dog is amazing.
Hello.
The best part is, she works for Princess Cruises.
So, uh, she's not gonna be back for the next three weeks.
Binge and purge.
You are my guru, Sherman.
Let's roll, man.
What's up with him?
If my partner was getting laid like that, I wouldn't wanna hear about it either.
Yeah, you're right.
Breakfast of champions.
Got a call.
Lincoln Heights.
Uh, step into my office before you head out.
Only take a sec.
You wanna tell me why you've been here burning the midnight oil?
There's no approval for overtime, you know?
I'm not gonna sue the city if that's what you're worried about.
I just got a little behind.
I'm catching up.
You feeling any better?
What?
You've been dragging.
Heard you weren't feeling well.
It's just a bug.
You can level with me, Lydia.
Woman to woman.
I'll let you know if something comes up.
I gotta go, that traffic is gonna be a bear.
What's up?
We got a body in Lincoln Heights.
Okay.
Let's go to Lincoln Heights.
You hear that shit about Cooper?
It's crazy, right?
Some asshole latched on to his neck like a pterodactyl.
R.A. got to him just in time.
I signed, you know.
Closed the deal on the house.
Signed all the paperwork last night.
I'm all in.
Even got my Costco card.
Can't get much more "all in" than that.
What's up, Ben?
Merkle.
Thank God we got that thing with the pipe worked out, right?
Ah.
Dodged a bullet there, didn't we?
Imagine how many assholes are telling the truth.
Get lost, man.
What's your fucking problem?
Little lovers' quarrel with your girlfriend?
Glad you guys got to catch up.
But me I'm sick of paying little Nate's babysitter overtime.
So let's finish on time today.
What do you say, Benji?
En route to 496 Broadway.
You have another assignment there, Central?
We, uh, in a hurry to get somewhere?
You're not doing anything to dispel the, uh, "Asian driver" stereotype.
Got an invitation to my, uh, academy reunion.
Hoping they wouldn't get around to it.
Started out with 90, there's 21 of us left.
Rather do shots of battery acid than spend a night with some of those guys.
Look, a subpoena's a real rough way to start the day, all right?
I know a lawyer downtown, helped me with some legal matters once.
He's a piece of work, but, uh, the kind you don't mind having on your side.
I'm not getting sued.
Black SUV.
Roll up on him.
I'll help him move.
- You gonna write him a ticket?
- Yeah.
Jerks like this, they cause bottlenecks.
Sir, you realize you're backing up traffic around the block?
I'm picking up my wife.
She has a broken leg.
- Yeah, I'm gonna issue a citation.
- I'll move the car.
License, registration, proof of insurance.
Oh, here she comes.
License, registration, proof of insurance, sir.
Registration.
My license.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, l--
- All around the block.
Let me get that for you, ma'am.
- Thanks, officer.
- You got it.
Honey, just hand me the crutches.
Hey, you.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Sign here, please.
- Okay.
I'm really sorry.
We looked for a spot.
You know what apology's just not gonna cut it right now.
Can you just make sure that the girls don't tape over it?
Especially not with Kardashian garbage.
Thank you, baby.
That is why I love you.
See you tonight.
It's the game tonight.
What the hell did we do before DVRs?
You a hoops fan?
- You say something to Fernandez?
- About what?
Me not feeling well.
Oh.
You mean that, uh, looking seasick, making 20 bathroom breaks a day?
That not feeling well?
Look, I'm sorry, I know it's a touchy subject.
Somebody's saying something.
Hey, it ain't me.
It ain't my business.
Officer, how you doing?
Robinson, Adams.
Bellia.
Victim's over here.
He just got out of county last week.
- For what?
- Eight months, possession with intent.
Word is he went back to the streets, working out of the alley.
- Drugs still on him?
- No.
- Robbery?
- Maybe, or a deal gone south.
- Any witnesses?
- No.
- How many hits?
- I counted eight.
Whoever put him down did not want him to get back up.
So did you, uh, get the dust off this citation book before you write that ticket?
Jerk knew he was breaking the law.
Well, you know, it is a slippery slope.
First it's double parking, then it's triple homicide.
Gotta keep your eyes open for jaywalkers.
I need coffee.
- What?
- Nothing.
- Got a problem with my caffeine intake?
- No, knock yourself out.
My husband's divorcing me in case you were wondering what was in the envelope.
- I didn't even know you were married.
- Yeah, six years.
In sickness and in health, till irreconcilable differences do us part.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah.
Deadbeat's gonna get half my pension.
Guess that year of couples counseling was time well spent.
Any available unit, neighbor dispute at 660 Barton Avenue.
A-57, show us handling.
A-57, roger.
The yoga instructor has a friend.
Teaches Pilates, gorgeous.
I talked you up, got her number for you.
There it is.
You know what?
Get out of my space.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Customers came here for my food.
- Calm down.
What happened?
- I'll make sure they don't go hungry.
We had a truck together.
He steals my mole negro and starts his own.
- I didn't steal nothing, bitch.
- Now he takes my space.
You snooze, you lose, bro.
He ain't even Oaxacan.
He's from Glendale.
Okay.
Whose truck is this?
That's mine.
I put everything I had into it.
I'm here every day.
Those are my customers.
Okay.
I am sorry, but he was here first.
There's nothing you can do.
As long as he keeps the meter full, you're gonna have to move your truck.
- Sorry, bro.
- All right.
You should call la migra.
That bitch ain't legal.
This isn't Arizona, pal.
- You know what, for the record.
- Yeah?
I didn't steal that fool's mole, man.
He's high.
- All right.
Thanks.
- No, no, no!
- Not my truck, man!
- Hey.
Son of a bitch!
Aah!
- Son of a bitch!
- Get back!
Oh, man!
Turn it off.
Turn off the car.
Demolition derby's over.
Get out here.
- Come here.
Come here.
- He made me do it.
- You wrecked my truck for mole?
- Back off.
I'm pressing charges.
Gonna sue his ass.
Good luck, all my money is in Oaxaca.
- What?
- Come on.
Let's go.
- We were supposed to be partners.
- Idiot!
You thought you knew the guy, huh?
Never expected a knife in the back?
He took everything from me.
Yeah, well, some guys you just can't trust.
All right, look, I get it, okay?
I shouldn't have accused you of anything, all right?
Mea culpa, my bad.
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.
I'm sorry, all right?
- Officer?
- Hey, not right now, buddy!
I paid for my burrito, but he rammed the other little guy's truck.
Yeah, you know what?
There's a Taco Bell across the street.
A-36, requesting a traffic unit at our location.
Boyle Avenue and 1st Street.
You know who shot him?
Not yet.
Someone trying to steal your boyfriend's supply maybe.
I asked Cam to stop dealing, but he just wouldn't give it up.
Even after I told him the news.
Brenda, when is the last time you saw him?
Couple days ago.
Did he mention anyone after him, or getting into any arguments?
Too many arguments to count.
Cam said the only way to survive on the streets:
Never let anyone push you around.
I never would have made it without him.
I was 15 when I left home.
He dealt, I shot up.
Just the way we got by.
What about when you got pregnant?
I gave rehab a try when he went to jail.
Been clean eight months.
Good for you.
Thanks.
I work at the Vons now, full-time and I get benefits for my baby.
I turned things around, but Cam just....
He just couldn't.
Things have been tough for you and you're gonna get through this too.
Brenda, can you think of anyone he might have gotten into an argument with?
Easy cream, easy sugar?
- Jess?
- Hispanic male, by the Chevy.
Hey, let me see your hands.
Hey, put your hands, both of them, on the top of the car.
- What?
- Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Turn around.
Kick your legs open.
- Kick them open!
- What are you doing?
Following directions, huh?
- What you doing near the vehicle?
- It's my car.
- Yeah, let's see the registration, then.
- I can't.
My keys are locked inside.
I can't get in.
I'll go get the slim jim.
Did you get lost?
Where were you?
Courtyard behind the bank.
They got benches there.
- I tried you on the radio.
- Yeah, I know.
You ready to roll?
You didn't wanna eat lunch with me?
What are you, in the third grade?
I said I was sorry.
What do you want me to do, get down on my knees?
Not really in the mood for a blowjob, but thanks.
Gonna do this passive-aggressive shit all day?
- Can we talk about this?
- Talk about what?
What happened.
All right.
Let's start with the fact that every day I gotta watch my back.
Guns, knives people with camera phones hoping that we, uh, screw up.
This car's the one place where somebody's supposed to have my back.
Instead, you question my integrity.
My partner.
You know what?
I'm glad you did it, because now I know where we stand.
Don't sweat it.
He's not gonna file a complaint.
- He resisted.
- Resisted?
You slammed him up against his car because he misplaced his keys.
Look, I get it, all right?
Most people, when they get bad news, they hide behind their computer.
We don't get that luxury.
I wasn't blindsided.
What?
Divorce, it didn't come out of the blue.
I think he hung on as long as he did because I got the shit beat out of me.
Yeah, he would've been a real bastard if he had dumped me while I was in traction.
Let's go.
I really jacked someone up for locking himself out of the car?
Pretty much.
We'll, uh, go get drinks tonight.
You can bitch all you want.
- Your parents home?
- What took you so long?
I called over an hour ago.
You called the noise complaint in on yourself?
Hurry up, come in.
- This your party?
- Yeah.
- Mazel tov.
- Where are your parents?
- Told them they were cramping my style.
- So they left you here alone?
For a couple hours.
Look, I need you to shut it down.
- What?
- Shut the party down.
You saying you want us to end your bar mitzvah party?
Could you throw me up against the wall and cuff me too?
That would be so badass.
I'm trying to work this girl and I need to do something epic.
How about you turn the music down before we call the parents of every kid and epically embarrass you?
She's way out of my league.
Wait a sec.
Which one?
Red dress.
You sure you can handle it?
I'm a man now.
I can take it.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Turn that down!
Turn the music down!
Against the wall.
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you do can be held against you in court.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
Do you understand these rights as they have been read to you, punk?
I'm not an idiot.
Yeah?
I think you are an idiot.
You're trouble.
Nothing but trouble.
We'll drop him off down the block.
Let's go!
Oh.
The store down the street from the murder scene?
They have a surveillance camera.
- You catch anything?
- We're checking.
An energy bar for lunch?
Come on.
No.
Have half of my sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly?
No, thank you.
What's wrong with that?
My wife made this.
Did Ballistics check those shell casings?
It was a .40 caliber.
I put the word out but there's no shortage of lowlifes willing to put a bullet in a dealer.
Not a bullet.
Eight.
At close range.
That doesn't sound like a robbery to me.
It sounds personal.
I'll check with Narcotics, see if victim was stepping on anybody's turf.
Maybe it's payback, like he pissed somebody off in jail.
It's a damn shame too because I bet he probably would've been father of the year.
In the '30s, some prisons used to sterilize female prisoners to prevent them from having babies?
- Mm.
Screwed up.
- Not saying it's cool.
I'm just saying, addict mom, dealer dad this kid is just gonna follow in his parents' footsteps.
I wouldn't give up on the mom quite yet.
She was barely holding it together.
Yeah, well, after living a life like that, she's gotta be pretty tough.
All I'm saying is I've seen it too many times.
Clock's ticking till this kid ends up in foster care.
Adams.
Yeah.
Be right down.
Surveillance caught a car on camera.
We got a plate.
All units, home invasion in progress, 216 Gramercy Place.
A-57, show us responding, 216 Gramercy Place.
Roger, A-57, handle Code 3.
He's going.
Gun.
A-57, requesting backup, 216 Gramercy Place.
Blue Toyota, headed south toward Wilshire.
License plate two-Sam-Adam-Mary -five-six-four.
I'll cut him off.
A-57, in foot pursuit, eastbound towards Western.
Out of the way!
Get out of my way!
Go in the house!
Lock the door!
Now!
A-57, we now have shots fired.
All units, A-25 reports they have a suspect fitting the description in custody at 2nd Street and Manhattan Place.
A-57, I need an R.A. unit at my location victim of a gunshot wound.
Jess!
Saw a gun fired.
The ambulance is on its way.
- What are you doing?
- Triage.
He's breathing, but it's shallow.
We need to stop the bleeding.
Here.
You apply pressure, I'll start CPR.
Okay, come on.
Stay with me, all right?
You okay?
Yeah, he had a gun, I just--
Well, gray hoodie.
I just came, I turned the corner, there's a man pointing a gun at me.
Yeah.
It's a clean shooting.
Something down by his feet?
What?
I came in, you were down by his feet.
Yeah, I was securing his gun.
I mean, who, you know, hears sirens and runs out with a toy gun?
Coop, Tang, I need you to separate.
Schuman from FID is on his way.
All right, you know the rules.
Separate corners until after the debrief.
Tang?
Let's go.
See you later.
There's our silver Ford Focus.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Rhonda Owens?
I figured you'd show up here eventually.
He's a good boy.
He didn't mean no harm.
- Cam Huggins?
- Who?
No, my son.
Stealing the cable TV so I could watch Monday Night Football.
Oh.
- Is that your car in the driveway?
- Yeah.
- When was the last time you drove it?
- When I went to vote for Obama.
Have you lent anybody your car recently?
If five years ago is recent.
No, it's not.
This is not about the cable TV?
No plates.
Uh, no, ma'am.
And we're sorry to have bothered you.
Thank you.
Football.
Through the driveway and around the corner.
I saw a dark-dressed individual here with a gun.
I fired one round from my service weapon.
Aimed for center mass, saw the suspect go down.
And when you saw it wasn't the suspect?
I radioed for an R.A. unit and I immediately tried to stop the bleeding.
Kid has a record.
Three months in juvie.
Broke a teacher's nose, you believe that?
You want some coffee or something?
Something to eat?
No.
I hate babysitting as much as you hate being babysitted, but that's the rules.
At least put me to good use.
Stupid kids running around with toy guns.
When are they gonna take them damn things off the shelf?
How are you to tell the difference between that and a real Sig 9 millimeter from here?
Cooper.
We're gonna be a while.
We'll talk back at the station.
My car is out front.
What happened?
Is it Derrick?
- Where is he?
- He's at Mercy.
We'll take you.
He was doing better.
Back in school.
He swore he wouldn't take the tip off that toy gun.
He promised me.
Shooter was smart.
He used the old lady's plates just in case his car was spotted.
- Premeditated.
- At least we know he drove a Focus.
Could crosscheck it with other dealers and ex-cons in the area.
- Detective Adams.
- Hey, Ross.
- How's your mom?
- In remission.
Doing good, thanks.
Listen, were you on the lookout for a .40 caliber?
Yeah.
For a murder in Lincoln Heights.
Picked up a punk.
Had three baggies of heroin and a .40 caliber Ruger on him.
Know what part of town he worked?
Or if he spent time at county?
No.
Claims he bought the gun this morning.
Well, take the gun to Ballistics, and we'll see if it's a match.
What?
He says he, uh, bought it off some pregnant lady.
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Ross.
Hey, John, you almost done in there?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm just, uh finishing up.
They're ready for you.
Look, you have every right to be pissed off, okay?
I would be if it were me.
For what it's worth, I've been beating myself up about it.
- Sam.
- Shh.
Crazy Carol.
Tried to get her help, but they're not gonna take her at St. Joe's again.
- Got a hell of a right hook.
- Yeah, she's only a danger to herself.
Carol.
Officer Bryant.
Remember me?
You raped me.
No, I did not rape you.
Okay.
Let's get you out of the street.
Don't come near me!
No.
He raped me!
Aah!
Carol, don't do that to yourself.
Should we take her in?
No law against beating the crap out of yourself.
Just gotta do it somewhere else.
Come on, man.
I got a meeting.
If you're important, they'll wait.
Keep your Taser in the holster.
Get me that can.
- What?
- Just do it.
I got an idea.
Hey, Carol.
Now, how many times have we been over this?
Look at this.
You want this?
Now, you know the deal.
I give you the can, you get out of the street, right?
Carol, do we have a deal?
We got a deal?
Okay.
You raped me.
Carol, get your stuff and move along, okay?
Get your stuff and move along.
See, now that's how you handle it.
- You raped me!
- Sammy!
Don't touch me!
Drop it.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
You're all right.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be okay.
Damn it, Carol.
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
All right, I'm gonna need to get you up.
I didn't do anything, anything at all.
- Can you stand up?
- No, l--
- Can you stand up?
- No.
You need anything before we get started?
Water?
How's the kid?
Critical condition.
- How's it look?
- He's in surgery.
Okay, let's get started.
So, what did you observe when you got to the scene?
We got a radio call.
He raped me!
You all saw it!
Getting pretty desperate there, Bryant.
Not my type.
He said, she said.
Search her, put her in the holding tank.
We'll, uh, book her when we get back.
Thanks.
- Does he need to go to the hospital?
- I need a tailor, not a doctor.
No stitches necessary.
- So you ready?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Thanks, man.
Yeah, no need to thank me or anything.
For what?
Saving your life?
No biggie.
Right.
She could've sliced your carotid artery.
You're lucky I don't tell the guys you got cut by a 60-year-old homeless woman.
Let's go.
Hey.
You find who did it?
Think so.
We just need to come in and ask you a few follow-up questions.
What kind of questions?
- What kind of car do you drive?
- I don't own a car.
Your boyfriend owned a silver Ford Focus.
- You ever borrow it from him?
- No.
There's a silver Ford Focus parked down the street.
Are we gonna find your prints at the wheel?
Be my guest.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, come on.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Let me go!
I didn't do anything!
- Easy.
- I didn't do anything!
Easy, Brenda.
Book Crazy Carol.
I gotta go change and pick up the kid.
That's it?
I had your back.
You want extra credit for doing your job?
Just cut me some slack.
What do I have to do?
What you did is what you're supposed to do.
Doesn't win you a get-out-of-jail-free card.
There an ETA on when you're gonna get past this?
- What do you want, a mulligan?
- No.
I'm not asking you to forget.
Just move on.
Twelve hours a day we ride together.
In that time, I'll do everything to make sure we both get home safe.
But when the shift ends, this ends.
Okay?
Don't expect me to go out and eat up your stories of female conquests over burgers and beers.
Nate never made a mistake?
Sorry I don't live up to standards set by your former partner but I'm just about out of sorries.
Savor this one.
It's the last you're gonna hear.
Take off the cuffs.
I'm not going anywhere.
We're gonna take you to county, have a doctor check you out.
So what if I took his car for a spin.
I didn't do anything wrong.
We have the gun.
Ballistics matched.
So?
So the guy you sold the gun to ID'd you.
If you did your job people like me wouldn't have to protect ourselves.
People like you?
- How's that?
- Ones trying to live right.
You don't care if Cam jumped back into dealing if he brought guns, needles, thugs into my house where my child's gonna be.
- You should've kicked him out.
- Think I didn't try?
Changed the locks.
He knocked out two of my molars.
Doctor at the clinic said I could've lost my baby.
Call 911.
Press charges.
So he'd serve what, a couple of months?
What were you gonna do to protect me when he got out?
Protect my baby?
Restraining orders don't work.
I didn't wanna kill him.
Had to, for my girl.
What's gonna happen to her?
She'll be given to a relative.
If I don't have any?
Foster care.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Could use that drink.
What about you?
How was, uh, FID?
I've known Larry 12 years.
He's fair.
What did they wanna know?
What I saw.
- What did you tell him?
- Came in on you doing triage.
What were you doing when I caught up?
I was managing the situation the best I could.
His or yours?
It was an accidental shooting.
You didn't need to do anything.
The department wouldn't have thrown you under the bus.
It was an accident.
You go back to the investigator.
Tell him you were served with divorce papers and had a bad day.
- A bad day.
- Yeah, a bad day.
Go back.
- And you tell him the truth.
- Or what, you will?
What happened today was a tragedy.
But I am a first-rate officer.
Go back to FID.
Stick to what you saw.
I assume you're waiting for me to tell you you were right.
Oh, the anticipation, it's killing me.
Fine, you were right about Brenda's baby.
- Happy?
- About another kid entering foster care?
I don't know if happy is the word I'm looking for.
Kid wouldn't be in the system if mom didn't pull the trigger.
She shot her ex so many times, almost had to reload.
All right, I hear you.
I hear you.
Look, don't worry about it.
I don't mind staying late.
Permission to give you some advice?
When you worked patrol you remember the surest way to find out if someone was carrying?
- Roll up on them, and see if they ran.
- Mm-hmm.
Look.
Fernandez rolled up on you this morning.
Stop working late, drawing attention to yourself.
Just act normal.
Then people won't wonder why you're not feeling well.
Unless, of course, you can't fit behind the steering wheel anymore.
Thought you had a game to watch.
I saw the news downstairs.
I already know who won.
That's too bad.
There's another game tomorrow.
Hey, boss.
If there ever was something that you felt like you wanted to tell me it will never leave this desk.
Good night.
See you tomorrow, partner.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I need something now.
Oxy?
Vicodin?
Doesn't matter, I just need something.
Just....
I feel like I'm losing my grip.
Rough day?
It's cool, man.
I got something for you.
You know what that says?
Ten years clean.
You expect this to be easy?
You gotta earn this.
You've got to go through hell to get one of these.
You did the right thing calling me.
That's way this program's supposed to work, John.
I been where you are.
I doubt that.
Well, what's eating you?
Saw something.
I just can't shake it.
On the job?
I thought you'd seen everything.
Uh-huh.
Well, whatever it is, it's between us.
You gotta tell somebody.
When you're ready.
Tonight, you can just listen.
Come on, the meeting's about to start.
How you doing?
It's good to see you.

The ramifications will last their whole lives.

A couple days.
They check you for rabies?
Never know.
Well, if I start frothing at the mouth, you can just call an ambulance.
Yeah.
I was gonna call animal control.

It's too bad your neck mobility is compromised.

You've been served.
Sorry again.
John: [ Singsong voice ] Good morning!

Need a nap already, Sherman?
[ Scoffs ] We were both up half the night, John.
Only difference is, I was with a girl, as opposed to looking at one online.
[ Man laughs ]
Fischer:
Hey, you didn't go to that country-girl bar again, did you?
That dump is STD Central.
I met her at the gym.
Parsons:
At Curves.
[ Laughter ]
She's a yoga instructor.
Let me tell you, her downward dog is amazing.
Hello.
The best part is, she works for Princess Cruises, so, uh, she's not gonna be back for the next three weeks.
Binge and purge.
You are my guru, Sherman.
Ai-yee.
Sammy:
Let's roll, man.
Parsons:
What's up with him?
If my partner was getting laid like that,
I wouldn't want to hear about it, either.
Man:
You're right.
[ Laughter ]
Breakfast of champions.
Got a call.
Lincoln Heights.
Uh, step into my office before you head out.
It will only take a sec.
You want to tell me why you've been here, burning the midnight oil?
There's no approval for overtime, you know.
[ Scoffs ] I'm not gonna sue the city, if that's what you're worried about.
I just got a little behind.
I'm catching up.
You feeling any better?
What?
You've been dragging.
Heard you weren't feeling well.
[ Scoffs ] It's just a bug.
You can level with me, Lydia.
Woman to woman.
I'll let you know if something comes up.
I got to go.
That traffic is gonna be a bear.
What's up?
We got a body in Lincoln Heights.
Okay.
Let's go to Lincoln Heights.
You hear that shit about Cooper?
It's crazy, right?
Some asshole latched on to his neck like a Pterodactyl.
The R.A. got to him just in time.
[ Siren walls in distance ]
I signed, you know.
Closed the deal on the house.
Signed all the paperwork last night.
I'm all in.
Even got my Costco card.
Can't get much more "all in" than that.
Merkle:
What's up, Ben?
Merkle.
Thank God we got that thing with the pipe worked out, right?
[ Chuckles ] Oh.
Dodged a bullet there, didn't we, chief?
Imagine how many of these assholes are telling the truth.
- Kind of scary, isn't it?
- Get lost, man.
What's your [bleep] problem?
[ Sighs ]
Little lovers' quarrel with your girlfriend there?
I'm glad you guys got to catch up, but me -- I'm sick of paying little Nate's babysitter overtime, so let's finish on time today.
What do you say, Benji?

[ Police radio chatter ]
We, uh -- we in a hurry to get somewhere?

Look, a subpoena's a real rough way to start the day, all right?
I know a lawyer downtown.
Helped me with some legal matters once.
He's a piece of work, but, uh, the kind you don't mind having on your side.
I'm not getting sued.
Black S.U.V.
Roll up on him.
I'll have him move.
You gonna write him a ticket?
Yeah.
Jerks like this -- they cause bottlenecks.

Especially not with that Kardashian garbage.

Somebody's saying something.
Hey, it ain't me.
It ain't my business.
How you doing?
Robinson.
Adams.
Bellia.
Victim's over here.
He just got out of county last week.
For what?
Eight months.
Possession with intent.
Word is he went right back to the streets, working out of the alley.
Drugs still on him?
No.
Ruben:
Robbery?
Maybe, or a deal gone south.
Any witnesses?
No.
How many hits?
I counted eight.
Whoever put him down did not want him to get back up.
So, did you, uh, have to dust off this citation book before you wrote that ticket?
Jerk knew he was breaking the law.
Well, you know, it is a slippery slope.
First it's double parking, then it's triple homicide.
Got to really keep your eyes open for them jaywalkers.
I need coffee.
[ Inhales sharply ]
What?
Nothing.
Got a problem with my caffeine intake?
Nope.
Knock yourself out.
My husband's divorcing me, in case you were wondering what was in the envelope.
I didn't even know you were married.
Yeah.
Six years.
In sickness and in health, till irreconcilable differences do us part.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah.
Deadbeat's gonna get half my pension.
I guess that year of couples' counseling was time well spent.

What happened?
Hey, don't worry about it, bro.
I'll make sure they don't go hungry.
We had a truck together.
He steals my molé negro and starts his own!
I didn't steal nothing, bitch.
Now he takes space?
You snooze, you lose, bro.
He ain't even Oaxacan!
He's from Glendale!
Okay.
Whose truck is this?
That's mine.
I put everything I had into it.
I'm here every day.
Those are my customers!
Okay, listen.
I am very sorry, but he was here first.
There's nothing you can do.
As long as he keeps the meter full, you're gonna have to move your truck.
[ Pedro chuckles ]
Pedro:
Sorry, bro.
Hey, you should call la migra, man.
That bitch ain't legal.
This isn't Arizona, pal.
And you know what?
For the record...
Yeah?
I didn't steal that fool's molé, man.
He's high.
All right.
Thanks.
No, no, no, no!
Not my truck, man!
Oh, son of a bitch!
Hey!
Ohh!
Son of a bitch!
Sammy:
Get back!
Oh, man!
Turn it off!
Turn off the car!
Ben:
Demolition derby's over!
Get out of here!
Come here.
Come here!
He made me do it.
Bitch, you wrecked my truck for molé?
!
- Back off!
- I'm pressing charges!
I'm gonna sue his ass!
Good luck.
All my money's back in Oaxaca.
What?
!
Sammy:
Come on.
Let's go.
- We were supposed to be partners.
- Idiot!
You thought you knew the guy, huh?
Never expected a knife in the back?
He took everything from me.
Yeah, well, some guys you just can't trust.
All right, look.
I get it, okay?
I shouldn't have accused you of anything, all right?
Mea culpa.
My bad.
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.
I'm sorry, all right?
!
- Officer.
- Hey, not right now, buddy!
I paid for my burrito, but he rammed the other little guy's truck before I could get it!
Yeah.
You know what?
There's a Taco Bell across the street.
A-36, requesting a traffic unit at our location --
Boyle Avenue and 1st Street.
[ Sighs ]
You know who shot him?
Not yet.
Someone trying to steal your boyfriend's supply, maybe.
I asked Cam to stop dealing, but he just wouldn't give it up, even after I told him the news.
Brenda, when's the last time you saw him?
Couple days ago.
Did he mention anyone after him or getting into any arguments?
Too many arguments to count.
Cam said the only way to survive on the streets -- never let anyone push you around.
I never would have made it without him.
I was 15 when I left home.
He dealt.
I shot up.
Just the way we got by.
What about when you got pregnant?
I gave rehab a try when he went to jail.
Been clean eight months.
Good for you.
Thanks.
I work at the Vons now -- full time.
And I get benefits...
for my baby.
I turned things around, but Cam just...
[ Voice breaking ] He just couldn't.
Things have been tough for you.
And you're gonna get through this, too.
[ Sniffles, cries ]
Brenda, can you think of anyone he might have gotten into an argument with?
[ Police radio chatter ]
Easy cream, easy sugar?
Jess?
Hispanic male by the Chevy.
Hey, let me see your hands!
Hi.
Hey, put your hands, both of them, on the top of the car.
Let's go.
What?
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Kick your legs open.
Kick them open!
What are you doing?
I wasn't doing anything.
Following directions?
Huh?
What were you doing near the vehicle, sir?
It's my car.
Yeah?
Let's see the registration, then.
I can't.
My keys are locked inside.
I can't get in.
I'll go get the slim Jim.
Ben:
Did you get lost?
Where were you?
Courtyard behind the bank.
They got benches over there.
Tried you on the radio.
Yeah, I don't know.
You ready to roll?
You didn't want to eat lunch with me?
What are you, in the 3rd grade?
Look, I said I was sorry.
What do you want me to do, get down on my knees?
I'm not really in the mood for a blowjob, but thanks.
You gonna do this passive-aggressive shit all day?
Can we talk about this?
Talk about what?
What happened!
All right.
Let's start with the fact that every day,
I got to watch my back -- guns, knives, people with camera phones, hoping that we, uh, screw up.
This car's the one place where somebody's supposed to have my back.
Instead, you question my integrity.
My partner.
You know what?
I'm glad you did it, 'cause now I know where we stand.
[ Car door closes ]
[ Engine turns over ]
Don't sweat it.
He's not gonna file a complaint.
[ Scoffs ] He resisted.
Resisted?
You slammed him up against his car because he misplaced his keys.
Look, I get it, all right?
Most people, when they get blindsided by bad news, they just hide behind their computer and phone their job in.
We don't get that luxury.
I wasn't blindsided.
What?
Divorce -- it didn't come out of the blue.
I think he only hung on as long as he did because I got the shit beat out of me.
Yeah, he would have been a real bastard if he had dumped me while I was in traction.
Let's go.
I really jacked someone up, huh?
For locking himself out of the car?
Pretty much.
We'll, uh, go get drinks tonight.
You can bitch all you want.
[ Grunts ]
[ Rap music playing and dog barking in distance ]
[ Music and barking continue ]
Your parents home?
What took you so long?
I called over an hour ago.
You called a noise complaint in on yourself.
Hurry up.
Come in.
[ Sighs ]
Sammy:
This your party?
Yeah.
Mazel tov.
Where are your parents?
I told them they were cramping my style.
So they left you here alone?
For a couple hours.
Look, I need you to shut it down.
What?
Shut the party down?
You saying you want us to end your Bar Mitzvah party?
Could you throw me up against the wall and cuff me, too?
That would be so badass.
[ Chuckles ]
I-I'm trying to work this girl, and I need to do something epic.
How 'bout you turn the music down now before we call the parents of every kid in here and epically embarrass you?
S-she's way out of my league.
Wait a sec.
Which one?
Red dress.
Sure you can handle it?
I'm a man now.
I can take it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, turn that music down!
Turn the music down!
Up against the wall.
You're under arrest, okay?
Whoa.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you do or say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak with an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
Do you understand these rights as they have been read to you?
Huh, punk?
I'm not an idiot!
Yeah?
I think you are an idiot.
I think you're trouble!
Nothing but trouble!
We'll drop him off down the block, make his year.
Let's go!
[ Music continues ]
Oh, the liquor store down the street from the murder scene -- they have a surveillance camera.
You catch anything?
We're checking.
[ Plastic rustles ]
An energy bar for lunch?
Come on.
No.
Have half of my sandwich.
Peanut butter and jelly?
No, thank you.
What's wrong with -- my wife made this.
Did ballistics check those shell casings?
They were .40 caliber.
I put the word out, but there's really no shortage of lowlifes willing to put a bullet in a dealer for his stash, you know?
Not a bullet -- eight, at close range.
That doesn't sound like a robbery to me.
That sounds personal.
Well, I'll check with narcotics, see if our victim was stepping on anybody's turf.
Maybe it's payback -- like, he pissed somebody off in jail.
It's a damn shame, too, 'cause I bet he probably would have been father of the year.
[ Chuckles ] You know, back in the '30s, some prisons used to sterilize their female prisoners to prevent them from having babies?
Mm.
That's screwed up.
Not saying it's cool.
I'm just saying -- addict mom, dealer dad.
Chances are, this kid is just gonna follow in his parents' footsteps.
I wouldn't give up on the mom quite yet.
She was barely holding it together.
Yeah, well, after living a life like that, she's got to be pretty tough.
All I'm saying is I've seen it too many times.
Clock's ticking till this kid ends up in foster care.
[ Telephone rings ]
Adams.
Yeah.
Be right down.
Surveillance caught a car on camera.
We got a plate.
Mm.
Dispatcher:
All units, home invasion in progress -- 216 Gramercy Place.
A-57, show us responding.
216 Gramercy Place.
Roger, 57, handle code 3.
[ Siren walls ]
He's going.
Gun!
A-57, requesting backup!
216 Gramercy Place!
Blue Toyota headed south toward Wilshire!
License plate 2-Sam-Adam-Mary-5-6-4!
I'll cut him off!
A-57 in foot pursuit eastbound towards Western!
[ Panting ]
[ John shouts ]
[ Grunts ]
Aah!
[ Grunts ]
[ Woman screams ]
John: [Bleep] Way!
[ Panting ]
Go in the house!
Lock the door -- now!
[ Breathing heavily ]
[ Gunshot ]
[ Siren walls ]
A-57, we now have shots fired.
All units, A-25 reports they have a suspect fitting the description in custody at 2nd Street and Manhattan Place.
[ Breathing heavily ]
A-57, I need an R.A. Unit at my location.
Victim of a gunshot wound.
Jess!
Saw a gun.
Fired.
The ambulance is on its way.
What are you doing?
Triage.
He's breathing, but it's shallow.
We need to stop the bleeding.
Here.
You apply pressure.
I'll start CPR.
Okay.
Stay with me, all right?
John:
You okay?
Yeah.
He had a gun.
I just...
Well, gray hoodie.
I just came back, turned the corner, there's a man pointing a gun at me...
Yeah.
It was a clean shooting.
John:
Was something down by his feet?
What?
When I came in, you were down by his feet.
Yeah.
I was securing his gun.
[ Breathes deeply ] I mean, who -- who, you know, hears sirens and runs out with a toy gun?
Brill:
Coop, Tang.
I need you to separate.
Shuman from F.I.D. is on his way.
All right, you know the rules.
Separate corners until after the debrief.
Tang.
Let's go.
See you later.
There's our silver Ford Focus.
[ Car door closes ]
Ruben:
Mm-hmm.
[ Police radio chatter ]
[ Knock on door ]
Rhonda Owens?
I figured you'd show up here eventually.
He's a good boy.
He didn't mean no harm.
Cam Huggins.
Who?
No, my son.
Stealing the cable TV so I could watch "Monday Night Football."
Oh.
Is that your car in the driveway?
Yeah.
When's the last time you drove it?
When I went to vote for Obama!
[ Exhales sharply ]
Have you lent anybody your car recently?
If five years ago is recent.
No.
It's not.
This is not about the cable TV?
No plates.
Uh, no, ma'am.
And, uh, we're sorry to have bothered you.
Thank you.
Football.
I came through the driveway and around the corner.
I saw a dark-dressed individual here with a gun.
I fired one round from my service weapon, aimed for center mass, saw the suspect go down.
Shuman:
And when you saw it wasn't the suspect?
I radioed for an R.A. Unit, and I immediately tried to stop the bleeding.
Kid has a record.
Three months in juvie.
Broke a teacher's nose.
You believe that?
You want some coffee or something?
Something to eat?
No.
[ Sighs ] Come on, man.
I hate babysitting as much as you hate being babysitted, but that's the rules.
At least put me to good use.
Stupid kids, running around with toy guns.
When they gonna take them damn things off the shelf, anyway?
I mean, how the hell are you supposed to tell the difference between that and a real Sig 9mm...
From here?
Shuman:
Cooper.
We're gonna be a while.
We'll talk back at the station.
My car's out front.
Shannon:
What happened?
!
Is it Derrick?
[ Crying ] Where is he?
!
He's at Mercy.
We'll take you.
He was doing better, back in school.
He swore he wouldn't take the tip off that toy gun.
Promised me.
Lydia:
Shooter was smart.
He used the old lady's plates just in case his car was spotted.
Premeditated.
At least we know he drove a Focus.
We can cross-check it with other dealers and ex-cons in the area.
Detective Adams.
Hey, Ross.
How's your mom?
In remission.
Doing good.
Thanks.
Listen, were you on the lookout for a .40 caliber?
Yeah, for a murder in Lincoln Heights.
Well, we just picked up a punk -- had three baggies of heroin and a .40 caliber Ruger on him.
Know what part of town he worked?
Or if he ever spent any time in county?
No.
Claims he bought the gun this morning.
Well, take the gun to ballistics, and we'll see if it's a match.
[ Chuckles ] What?
Uh, says he bought it off some pregnant lady.
Thanks, Ross.
[ Door opens ]
Brill:
Hey, John.
You almost done in there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just, uh...
Finishing up.
They're ready for you.
[ Door closes ]
[ Exhales slowly ]
[ Toilet flushes ]
Look, you have every right to be pissed off, okay?
I would be, if it were me.
[ Sighs ] For what it's worth,
I've been beating myself up about it.
Sam.
[ Exhales slowly ]
Crazy Carol.
Tried to get her help, but they're not gonna take her at St. Joe's again.
She's got a hell of a right hook.
Yeah.
She's only a danger to herself.
Carol!
Officer Bryant.
Remember me?
You raped me.
No, I did not rape you, okay?
Let's -- let's get you out of the street.
No, don't come near me!
No!
He raped me!
Ohh!
Carol, don't do that to yourself.
Should we take her in?
There's no law against beating the crap out of yourself.
She's got to do it somewhere else.
Man:
Come on, man!
I got a meeting!
If you're important, they'll wait!
Keep your taser in the holster.
Give me that can.
What?
Just do it.
I got an idea.
Hey, Carol, now, how many times we been over this?
[ Carol shudders ]
Look at this.
You want this?
Now, you know the deal.
I give you the can, you get out of the street, right?
Carol, do we have a deal?
We got a deal?
[ Breathing heavily ]
Okay.
[ Lips smack ]
You raped me.
[ Huffing ]
Carol, get your stuff and move along, okay?
Get your stuff and move along.
See?
Now, that's how you handle it.
You raped me!
Sammy!
Don't touch me!
[ Yelling ]
Drop it.
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!
[ Sobbing ]
You'll be all right.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be okay.
Damn it, Carol.
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
All right, I'm gonna need to get you up.
I didn't do anything -- anything at all.
[ Crying ]
Can you stand up?
No.
Can you stand up?
[ Carol whimpering ]
I didn't do anything.
[ Scoffs lightly ]
You need anything before we get started?
Water?
How's the kid?
Critical condition.
How's it look?
He's in surgery.
Okay.
Let's get started.
So, what did you observe when you got to the scene?
We got a radio call.
He raped me!
You all saw it!
Getting pretty desperate there, Bryant.
She's not my type.
He said, she said.
Just search her.
Put her in the holding tank.
We'll, uh, we'll book her when we get back.
Thanks.
[ Car door closes, engine turns over ]
Do you need to go to the hospital?
I need a tailor, not a doctor.
No stitches necessary.
So, you ready?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm ready.
Thanks, man.
Yeah, no need to thank me or anything.
For what?
Saving your life.
No Biggie.
[ Sarcastically ] Right.
She could have sliced your carotid artery.
You're lucky I don't tell the guys you got cut by a 60-year-old homeless woman.
Let's go!
Hey.
You find who did it?
Think so.
We just need to come in and ask you a few follow-up questions.
What kind of questions?
What kind of car do you drive?
I don't own a car.
Your boyfriend owned a silver Ford Focus.
You ever borrow it from him?
No.
There's a silver Ford Focus parked down this street.
Are we gonna find your prints at the wheel?
Unh.
Be my guest.
[ Sighs ]
Whoa!
[ Brenda grunts ]
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, come on.
Lydia:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Easy, easy, easy.
Let me go!
I didn't do anything!
Easy!
I didn't do anything!
Easy.
Brenda.
[ Sighs ]
Book crazy Carol.
I got to go change and pick up the kid.
That's it?
I had your back.
You want extra credit for doing your job?
Just cut me some slack, man.
What do I have to do, take a bullet for you?
What you did back there is what you're supposed to do.
It doesn't win you a get-out-of-jail-free card.
Hey, is there an E.T.A. on when you're gonna get past this?
What do you want, a mulligan?
No, I'm not asking you to forget what I said.
Just move on.
12 hours a day, we ride together.
In that time, I'll do everything in my power to make sure we both get home safe.
But when the shift ends, this ends, okay?
Don't expect me to go out and eat up your stories of female conquest over burgers and beers.
Nate never made a mistake?
I'm sorry I don't live up to the standards set by your former partner, but I'm just about out of sorries.
Savor this one.
It's the last you're gonna hear.
[ Door opens, closes ]
Take off the cuffs.
I'm not going anywhere.
We're gonna take you to county, have a doctor check you out.
So what if I took his car for a spin?
I didn't do anything wrong.
We have the gun.
Ballistics matched.
So?
So, the guy you sold the gun to I.D.'d you.
If you did your job, people like me wouldn't have to protect ourselves.
People like you?
How's that?
Ones trying to live right.
You don't care if Cam jumped right back into dealing...
If he brought guns and needles and thugs into my house, where my child's gonna be.
You should have kicked him out.
You think I didn't try?
I changed the locks.
He knocked out two of my molars.
Doctor at the clinic said I could have lost my baby.
Call 911.
Press charges.
So he'd serve what -- a couple of months?
What were you gonna do to protect me when he got out -- protect my baby?
Restraining orders don't work.
I didn't want to kill him.
Had to, for my girl.
What's gonna happen to her?
She'll be given to a relative.
And if I don't have any?
Foster care.
Hey.
Hey.
I could use that drink.
What about you?
How was, uh, F.I.D.?
I've known Larry 12 years.
He's fair.
What'd they want to know?
What I saw.
What'd you tell him?
Came in on you doing triage.
What were you doing when I caught up?
I was managing the situation the best I could.
His or yours?
It was an accidental shooting.
You didn't need to do anything.
The department -- they wouldn't have thrown you under the bus.
It's an accident.
It could have happened to any of us.
You go back in to the investigator.
You tell him you were served with divorce papers, and you had a bad day.
- Had a bad day.
- Yeah,bad day.
I had a bad day.
You go back in there, and you tell him the truth.
Or what?
You will?
What happened today was a tragedy.
But I am a first-rate officer.
Go back to F.I.D.
Stick to what you saw!
[ Car horn honks in distance ]
[ Engine turns over ]
[ Chuckles ]
I assume you're waiting for me to tell you you were right.
Oh, the anticipation is killing me.
Fine.
You were right about Brenda's baby.
Happy?
About another kid entering foster care?
No.
I don't know if "happy" is necessarily the word I'm looking for.
The kid wouldn't even be in the system if the mom didn't pull the trigger.
She shot her ex so many times, she almost had to reload.
All right.
I hear you.
I hear you.
Look, don't worry about it.
I don't mind staying late.
[ Sighs ]
Permission to give you some advice?
When you worked patrol, you remember the surest way to find out if someone was carrying?
Roll up on them and see if they ran.
Mm-hmm.
Look Fernandez rolled up on you this morning.
Stop working late, drawing attention to yourself.
Just act normal.
Then people won't wonder why you're not...feeling well.
Unless, of course, you can't fit behind the steering wheel anymore.
I thought you had a game to watch.
I saw the news downstairs.
I already know who won.
Oh, that's too bad.
There's another game tomorrow.
[ Breathes deeply ]
And, boss...
If there ever was something that you felt like you wanted to tell me, it will never leave this desk.
Good night.
See you tomorrow...
Partner.
Man:
Hey.
Hey.
I need something now.
Oxy?
Vicodin?
Doesn't matter.
I just need something.
Just...
I feel like I'm losing my grip.
Rough day?
[ Chuckles ]
It's cool, man.
I got something for you.
You know what this is?
10 years clean.
You expect this to be easy.
You got to earn this.
You got to go through hell to get one of these.
You did the right thing, calling me.
That's the way this program's supposed to work, John.
I've been where you are.
I doubt that.
Well, what's eating you?
I saw something.
I just can't shake it.
On the job?
I thought you'd seen everything.
Uh-huh.
Well, whatever it is, it's between us.
You got to tell somebody.
When you ready.
Tonight, you can just listen.
Come on.
The meeting's about to start.
[ John exhales sharply ]
It's good to see you.
[ Purse thuds ]
[ Breathing deeply ]
[ Slams table, grunts ]

Gossip Girl here, your one and only source, into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Dan's serial is continuing in Vanity Fair.
Dan, we had a deal!
Vanity Fair is the big time.
And the more readers I have the more power I have.
It's that simple.
Dan wrote the truth.
We are together.
And I want you, by my side, here, and at the gallery opening.
Are you Dan Humphrey?
I am.
I read your piece in "The Spectator" today.
Can I buy you a drink?
Absolutely.
Did this really happen?
You and Serena?
Every dirty detail, exactly as it occurred.
She said she erased it, but did you actually see her do it?
What is wrong with you?
You had someone who loved you unconditionally, and you threw that all away to let Chuck Bass decide when he's ready for you?
I just have a few questions about a weekend you spent with Bart in Dubai about four years ago.
Dave drove Bart to meet someone named lady Alexander.
I don't know who she is or even where to start looking for her.
We will find her.
And who am I?
That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.O.X.O., Gossip Girl.
Extra, extra, read all about it... the latest upper east sider to take center stage in the social spotlight.
But you know what they say?
If you can't take the heat, then move to Hell's Kitchen.
"Nate Archibald has the opposite of the Midas touch.
Instead of everything he touches turning to gold, he turns all the gold he's been given to dust."
Your friend's poor, right?
I mean, he's probably just jealous.
Oh, first of all, Dan screwed me over by selling the serialization of his new book right out from under me, and then he releases the chapter about me.
You look really hot in the picture.
Who cares what it says?
He's saying that
I'm single-handedly destroying "The Spectator."
Okay, enough.
This Dan guy is full of it.
No, actually, if he was making stuff up, you know, I'd be mad, but I'd get over it.
Thing is, he's right.
"The Spectator" is in serious financial trouble, and it's all my fault.
It's why I'm meeting with the bank later today to hopefully extend our credit line.
Can I help?
Please.
I am dying for an excuse to skip brunch with my dad and Serena Van Der Floozy.
No, that's nice, but you should go to brunch, and you should be nice to Serena, all right?
She's the one who convinced your dad to let us keep dating, all right?
Give her a chance.
Your article on Nate is generating major online buzz.
Huffpo has a link on their main page, and Dwight Garner just tweeted about it, saying that he's halfway through and doesn't hate it yet.
Even "Gossip Girl" gave us a nice plug.
Overall, the reaction's been positive... for you, that is.
Not for Nate.
Are they talking about how the use of real names makes this my "In cold blood"?
I mean, do they like the writing?
Are they making any comparisons to historical literary figures?
Perez Hilton.
But the important thing is that they're talking about it.
Literary celebrity is fleeting.
We have to make the most of it.
Trust me.
I have been.
I am not talking about trolling for lit groupies at McNally's and sleeping with your coffee dates.
Well, that's how I'm finding a bed to sleep in every night.
Look, being a writer in 2012 isn't merely about the words that you write.
It's about your image.
So from now on, you're only going to be seen with girls who have Ivy League pedigrees, or, at the very least, Vassar.
She needs to have cover girl looks and at least three mentions in "Page Six"
in the last six months.
How exactly am I gonna do that?
I've already set up the interviews.
This is the guy my daughter's dating?
Have you read this article on Nate?
Oh, I'm not a fan of the author's previous work.
Well, let me summarize for you.
His last girlfriend was a madam.
Before that, he dated con artists with an "S"
because, yes, there was more than one.
Your friend Dan wrote all this?
Dan Humphrey's a douche.
Well, you can forget about dating the guy in this article ever again.
That's fine by me.
Nate is nothing like the guy in that article.
Well, I don't know what Dan wrote, but I can vouch for Nate.
He's kind and honest and a good friend.
And... and he cares about Sage a lot.
You should get to know him before you judge him.
Or at least before you hit him again.
Dad, can he come to the horse show with us?
This afternoon?
No, that's always been our thing.
Oh, come on.
You hate it, and you know it.
It'll give you someone to talk about football with instead.
Nate loves football.
See?
Look, we're already finding things to bond over.
Oh, I guess he can join us.
It'll give me a chance to talk to him.
Possibly threaten his life.
I'll see if he can come.
Thanks, dad.
You, too, Serena.
Did you see that?
She almost smiled at me.
Hmm.
And don't worry about Nate.
You'll really like him.
He's the best.
Well, you would know.
When were you gonna tell me you've had sex with my daughter's boyfriend?
Okay.
This is definitely a... a fire hazard.
I think it's time to unpack the boxes Lily sent over.
Sorry, I've been so busy with this new gallery opening.
I'm actually headed over there now.
Don't take this the wrong way, but maybe you're using the gallery as an excuse to avoid going through your old life.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Is it?
These boxes are full of stuff from your time with Lily, and I can see how revisiting those memories could be difficult.
Look, let me help.
I will unpack the boxes, and when you come back, they'll be gone.
That would be nice.
Keep the things that we can use around the loft and just throw everything else out.
Gosh.
"May 17, 2008.
Dear Rufus, last night was the best night of my life"
It's kind of a big deal not to mention.
I wasn't trying to hide my past with Nate.
I swear it was a long time ago.
We're just friends now, and besides, when is something like that supposed to come up?
I don't know.
Maybe the second he started dating my daughter?
Sage knows, and she doesn't care.
I don't see what the big deal is.
I don't know everyone that you've been with.
You're right.
We both have pasts, but mine's not about to be chronicled in a magazine.
There's bound to be a Serena chapter soon, right?
Maybe it's time we have the conversation...
Discuss everyone we've been wit to avoid any more embarrassing surprises in print or at parties.
Everyone?
Well, within reason.
Second base and beyond.
Kissing doesn't count.
I think it's a great idea.
I just have to run an errand first.
When you get back then.
That Eleanor again?
Debriefing my mother on Waldorf Designs can wait.
She knows I have no buyers, and she's just calling to yell at me.
Besides, I have much more pressing business to attend to, like finding Lady Alexander, whoever and wherever she may be.
Now I've gone through the peerage registries of all the royals in Western Europe, and the closest I could find was a Lady Alexandria of Lisbon, but she died 50 years ago in a Portuguese mental hospital.
I am starting to think my father had his bodyguard feed us bad intel.
That is in Bart's playbook, but I'm having one of those psychic hunches I get, like when I predicted tom and Katie wouldn't last.
You didn't have to be psychic to call that one.
I know this may be a little crazy.
My mother has a friend called Lady Vaughn, only "Lady" isn't her title.
It's her name.
She literally changed it to sound more important so she could sit on the boards of all the big museums, and it worked.
Maybe Lady Alexander did the same.
There she is.
Lady Alexander.
But it says she's not on the board.
It's a portrait in a private showing.
By the artist Brian Batt.
I know him!
I mean, I...
I know his work.
He has a studio downtown.
I always wanted to commission a portrait of you.
Hmm.
What's wrong?
The eggs overcooked again?
No.
Well, actually, yes, but that's not what's so upsetting.
Eric just texted me from Sarah Lawrence telling me I was on "Gossip Girl".
This is about our wedding?
No, the night before, when I slept with Rufus.
That's old news.
I have no idea why I'm suddenly on the radar of this childish blog.
I think it's fairly obvious what kind of child would be putting out such stories.
Charles?
No, he would never.
He shipped a woman in from Dubai to drive a wedge in between us.
I'm sorry he keeps dragging you into our fight.
Well, maybe that's why he hasn't returned my calls.
I'll take care of it.
Okay.
I love how you combine the classic portraiture with pop culture, but we really came to see your portrait of Lady Alexander.
Friends of ours saw it in your private show at the MET, and they suggest we mimic the style.
I wanna do the exact same pose.
I think you've got the wrong guy.
I don't do that sort of thing.
Obviously, we wouldn't want to compromise your artistic integrity by recreating someone else's pose.
Unless it's okay with her.
And we tripled your fee.
I don't mind calling Lady Alexander myself.
See, I generally don't take no for an answer.
So if you'd simply provide a phone number...
Looks like Chuck's Midas touch is still intact.
I really hope we're not talking about the same Lady Alexander.
Here she is.
But a horse by any other name is still a horse.
And Chuck and Blair can't seem to buy a clue.
Assuming that Lady Alexander isn't related to Mr. Ed, it appears we've hit another dead end.
Well, not exactly.
Thoroughbred registries have all the important info on every sale, such as prices and previous owners.
It's like M.L.S. for horses.
So find the horse, find the owner.
Here she is...
Lady Alexander.
It says she was bought four years ago by Bartholomew Bass.
What else does it say?
Well, not much except she was just under $1 million.
Is that a lot of money?
For regular people, yes.
I meant for a horse.
I didn't realize your father was such a horse enthusiast.
He's not.
Well, then...
Why did he buy a dozen thoroughbreds in a single month?
Let me see that.
It says here he bought them all from the same man in Dubai.
I don't recognize the name, and I've been through the Bass Industries books with a fine-toothed comb.
Maybe your father's secret is that he's just into horses... really, really expensive horses.
I doubt he'd pay off Amira for that.
I need to find Sheikh Hassan.
There is a big 3-day horse show going on just outside the city right now.
I saw it on one of the registries.
It... it attracts an elite international crowd.
Maybe if the Sheikh isn't there himself, he has people there for him?
Looks like we're back in the saddle.
You... you have a house in the Hamptons, too?
And in Aspen and in St. Barth's, too.
Sorry.
Tiffany.
Time's up.
Don't call us.
We'll call you.
Okay, you both know the drill.
Skip the small talk and get down to business.
You have five minutes.
Serena.
Are you here to interview for the position?
I'm sorry.
Do you work here now?
As if.
I'm pimping out celebutantes for Dan to have sex with.
If you're interested, you can, uh, get in line.
Uh, Dan told me to meet him here.
I'll just be two minutes.
That's fine, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave your bag.
We can't risk any unauthorized recording devices.
His words are worth too much.
No, the bank has all my paperwork, okay?
And you've seen the numbers, and they're good.
No, I...
I get that there's a lot of money going out the door each month, okay?
But just, with a little more time,
I know I can turn things around.
I understand.
Thank you.
Who let you in here?
That article this morning was unfairly biased.
It's my job to report on other people's business.
I'd be a hypocrite to get upset about it.
Plus, "The Spectator" just got plugged in a popular national magazine.
The glass is half full approach, huh?
Yeah.
I know your paper is in trouble.
I also know that you are a lot smarter than that article makes you out to be.
So I am here to offer you some relief.
Let's talk.
So what's so important you had to see me in person?
And allow Georgina to frisk you?
I...
I need to know, did you write a chapter about me?
Of course I did.
You really think my father or Nate are more interesting than the infamous Serena Van Der Woodsen?
Okay, but I need to know what's in it and when it comes out.
Well, that would ruin all the fun.
Dan, I'm serious.
Did you write about that night that we were together at the Campbell apartment?
Relax.
I didn't publish any of that.
But not to protect you.
Um, because it was the most humiliating thing
I've ever been a part of.
But don't worry.
There's... there's gonna be some good stuff in your chapter.
I think I might even include a little tidbit of this desperate conversation.
Wow, I...
I can't believe
I ever loved someone who could write such awful things about his friends and family.
Right, 'cause you were thinking about my feelings when you made that sex tape.
You know what?
The worst part is you actually seem to be enjoying it.
Serena, wait a second.
Wait.
On your way out, just let Georgina know that I gotta take a bathroom break.
Thanks for stopping by.
Uh, Dan says have the next girl meet him in the bathroom.
Mmm.
That's more like it.
Hey.
I just finished my errand.
Yeah, I got everything I needed.
So... you back "The Spectator,"
and I put out fluff pieces on you and Lily to offset her bad press on "Gossip Girl"?
I know you did well with that article on Rufus, and mature readers help broaden your demo.
You will have the extra cash you need.
And as for me, a happy wife is a happy life.
Hmm.
Next thing I know, you'll be asking me to write bad press on Chuck, huh?
I'm not looking for another partner.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna handle this one on my own.
I have no doubt you will succeed, especially if you've inherited your father's gift with numbers.
He was always so... inventive.
Hey, it's Nate.
Listen, I have a business proposition for you.
Well... at least I know your phone is working.
What I don't know is why you're avoiding my calls.
It's nothing personal.
As you know, I've been avoiding my father.
And, well, you're married to him.
Does that mean you're behind the stories about me on "Gossip Girl"?
Is that what he told you?
I hope you know I would never do something like that to you.
Well, I needed to hear it from you.
I also need for you to end this feud with your father.
I love both of you, and I can't stand to be in the middle of it a second longer.
I appreciate your desire to bring us back together, but we were never close to begin with.
The man's idea of father/son bonding was teaching me how to diversify bonds.
It's always been business between us.
Well, I got us tickets to the horse show, but it starts in an hour, so...
Oh.
Hello, Lily.
Oh, well, you don't mean the one at the Stone Orchard stables?
It is.
I...
I don't...
Chuck?
Oh, I haven't been in years.
It's a fabulous event.
And a wonderful opportunity, Charles, for you and your father to talk about something other than business and start to make amends.
I'm gonna see if he's available.
Oh, please.
No, don't tell him.
This should be a surprise.
Well, that was fast.
So... what's this big business opportunity you mentioned on the phone?
Mind if I come in?
Looks like Chuck and Blair aren't the only ones with a surprise visitor.
So much for Golden Boy going it alone.
So what's with all the boxes?
Are you moving in, or is Rufus moving out?
It's Rufus' stuff from Lily's.
I know you released the story about Rufus suing Dan, so I figured out you might also be behind all the stories about Lily on "Gossip Girl."
Ooh.
Well, now I know where you got all the ammo from.
Lily acts so high and mighty, but look at her.
She's been married a dozen times, she's had countless affairs, a secret kid, she's even spent time under house arrest, but never pays the price.
And why should Rufus suffer while Lily's reputation remains unscathed?
I agree.
You do?
But Lily's friends don't read "Gossip Girl."
So you should put the stories out on "The Spectator."
I can see why you don't feel like socializing with your father, but why would you insist on keeping your attendance at an equestrian event a secret?
I could care less about the horses.
I'm looking at the property as long as my father and I are both in the real estate game in New York, there will never be peace in our family.
Stone Orchard is for sale?
Uh-huh.
Oh, my God.
What a shame.
It's been in the same family for two centuries.
Well, I heard they lost a fortune in Facebook stock.
I'm just exploring the possibility, and I don't want Bart to know until it's real.
This is fantastic, Charles.
Good for you!
I am so proud of you for thinking outside of the box, and outside of Manhattan.
I know the place quite well.
I actually put my horses there when we first moved back out east.
And...
I mean, I could show you around?
I promise, not a word of this to your father.
Ooh.
Well, then there was Ben, who, contrary to some forged documents,
I didn't sleep with when I was 15.
Not until after he got out of prison, and that was the last guy I was with before you.
You said that was a year and a half ago.
Not even one random hook-up between the jailbird and me?
No.
I swore off men.
I just wanted to focus on myself.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, I know that must be hard for you to believe, since you spent the entire winter focusing on the "Sports Illustrated" swimsuit models.
Wait, wait.
Come on.
You saw that cat daddy video.
So that's it, then?
We're... we're good?
I feel prepared for anything that could be published.
Okay.
No.
Just... no.
Did, uh, Nate get back to you about the, uh, horse show?
He's got some work to do.
He's gonna meet us there.
I'm really glad he's going.
Go easy on him, okay?
Serena, did you want to come, too?
I mean, if my dad wants you to.
Oh.
Well, I...
I don't want to intrude.
No.
No, no, come.
You can keep Sage occupied while I interrogate her boyfriend.
Bart, dear, I know you're going to be devastated, but I was thinking we should cancel our dinner with the Kranzlers this evening.
Gee, that's too bad.
I was looking forward to dodging all their questions about my disappearance.
Well, don't worry.
We'll reschedule.
You needn't bother, Lily.
What else did you have in mind instead?
Well, I was suddenly in the mood for a spa overhaul... massage, facial, nails, the works.
Are you still upset about Chuck and those stories on "Gossip Girl"?
Because I'm planning to stop by The Empire and have a talk with him.
Oh, I don't think that's necessary.
I spoke to Charles, and he said he didn't leak those stories, and I believe him.
So I'll call you when I'm done, okay?
Sure.
Thank you for keeping this between us.
I hate lying, but there's no reason to concern your father if it helps you with your plan to make peace.
Trust me.
If he found out, he'd run everything.
Sometimes it's best not to call in order to avoid being called out later.
Just smell the air... so crisp and clean.
And fertilized.
You know, there is so much to show you.
This could take all afternoon.
Oh!
Uh, uh, did you see that woman over there waving at you?
Which one?
The one that looks like Princess Anne.
She's saying your name and waving.
Are you sure?
Ah.
Well, maybe I should go say hello.
I don't want to be rude.
Mm.
Excuse me.
Okay, now it's your chance!
Go!
Run!
Blair, this isn't a hostage situation.
I don't even know who to... excuse me.
Can you tell me if any of Sheikh Hassan's horses are competing today?
Mm... just one...
Crown Jewel.
She's on the course.
Thank you.
Okay, look.
I'll go and see what I can find out about Sheikh Hassan.
If you can keep Lily occupied for a few...
I got a closer look, and it is Princess Anne with her daughter Zara, but are you sure she was waving at me?
Because we've never actually met before.
Maybe she was just swatting away mosquitoes or airing out her pits.
Hmm.
Well, either way, where should we begin our tour?
Mm-hmm.
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
I...
No, it's okay.
We just got here ourselves.
Nate, this is my dad.
You remember his fist, right?
Ah.
Yeah, sorry about that.
I've never actually punched anyone before.
You definitely did a good job.
It hurt, so...
Hey, do you wanna go check out the horse?
Yeah.
You guys stay and bond over how great I am and how you want me to be happy, okay?
Great.
Bye!
You know, just so you know,
I had to... ice my hand all night.
Probably hurt me more than it you.
And I should probably tell you
I am a huge fan of the business you've built.
I've been following your career for forever now.
So...
You're not dating my daughter just to get to me, are you?
No, sir.
It's just a purely added bonus.
Whoa!
Whoa!
You may be dating my daughter, but I'm dating your ex.
That cancels out the need for any "sirs."
Lily, hi!
Hi!
It's so nice to see you back at the barn.
Thank you, Jessica.
Great to see you as well.
Enjoy the rest of your day.
Ah!
Thank you.
If you ladies wanna get a drink,
I think I'll check out the stables.
Now leaving the course...
Crown Jewel, owned by Sheikh Hassan, ridden by the Sheikh's daughter Iman.
Oh, I think the stables are this way.
Actually, Lily...
can we take a little detour?
You know, I've been considering an equestrian *** for my next line, and I want you to introduce me to those women in the fabulous fascinators.
Next on the course...
That is a beautiful horse.
I'd love to talk to you about buying it.
So who's it gonna be?
Personally, I think Melissa has the better face for photos, but Natasha is a Coppola, and that does come with a certain cachet.
Well, I have to choose now?
Obviously.
But can't it wait?
I mean, I'm...
I'm...
I'm exhausted.
Oh, suck it up, Humphrey.
They have pills for that.
These girls are perfect.
They all come from great neighborhoods, have very high I.Qs, and dress in designer labels.
They meet all of our requirements.
This just isn't me.
These girls might be perfect on paper, but they're not who I'm looking for.
Who you're... since when are you looking for anybody?
Don't go soft on me now, Humphrey.
Finding true love was never part of our deal.
I'm sorry you're not selling.
She's absolutely stunning.
Thank you.
My family takes great pride in our thoroughbreds.
I know.
I've been a big fan of your family's horses since I was a child.
There was one in particular I remember seeing compete.
I think she was yours.
Lady Alexander?
Lady Alexander was my childhood horse.
She was much loved but never competed a day in her life.
My father must've loved her as much as then, because he paid a great deal for her.
Again, you're mistaken.
She was sold to a family friend several years ago and put to pasture.
She was worthless to anyone but me.
Which made her priceless.
Uncle Bart!
So good to see you.
I see my son is attempting to work his charms on you.
Why didn't you tell me Bart Bass is your father?
He's like family.
Our fathers were such good friends before his accident.
Speaking of which,
I was sorry to hear of his recent passing.
Is that...
I think that's Serena.
You know her?
Uh, yeah.
That's my mom.
Come on.
I'll introduce you.
Grandma.
Oh, no, no.
Don't call her that.
Yeah, as much as I'd love to stay and chat with your charming daughter,
I have to take this call from my mother.
Oh, tell Eleanor I said hello.
Mm.
Serena, darling, I had no idea you were coming to this.
Oh, yeah.
It was just a last-minute decision.
But I want you to meet Steven's daughter Sage.
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.
Oh, likewise.
Um, you're so much... more mature than I'd imagined.
I should probably go check on my dad and Nate.
Okay, I'll be right there.
How old is she?
Oh, you know what?
This is probably my fault that you have a father complex.
Wait, so you really played basketball at Duke?
You're really that gullible?
No.
No, unlike the other chemical engi-nerds,
I did watch a few games.
Hey, some people call it gullible.
I like to call it trusting.
It seems like you guys are getting along.
No black eyes at least.
No, you were... you were right about this guy.
He's trusting, which may have led to some poor business decisions but... it makes for good character.
He reminds me a little of myself at his age.
Hey, that means a lot, man.
Thanks.
Okay, I wanted you guys to get along.
There's no need for a full-on bromance.
Where's Serena?
She ran into her mom.
Wait.
Lily's here?
Do you know if he still wants to have kids?
I mean, maybe he's done.
Mother!
Can we have this conversation somewhere else?
People are starting to stare.
Oh.
It's probably another one of those "Gossip Girl" stories about me.
Oh, I hope it ends soon.
Oh, no, it's... it's not a "Gossip Girl" blast.
It's a "Spectator" blast... about both of us.
"Like mother, like daughter.
They not only share the same taste in clothing but also in men.
Looks like Steven Spence put age before beauty by sleeping with Lily before Serena"?
Excuse me.
Hey, Serena, wait.
Did you just omit someone from our conversation?
Like, I don't know, my mother?
What... what are you talking about?
Your love life is the one being published on "The Spectator."
I had no idea that the story was about him, okay?
I...
I gave it to my editor so I could be here with Sage... and get to know Steven.
Well, thanks to you, we all know him better now.
Way to go, Nate.
Dad, seriously?
Gross.
Yeah, I...
I have no idea why there's a story about me sleeping with your mother.
It's not true!
Actually, it is.
There are two sides to every story, with the truth and Serena stuck smack in the middle.
I think you're confusing me with someone else.
Unfortunately, I'm not.
Okay, well, one of you is wrong, and I really hope it's you, mom.
I know we've met a few times socially, you know, through the Central Park Conservancy.
And the Bancroft wedding?
The one in the Irish castle.
We snuck down to the dungeon, opened the oldest bottle of whiskey we could find.
My last name was Mueller then.
Klaus' ex?
Lily Mueller.
Oh, my God.
Oh!
So it is true?
Look, it... it was... it... it was right after my divorce.
You know, I had gone skiing in Verbier, and hurt my knee.
There were... there were painkillers and... and whiskey and... oh, wow.
Is that why you were so cold to me at Conservancy events?
I didn't know about the painkillers.
Yeah.
But you did know that we were dating.
Why didn't you say anything?
What was I supposed to say?
I...
I... you... you told me that you two were madly in love and that he could be the one.
Besides...
I figured Steven should be the one to tell you.
Well, I guess this was one of those surprises we were hoping to avoid.
This is your final notice.
In five minutes.
What the hell do you think you're doing here, talking to Iman?
Enjoying the horses.
Same as you, right?
Because Lily would hate to learn that you had me followed.
You need to stop sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong and leave Lily out of this.
Do we understand each other?
I didn't realize you'd become such an animal lover.
I have a dog, too.
I find the company of animals preferable to some people.
Another weakness you didn't inherit from me.
I pulled the story off the site, okay?
I got ahold of some old list Lily made.
You know, the names of everyone that she had ever slept with.
I...
I swear I didn't know your dad's name was on it.
Everything was going so well.
My dad was really starting to like you.
I screwed up.
I'm sorry.
I should've vetted the article before it ever came out.
What do you have against Serena's mom anyway?
Nothing.
I don't have anything against her.
I just... it was a... it was a...
it was a desperate move to save my company.
It was a mistake.
Well, you decided to do it on your own for a reason.
I did, and I think I know of a way that I can without hurting anyone that I care about.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Okay?
I'm really sorry.
And I just...
I don't want to lose "The Spectator."
Or you.
I just saw Lily leaving with Bart.
Did you not tell him you tracked down the Sheikh?
Doesn't matter.
Sheikh's dead, and the daughter won't talk.
She won't?
Why not?
She calls him "Uncle Bart."
We're done here.
Shall we?
Uh, I'll meet you at the car.
I need the ladies' room after all those mint juleps.
Right.
Next on the course...
Owned by the Kelly stables.
Iman?
Hi.
I'm Blair.
I'm a close friend of Chuck's.
I know he left before he could speak to you, but this is important to him, and so it's important to me.
Is this about the horse?
Because I know Chuck never really wanted it.
He was just flirting with me.
I don't think he was flirting with you.
Look, I know how much these horses mean to you and meant to your father.
Unfortunately, they don't mean that much to Bart.
He isn't exactly a big donator at P.E.T.A, if you know what I mean.
I'm not sure I do.
Well, Bart Bass.
Killed a tiger on safari?
He eats veal on a regular basis?
I don't know about any of that, but he was a good friend to my father.
He bought Lady Alexander and the others so they could live out their days on a farm in Virginia.
Okay.
Listen, Princess Jasmine, the fact is, your Uncle Bart is bad.
I'm sure every single horse he bought from your family went straight to the glue factory, including your beloved Lady Alexander.
But, if you like, go ahead.
Check it out.
See if you find the Bart Bass retirement home for aged equines.
Trust me, Chuck is the good guy here, and he needs your help.
On the Upper East Side, it's hard to know who to trust.
Usually, the answer is no one.
I'm sorry, but it's gonna take me more than a car ride to forget the fact that you slept with my mother.
Serena, I can't change what happened.
I can forget it, obviously, but I...
I can't change it.
Maybe you can forget, too?
I don't know if I'll ever be able to forget this.
Well, I...
I guess I can try to move past it.
I mean, crazier things have happened in my family.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, just not so fast.
There are certain images that keep popping up.
Then we must try to erase them.
I'm warning you.
This could take a while.
Mm-hmm.
I never thought I'd see you again.
Care for a drink?
I can't stay long, but I wanted to tell you that I looked into what your friend Blair told me.
Lady Alexander never went to any farm in Virginia.
Blair told you she did?
No.
Bart told me.
But the horses he purchased from my family are nowhere to be found.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Bart obviously didn't care much about your horses and probably paid your father a lot of money for something else.
Do you know what it was?
Maybe a... a real estate deal?
Perhaps a hotel?
A hotel?
No, my father was in the oil business.
But Bart couldn't have been involved in that.
Why not the oil business?
Because we have a home in Dubai, but we're Sudanese nationals.
I'm sorry.
International affairs are not my area of expertise.
Well, at least not this kind.
Well, the U.S. has an embargo against trading oil with Sudan, so if that's what he bought from my father...
Bart was breaking federal law.
Thanks for taking another look at my loan application.
I... can't believe I left out all the revenue from the new markets.
Just a rookie mistake, I guess.
Well, the numbers do look better, and, uh, I'm glad you caught the error, because, uh, with ad sales projections like this... we're happy to extend "The Spectator's" line of credit.
Thank you so much.
You're a lifesaver.
Now let me just go make you a copy of this real quick.
I'll be right back.
How did it go?
Yeah, Nate asked me to take another look at the numbers like you said he would.
Are you sure you wanna co-sign on this loan?
It's obvious he's doctored his earnings report.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Send me the documents to sign in the morning.
Again, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you I was with Charles, and you felt the need to follow us.
Apparently... with good reason.
He's just trying to make things right with you.
I know how much you wanna believe that, but Charles has done nothing since we've gotten back together but lie and manipulate you.
Oh, really?
You really think I'm that much of a pushover.
He will prey upon your maternal instincts to get between us.
Well, I won't let that happen.
Neither will I.
You know how much I don't like ultimatums, but I'm afraid Chuck has left me no choice.
If you wanna be with me, you need to stay away from my son.
You can't ask me to do that.
He's my son, too.
We're not done discussing this.
So Bart was using the horses to hide the money he was buying illegal oil with?
He had to hide it somehow.
Sudan is an embargoed country, which means he didn't fake his death because he was worried Mason Nevins would come after Lily or me.
He did it so he could avoid federal prison.
Well, this is what we need.
Right?
Quick.
Call the CIA or the FBI or TMZ.
Let's turn him in!
I wish it were that simple.
We need evidence first.
I was already planning our victory celebration in my head.
We were in a bubble bath with a bottle of Grande Cuvée and no business in the way of us being together.
Hold onto that visual.
Mmm.
If I must.
Call me if you need anything.
Blair, it's Jean Pierre.
Your mother is not pleased.
She knows you're avoiding her calls and that you don't have orders from any buyers.
She says you have one month to fix this.
Lily, I cannot apologize to you enough.
I mean, nothing like this will ever happen again in "The Spectator," I promise you.
Thank you for understanding, yeah.
Bye.
I hope you're here because you forgive me, too.
I hope that answers your question.
If Serena can forgive my dad for sleeping with Lily, and Lily can forgive you for publishing a story about it,
I guess I can forgive you for acting like a jerk.
You know, I...
I haven't gone through those.
Are you sure you just wanna throw it all away?
Some of it must have sentimental value.
Yeah, I'm sure, and I'm sorry I put the responsibility on you to begin with, but I was at the gallery, and I realized I don't want this stuff.
I...
I don't wanna look back.
I just wanna look forward...
With you.
We all have things from our past we'd like to erase.
Philip, get some popcorn.
I ran into Serena earlier today and picked up a movie for us.
But on the Upper East Side, it's not so easy to hit "delete."
♪ Step forward
There's always a record of misdeed somewhere...

Humphrey, what are you doing here?
I'm pretty sure you have a spare room up in here.
I was wondering if I could crash.
You made it pretty clear you were done with me.
What's changed?
I realized I made a mistake.
I've missed you.
I've missed... my friend.
Last year, when you had no one, I was there for you.
I kinda need you to do the same for me right now.
Serena's bed is empty.
Make yourself at home.

Better not to ignore the past but learn from it instead.

X.O.X.O., Gossip Girl.
Gossip Girl here, your one and only source, into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Dan's serial is continuing in Vanity Fair.
Dan, we had a deal!
Vanity Fair is the big time.
And the more readers I have the more power I have.
It's that simple.
Dan wrote the truth.
We are together.
And I want you, by my side, here, and at the gallery opening.
Are you Dan Humphrey?
I am.
I read your piece in "The Spectator" today.
Can I buy you a drink?
Absolutely.
Did this really happen?
You and Serena?
Every dirty detail, exactly as it occurred.
She said she erased it, but did you actually see her do it?
What is wrong with you?
You had someone who loved you unconditionally, and you threw that all away to let Chuck Bass decide when he's ready for you?
I just have a few questions about a weekend you spent with Bart in Dubai about four years ago.
Dave drove Bart to meet someone named lady Alexander.
I don't know who she is or even where to start looking for her.
We will find her.
And who am I?
That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.
X.O.X.O., Gossip Girl.
Extra, extra, read all about it... the latest upper east sider to take center stage in the social spotlight.
But you know what they say?
If you can't take the heat, then move to Hell's Kitchen.
"Nate Archibald has the opposite of the Midas touch.
Instead of everything he touches turning to gold, he turns all the gold he's been given to dust."
Your friend's poor, right?
I mean, he's probably just jealous.
Oh, first of all, Dan screwed me over by selling the serialization of his new book right out from under me, and then he releases the chapter about me.
You look really hot in the picture.
Who cares what it says?
He's saying that
I'm single-handedly destroying "The Spectator."
Okay, enough.
This Dan guy is full of it.
No, actually, if he was making stuff up, you know, I'd be mad, but I'd get over it.
Thing is, he's right.
"The Spectator" is in serious financial trouble, and it's all my fault.
It's why I'm meeting with the bank later today to hopefully extend our credit line.
Can I help?
Please.
I am dying for an excuse to skip brunch with my dad and Serena Van Der Floozy.
No, that's nice, but you should go to brunch, and you should be nice to Serena, all right?
She's the one who convinced your dad to let us keep dating, all right?
Give her a chance.
Your article on Nate is generating major online buzz.
Huffpo has a link on their main page, and Dwight Garner just tweeted about it, saying that he's halfway through and doesn't hate it yet.
Even "Gossip Girl" gave us a nice plug.
Overall, the reaction's been positive... for you, that is.
Not for Nate.
Are they talking about how the use of real names makes this my "In cold blood"?
I mean, do they like the writing?
Are they making any comparisons to historical literary figures?
Perez Hilton.
But the important thing is that they're talking about it.
Literary celebrity is fleeting.
We have to make the most of it.
Trust me.
I have been.
I am not talking about trolling for lit groupies at McNally's and sleeping with your coffee dates.
Well, that's how I'm finding a bed to sleep in every night.
Look, being a writer in 2012 isn't merely about the words that you write.
It's about your image.
So from now on, you're only going to be seen with girls who have Ivy League pedigrees, or, at the very least, Vassar.
She needs to have cover girl looks and at least three mentions in "Page Six"
in the last six months.
How exactly am I gonna do that?
I've already set up the interviews.
This is the guy my daughter's dating?
Have you read this article on Nate?
Oh, I'm not a fan of the author's previous work.
Well, let me summarize for you.
His last girlfriend was a madam.
Before that, he dated con artists with an "S"
because, yes, there was more than one.
Your friend Dan wrote all this?
Dan Humphrey's a douche.
Well, you can forget about dating the guy in this article ever again.
That's fine by me.
Nate is nothing like the guy in that article.
Well, I don't know what Dan wrote, but I can vouch for Nate.
He's kind and honest and a good friend.
And... and he cares about Sage a lot.
You should get to know him before you judge him.
Or at least before you hit him again.
Dad, can he come to the horse show with us?
This afternoon?
No, that's always been our thing.
Oh, come on.
You hate it, and you know it.
It'll give you someone to talk about football with instead.
Nate loves football.
See?
Look, we're already finding things to bond over.
Oh, I guess he can join us.
It'll give me a chance to talk to him.
Possibly threaten his life.
I'll see if he can come.
Thanks, dad.
You, too, Serena.
Did you see that?
She almost smiled at me.
Hmm.
And don't worry about Nate.
You'll really like him.
He's the best.
Well, you would know.
When were you gonna tell me you've had sex with my daughter's boyfriend?
Okay.
This is definitely a... a fire hazard.
I think it's time to unpack the boxes Lily sent over.
Sorry, I've been so busy with this new gallery opening.
I'm actually headed over there now.
Don't take this the wrong way, but maybe you're using the gallery as an excuse to avoid going through your old life.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Is it?
These boxes are full of stuff from your time with Lily, and I can see how revisiting those memories could be difficult.
Look, let me help.
I will unpack the boxes, and when you come back, they'll be gone.
That would be nice.
Keep the things that we can use around the loft and just throw everything else out.
Gosh.
"May 17, 2008.
Dear Rufus, last night was the best night of my life"
It's kind of a big deal not to mention.
I wasn't trying to hide my past with Nate.
I swear it was a long time ago.
We're just friends now, and besides, when is something like that supposed to come up?
I don't know.
Maybe the second he started dating my daughter?
Sage knows, and she doesn't care.
I don't see what the big deal is.
I don't know everyone that you've been with.
You're right.
We both have pasts, but mine's not about to be chronicled in a magazine.
There's bound to be a Serena chapter soon, right?
Maybe it's time we have the conversation...
Discuss everyone we've been wit to avoid any more embarrassing surprises in print or at parties.
Everyone?
Well, within reason.
Second base and beyond.
Kissing doesn't count.
I think it's a great idea.
I just have to run an errand first.
When you get back then.
That Eleanor again?
Debriefing my mother on Waldorf Designs can wait.
She knows I have no buyers, and she's just calling to yell at me.
Besides, I have much more pressing business to attend to, like finding Lady Alexander, whoever and wherever she may be.
Now I've gone through the peerage registries of all the royals in Western Europe, and the closest I could find was a Lady Alexandria of Lisbon, but she died 50 years ago in a Portuguese mental hospital.
I am starting to think my father had his bodyguard feed us bad intel.
That is in Bart's playbook, but I'm having one of those psychic hunches I get, like when I predicted tom and Katie wouldn't last.
You didn't have to be psychic to call that one.
I know this may be a little crazy.
My mother has a friend called Lady Vaughn, only "Lady" isn't her title.
It's her name.
She literally changed it to sound more important so she could sit on the boards of all the big museums, and it worked.
Maybe Lady Alexander did the same.
There she is.
Lady Alexander.
But it says she's not on the board.
It's a portrait in a private showing.
By the artist Brian Batt.
I know him!
I mean, I...
I know his work.
He has a studio downtown.
I always wanted to commission a portrait of you.
Hmm.
What's wrong?
The eggs overcooked again?
No.
Well, actually, yes, but that's not what's so upsetting.
Eric just texted me from Sarah Lawrence telling me I was on "Gossip Girl".
This is about our wedding?
No, the night before, when I slept with Rufus.
That's old news.
I have no idea why I'm suddenly on the radar of this childish blog.
I think it's fairly obvious what kind of child would be putting out such stories.
Charles?
No, he would never.
He shipped a woman in from Dubai to drive a wedge in between us.
I'm sorry he keeps dragging you into our fight.
Well, maybe that's why he hasn't returned my calls.
I'll take care of it.
Okay.
I love how you combine the classic portraiture with pop culture, but we really came to see your portrait of Lady Alexander.
Friends of ours saw it in your private show at the MET, and they suggest we mimic the style.
I wanna do the exact same pose.
I think you've got the wrong guy.
I don't do that sort of thing.
Obviously, we wouldn't want to compromise your artistic integrity by recreating someone else's pose.
Unless it's okay with her.
And we tripled your fee.
I don't mind calling Lady Alexander myself.
See, I generally don't take no for an answer.
So if you'd simply provide a phone number...
Looks like Chuck's Midas touch is still intact.
I really hope we're not talking about the same Lady Alexander.
Here she is.
But a horse by any other name is still a horse.
And Chuck and Blair can't seem to buy a clue.
Assuming that Lady Alexander isn't related to Mr. Ed, it appears we've hit another dead end.
Well, not exactly.
Thoroughbred registries have all the important info on every sale, such as prices and previous owners.
It's like M.L.S. for horses.
So find the horse, find the owner.
Here she is...
Lady Alexander.
It says she was bought four years ago by Bartholomew Bass.
What else does it say?
Well, not much except she was just under $1 million.
Is that a lot of money?
For regular people, yes.
I meant for a horse.
I didn't realize your father was such a horse enthusiast.
He's not.
Well, then...
Why did he buy a dozen thoroughbreds in a single month?
Let me see that.
It says here he bought them all from the same man in Dubai.
I don't recognize the name, and I've been through the Bass Industries books with a fine-toothed comb.
Maybe your father's secret is that he's just into horses... really, really expensive horses.
I doubt he'd pay off Amira for that.
I need to find Sheikh Hassan.
There is a big 3-day horse show going on just outside the city right now.
I saw it on one of the registries.
It... it attracts an elite international crowd.
Maybe if the Sheikh isn't there himself, he has people there for him?
Looks like we're back in the saddle.
You... you have a house in the Hamptons, too?
And in Aspen and in St. Barth's, too.
Sorry.
Tiffany.
Time's up.
Don't call us.
We'll call you.
Okay, you both know the drill.
Skip the small talk and get down to business.
You have five minutes.
Serena.
Are you here to interview for the position?
I'm sorry.
Do you work here now?
As if.
I'm pimping out celebutantes for Dan to have sex with.
If you're interested, you can, uh, get in line.
Uh, Dan told me to meet him here.
I'll just be two minutes.
That's fine, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave your bag.
We can't risk any unauthorized recording devices.
His words are worth too much.
No, the bank has all my paperwork, okay?
And you've seen the numbers, and they're good.
No, I...
I get that there's a lot of money going out the door each month, okay?
But just, with a little more time,
I know I can turn things around.
I understand.
Thank you.
Who let you in here?
That article this morning was unfairly biased.
It's my job to report on other people's business.
I'd be a hypocrite to get upset about it.
Plus, "The Spectator" just got plugged in a popular national magazine.
The glass is half full approach, huh?
Yeah.
I know your paper is in trouble.
I also know that you are a lot smarter than that article makes you out to be.
So I am here to offer you some relief.
Let's talk.
So what's so important you had to see me in person?
And allow Georgina to frisk you?
I...
I need to know, did you write a chapter about me?
Of course I did.
You really think my father or Nate are more interesting than the infamous Serena Van Der Woodsen?
Okay, but I need to know what's in it and when it comes out.
Well, that would ruin all the fun.
Dan, I'm serious.
Did you write about that night that we were together at the Campbell apartment?
Relax.
I didn't publish any of that.
But not to protect you.
Um, because it was the most humiliating thing
I've ever been a part of.
But don't worry.
There's... there's gonna be some good stuff in your chapter.
I think I might even include a little tidbit of this desperate conversation.
Wow, I...
I can't believe
I ever loved someone who could write such awful things about his friends and family.
Right, 'cause you were thinking about my feelings when you made that sex tape.
You know what?
The worst part is you actually seem to be enjoying it.
Serena, wait a second.
Wait.
On your way out, just let Georgina know that I gotta take a bathroom break.
Thanks for stopping by.
Uh, Dan says have the next girl meet him in the bathroom.
Mmm.
That's more like it.
Hey.
I just finished my errand.
Yeah, I got everything I needed.
So... you back "The Spectator,"
and I put out fluff pieces on you and Lily to offset her bad press on "Gossip Girl"?
I know you did well with that article on Rufus, and mature readers help broaden your demo.
You will have the extra cash you need.
And as for me, a happy wife is a happy life.
Hmm.
Next thing I know, you'll be asking me to write bad press on Chuck, huh?
I'm not looking for another partner.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna handle this one on my own.
I have no doubt you will succeed, especially if you've inherited your father's gift with numbers.
He was always so... inventive.
Hey, it's Nate.
Listen, I have a business proposition for you.
Well... at least I know your phone is working.
What I don't know is why you're avoiding my calls.
It's nothing personal.
As you know, I've been avoiding my father.
And, well, you're married to him.
Does that mean you're behind the stories about me on "Gossip Girl"?
Is that what he told you?
I hope you know I would never do something like that to you.
Well, I needed to hear it from you.
I also need for you to end this feud with your father.
I love both of you, and I can't stand to be in the middle of it a second longer.
I appreciate your desire to bring us back together, but we were never close to begin with.
The man's idea of father/son bonding was teaching me how to diversify bonds.
It's always been business between us.
Well, I got us tickets to the horse show, but it starts in an hour, so...
Oh.
Hello, Lily.
Oh, well, you don't mean the one at the Stone Orchard stables?
It is.
I...
I don't...
Chuck?
Oh, I haven't been in years.
It's a fabulous event.
And a wonderful opportunity, Charles, for you and your father to talk about something other than business and start to make amends.
I'm gonna see if he's available.
Oh, please.
No, don't tell him.
This should be a surprise.
Well, that was fast.
So... what's this big business opportunity you mentioned on the phone?
Mind if I come in?
Looks like Chuck and Blair aren't the only ones with a surprise visitor.
So much for Golden Boy going it alone.
So what's with all the boxes?
Are you moving in, or is Rufus moving out?
It's Rufus' stuff from Lily's.
I know you released the story about Rufus suing Dan, so I figured out you might also be behind all the stories about Lily on "Gossip Girl."
Ooh.
Well, now I know where you got all the ammo from.
Lily acts so high and mighty, but look at her.
She's been married a dozen times, she's had countless affairs, a secret kid, she's even spent time under house arrest, but never pays the price.
And why should Rufus suffer while Lily's reputation remains unscathed?
I agree.
You do?
But Lily's friends don't read "Gossip Girl."
So you should put the stories out on "The Spectator."
I can see why you don't feel like socializing with your father, but why would you insist on keeping your attendance at an equestrian event a secret?
I could care less about the horses.
I'm looking at the property as long as my father and I are both in the real estate game in New York, there will never be peace in our family.
Stone Orchard is for sale?
Uh-huh.
Oh, my God.
What a shame.
It's been in the same family for two centuries.
Well, I heard they lost a fortune in Facebook stock.
I'm just exploring the possibility, and I don't want Bart to know until it's real.
This is fantastic, Charles.
Good for you!
I am so proud of you for thinking outside of the box, and outside of Manhattan.
I know the place quite well.
I actually put my horses there when we first moved back out east.
And...
I mean, I could show you around?
I promise, not a word of this to your father.
Ooh.
Well, then there was Ben, who, contrary to some forged documents,
I didn't sleep with when I was 15.
Not until after he got out of prison, and that was the last guy I was with before you.
You said that was a year and a half ago.
Not even one random hook-up between the jailbird and me?
No.
I swore off men.
I just wanted to focus on myself.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, I know that must be hard for you to believe, since you spent the entire winter focusing on the "Sports Illustrated" swimsuit models.
Wait, wait.
Come on.
You saw that cat daddy video.
So that's it, then?
We're... we're good?
I feel prepared for anything that could be published.
Okay.
No.
Just... no.
Did, uh, Nate get back to you about the, uh, horse show?
He's got some work to do.
He's gonna meet us there.
I'm really glad he's going.
Go easy on him, okay?
Serena, did you want to come, too?
I mean, if my dad wants you to.
Oh.
Well, I...
I don't want to intrude.
No.
No, no, come.
You can keep Sage occupied while I interrogate her boyfriend.
Bart, dear, I know you're going to be devastated, but I was thinking we should cancel our dinner with the Kranzlers this evening.
Gee, that's too bad.
I was looking forward to dodging all their questions about my disappearance.
Well, don't worry.
We'll reschedule.
You needn't bother, Lily.
What else did you have in mind instead?
Well, I was suddenly in the mood for a spa overhaul... massage, facial, nails, the works.
Are you still upset about Chuck and those stories on "Gossip Girl"?
Because I'm planning to stop by The Empire and have a talk with him.
Oh, I don't think that's necessary.
I spoke to Charles, and he said he didn't leak those stories, and I believe him.
So I'll call you when I'm done, okay?
Sure.
Thank you for keeping this between us.
I hate lying, but there's no reason to concern your father if it helps you with your plan to make peace.
Trust me.
If he found out, he'd run everything.
Sometimes it's best not to call in order to avoid being called out later.
Just smell the air... so crisp and clean.
And fertilized.
You know, there is so much to show you.
This could take all afternoon.
Oh!
Uh, uh, did you see that woman over there waving at you?
Which one?
The one that looks like Princess Anne.
She's saying your name and waving.
Are you sure?
Ah.
Well, maybe I should go say hello.
I don't want to be rude.
Mm.
Excuse me.
Okay, now it's your chance!
Go!
Run!
Blair, this isn't a hostage situation.
I don't even know who to... excuse me.
Can you tell me if any of Sheikh Hassan's horses are competing today?
Mm... just one...
Crown Jewel.
She's on the course.
Thank you.
Okay, look.
I'll go and see what I can find out about Sheikh Hassan.
If you can keep Lily occupied for a few...
I got a closer look, and it is Princess Anne with her daughter Zara, but are you sure she was waving at me?
Because we've never actually met before.
Maybe she was just swatting away mosquitoes or airing out her pits.
Hmm.
Well, either way, where should we begin our tour?
Mm-hmm.
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
I...
No, it's okay.
We just got here ourselves.
Nate, this is my dad.
You remember his fist, right?
Ah.
Yeah, sorry about that.
I've never actually punched anyone before.
You definitely did a good job.
It hurt, so...
Hey, do you wanna go check out the horse?
Yeah.
You guys stay and bond over how great I am and how you want me to be happy, okay?
Great.
Bye!
You know, just so you know,
I had to... ice my hand all night.
Probably hurt me more than it you.
And I should probably tell you
I am a huge fan of the business you've built.
I've been following your career for forever now.
So...
You're not dating my daughter just to get to me, are you?
No, sir.
It's just a purely added bonus.
Whoa!
Whoa!
You may be dating my daughter, but I'm dating your ex.
That cancels out the need for any "sirs."
Lily, hi!
Hi!
It's so nice to see you back at the barn.
Thank you, Jessica.
Great to see you as well.
Enjoy the rest of your day.
Ah!
Thank you.
If you ladies wanna get a drink,
I think I'll check out the stables.
Now leaving the course...
Crown Jewel, owned by Sheikh Hassan, ridden by the Sheikh's daughter Iman.
Oh, I think the stables are this way.
Actually, Lily... can we take a little detour?
You know, I've been considering an equestrian *** for my next line, and I want you to introduce me to those women in the fabulous fascinators.
Next on the course...
That is a beautiful horse.
I'd love to talk to you about buying it.
So who's it gonna be?
Personally, I think Melissa has the better face for photos, but Natasha is a Coppola, and that does come with a certain cachet.
Well, I have to choose now?
Obviously.
But can't it wait?
I mean, I'm...
I'm...
I'm exhausted.
Oh, suck it up, Humphrey.
They have pills for that.
These girls are perfect.
They all come from great neighborhoods, have very high I.Qs, and dress in designer labels.
They meet all of our requirements.
This just isn't me.
These girls might be perfect on paper, but they're not who I'm looking for.
Who you're... since when are you looking for anybody?
Don't go soft on me now, Humphrey.
Finding true love was never part of our deal.
I'm sorry you're not selling.
She's absolutely stunning.
Thank you.
My family takes great pride in our thoroughbreds.
I know.
I've been a big fan of your family's horses since I was a child.
There was one in particular I remember seeing compete.
I think she was yours.
Lady Alexander?
Lady Alexander was my childhood horse.
She was much loved but never competed a day in her life.
My father must've loved her as much as then, because he paid a great deal for her.
Again, you're mistaken.
She was sold to a family friend several years ago and put to pasture.
She was worthless to anyone but me.
Which made her priceless.
Uncle Bart!
So good to see you.
I see my son is attempting to work his charms on you.
Why didn't you tell me Bart Bass is your father?
He's like family.
Our fathers were such good friends before his accident.
Speaking of which,
I was sorry to hear of his recent passing.
Is that...
I think that's Serena.
You know her?
Uh, yeah.
That's my mom.
Come on.
I'll introduce you.
Grandma.
Oh, no, no.
Don't call her that.
Yeah, as much as I'd love to stay and chat with your charming daughter,
I have to take this call from my mother.
Oh, tell Eleanor I said hello.
Mm.
Serena, darling, I had no idea you were coming to this.
Oh, yeah.
It was just a last-minute decision.
But I want you to meet Steven's daughter Sage.
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.
Oh, likewise.
Um, you're so much... more mature than I'd imagined.
I should probably go check on my dad and Nate.
Okay, I'll be right there.
How old is she?
Oh, you know what?
This is probably my fault that you have a father complex.
Wait, so you really played basketball at Duke?
You're really that gullible?
No.
No, unlike the other chemical engi-nerds,
I did watch a few games.
Hey, some people call it gullible.
I like to call it trusting.
It seems like you guys are getting along.
No black eyes at least.
No, you were... you were right about this guy.
He's trusting, which may have led to some poor business decisions but... it makes for good character.
He reminds me a little of myself at his age.
Hey, that means a lot, man.
Thanks.
Okay, I wanted you guys to get along.
There's no need for a full-on bromance.
Where's Serena?
She ran into her mom.
Wait.
Lily's here?
Do you know if he still wants to have kids?
I mean, maybe he's done.
Mother!
Can we have this conversation somewhere else?
People are starting to stare.
Oh.
It's probably another one of those "Gossip Girl" stories about me.
Oh, I hope it ends soon.
Oh, no, it's... it's not a "Gossip Girl" blast.
It's a "Spectator" blast... about both of us.
"Like mother, like daughter.
They not only share the same taste in clothing but also in men.
Looks like Steven Spence put age before beauty by sleeping with Lily before Serena"?
Excuse me.
Hey, Serena, wait.
Did you just omit someone from our conversation?
Like, I don't know, my mother?
What... what are you talking about?
Your love life is the one being published on "The Spectator."
I had no idea that the story was about him, okay?
I...
I gave it to my editor so I could be here with Sage... and get to know Steven.
Well, thanks to you, we all know him better now.
Way to go, Nate.
Dad, seriously?
Gross.
Yeah, I...
I have no idea why there's a story about me sleeping with your mother.
It's not true!
Actually, it is.
There are two sides to every story, with the truth and Serena stuck smack in the middle.
I think you're confusing me with someone else.
Unfortunately, I'm not.
Okay, well, one of you is wrong, and I really hope it's you, mom.
I know we've met a few times socially, you know, through the Central Park Conservancy.
And the Bancroft wedding?
The one in the Irish castle.
We snuck down to the dungeon, opened the oldest bottle of whiskey we could find.
My last name was Mueller then.
Klaus' ex?
Lily Mueller.
Oh, my God.
Oh!
So it is true?
Look, it... it was... it... it was right after my divorce.
You know, I had gone skiing in Verbier, and hurt my knee.
There were... there were painkillers and... and whiskey and... oh, wow.
Is that why you were so cold to me at Conservancy events?
I didn't know about the painkillers.
Yeah.
But you did know that we were dating.
Why didn't you say anything?
What was I supposed to say?
I...
I... you... you told me that you two were madly in love and that he could be the one.
Besides...
I figured Steven should be the one to tell you.
Well, I guess this was one of those surprises we were hoping to avoid.
This is your final notice.
In five minutes.
What the hell do you think you're doing here, talking to Iman?
Enjoying the horses.
Same as you, right?
Because Lily would hate to learn that you had me followed.
You need to stop sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong and leave Lily out of this.
Do we understand each other?
I didn't realize you'd become such an animal lover.
I have a dog, too.
I find the company of animals preferable to some people.
Another weakness you didn't inherit from me.
I pulled the story off the site, okay?
I got ahold of some old list Lily made.
You know, the names of everyone that she had ever slept with.
I...
I swear I didn't know your dad's name was on it.
Everything was going so well.
My dad was really starting to like you.
I screwed up.
I'm sorry.
I should've vetted the article before it ever came out.
What do you have against Serena's mom anyway?
Nothing.
I don't have anything against her.
I just... it was a... it was a...
it was a desperate move to save my company.
It was a mistake.
Well, you decided to do it on your own for a reason.
I did, and I think I know of a way that I can without hurting anyone that I care about.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Okay?
I'm really sorry.
And I just...
I don't want to lose "The Spectator."
Or you.
I just saw Lily leaving with Bart.
Did you not tell him you tracked down the Sheikh?
Doesn't matter.
Sheikh's dead, and the daughter won't talk.
She won't?
Why not?
She calls him "Uncle Bart."
We're done here.
Shall we?
Uh, I'll meet you at the car.
I need the ladies' room after all those mint juleps.
Right.
Next on the course...
Owned by the Kelly stables.
Iman?
Hi.
I'm Blair.
I'm a close friend of Chuck's.
I know he left before he could speak to you, but this is important to him, and so it's important to me.
Is this about the horse?
Because I know Chuck never really wanted it.
He was just flirting with me.
I don't think he was flirting with you.
Look, I know how much these horses mean to you and meant to your father.
Unfortunately, they don't mean that much to Bart.
He isn't exactly a big donator at P.E.T.A, if you know what I mean.
I'm not sure I do.
Well, Bart Bass.
Killed a tiger on safari?
He eats veal on a regular basis?
I don't know about any of that, but he was a good friend to my father.
He bought Lady Alexander and the others so they could live out their days on a farm in Virginia.
Okay.
Listen, Princess Jasmine, the fact is, your Uncle Bart is bad.
I'm sure every single horse he bought from your family went straight to the glue factory, including your beloved Lady Alexander.
But, if you like, go ahead.
Check it out.
See if you find the Bart Bass retirement home for aged equines.
Trust me, Chuck is the good guy here, and he needs your help.
On the Upper East Side, it's hard to know who to trust.
Usually, the answer is no one.
I'm sorry, but it's gonna take me more than a car ride to forget the fact that you slept with my mother.
Serena, I can't change what happened.
I can forget it, obviously, but I...
I can't change it.
Maybe you can forget, too?
I don't know if I'll ever be able to forget this.
Well, I...
I guess I can try to move past it.
I mean, crazier things have happened in my family.
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, just not so fast.
There are certain images that keep popping up.
Then we must try to erase them.
I'm warning you.
This could take a while.
Mm-hmm.
I never thought I'd see you again.
Care for a drink?
I can't stay long, but I wanted to tell you that I looked into what your friend Blair told me.
Lady Alexander never went to any farm in Virginia.
Blair told you she did?
No.
Bart told me.
But the horses he purchased from my family are nowhere to be found.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Bart obviously didn't care much about your horses and probably paid your father a lot of money for something else.
Do you know what it was?
Maybe a... a real estate deal?
Perhaps a hotel?
A hotel?
No, my father was in the oil business.
But Bart couldn't have been involved in that.
Why not the oil business?
Because we have a home in Dubai, but we're Sudanese nationals.
I'm sorry.
International affairs are not my area of expertise.
Well, at least not this kind.
Well, the U.S. has an embargo against trading oil with Sudan, so if that's what he bought from my father...
Bart was breaking federal law.
Thanks for taking another look at my loan application.
I... can't believe I left out all the revenue from the new markets.
Just a rookie mistake, I guess.
Well, the numbers do look better, and, uh, I'm glad you caught the error, because, uh, with ad sales projections like this... we're happy to extend "The Spectator's" line of credit.
Thank you so much.
You're a lifesaver.
Now let me just go make you a copy of this real quick.
I'll be right back.
How did it go?
Yeah, Nate asked me to take another look at the numbers like you said he would.
Are you sure you wanna co-sign on this loan?
It's obvious he's doctored his earnings report.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
Send me the documents to sign in the morning.
Again, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you I was with Charles, and you felt the need to follow us.
Apparently... with good reason.
He's just trying to make things right with you.
I know how much you wanna believe that, but Charles has done nothing since we've gotten back together but lie and manipulate you.
Oh, really?
You really think I'm that much of a pushover.
He will prey upon your maternal instincts to get between us.
Well, I won't let that happen.
Neither will I.
You know how much I don't like ultimatums, but I'm afraid Chuck has left me no choice.
If you wanna be with me, you need to stay away from my son.
You can't ask me to do that.
He's my son, too.
We're not done discussing this.
So Bart was using the horses to hide the money he was buying illegal oil with?
He had to hide it somehow.
Sudan is an embargoed country, which means he didn't fake his death because he was worried Mason Nevins would come after Lily or me.
He did it so he could avoid federal prison.
Well, this is what we need.
Right?
Quick.
Call the CIA or the FBI or TMZ.
Let's turn him in!
I wish it were that simple.
We need evidence first.
I was already planning our victory celebration in my head.
We were in a bubble bath with a bottle of Grande Cuvée and no business in the way of us being together.
Hold onto that visual.
Mmm.
If I must.
Call me if you need anything.
Blair, it's Jean Pierre.
Your mother is not pleased.
She knows you're avoiding her calls and that you don't have orders from any buyers.
She says you have one month to fix this.
Lily, I cannot apologize to you enough.
I mean, nothing like this will ever happen again in "The Spectator," I promise you.
Thank you for understanding, yeah.
Bye.
I hope you're here because you forgive me, too.
I hope that answers your question.
If Serena can forgive my dad for sleeping with Lily, and Lily can forgive you for publishing a story about it,
I guess I can forgive you for acting like a jerk.
You know, I...
I haven't gone through those.
Are you sure you just wanna throw it all away?
Some of it must have sentimental value.
Yeah, I'm sure, and I'm sorry I put the responsibility on you to begin with, but I was at the gallery, and I realized I don't want this stuff.
I...
I don't wanna look back.
I just wanna look forward...
With you.
We all have things from our past we'd like to erase.
Philip, get some popcorn.
I ran into Serena earlier today and picked up a movie for us.
But on the Upper East Side, it's not so easy to hit "delete."
There's always a record of misdeed somewhere...
And someone's always looking for it.
Humphrey, what are you doing here?
I'm pretty sure you have a spare room up in here.
I was wondering if I could crash.
You made it pretty clear you were done with me.
What's changed?
I realized I made a mistake.
I've missed you.
I've missed... my friend.
Last year, when you had no one, I was there for you.
I kinda need you to do the same for me right now.
Serena's bed is empty.
Make yourself at home.
Better not to ignore the past but learn from it instead.
Otherwise, history has a way of repeating itself.

- Home Sick Hulk
The optimists' club is picking me up any minute.
It's so exciting!
Are you sure you'll be okay?
Me, okay?
It's just a weekend.
Go, enjoy!
Don't even think about me.
I cooked you a little food.
Hopefully you won't run out.
Not unless I invite the entire school over.
I left some money on the counter and hid a spare key on the stoop.
I have a key.
In case you get locked out, like last time, and the time before.
I'm completely capable of taking care of myself.
It's so cute that you think so, sweetie, but I don't think your pets would agree.
Pets?
Peter, I'm back!
Peter, I'm back!
Peter, I'm back!
Uh-oh.
Everything will be fine.
I'm older now.
I could take care of a pet, if you'd ever let me get another one.
You just go, have fun.
Don't forget to lock the doors.
And brush your teeth!
And bring in the mail!
A... and the plants... water the plants!
Goodbye, aunt May!
Pfft.
I can take care of myself.
I already take of four teammates, five boroughs and even New Jersey when I have to.
Aunt May worries way too much.
Something's headed for the city.
I don't see anything.
I'm going to need a bird's eye... heh, bug's eye view.
I'd make a wish, but that would take time away from making contact.
And whatever this thing is, it's headed right for the old world's fair grounds.
What is this thing, some outer space golf ball?
Uh-oh.
The Hulk?
!
Whoa, green guy!
No smashing required!
We're buds, Hulk!
Remember?
What's wrong with you?
I mean, outside from being huge, green and half-naked.
Uh-oh.
Team!
Unidentified space-borne object just landed in the old world's fair grounds.
Get down there and report.
Already on it, Fury.
Sending you a video capture.
Need you to tell me what not on Earth this thing is!
Quit twisting!
I'm trying to help you!
Spider-man, positive id as a Phalanx.
Alien species, highly infectious.
Keep your distance.
Don't let it touch you.
I got your back, big guy.
- Uh-oh.
- Smash!
Nice work, big green!
Yeah!
High five?
No?
Okay.
Help...
Hulk...
No, no, no, no, no, oh!
Help...
Spidey...
What was that noise?
That was the Hulk... that was...
Never hesitate to tell the truth!
Tell truth, and SHIELD put friend in cage!
I'll get back to you, Fury.
Busy here.
Spidey out.
Whoa.
What is that?
- Uh!
- Don't hang up on me!
We're almost there.
Now, what is the situation?
The situation is that Phalanx thing is scrap metal now, and...
If bug man really friend, he'll keep Hulk from lockdown.
And?
And I have got some huge homework, so I'm going to leave the cleanup to your SHIELD guys.
Bye!
Don't ha...
Okay, so taking him home maybe wasn't the best idea, but...
Where am Hulk?
He wasn't looking his usual green self.
Bug man!
Where you take Hulk?
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't sit up!
Where Hulk?
Somewhere safe, where we can figure out what that Phalanx thing did to you, and why.
Hulk no like puny metal creatures!
But Hulk like bug man.
That's good.
I like you, too.
And Spidey no like puny creatures either, to put it Hulk-ly.
- Hulk and bug man smash again!
- Totally, yeah!
But in the meantime, do you have any other hobbies besides smashing?
Smashing good!
Hulk also like music.
Hey, me, too!
You play any instruments?
- Hulk smash piano once.
- Yeah, I can imagine.
So, where do you live?
Maybe if we can get you there...
Hulk live wherever Hulk is.
- That's the same as living nowhere.
- And everywhere.
Huh, guess I never thought of it like that.
I...
Hey, stay put!
Huh?
That thing is still in you.
Peter, I'm back!
What?
!
This soon?
Oh, no, no, no!
- Peter?
- Someone coming for Hulk!
Shh!
Be... be right there!
No one's coming for you.
Just stay right here.
Don't make any sounds, and don't move.
I'm going to help you.
I just don't know how yet.
Peter, is everything all right?
Oh.
Couldn't be better!
Oh...
Peter, is everything all right?
Aunt, Hulk, holes, costume, panic!
Aunt May!
What are you doing here?
I twisted my ankle, of all things.
I whitewater raft, I bungee jump
I ATV, and then I go and do this just by stepping off a curb, augh!
But don't worry about me.
I'll climb in bed and ice my foot.
Stairs?
Oh, aunt May!
Stairs?
Really, stairs?
!
Now, you turn right back around and go sit down.
- Downstairs!
This instant!
- Well, I...
I guess I...
- What was that?
- Let me look.
I said stay put, you!
Shh!
- Rats in the attic?
- Better than bats in the belfry.
Oh, aunt May, you are a riot!
But I have to insist you stay off that foot.
- Downstairs, go!
- I just wanted to get my...
I'll get it!
- Hulk nose run.
- Oh, really?
The curtains?
Hulk need to sneeze!
Ah... ah...
No!
Wait!
Don't...
Could I borrow the curtain, please?
Do not make me come back in here!
It was nothing, just some books.
I have tons of homework.
Literally tons, so...
Then don't worry about me.
I...
I can take care of you and...
get done what I need to get done.
I promise you won't end up like my pets.
Now, let me go get some ice for that ankle.
Okay, just stay in bed, stay very still, and no matter what, don't leave this...
Uh-oh.
Hulk, get back here!
Hulk leave room if Hulk want.
No.
Hulk stay in room like bug man say, or bug man get... why am I talking like you?
You can't leave because... because I'm your friend, and I'm looking for a way to help you feel better, and I need a little time for that.
Hulk wait because Hulk feel sleepy, not because bug man say to.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever you say.
Just stay put.
Uh-oh!
Aunt May, come back!
I said I'd take care of you, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.
Isn't that sweet of you?
I'm just glad I'm not his goldfish.
I'll go wait in the living room.
No!
The den will be much cozier.
There.
See?
Nice, right?
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were hiding a girl upstairs.
Well, you do know better then because a girl is the last thing I have hiding upstairs.
What in the world?
- Just seismic tremors.
- An Earthquake?
Here?
Sure!
There are all kinds of... faults around here.
Most of them in my storytelling.
Unwelcome pests in your home?
- Peter, it's too loud!
- What?
I can't hear you, it's too loud!
- Here's something to read.
- The phone book?
I'd better go check the internet to see where that tremor was centered.
- What are you doing?
!
- Mosquito.
- Huh.
Got it.
- Shh!
Also, ew!
But mostly, shh!
You have to be quiet.
My aunt is downstairs!
Hulk smash puny ant!
Not ant, "ant".
Aunt, "aunt"!
You know, like uncle?
You will not smash.
Peter!
Oh!
Shush!
I mean it this time.
I've never seen those socks before.
Uh.
They're new.
Big sock sale... at the sock store.
Sock store, seriously?
The best I can do?
Ugh, weak sauce.
- Here, your eye mask!
- But I'm not sleepy.
I...
Sleepy schmeepy!
It's soothing.
Music!
Just relax until I get back.
- Oh, Hulk, what are you doing?
- Eat.
- Obviously!
- Shush!
I mean, what are you doing downstairs?
I told you to wait!
Hulk quiet, not squash ant, and leave pickle for bug man!
Uh... uh!
Yeah, he left me a big pickle.
Now, let me look at that barb in your...
Hulk dizzy.
I dare anyone to tell me how this situation gets worse.
That doesn't look good.
How'd you get hooked up with these Phalanx things anyway?
Creatures grab Hulk, while Hulk sleep.
Take up to space.
Hulk smash till crash down, but too many.
Hulk feel sick.
From the tech infection, or... wait, you mean...
Hulk stomach hurt.
Nuh-uh, you are not going to...
Hulk all over me.
- Ooh...
- Wait for it!
Just...
If he can survive a fall from the sky, he can survive a fall from the hallway, right?
Aim for the drain!
Aim for the drain!
Peter?
Are you all right?
Just feeling a little...
green.
Now, you stay there.
If you get up again, I'll... sic the Hulk on you.
Oh, Peter.
Such an imagination.
Oh, Hulk.
The washing machine, really?
Yuck.
Try to warn a spider next time, would you, Hulk?
- Hulk, is that your real name, or...
- Hulk is Hulk.
Look, I have no idea how to treat this mecha-fection.
I know SHIELD could crack it, but they'd also crack you.
Do you have any friends or family we could...
Hulk have no friends.
Hulk always alone.
- What about me?
- How bug friend?
Hulk not even know who bug man is under bug mask.
Well, sure, but I do have a secret identity to keep secret.
Hulk...
My name is Peter Parker, and I am your friend.
I promise.
Par... ker...
I'm going to assume that means it's off, whatever "off" is.
It's no SHIELD tech, but...
Spider-man, we need to talk about your disappearing act.
Yeah, Fury...
I'm actually working on... science homework right now.
Can't talk.
Bye!
I'm so going to pay for that.
But first...
This isn't just metal.
It's living metal.
Looks like it's kaput... or not!
Uh-oh.
Spidey sense says don't go there.
Hulk?
Okay, not Hulk.
But then, who...
Please tell me that Phalanx barb did not send out some SOS.
Big guy!
You'd better wake up!
I have a bad feeling I told those Phalanx things where you went!
And now they're here!
Hulk better, ready to smash!
I think you're about to get your wish.
Outside!
Hulk smash!
Don't touch!
Keep them back!
We have to shut these things down and move this fight out of the suburbs.
Any ideas?
Hulk smash!
No, Hulk!
No, Hulk!
Wait!
Let that one go.
Lawn gnomes?
We are so obviously in Queens.
- We need to follow it!
- Yes!
Machine man go inside.
Well then, guess we should take a look at what will no doubt be a very unpleasant sight.
You want to open the door?
Or tear it off its hinges?
That looks like the mother of all mother ships.
What's it doing?
What's it making?
Oh, why do I know this is not good?
Uh-oh.
They seem to have your eyes.
Looks like the Phalanx weren't trying to infect you.
They were harvesting your tissue to steal your strength by evolving!
No one steal Hulk strength!
This time someone did.
We can't let them get out of here.
Hope you're in the mood for some alien smash.
We're trapped with them now.
No, puny creatures trapped with us!
No go!
The organic material in the wood is getting infected, too.
We need to hit them with something non-organic, like metal!
Hey, batta, batta, batta!
Sa-wing batta!
Delivery for Mr. and Mrs. Phalanx.
Oh, the more we smash the more they make!
This is not a good long-term strategy.
Hulk feel better.
Maybe Hulk body have things that kill virus.
What, like antibodies?
Actually, that's possible.
You rejected the barb.
If you have antibodies, you'd be immune.
- How did you think of this?
- Puny Banner is scientist.
Wait.
Puny Banner?
The world-famous gamma scientist, Bruce Banner?
You know him?
- Oh.
Wow, you are him!
- Hulk is Hulk now.
Then I say, keep your fingers crossed that you're immune to these circuit boards, and smash, Hulk!
Go, Hulk!
Go!
More to smash, Hulk!
More to smash!
Hulk!
You okay in there?
The alien invasion is officially Hulked.
Oh,no.
Now what?
Hulk, we meet again.
Ever get the feeling you've seen something before?
Déja vu?
Monosyllables, then scientific theories, then French?
I'm loving me some Hulk right now.
Stand down, Spider-Man.
Not on your life, Fury.
No one touches my friend.
- You got it all wrong, webs.
- Then explain it to me.
I get that you're trying to do what's best for Hulk, but I'm responsible for making a decision that's best for the world.
Well, the Hulk just saved the world from the Phalanx, with my guidance, of course.
So, how are you going to reward him, throw him in Hulk jail?
He has a mind, a sharp one, in fact.
He can be a good friend to have, if you're a friend to him first.
Nick Fury, director of SHIELD.
We could use a hero like you.
We can offer you a home, regular food, and all of SHIELD's resources to try and figure out how we can help each other.
Hulk, despite their less-than-subtle techniques, they are the good guys.
They smash baddies, too.
What do you say?
No!
Well, that worked out, huh?
Guess I'd better get going, too.
Things to do, people to see...
Not so fast.
This was all because you didn't...
Hulk decide will go with one-eye man.
If friend think Hulk should.
Friend thinks... friend thinks Hulk should have a home, a home where friend could come visit him... and smash.
- What made you come back?
- Hulk still hungry.
Got it.
Put it there, pal.
Till next time, Hulk.
Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
First order of business for SHIELD... develop a handshake filter for that guy.
Who says I can't take care of things?
I took care of the Phalanx, I took care of Hulk, and I even took care of aunt... oops.
Peter?
Peter, can you bring me a glass of water, please?
Gotta run!
Peter!

- What are you doing?
!
- Mosquito.
- Huh.
Got it.
- Shh!
Also, ew!
But mostly, shh!
You have to be quiet.
My aunt is downstairs!
Hulk smash puny ant!
Not ant, "ant".
Aunt, "aunt"!
You know, like uncle?
You will not smash.
Peter!
Oh!
Shush!
I mean it this time.
I've never seen those socks before.
Uh.
They're new.
Big sock sale... at the sock store.
Sock store, seriously?
The best I can do?
Ugh, weak sauce.
- Here, your eye mask!
- But I'm not sleepy.
I...
Sleepy schmeepy!
It's soothing.
Music!
Just relax until I get back.
- Oh, Hulk, what are you doing?
- Eat.
- Obviously!
- Shush!
I mean, what are you doing downstairs?
I told you to wait!
Hulk quiet, not squash ant, and leave pickle for bug man!
Uh... uh!
Yeah, he left me a big pickle.
Now, let me look at that barb in your...
Hulk dizzy.
I dare anyone to tell me how this situation gets worse.
That doesn't look good.
How'd you get hooked up with these Phalanx things anyway?
Creatures grab Hulk, while Hulk sleep.
Take up to space.
Hulk smash till crash down, but too many.
Hulk feel sick.
From the tech infection, or... wait, you mean...
Hulk stomach hurt.
Nuh-uh, you are not going to...
Hulk all over me.
- Ooh...
- Wait for it!
Just...
If he can survive a fall from the sky, he can survive a fall from the hallway, right?
Aim for the drain!
Aim for the drain!
Peter?
Are you all right?
Just feeling a little...
green.
Now, you stay there.
If you get up again, I'll... sic the Hulk on you.
Oh, Peter.
Such an imagination.
Oh, Hulk.
The washing machine, really?
Yuck.
Try to warn a spider next time, would you, Hulk?
- Hulk, is that your real name, or...
- Hulk is Hulk.
Look, I have no idea how to treat this mecha-fection.
I know SHIELD could crack it, but they'd also crack you.
Do you have any friends or family we could...
Hulk have no friends.
Hulk always alone.
- What about me?
- How bug friend?
Hulk not even know who bug man is under bug mask.
Well, sure, but I do have a secret identity to keep secret.
Hulk...
My name is Peter Parker, and I am your friend.
I promise.
Par... ker...
I'm going to assume that means it's off, whatever "off" is.
It's no SHIELD tech, but...
Spider-man, we need to talk about your disappearing act.
Yeah, Fury...
I'm actually working on... science homework right now.
Can't talk.
Bye!
I'm so going to pay for that.
But first...
This isn't just metal.
It's living metal.
Looks like it's kaput... or not!
Uh-oh.
Spidey sense says don't go there.
Hulk?
Okay, not Hulk.
But then, who...
Please tell me that Phalanx barb did not send out some SOS.
Big guy!
You'd better wake up!
I have a bad feeling I told those Phalanx things where you went!
And now they're here!
Hulk better, ready to smash!
I think you're about to get your wish.
Outside!
Hulk smash!
Don't touch!
Keep them back!
We have to shut these things down and move this fight out of the suburbs.
Any ideas?
Hulk smash!
No, Hulk!
No, Hulk!
Wait!
Let that one go.
Lawn gnomes?
We are so obviously in Queens.
- We need to follow it!
- Yes!
Machine man go inside.
Well then, guess we should take a look at what will no doubt be a very unpleasant sight.
You want to open the door?
Or tear it off its hinges?
That looks like the mother of all mother ships.
What's it doing?
What's it making?
Oh, why do I know this is not good?
Uh-oh.
They seem to have your eyes.
Looks like the Phalanx weren't trying to infect you.
They were harvesting your tissue to steal your strength by evolving!
No one steal Hulk strength!
This time someone did.
We can't let them get out of here.
Hope you're in the mood for some alien smash.
We're trapped with them now.
No, puny creatures trapped with us!
No go!
The organic material in the wood is getting infected, too.
We need to hit them with something non-organic, like metal!
Hey, batta, batta, batta!
Sa-wing batta!
Delivery for Mr. and Mrs. Phalanx.
Oh, the more we smash the more they make!
This is not a good long-term strategy.
Hulk feel better.
Maybe Hulk body have things that kill virus.
What, like antibodies?
Actually, that's possible.
You rejected the barb.
If you have antibodies, you'd be immune.
- How did you think of this?
- Puny Banner is scientist.
Wait.
Puny Banner?
The world-famous gamma scientist, Bruce Banner?
You know him?
- Oh.
Wow, you are him!
- Hulk is Hulk now.
Then I say, keep your fingers crossed that you're immune to these circuit boards, and smash, Hulk!
Go, Hulk!
Go!
More to smash, Hulk!
More to smash!
Hulk!
You okay in there?
The alien invasion is officially Hulked.
Oh,no.
Now what?
Hulk, we meet again.
Ever get the feeling you've seen something before?
Déja vu?
Monosyllables, then scientific theories, then French?
I'm loving me some Hulk right now.
Stand down, Spider-Man.
Not on your life, Fury.
No one touches my friend.
- You got it all wrong, webs.
- Then explain it to me.
I get that you're trying to do what's best for Hulk, but I'm responsible for making a decision that's best for the world.
Well, the Hulk just saved the world from the Phalanx, with my guidance, of course.
So, how are you going to reward him, throw him in Hulk jail?
He has a mind, a sharp one, in fact.
He can be a good friend to have, if you're a friend to him first.
Nick Fury, director of SHIELD.
We could use a hero like you.
We can offer you a home, regular food, and all of SHIELD's resources to try and figure out how we can help each other.
Hulk, despite their less-than-subtle techniques, they are the good guys.
They smash baddies, too.
What do you say?
No!
Well, that worked out, huh?
Guess I'd better get going, too.
Things to do, people to see...
Not so fast.
This was all because you didn't...
Hulk decide will go with one-eye man.
If friend think Hulk should.
Friend thinks... friend thinks Hulk should have a home, a home where friend could come visit him... and smash.
- What made you come back?
- Hulk still hungry.
Got it.
Put it there, pal.
Till next time, Hulk.
Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
First order of business for SHIELD... develop a handshake filter for that guy.
Who says I can't take care of things?
I took care of the Phalanx, I took care of Hulk, and I even took care of aunt... oops.
Peter?
Peter, can you bring me a glass of water, please?
Gotta run!
Peter!
[ Indistinct whispers ]
[ominous music]
[ Indistinct whispers ]
TERRY:
Neal?
Neal, come on, wake up.
Hey, come on, kid, get up.
We're almost home.
[ Gasps ]
How long was I out?
All the way from the airport, about three hours.
What, didn't you sleep last night?
Looks about the same around here.
Yeah, yeah.
The, um... snow just all came off last week.
It was real nice.
You would've...
You would've liked it.
Yeah.
Too bad I had to miss it then.
So I guess it's a lot, uh... a lot warmer in Florida, huh?
Depends on what you mean by warm.
See you still got that mumbling thing.
I don't know.
You see, Aunt Sara didn't seem to care if I talked or not.
Actually, Sara cared a lot.
Could've fooled me.
Really?
[ laughs] Real--
You know, kid, when someone takes your ass in and doesn't kick it out after two years, that's 'cause they actually give a shit.
And she didn't want you gone, if that's what you think, either, okay?
It's 'cause the new lady wants to meet me, right?
So you did read the letters I sent you then.
Yeah.
Well, I didn't know one way or the other, you know.
Response would have been nice.
I had some, but they weren't very nice.
What does Paulie think of her?
Paulie thinks the world of her.
Which is one of the reasons why I decided to move forward with her.
And one of the big reasons why she wants to get to know you.
How is Paulie?
He's fine.
He's good.
[ People conversing ]
- TERRY: [whispers ] Aw, shit.
- NEAL:
Dad?
I'm sorry.
Come on.
It's gonna be all right.
Come on.
- [guests clapping ]
- TERRY:
Hey.
It was Angela's idea.
I'm gonna love her.
Hey, come on, this is important to her, all right?
So just try and remember what a smile is and slap it on your face for a few minutes, please?
ANGELA: [gasps] Ohh!
[laughs]
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oh, so nice to finally meet you, honey!
TERRY:
This is Angela, obviously.
ANGELA:
Oh, welcome home.
I'm Angela.
Oh, so nice to see you.
You know, you must be very hungry.
You want something to eat, something to drink?
I mean, I've made plenty of... [voice becomes distorted ]
...in person.
You really are a cutie!
- Oh!
- Where's Paulie?
Yeah, where is your youngest, Hausman?
I figured he'd be out here dancing for joy to have Neal back.
TERRY:
Oh.
Uh, well, you know, Paul's, uh...
Taking a nap, actually.
Yeah, he's had a little fever recently, and he's just getting over it.
TERRY:
You know, we just want to keep him rested for school tomorrow.
Hey, Neal, you remember me, right?
Mr. Evans.
Hey, kept an eye on your dad while you were staying at your aunt's.
Made sure he didn't get into any trouble.
Are you sure about that?
I think he snuck in a new wife when you weren't looking.
[laughs]
Yeah, anyway, you remember my boys, Richard and Roger?
Hey, guys.
They've been talking nonstop about you ever since they heard you were coming back.
Hey, we would love to have you over for our own little welcome back.
You know, you and your brother can come over for dinner, you can stay the night, we'll hang out.
- It'll be great.
- Thanks.
I'm gonna go tell Paulie.
MR. EVANS:
All right, great.
Great to see you...
Neal.
CARA:
Neal?
Hey, Cara.
I'm sorry I left without saying good-bye.
We just left, like, overnight.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I never got the chance to say sorry about, you know, what happened.
Thanks.
Hey, Cara?
Gonna marry that nut job?
You better keep him away from matches.
Shut up!
I'm sorry.
My brothers are idiots.
It's okay.
My brother's inside, so I should go.
Cool.
It's good seeing you, Neal.
It's gorgeous.
[thud]
[ Rapid breathing ]
Paulie?
Paulie?
Paulie!
Paulie!
Paulie?
[thud echoing ]
[thud] [panfing]
[creaking ]
Paulie, Jesus Christ!
You really scared me, buddy.
You're not Neal.
No, of course, I am.
It's really me, Paulie.
Prove it.
Okay.
Well, Dad, probably flipped out when he found out about these, right?
It pretended to be you so many times.
Paulie, don't talk like that.
TERRY:
Hey, what the hell's going on in here?
God damn it!
Paulie, what the hell you doing up here?
How many times do I have to tell you not to go through these boxes?
What, 2,000 times?
- [Terry shouting ]
- Terry, Honey?
Is everything okay?
[shouting continues]
Sorry, excuse me.
What'd you think, Neal's back, you get to do whatever the hell you want?
Is that it?
I'm sorry, Dad.
- Dad?
- What?
Just hold on a second.
What do you want?
You want Neal gone?
You want him going back to Florida?
- Is that it?
- Dad, come on!
What the hell are you thinking, Paul?
What's going on?
This goddamn party's over, Angela.
I want everybody out of my house right now.
Everybody gone!
Now!
Okay!
Okay, honey, just listen to me, okay?
Move your car.
You're blocking some people in.
You have to move your car.
Just take it easy, honey.
Fine.
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
How about you, Neal?
I'm great, Angela.
- Listen, um...
- [ money crinkling ]
Why don't you, uh, just take this?
Get out of the house and go and be brothers for a little bit, okay?
Be back by 6:00 for dinner, all right?
Thank you.
You're welcome, honey.
Be careful.
Six o'clock!
God.
NEAL:
Aah!
[Paulie laughing]
Wow, Neal, you're here!
That's right, dude.
I'm here for good.
Feels like it's been forever.
I know, man.
I can't believe how big you got.
I thought you were gonna be a midget the rest of your life.
So how was Florida with Aunt Sara?
Aunt Sara home-schooled me and put me in therapy, so I sat around and listened to how crazy I was for a while.
[laughs]
What?
I miss something?
No, it's just funny how sometimes a crazy person is the only one who gets it right.
Gets it right?
You're not crazy, Neal.
You never were.
[tapping on table]
You can smoke if you need to.
I can't smoke in here.
No, I just mean around me.
I don't mind.
Thanks.
I think I'm gonna quit.
I have enough problems already.
I really missed this.
You know, this is the coolest place in town.
Well, what did you miss more, this place or me?
You jerk.
I was just about to say you.
hey, guys, how's it going?
Hi.
Hi.
Haven't seen you in forever.
Thought my best customer left for another diner.
Well, um, there isn't one.
This is the best in town.
[ laughs ] Listen to that.
So, you used to get the Reuben?
- Uh-huh.
- Two, please.
Right on it.
So you have a girlfriend?
No, no.
You sure?
I mean, there's gotta be like ten girls after you right now.
Well, um, I kind of like this one girl.
[fading and distorting ] She sits right next to me in... [ inaudible]
[ Muffled ] Neal?
Whoa!
Neal?
Neal!
[sound returns to normal ]
Hey, let me ask you something.
Have you seen this before?
I don't want to talk about that.
NEAL:
It's okay.
It's just me talking to you, okay?
There's nobody else but us.
I found that sketchbook a while back, yeah.
I went through your boxes a few times just, you know, 'cause it made me think of you,
- and...
- And you looked inside?
Yeah.
Is that what you mean by saying that I'm not crazy?
You think that you've been seeing something like this?
At night, every night.
Who knows about this?
You do.
Only you would ever believe it's happening again.
But you didn't tell Dad?
Angela?
No.
Well, they know I haven't been sleeping, but I don't talk about it.
They just think it's me missing you or school, and I just agree with them.
And you think you saw me sometimes?
It's one of the ways it tries to get me.
I remembered you talking about visions you'd have at night and Dad saying you've got an overactive imagination.
Why was all my stuff boxed up in your room, Paulie?
Well, when you got sent away,
I got kind of sad, so Dad packed up all your stuff and moved me in.
He thought it would help.
Oh, shit.
Yeah, it didn't.
So you've been sleeping in my room this whole time?
Well, I go in there every night, but I don't sleep.
Neal... you believe me, right?
Okay.
Ooh.
Phew!
Paulie, what a mess.
See, is there anything else?
Nope.
[rumbling]
[ Gasps ]
Damn it.
[ slam 1
[ loud banging ]
Oh!
[gasping ]
Okay.
[gasping ]
Oh!
[ Neal speaking indistinctly]
This was really close, too.
[quietly] Cara.
[door bell jingles]
What is it, Neal?
Two Reubens!
Best in town, right, big guy?
NEAL: [ muttering ] Oh, my God.
Hey, Neal.
Wow, you've been back for two hours and you're already at Melanie's.
Heh.
So how was your party?
Hey, it was, uh...
It was not much.
I mean, it was fine.
It was...
Well, well, well, if it isn't the firebug?
You know, I heard that your dad had to send you away to keep you out of jail.
SECOND BOY:
Yeah, didn't something happen to your mom?
Did you do that, too?
You can't believe everything you hear.
He got sent away to protect him from me.
That's right, I'm his brother, Paulie.
I don't remember what happened that night.
When I came to the next morning, he was halfway across the country, and I was in a straitjacket.
What the hell are you talking about?
You're like three.
Mm-hmm.
That's how I get away with it.
Let's get outta here.
[laughs]
You seem like you came out of everything okay.
Better than ever, baby.
Wow.
So, Neal, sorry about that.
I'll see you around, I guess.
Yeah.
NEAL:
So... from the foot of the bed or the side, most often?
Definitely the side.
Any idea what time?
Not really.
It's when it's dark and late... really late.
Any contact?
What do you mean?
Like talking, messages, or...?
I don't think so.
What does it do?
It reaches.
[ Indistinct whispers ]
Dinner, boys.
Come on.
TERRY:
It's very good, dear.
ANGELA:
I see the salad is very popular.
- It is.
- Mm-hmm.
TERRY:
I cut mean vegetables.
[Angela laughs]
Oh.
Isn't this wonderful?
We're finally all here.
So where did you wind up going?
[silverware clanks]
Oh!
ANGELA:
Stop that.
Melanie's.
I love that place.
It's such a great idea.
Is that where your appetite went, Neal?
- Paulie?
Stop that.
- Enough.
ANGELA:
You're not tossing food.
No, I didn't eat my sandwich, either.
You want me to cook you something?
- You sure?
- No, no.
No, like a soufflé, you know.
[laughs]
I'd like to see that.
So where's Neal gonna sleep?
Well, Angela and I talked about that a little bit, and, um, you know, Paulie's in your old room, so we thought maybe you'd be okay trying something a little different.
I made a bed for you in Paulie's old room.
I hope that's okay.
Paulie's room.
That's great, considering that all-- all my shit is in there.
[school bell rings]
So nice to see many of your happy faces here supporting theater in the schools.
Maybe that'll send the school board a message, huh?
Well, you might have noticed that our turnout for this year's school play is a little light.
You can thank your parents for responding so well to my original piece I wrote,
"Barry Bonds:
Hero or Cheater?"
Undaunted, I'm gonna move on to my next project, which will be a lot of fun.
We're gonna do "The Crucible, the Musical," and... [ music]
[dialogue inaudible]
[ Spotlight clicks ]
Wake up!
Aah!
[echoing ]
Aah!
Look, I get that you need some time to readjust, Neal.
Okay, I do, but I got you two staring off into nothing.
You're not eating.
You sure as shit don't care about Angela's feelings.
And you know what I don't want, boys?
I don't want today to become every other day.
We used to be normal.
Do you remember that?
We're gonna be again.
We're gonna be, but it's up to you boys.
Paulie?
Angela and I have decided we're gonna keep you out of school for a little while.
No.
No, no, no, you can't do that!
Why?
Why?
Are you actually asking why?
Should we ask all your--your classmates who watched you melt down today why, Paulie?
Now, look, the--the priority here is to get you guys both back to earth and back in school in a week, and we are gonna do it!
But before I can enroll you, Neal,
I need you to do some things for me, son.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Like grow the fuck up, for one.
Like become a man!
You're were only supposed to go down to Sara's for a couple of months, but she wanted you there because she thought it was helping.
But if two years down there is not getting you to grow up, then I'm gonna do it!
Your ass is getting a job!
Is getting a job gonna make me a man?
Well, it's sure as shit gonna help!
Uh, Neal, honey?
I think what your dad is trying to say is that [fading and distorting ] Paulie needs a role model.
[voice becomes indistinct]
[ Indistinct whispering ]
ANGELA: [ muffled ] Are you okay?
[door bangs]
- Neal!
Are you listening?
- Yes!
Yes?
Okay, then what did we just say?
That I'm still crazy!
No, that is not what we just said!
That's all that anybody thinks!
I'm not even getting a chance!
You don't get chances, kid!
You earn them, and you're not doing it!
Well, maybe I should have just died with Mom!
You two go to bed.
Angela's making you act completely...
TERRY:
Stop it, Neal.
Please just stop talking, all right?
Now, you two brought this on yourselves.
This door's gonna stay locked.
You gotta go to the bathroom, you knock.
Otherwise, all I want to hear is silence.
Sleep tight!
Don't start with me.
Maybe we should consider outside help.
No.
We've done that, and it hasn't done jack shit.
We are doing this ourselves.
But something is going on here, Terry.
Yes, Angela, there is, and we're gonna put a stop to it.
NEAL:
You sleep with the light on?
PAULIE:
At night, yeah.
NEAL:
For how long?
PAULIE:
About a year now.
NEAL:
But it helps?
PAULIE:
Mm-mmm.
[ Floor creaks ]
Hey, let's try something, you and me.
Turn the light off.
Neal, what are you gonna do?
[whispers ] Hey.
[ Soft snarl ]
Hey!
[ Loud roar]
If we don't make any noise, it doesn't know we're here.
What about when we move?
Here, let me try something.
[floor creaking ]
[ Monster snarling ]
So we don't move, we don't make any sound, it's not gonna try anything, right?
- [ Roaring ]
- Paulie, he's right behind you, man!
[ Roar echoes and fades ]
[Sighs]
How close did it come to me?
Um, not that close.
Still had half the room to go.
A couple of feet.
We're all right with the lights on, I think.
Yeah.
Wonder what Angela tells Dad.
What do you think of her?
She's kind of cool.
Seriously?
Does she even have a job?
She's a substitute teacher.
Good for her.
Substitute teacher, substitute wife, substitute mom.
She's got it all figured out.
Neal, you should give her a chance.
Does Dad ever talk about Mom?
Never, except when he'd talk about you.
Does he blame me?
He blames everybody.
' Hey, Neal?
'Hmm?
Want to see how I get to bed?
Yeah.
[ Loud roar]
[ Roar fades ]
So I was thinking about how we'd keep you off the floor tonight, Neal.
I was just gonna stay up all night.
Not like I haven't done it before.
Well, maybe you can sleep on the dresser.
I mean, better than no sleep.
Worth a shot.
Just run, Neal.
You're gonna make it mad.
[ Loud roar]
[ Roaring ]
I think I made it mad anyway.
Well, it's a lot noisier than it's ever been before.
It remembers me.
It's been a long two years, Neal.
I'm glad you haven't changed.
What happened to you today?
I fell asleep in class, and I woke up screaming.
Why didn't you say anything, man?
Well, 'cause I kind of like just hanging out without talking about screaming.
You ready to stop screaming?
Yeah.
[Sighs]
[ Indistinct whispers ]
[object banging and rattling ]
Paulie?
Paulie!
Paulie, if you're sleeping, wake up!
Wake up, man, there's something happening!
PAULIE:
Yeah, this stuff.
I don't remember this!
What the fuck is this, man?
Usually happens after I've already fallen asleep.
[ Bangs and crashes]
What's happening?
!
I don't know, Paulie!
Hang on!
[clattering ]
[ Noise stops]
[ Indistinct whispers ]
[Crash ] [objects clatter]
Dad!
NEAL:
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, leave him alone!
Dad!
Dad!
What are you doing?
[ Paulie groans]
- NEAL:
Get off him, Dad!
- PAULIE:
Dad, what--
- NEAL:
Stop!
- Dad!
- [ Monster Terry growling ]
- PAULIE:
Neal!
No!
Dad!
Dad, stop!
NEAL:
Dad!
Dad!
- [ Hissing and snarling ]
- PAULIE:
No, no!
[growling]
Aah!
[wincing ]
ANGELA:
Does it hurt?
PAULIEI Mm-hmm.
Do you want to tell me exactly what happened, honey?
No.
Paulie, you know, I can put medicine on your bruises in the middle of the night, but the only way I can truly help you is if I can stop this from happening in the first place.
Paulie, honey, I love you, and I really want to help you, but you have to trust me.
Please trust me.
Okay, you have two ways of answering this for me.
Either you did this, or he did this to himself.
- Which one is it?
- No.
Which answer, Neal?
Which answer is gonna make us less miserable?
You don't really think that I would ever do that to him, do you?
So he did it to himself?
I didn't say that.
God damn it, Neal!
Knock this shit off, please!
'Cause I don't think you two can survive another day!
I don't think I can survive another day of this!
I know.
This is not the way to protect your little brother.
You know, he doesn't need you making excuses for him.
He needs you being a man, standing up for him.
I'm trying.
Dad thinks you did it.
Really?
Angela thinks you did it.
She does?
If she says that to my face, I'm gonna call her a bitch to hers.
Well, then that'd be the first time you talked to her.
Did it hurt when it grabbed you?
No, it...
It felt worse.
Like what'd it feel like?
It was cold and...
and numb, and it felt like I was...
Falling asleep?
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
Okay, boys, it's late.
Let's try this again, shall we?
ANGELA:
Come on, honey, let's get you back to bed.
Honey, come here.
I'm really worried about you.
How can I make this better?
PAULIE:
Can I have my sleeping bag?
ANGELA:
Sure, I'll go get your sleeping...
TERRY:
No.
Paulie's sleeping in a bed like a normal person, and this door is staying locked.
The sooner you two get past this phase... [ unscrewing light bulb]
The sooner we can go on living our lives.
ANGELA:
What are you doing?
TERRY:
What am I doing?
Normal people sleep in the dark!
So is he!
ANGELA:
It's a little extreme, Terry.
TERRY:
Come on, please?
Come on.
[ Lock clicking ]
PAULIEI Neal.
NEAL:
Come on.
TERRY:
Boys?
Paulie?
Neal?
Wake up.
Good morning.
You okay?
NEAL:
Yeah, Dad, we're both fine.
TERRY:
Okay, Well, it's...
It's breakfast time.
Come on.
I know.
Thank you, Sam.
I really appreciate it.
Yes, I will.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
They understand.
They're not happy, but they...they get it.
I'm sorry, Ang.
It's okay, honey.
It's not your fault.
[Sighs]
I found Neal in Paulie's room this morning.
- What?
- Snuck in.
Oh, my gosh.
At least they didn't kill each other.
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
I swear to God, Ang, I have no idea what to do.
Did Dad tell you about Mom's grave?
One of his letters had pictures of it.
Yeah, well, she's not there.
No fuckin' way.
I wanted her to stay here, and Dad said it was okay as long as he didn't see it.
So I keep it in here.
[ Sniffles ]
You remember Mom staying in the house after the fire reached the living room?
That night...
I begged her to stay with me so she could see what was under the bed.
She did, and... she died because she believed me.
She was protecting us.
I miss her.
[ Car door closes, engine starts ]
Look, you gotta hold it from the side, too.
Keep your finger on the trigger.
Keep it steady and push forward with your back hand.
In.
You'd have to be pretty close to hurt it with this, right?
Well, yeah.
We'd have to get closer than we've ever been before sooner or later.
[clattering ]
What makes you think we can kill it?
I think it's afraid of us, and it wouldn't be afraid of anything if it couldn't die, Paul.
Would you be?
We're something this thing has never dealt with before.
What?
We're brothers.
Oh, shit.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Uh, Neal, dear?
Let's leave that alone for the time being.
Dad taught me to use it before.
Well, he's not here right now, so, uh, put it down.
I'll be fine.
Put it down, please.
[ Chainsaw thuds ]
Come on, pal.
Paulie?
Sweetheart, please tell me what's going on.
It's not a big deal.
Well, if you can just tell me a little bit, honey, maybe I can, I don't know, somehow help you?
If you want to help him, stay out of his way.
NEAL:
It looks pretty good in there.
PAULIE:
Yeah, not bad for two hours of sleep between us.
We're okay.
Before I got sent away, I used to sleep anywhere I could, like the kitchen, Mom and Dad's room, outside.
I slept in the garage a few times, but it only ever got to me when I would try to sleep in beds.
It's bound to beds.
Why?
I don't know.
I have theories, I guess.
Beds are where people sleep the most, so if it usually strikes when you sleep, it makes sense.
That's where you have the most dreams and nightmares.
Maybe that's what it looks for.
Maybe.
I have another theory, too, but you can't freak out.
Go ahead.
I read once that you shed a lot of dead skin cells in your bed.
Like while you sleep, you know, like, your bed is full of dead skin and pieces of your body.
Maybe it starts by, like, feeding on-- on your dead flesh before it, you know...
PAULIE:
Before that's not good enough anymore.
NEAL:
Yeah.
PAULIE:
You looking at that old Polaroid?
Yeah.
You know about this?
Yeah, I found it after you left.
PAULIE:
So that's what it looks like, right?
That crazy face?
I guess.
I never tried to take another picture after this one, so...
I did.
You did?
Yeah.
I thought that if I could prove it was real then you'd come back sooner, you know.
So I started taking pictures under the bed, staying up late, making noise, you know, stuff like that.
Until one night, that mist came out of nowhere, and it's never gone away since then.
NEAL:
Can you sleep?
[Sighs]
[ Indistinct whispers ]
Neal?
Neal!
NEAL:
What?
[scraping ] [thud]
Run.
Come on, Paulie, this way!
[Crash ]
[ Both panting ]
- [Crash] ' 9h, my God!
[ Rattling ]
[ Monster growling ]
[ Roaring ]
Paulie, that's my old bed!
[ Hissing and roaring ]
[ Loud thuds 1
NEAL:
Aah!
[ Both screaming ]
[ Noise stops]
NEAL:
You okay?
PAULIEI No.
TERRY:
Come on, boys, wake up.
You been asleep all afternoon.
What is all that?
We're gonna try something new tonight, something fun.
Mr. Evans next door has offered to have you guys spend the night.
His boys would love to have you both for a sleepover.
[scoffs] You gotta be fucking joking.
TERRY:
Neal, come on.
Dad, didn't you just finish telling us we need to grow up?
I mean, what the hell?
- Neal, stop it.
- They're expecting you anytime, so whenever you're ready, up you come, boys.
Come on, it's gonna be fun.
Paulie, you're not gonna need that.
Give that to me.
Thank you, honey.
PAULIEI But, Dad...
No, she's right, honey.
Come on.
- Thank you, sweetie.
Here.
- It's all right.
Take this.
Neal, get up.
Here you go.
Have fun, honey.
[Angela sighs]
TERRY:
Be good, please?
[ Knocking ]
NEAL:
Oh.
CARA:
Hey, 9W9-
Hey, Cara.
Is everything okay?
Hey, boys, glad you took me up on my offer to come over.
NEAL:
Well, it just sounded too good to pass up.
Hey, there's little Paul.
Boy, you're really growing up fast, little man.
PAULIE:
Only not fast enough.
[ Mr. Evans laughs]
So you're staying here with my brothers?
Yeah.
I gotta stay close to Paulie, you know.
Yeah, I guess.
[suspenseful music playing on TV]
[ Door opens I
Okay, Robert, Richard, our guests have arrived.
Okay, yeah.
Got it.
Now, uh, they're gonna be staying all night, so you make sure that they, uh, feel like this place is their home, okay?
Excuse me.
PAULIE:
Hey, guys.
RICHARD:
Hey.
Sorry, we don't have any extra chairs.
[sound of laser battle on TV]
Is it cool if we just throw our pillows on your bed?
[ lasers blasting ]
[ Whispering ] Hey, Neal.
You know how you were talking about dead skin cells on our bed and stuff?
Well, do you think they could be on our pillows, too?
I mean, I've had this since I was six.
You think that'd be enough to get it over here?
No.
No way.
[ Indistinct whispers ]
[suspenseful music playing on TV]
What's going on?
I was gonna ask you.
Having fun?
Time of my life.
Sorry it was weird, me being here.
No, it's okay.
I just came over here to say if you get bored with these spazzes, you can come down the hall and find me and I can make us some tea.
We can catch up.
Yeah, that's cool.
Thanks.
I just have to wait till Paulie falls asleep, and...
Cool.
[ Paulie laughs] [water splashing ]
Ohh.
[humming]
Hmm.
[explosions on TV]
NEAL:
It's a nice TV.
RICHARD:
Yeah.
ROBERT:
Thanks.
Is it bigger than the one you guys have?
We don't have a TV.
RICHARD:
What the hell do you mean, you don't have a TV?
NEAL:
We just don't, that's all.
Our dad took it away a few years ago.
ROBERT:
Was it TV that made you go all, you know?
No, it wasn't, because...
It's cool, Paul.
No, actually, nobody knew at the time, so they just got rid of it.
Better safe than sorry.
RICHARD:
So it's true that they took you away to the prison for the criminally insane?
Why do you have to be such a jerk like that?
ROBERT:
We have the right to know who's in our house.
Everybody's talking about it.
They say you disappeared after your mom died.
And you tried to burn the house down.
So maybe I did.
What the hell's with that?
I mean, what happened to your brain?
Do you really want to know?
Neal, let's not talk about that.
Do you two really want to know?
Then pause your movie.
These lights are going off.
[water running]
[ Lights click]
Terry?
Yeah, yeah!
I got it!
God damn it.
[ Lights match ]
[Sighs]
- [ Zap 1 - [cries out]
God!
[Sighs]
[ slam 1
[ gasps ]
Oh, Terry!
What are you doing?
Terry?
Ouch, jeez.
Oh!
[water running]
Oh, my God.
[Sighs] [turns off water]
I tried to kill it with fire.
Give me a break.
The fire took down most of our house, and it even got my mom.
But that's not what's really scary.
What's really scary is that it survived.
What did?
Some crazy guy?
Not a man, not a human.
Something that you can't see and you can't read about.
You can only hear about it or learn about it as it attacks you.
And now Paulie's getting attacked.
Paul, show them.
No, Neal.
Paul, show them.
Whatever!
You could have done that to him!
I would never do that to my brother.
Neal, this is stupid.
Let's just leave.
Yeah, you two go find something fake to hide from.
Yeah, take your crazy somewhere else.
What's the matter, boys?
You afraid of what might be living right next door to you?
Yeah, you and your cuckoo bird fuckin' brother ready to burn our house down.
Paul, what did you say that thing felt like when it grabbed you?
He said it felt icy cold and numb like a dead arm grasping at you.
I never said that.
You feel your body start to fall asleep.
That's how it likes its food, immobile, but still alive.
It attacks you while you sleep.
If you move, if you make a sound, if you get too close... [ indistinct whispers ]
It's too late for you.
Yeah, right.
If you believe that, you're even crazier than anyone could guess.
I wouldn't wish believing in this on my worst fucking enemy, including you two.
Neal?
Paul, come on, what is it?
Look at their floor.
[ Indistinct whispers ]
Wh-what's this stuff?
Fog?
Hey, is this some kind of a joke?
GUYS, guys, Shh!
Uh, it's just mist from outside.
Knock it off!
Don't talk!
Guys, stop!
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.

I'm going after my brother!
Cara, run!
Okay, it's just me.
[ Knocking ]
_ Dad' " Dad!

- Dad!
- Dad!
It's us!
What the hell's going--
NEAL:
Close the door!
What the hell's going on, you two?
Were you guys just in here five minutes ago?
No, Dad!
We have to get out of this house!
We have to leave right now!
Was one of you walking around all wrapped up in a sheet or not, damn it?
No, no, no!
That's the thing that's after us!
You guys are just little monsters!
I've done nothing but try to be nice to you!
Angela!
We're sorry, but you have to listen to us now!
- Listen to you?
How can I...
- We have to get out of this house!
- We have to leave right now!
- Listen to you?

I can't, Neal!
The power's off!
ANGELA:
Oh, my God!
- It's okay.
- [Angela crying ]
It's okay, I'm here.
It got Dad!
- ANGELA:
Oh, my God.
- I know.
It's not afraid of us, Neal.
It's not afraid.
It's not gonna get us!
Angela, are you okay?
What is that thing?
We need to get out of this house right now!
We need to move quickly and quietly and get out the front door.
There's more lights by the street.
I'm gonna open the door, and then we're gonna move.
Angela, you first, then you, Paulie, then me.
Get ready.
[ Door opens I
NEAL:
Paulie, look out!
Aah!

Take me!
ANGELA:
Paulie!
[sobbing ]
Paulie!
Oh, my God!
Angela, listen to me!
Listen to me, please!
This thing has been after me for two years.
If it wanted Paulie, it would have taken him a long time ago.
It just wants me.
It's using Paulie as bait to get to me.
But if I don't go after him now, it's gonna be too late.
No, no, Neal, no!
No, I think I can find a way to get to it, but I--I need your help, please.
Angela, I can't do this without you.
I need you.
I need your help.
ANGELA:
Okay, okay, okay.
What do you want me to do?
Get some rope.
Okay, Angela, I'm gonna do this.
Come here.
[crying 1
Good luck, sweetheart.
Come back to me, okay?
Oh, and, Neal... no matter what happens,
I will not let go of this fucking rope!
You hear me?
Go, go, hurry!

PAULIE:
I can't believe it!
I told you we were in this shit together, didn't I?
Where are we, Neal?
I don't know.
Why are we in hell?
What did we do wrong?
We're not, Paulie.
We're still alive, and I need you to keep it together with me, okay?
Angela's still got the other end of this back in the bedroom.
She's not gonna let go.
[crying ] Dad's dead.
He's gone.
Yeah, Paulie, he's gone.
But we're gonna live to remember him just like Mom.

[ Knife zings]
Come on, Paulie!
Hurry, hurry!
Look, Paulie, there's the rope.
You can reach it, all right?
- I'm gonna hold you up!
- No, no!
I can't reach that!
Paulie, you can do this, okay?
I need you to do this!
NEAL:
Unh!
Come on, Paulie!

TERRY:
Neal?
Neal, come on, wake up.
Hey, come on, kid, get up.
We're almost home.
[ Gasps ]
How long was I out?
All the way from the airport, about three hours.
What, didn't you sleep last night?
Looks about the same around here.
Yeah,yeah.
The, um... snow just all came off last week.
It was real nice.
You would've...
You would've liked it.
Yeah.
Too bad I had to miss it then.
So I guess it's a lot, uh... a lot warmer in Florida, huh?
Depends on what you mean by warm.
See you still got that mumbling thing.
I don't know.
You see, Aunt Sara didn't seem to care if I talked or not.
Actually, Sara cared a lot.
Could've fooled me.
Really?
[ laughs ] Really
You know, kid, when someone takes your ass in and doesn't kick it out after two years, that's 'cause they actually give a shit.
And she didn't want you gone, if that's what you think, either, okay?
It's 'cause the new lady wants to meet me, right?
So you did read the letters I sent you then.
Yeah.
Well, I didn't know one way or the other, you know.
Response would have been nice.
I had some, but they weren't very nice.
What does Paulie think of her?
Paulie thinks the world of her.
Which is one of the reasons why I decided to move forward with her.
And one of the big reasons why she wants to get to know you.
How is Paulie?
He's fine.
He's good.
[ People conversing ]
- TERRY: [whispers ] Aw, shit.
- NEAL:
Dad?
I'm sorry.
Come on.
It's gonna be all right.
Come on.
- [guests clapping ]
- TERRY:
Hey.
It was Angela's idea.
I'm gonna love her.
Hey, come on, this is important to her, all right?
So just try and remember what a smile is and slap it on your face for a few minutes, please?
ANGELA: [gasps] Ohh!
[laughs]
Oh, my!
Oh, my!
Oh, so nice to finally meet you, honey!
TERRY:
This is Angela, obviously.
ANGELA:
Oh, welcome home.
I'm Angela.
Oh, so nice to see you.
You know, you must be very hungry.
You want something to eat, something to drink?
I mean, I've made plenty of... [voice becomes distorted ]
...in person.
You really are a cutie!
- Oh!
- Where's Paulie?
Yeah, where is your youngest, Hausman?
I figured he'd be out here dancing for joy to have Neal back.
TERRY:
Oh.
Uh, well, you know, Paul's, uh...
Taking a nap, actually.
Yeah, he's had a little fever recently, and he's just getting over it.
TERRY:
You know, we just want to keep him rested for school tomorrow.
Hey, Neal, you remember me, right?
Mr. Evans.
Hey, kept an eye on your dad while you were staying at your aunt's.
Made sure he didn't get into any trouble.
Are you sure about that?
I think he snuck in a new wife when you weren't looking.
[laughs]
Yeah, anyway, you remember my boys, Richard and Roger?
Hey, guys.
They've been talking nonstop about you ever since they heard you were coming back.
Hey, we would love to have you over for our own little welcome back.
You know, you and your brother can come over for dinner, you can stay the night, we'll hang out.
- It'll be great.
- Thanks.
I'm gonna go tell Paulie.
MR. EVANS:
All right, great.
Great to see you...
Neal.
CARA:
Neal?
Hey, Cara.
I'm sorry I left without saying good-bye.
We just left, like, overnight.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I never got the chance to say sorry about, you know, what happened.
Thanks.
Hey, Cara?
Gonna marry that nut job?
You better keep him away from matches.
Shut up!
I'm sorry.
My brothers are idiots.
It's okay.
My brother's inside, so I should go.
Cool.
It's good seeing you, Neal.
It's gorgeous.
[thud]
[ Rapid breathing ]
Paulie?
Paulie?
Paulie!
Paulie!
Paulie?

[creaking ]
Paulie, Jesus Christ!
You really scared me, buddy.
You're not Neal.
No, of course, I am.
It's really me, Paulie.
Prove it.
Okay.
Well, Dad, probably flipped out when he found out about these, right?
It pretended to be you so many times.
Paulie, don't talk like that.
TERRY:
Hey, what the hell's going on in here?
God damn it!
Paulie, what the hell you doing up here?
How many times do I have to tell you not to go through these boxes?
What, 2,000 times?
- [Terry shouting ]
- Terry, Honey?
Is everything okay?
[shouting continues]
Sorry, excuse me.
What'd you think, Neal's back, you get to do whatever the hell you want?
Is that it?
I'm sorry, Dad.
- Dad?
- What?
Just hold on a second.
What do you want?
You want Neal gone?
You want him going back to Florida?
- Is that it?
- Dad, come on!
What the hell are you thinking, Paul?
What's going on?
This goddamn party's over, Angela.
I want everybody out of my house right now.
Everybody gone!
Now!
Okay!
Okay, honey, just listen to me, okay?
Move your car.
You're blocking some people in.
You have to move your car.
Just take it easy, honey.
Fine.
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
How about you, Neal?
I'm great, Angela.
- Listen, um...
- [ money crinkling ]
Why don't you, uh, just take this?
Get out of the house and go and be brothers for a little bit, okay?
Be back by 6:00 for dinner, all right?
Thank you.
You're welcome, honey.
Be careful.
Six o'clock!
God.
NEAL:
Aah!
[Paulie laughing]
Wow, Neal, you're here!
That's right, dude.
I'm here for good.
Feels like it's been forever.
I know, man.
I can't believe how big you got.
I thought you were gonna be a midget the rest of your life.
So how was Florida with Aunt Sara?
Aunt Sara home-schooled me and put me in therapy, so I sat around and listened to how crazy I was for a while.
[laughs]
What?
I miss something?
No, it's just funny how sometimes a crazy person is the only one who gets it right.
Gets it right?
You're not crazy, Neal.
You never were.
[tapping on table]
You can smoke if you need to.
I can't smoke in here.
No, I just mean around me.
I don't mind.
Thanks.
I think I'm gonna quit.
I have enough problems already.
I really missed this.
You know, this is the coolest place in town.
Well, what did you miss more, this place or me?
You jerk.
I was just about to say you.
Hey, guys, how's it going?
Hi.
Hi.
Haven't seen you in forever.
Thought my best customer left for another diner.
Well, um, there isn't one.
This is the best in town.
[ laughs ] Listen to that.
So, you used to get the Reuben?
- Uh-huh.
- Two, please.
Right on it.
So you have a girlfriend?
No, no.
You sure?
I mean, there's gotta be like ten girls after you right now.
Well, um, I kind of like this one girl.
[fading and distorting ] She sits right next to me in... [ inaudible]
[ Muffled ] Neal?
Whoa!
Neal?
Neal!
[sound returns to normal ]
Hey, let me ask you something.
Have you seen this before?
I don't want to talk about that.
NEAL:
It's okay.
It's just me talking to you, okay?
There's nobody else but us.
I found that sketchbook a while back, yeah.
I went through your boxes a few times just, you know, 'cause it made me think of you,
- and...
- And you looked inside?
Yeah.
Is that what you mean by saying that I'm not crazy?
You think that you've been seeing something like this?
At night, every night.
Who knows about this?
You do.
Only you would ever believe it's happening again.
But you didn't tell Dad?
Angela?
No.
Well, they know I haven't been sleeping, but I don't talk about it.
They just think it's me missing you or school, and I just agree with them.
And you think you saw me sometimes?
It's one of the ways it tries to get me.
I remembered you talking about visions you'd have at night and Dad saying you've got an overactive imagination.
Why was all my stuff boxed up in your room, Paulie?
Well, when you got sent away,
I got kind of sad, so Dad packed up all your stuff and moved me in.
He thought it would help.
Oh, shit.
Yeah, it didn't.
So you've been sleeping in my room this whole time?
Well, I go in there every night, but I don't sleep.
Neal... you believe me, right?
Okay.
Ooh.
Phew!
Paulie, what a mess.
See, is there anything else?
Nope.
[rumbling]
[ Gasps ]
Damn it.
[ slam 1
[ loud banging ]
Oh!
[gasping ]
Okay.
[gasping ]
Oh!
Oh!
[ Neal speaking indistinctly]
This was really close, too.
[quietly] Cara.
[door bell jingles]
What is it, Neal?
Two Reubens!
Best in town, right, big guy?
NEAL: [ muttering ] Oh, my God.
Hey, Neal.
Wow, you've been back for two hours and you're already at Melanie's.
Heh.
So how was your party?
Hey, it was, uh...
It was not much.
I mean, it was fine.
It was...
Well, well, well, if it isn't the firebug?
You know, I heard that your dad had to send you away to keep you out of jail.
SECOND BOY:
Yeah, didn't something happen to your mom?
Did you do that, too?
You can't believe everything you hear.
He got sent away to protect him from me.
That's right, I'm his brother, Paulie.
I don't remember what happened that night.
When I came to the next morning, he was halfway across the country, and I was in a straitjacket.
What the hell are you talking about?
You're like three.
Mm-hmm.
That's how I get away with it.
Let's get outta here.
[laughs]
You seem like you came out of everything okay.
Better than ever, baby.
Wow.
So, Neal, sorry about that.
I'll see you around, I guess.
Yeah.
NEAL:
So... from the foot of the bed or the side, most often?
Definitely the side.
Any idea what time?
Not really.
It's when it's dark and late... really late.
Any contact?
What do you mean?
Like talking, messages, or...?
I don't think so.
What does it do?
It reaches.
[ Indistinct whispers ]
Dinner, boys.
Come on.
TERRY:
It's very good, dear.
ANGELA:
I see the salad is very popular.
- It is.
- Mm-hmm.
TERRY:
I cut mean vegetables.
[Angela laughs]
Oh.
Isn't this wonderful?
We're finally all here.
So where did you wind up going?
[silverware clanks]
Oh!
ANGELA:
Stop that.
Melanie's.
I love that place.
It's such a great idea.
Is that where your appetite went, Neal?
- Paulie?
Stop that.
- Enough.
ANGELA:
You're not tossing food.
No, I didn't eat my sandwich, either.
You want me to cook you something?
- You sure?
- No, no.
No, like a soufflé, you know.
[laughs]
I'd like to see that.
So where's Neal gonna sleep?
Well, Angela and I talked about that a little bit, and, um, you know, Paulie's in your old room, so we thought maybe you'd be okay trying something a little different.
I made a bed for you in Paulie's old room.
I hope that's okay.
Paulie's room.
That's great, considering that all-- all my shit is in there.
[school bell rings]
So nice to see many of your happy faces here supporting theater in the schools.
Maybe that'll send the school board a message, huh?
Well, you might have noticed that our turnout for this year's school play is a little light.
You can thank your parents for responding so well to my original piece I wrote,
"Barry Bonds:
Hero or Cheater?"
Undaunted, I'm gonna move on to my next project, which will be a lot of fun.
We're gonna do "The Crucible, the Musical," and... [ music] [dialogue inaudible]
[ Spotlight clicks ]
Wake up!
Aah!
[echoing ]
Aah!
Aah!
Look, I get that you need some time to readjust, Neal.
Okay, I do, but I got you two staring off into nothing.
You're not eating.
You sure as shit don't care about Angela's feelings.
And you know what I don't want, boys?
I don't want today to become every other day.
We used to be normal.
Do you remember that?
We're gonna be again.
We're gonna be, but it's up to you boys.
Paulie?
Angela and I have decided we're gonna keep you out of school for a little while.
No.
No, no, no, you can't do that!
Why?
Why?
Are you actually asking why?
Should we ask all your--your classmates who watched you melt down today why, Paulie?
Now, look, the--the priority here is to get you guys both back to earth and back in school in a week, and we are gonna do it!
But before I can enroll you, Neal,
I need you to do some things for me, son.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
Like grow the fuck up, for one.
Like become a man!
You're were only supposed to go down to Sara's for a couple of months, but she wanted you there because she thought it was helping.
But if two years down there is not getting you to grow up, then I'm gonna do it!
Your ass is getting a job!
Is getting a job gonna make me a man?
Well, it's sure as shit gonna help!
Uh, Neal, honey?
I think what your dad is trying to say is that [fading and distorting ] Paulie needs a role model.
[voice becomes indistinct]
[ Indistinct whispering ]
ANGELA: [ muffled ] Are you okay?
[door bangs]
- Neal!
Are you listening?
- Yes!
Yes?
Okay, then what did we just say?
That I'm still crazy!
No, that is not what we just said!
That's all that anybody thinks!
I'm not even getting a chance!
You don't get chances, kid!
You earn them, and you're not doing it!
Well, maybe I should have just died with Mom!
You two go to bed.
Angela's making you act completely...
TERRY:
Stop it, Neal.
Please just stop talking, all right?
Now, you two brought this on yourselves.
This door's gonna stay locked.
You gotta go to the bathroom, you knock.
Otherwise, all I want to hear is silence.
Sleep tight!
Don't start with me.
Maybe we should consider outside help.
No.
We've done that, and it hasn't done jack shit.
We are doing this ourselves.
But something is going on here, Terry.
Yes, Angela, there is, and we're gonna put a stop to it.
NEAL:
You sleep with the light on?
PAULIE:
At night, yeah.
NEAL:
For how long?
PAULIE:
About a year now.
NEAL:
But it helps?
PAULIE:
Mm-mmm.
[ Floor creaks ]
Hey, let's try something, you and me.
Turn the light off.
Neal, what are you gonna do?
[whispers ] Hey.
[ Soft snarl ]
Hey!
[ Loud roar]
If we don't make any noise, it doesn't know we're here.
What about when we move?
Here, let me try something.
[floor creaking ]
[ Monster snarling ]
So we don't move, we don't make any sound, it's not gonna try anything, right?
- [ Roaring ]
- Paulie, he's right behind you, man!
[ Roar echoes and fades ]
[Sighs]
How close did it come to me?
Um, not that close.
Still had half the room to go.
A couple of feet.
We're all right with the lights on, I think.
Yeah.
Wonder what Angela tells Dad.
What do you think of her?
She's kind of cool.
Seriously?
Does she even have a job?
She's a substitute teacher.
Good for her.
Substitute teacher, substitute wife, substitute mom.
She's got it all figured out.
Neal, you should give her a chance.
Does Dad ever talk about Mom?
Never, except when he'd talk about you.
Does he blame me?
He blames everybody.
' Hey, Neal?
'Hmm?
Want to see how I get to bed?
Yeah.
[ Loud roar]
[ Roar fades ]
So I was thinking about how we'd keep you off the floor tonight, Neal.
I was just gonna stay up all night.
Not like I haven't done it before.
Well, maybe you can sleep on the dresser.
I mean, better than no sleep.
Worth a shot.
Just run, Neal.
You're gonna make it mad.
[ Loud roar]
[ Roaring ]
I think I made it mad anyway.
Well, it's a lot noisier than it's ever been before.
It remembers me.
It's been a long two years, Neal.
I'm glad you haven't changed.
What happened to you today?
I fell asleep in class, and I woke up screaming.
Why didn't you say anything, man?
Well, 'cause I kind of like just hanging out without talking about screaming.
You ready to stop screaming?
Yeah.
[Sighs]
[ Indistinct whispers ]
[object banging and rattling ]
Paulie?
Paulie!
Paulie, if you're sleeping, wake up!
Wake up, man, there's something happening!
PAULIE:
Yeah, this stuff.
I don't remember this!
What the fuck is this, man?
Usually happens after I've already fallen asleep.
[ Bangs and crashes]
What's happening?
!
I don't know, Paulie!
Hang on!
[clattering ]
[ Noise stops]
[ Indistinct whispers ]
[Crash ] [objects clatter]
Dad!
NEAL:
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, leave him alone!
Dad!
Dad!
What are you doing?
[ Paulie groans]
- NEAL:
Get off him, Dad!
- PAULIE:
Dad, what--
- NEAL:
Stop!
- Dad!
- [ Monster Terry growling ]
- PAULIE:
Neal!
No!
Dad!
Dad, stop!
NEAL:
Dad!
Dad!
- [ Hissing and snarling ]
- PAULIE:
No, no!
[growling]
Aah!
[wincing ]
ANGELA:
Does it hurt?
PAULIE:
Mm-hmm.
Do you want to tell me exactly what happened, honey?
No.
Paulie, you know, I can put medicine on your bruises in the middle of the night, but the only way I can truly help you is if I can stop this from happening in the first place.
Paulie, honey, I love you, and I really want to help you, but you have to trust me.
Please trust me.
Okay, you have two ways of answering this for me.
Either you did this, or he did this to himself.
- Which one is it?
- No.
Which answer, Neal?
Which answer is gonna make us less miserable?
You don't really think that I would ever do that to him, do you?
So he did it to himself?
I didn't say that.
God damn it, Neal!
Knock this shit off, please!
'Cause I don't think you two can survive another day!
I don't think I can survive another day of this!
I know.
This is not the way to protect your little brother.
You know, he doesn't need you making excuses for him.
He needs you being a man, standing up for him.
I'm trying.
Dad thinks you did it.
Really?
Angela thinks you did it.
She does?
If she says that to my face, I'm gonna call her a bitch to hers.
Well, then that'd be the first time you talked to her.
Did it hurt when it grabbed you?
No, it...
It felt worse.
Like what'd it feel like?
It was cold and...
and numb, and it felt like I was...
Falling asleep?
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
Okay, boys, it's late.
Let's try this again, shall we?
ANGELA:
Come on, honey, let's get you back to bed.
Honey, come here.
I'm really worried about you.
How can I make this better?
PAULIE:
Can I have my sleeping bag?
ANGELA:
Sure, I'll go get your sleeping...
TERRY:
No.
Paulie's sleeping in a bed like a normal person, and this door is staying locked.
The sooner you two get past this phase... [ unscrewing light bulb]
The sooner we can go on living our lives.
ANGELA:
What are you doing?
TERRY:
What am I doing?
Normal people sleep in the dark!
So is he!
ANGELA:
It's a little extreme, Terry.
TERRY:
Come on, please?
Come on.
[ Lock clicking ]
PAULIE:
Neal.
NEAL:
Come on.
TERRY:
Boys?
Paulie?
Neal?
Wake up.
Good morning.
You okay?
NEAL:
Yeah, Dad, we're both fine.
TERRY:
Okay, Well, it's...
It's breakfast time.
Come on.
I know.
Thank you, Sam.
I really appreciate it.
Yes, I will.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
They understand.
They're not happy, but they...they get it.
I'm sorry, Ang.
It's okay, honey.
It's not your fault.
[Sighs]
I found Neal in Paulie's room this morning.
- What?
- Snuck in.
Oh, my gosh.
At least they didn't kill each other.
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
I swear to God, Ang, I have no idea what to do.
Did Dad tell you about Mom's grave?
One of his letters had pictures of it.
Yeah, well, she's not there.
No fuckin' way.
I wanted her to stay here, and Dad said it was okay as long as he didn't see it.
So I keep it in here.
[ Sniffles ]
You remember Mom staying in the house after the fire reached the living room?
That night...
I begged her to stay with me so she could see what was under the bed.
She did, and... she died because she believed me.
She was protecting us.
I miss her.
[ Car door closes, engine starts ]
Look, you gotta hold it from the side, too.
Keep your finger on the trigger.
Keep it steady and push forward with your back hand.
In.
You'd have to be pretty close to hurt it with this, right?
Well, yeah.
We'd have to get closer than we've ever been before sooner or later.
[clattering ]
What makes you think we can kill it?
I think it's afraid of us, and it wouldn't be afraid of anything if it couldn't die, Paul.
Would you be?
We're something this thing has never dealt with before.
What?
We're brothers.
Oh, shit.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Uh, Neal, dear?
Let's leave that alone for the time being.
Dad taught me to use it before.
Well, he's not here right now, so, uh, put it down.
I'll be fine.
Put it down, please.
[ Chainsaw thuds ]
Come on, pal.
Paulie?
Sweetheart, please tell me what's going on.
It's not a big deal.
Well, if you can just tell me a little bit, honey, maybe I can, I don't know, somehow help you?
If you want to help him, stay out of his way.
NEAL:
It looks pretty good in there.
PAULIE:
Yeah, not bad for two hours of sleep between us.
We're okay.
Before I got sent away, I used to sleep anywhere I could, like the kitchen, Mom and Dad's room, outside.
I slept in the garage a few times, but it only ever got to me when I would try to sleep in beds.
It's bound to beds.
Why?
I don't know.
I have theories, I guess.
Beds are where people sleep the most, so if it usually strikes when you sleep, it makes sense.
That's where you have the most dreams and nightmares.
Maybe that's what it looks for.
Maybe.
I have another theory, too, but you can't freak out.
Go ahead.
I read once that you shed a lot of dead skin cells in your bed.
Like while you sleep, you know, like, your bed is full of dead skin and pieces of your body.
Maybe it starts by, like, feeding on-- on your dead flesh before it, you know...
PAULIE:
Before that's not good enough anymore.
NEAL:
Yeah.
PAULIE:
You looking at that old Polaroid?
Yeah.
You know about this?
Yeah, I found it after you left.
PAULIE:
So that's what it looks like, right?
That crazy face?
I guess.
I never tried to take another picture after this one, so...
I did.
You did?
Yeah.
I thought that if I could prove it was real then you'd come back sooner, you know.
So I started taking pictures under the bed, staying up late, making noise, you know, stuff like that.
Until one night, that mist came out of nowhere, and it's never gone away since then.
NEAL:
Can you sleep?
[Sighs]
[ Indistinct whispers ]
Neal?
Neal!
NEAL:
What?
[scraping ] [thud]
Run.
Come on, Paulie, this way!
[Crash ]
[ Both panting ]
- [Crash] ' Oh, my God!
[ Rattling ]
[ Monster growling ]
[ Roaring ]
Paulie, that's my old bed!
[ Hissing and roaring ] [loud thuds]
NEAL:
Aah!
[ Both screaming ]
[ Noise stops]
NEAL:
You okay?
PAULIE:
No.
TERRY:
Come on, boys, wake up.
You been asleep all afternoon.
What is all that?
We're gonna try something new tonight, something fun.
Mr. Evans next door has offered to have you guys spend the night.
His boys would love to have you both for a sleepover.
[scoffs] You gotta be fucking joking.
TERRY:
Neal, come on.
Dad, didn't you just finish telling us we need to grow up?
I mean, what the hell?
- Neal, stop it.
- They're expecting you anytime, so whenever you're ready, up you come, boys.
Come on, it's gonna be fun.
Paulie, you're not gonna need that.
Give that to me.
Thank you, honey.
PAULIE:
But, Dad...
No, she's right, honey.
Come on.
- Thank you, sweetie.
Here.
- It's all right.
Take this.
Neal, get up.
Here you go.
Have fun, honey.
[Angela sighs]
TERRY:
Be good, please?
[ Knocking ]
NEAL:
Oh.
CARA:
Hey, guys-
Hey, Cara.
Is everything okay?
Hey, boys, glad you took me up on my offer to come over.
NEAL:
Well, it just sounded too good to pass up.
Hey, there's little Paul.
Boy, you're really growing up fast, little man.
PAULIE:
Only not fast enough.
[ Mr. Evans laughs]
So you're staying here with my brothers?
Yeah.
I gotta stay close to Paulie, you know.
Yeah, I guess.
[suspenseful music playing on TV] [door opens]
Okay, Robert, Richard, our guests have arrived.
Okay, yeah.
Got it.
Now, uh, they're gonna be staying all night, so you make sure that they, uh, feel like this place is their home, okay?
Excuse me.
PAULIE:
Hey, guys.
RICHARD:
Hey.
Sorry, we don't have any extra chairs.
[sound of laser battle on TV]
Is it cool if we just throw our pillows on your bed?
[ lasers blasting ]
[ Whispering ] Hey, Neal.
You know how you were talking about dead skin cells on our bed and stuff?
Well, do you think they could be on our pillows, too?
I mean, I've had this since I was six.
You think that'd be enough to get it over here?
No.
No way.
[ Indistinct whispers ]
[suspenseful music playing on TV]
What's going on?
I was gonna ask you.
Having fun?
Time of my life.
Sorry it was weird, me being here.
No, it's okay.
I just came over here to say if you get bored with these spazzes, you can come down the hall and find me and I can make us some tea.
We can catch up.
Yeah, that's cool.
Thanks.
I just have to wait till Paulie falls asleep, and...
Cool.
[ Paulie laughs] [water splashing ]
Ohh.
[humming]
Hmm.
[explosions on TV]
NEAL:
It's a nice TV.
RICHARD:
Yeah.
ROBERT:
Thanks.
Is it bigger than the one you guys have?
We don't have a TV.
RICHARD:
What the hell do you mean, you don't have a TV?
NEAL:
We just don't, that's all.
Our dad took it away a few years ago.
ROBERT:
Was it TV that made you go all, you know?
No, it wasn't, because...
It's cool, Paul.
No, actually, nobody knew at the time, so they just got rid of it.
Better safe than sorry.
RICHARD:
So it's true that they took you away to the prison for the criminally insane?
Why do you have to be such a jerk like that?
ROBERT:
We have the right to know who's in our house.
Everybody's talking about it.
They say you disappeared after your mom died.
And you tried to burn the house down.
So maybe I did.
What the hell's with that?
I mean, what happened to your brain?
Do you really want to know?
Neal, let's not talk about that.
Do you two really want to know?
Then pause your movie.
These lights are going off.
[water running]
[ Lights click]
Terry?
Yeah, yeah!
I got it!
God damn it.
[ Lights match ]
[Sighs]
- [ Zap 1 - [cries out]
God!
[Sighs] [ slam 1
[ gasps ]
Oh, Terry!
What are you doing?
Terry?
Ouch, jeez.
Oh!
[water running]
Oh, my God.
[Sighs] [turns off water]
I tried to kill it with fire.
Give me a break.
The fire took down most of our house, and it even got my mom.
But that's not what's really scary.
What's really scary is that it survived.
What did?
Some crazy guy?
Not a man, not a human.
Something that you can't see and you can't read about.
You can only hear about it or learn about it as it attacks you.
And now Paulie's getting attacked.
Paul, show them.
No, Neal.
Paul, show them.
Whatever!
You could have done that to him!
I would never do that to my brother.
Neal, this is stupid.
Let's just leave.
Yeah, you two go find something fake to hide from.
Yeah, take your crazy somewhere else.
What's the matter, boys?
You afraid of what might be living right next door to you?
Yeah, you and your cuckoo bird fuckin' brother ready to burn our house down.
Paul, what did you say that thing felt like when it grabbed you?
He said it felt icy cold and numb like a dead arm grasping at you.
I never said that.
You feel your body start to fall asleep.
That's how it likes its food, immobile, but still alive.
It attacks you while you sleep.
If you move, if you make a sound, if you get too close... [ indistinct whispers ]
It's too late for you.
Yeah, right.
If you believe that, you're even crazier than anyone could guess.
I wouldn't wish believing in this on my worst fucking enemy, including you two.
Neal?
Paul, come on, what is it?
Look at their floor.
[ Indistinct whispers ]
Wh-what's this stuff?
Fog?
Hey, is this some kind of a joke?
GUYS, guys, Shh!
Uh, it's just mist from outside.
Knock it off!
Don't talk!
Guys, stop!
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.
[all panting 1
[ roaring ]
Paulie, run!

Don't move!
You're in the light!
As fast as you can, run to your room, turn the light on, and don't come out no matter what you hear!
[crying ] What about you?
I'm going after my brother!
Cara, run!
Okay, it's just me.
[ Knocking ]
_ Dad' " Dad!

- Dad!
- Dad!
It's us!
What the hell's going--
NEAL:
Close the door!
What the hell's going on, you two?
Were you guys just in here five minutes ago?
No, Dad!
We have to get out of this house!
We have to leave right now!
Was one of you walking around all wrapped up in a sheet or not, damn it?
No, no, no!
That's the thing that's after us!
You guys are just little monsters!
I've done nothing but try to be nice to you!
Angela!
We're sorry, but you have to listen to us now!
- Listen to you?
How can I...
- We have to get out of this house!
- We have to leave right now!
- Listen to you?

[ Snorts ]

Angela!
Turn the lights on!
I can't, Neal!
The power's off!
ANGELA:
Oh, my God!
- It's okay.
- [Angela crying ]
It's okay, I'm here.
It got Dad!
- ANGELA:
Oh, my God.
- I know.
It's not afraid of us, Neal.
It's not afraid.
It's not gonna get us!
Angela, are you okay?
What is that thing?
We need to get out of this house right now!
We need to move quickly and quietly and get out the front door.
There's more lights by the street.
I'm gonna open the door, and then we're gonna move.
Angela, you first, then you, Paulie, then me.
Get ready.
[door opens]
NEAL:
Paulie, look out!
Aah!
Aah!

Neal, help!

NEAL:
Take me!
Take me!
ANGELA:
Paulie!
[sobbing ]
Paulie!
Oh, my God!
Angela, listen to me!
Listen to me, please!
This thing has been after me for two years.
If it wanted Paulie, it would have taken him a long time ago.
It just wants me.
It's using Paulie as bait to get to me.
But if I don't go after him now, it's gonna be too late.
No, no, Neal, no!
No, I think I can find a way to get to it, but I--I need your help, please.
Angela, I can't do this without you.
I need you.
I need your help.
ANGELA:
Okay, okay, okay.
What do you want me to do?
Get some rope.
Okay, Angela, I'm gonna do this.
Come here.
[crying 1
Good luck, sweetheart.
Come back to me, okay?
Oh, and, Neal... no matter what happens,
I will not let go of this fucking rope!
You hear me?
Go, go, hurry!

PAULIE:
I can't believe it!
I told you we were in this shit together, didn't I?
Where are we, Neal?
I don't know.
Why are we in hell?
What did we do wrong?
We're not, Paulie.
We're still alive, and I need you to keep it together with me, okay?
Angela's still got the other end of this back in the bedroom.
She's not gonna let go.
[crying ] Dad's dead.
He's gone.
Yeah, Paulie, he's gone.
But we're gonna live to remember him just like Mom.
- [ Monster roars] - [ both screaming ] [growling]
[ Neal screams and grunts]
[ Roaring ]
[ Knife zings]
Come on, Paulie!
Hurry, hurry!
Look, Paulie, there's the rope.
You can reach it, all right?
- I'm gonna hold you up!
- No, no!
I can't reach that!
Paulie, you can do this, okay?
I need you to do this!
NEAL:
Unh!
Come on, Paulie!
- NEAL:
Shit!
- [straining]
Oh, my God!
Oh, honey!
Oh, my God!
It's good to see you!
Oh, Neal!
Oh, God!
Oh, thank...thank you!
[all breathing heavily]
CARA:
Neal!
Oh, my God!
[crying ] They're all dead!
Oh, my God!
[ Loud crash ]
[ Monster roars]
[ Roaring ]
Die!
[snarling ] Come!
[ Roaring ]
[ Chainsaw buzzing ] [growling]
ANGELA:
Oh!
Oh!
- Come on!
- [ chainsaw revs ] [growling]
[ Roaring ]
Die!
Aah!
[grunts]
No, Paulie!
[coughs] [growling]
[Angela sobbing ] [sizzling ] [shrieking ]
PAULIE:
Neal, the ashes!
Mom!
[ Roaring ]
Aaaah!

Unh!

[ Music]
Let's move on.
Donovan, I know that you and Cleo had some words about how much time you've been spending in the library.
So do you want to talk about that?
Yes.
Cleo has been real supportive lately.
He knows that I have to get my law degree so I can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I'm innocent.
They have you on videotape stabbing three people at a Relax The Back store.
I ain't said it was going to be easy.
Now, Cleo, I know you were angry about not spending enough time with Donovan.
You want to tell us why you were able to let that go?
I don't want to, but I have to.
Donovan, you know how we said that if one of us gets out before the other that we would kill ourselves?
I-I'd like to revisit that.
What?
I'm getting out today.
I got a letter last week... something about prison overcrowded.
What?
!
- You knew for a week?
!
- Donovan, Donovan, you're obviously hurt.
You need to express to Cleo how that makes you feel.
Otherwise, hurt turns to anger, anger turns to rage, and rage turns to... holy crap!
No, no, it's all right.
Why didn't you tell me?
!
I thought you might get mad.
Well, he did kill three people already for less, so good call.
- I'm so sorry, monster.
- No!
I'm not your monster any more.
You broke my heart, Cleo.
I could have traded you for Jell-O and I didn't.
- Here you go, bro.
- Ahh!
How about now?
Now's good.
Okay, I know it goes without saying, but I'm going to go ahead and say it.
We never hand the angry man a second chair.
you got to do something to distract the pitcher.
Wink at her like maybe you know something she doesn't.
Like this generation will be the first to do worse than their parents and we're all doomed for failure?
- Just try to hit the ball and have fun.
- Gotcha.
This tournament's making me nuts.
I don't even know how Sam's going to deal with the bus ride there with her OCD and everything.
She's terrified of truck stop bathrooms.
Hey, I want my teenage daughter terrified of truck stop bathrooms.
Good point.
Hey, while we have a second, will you look at something?
It's a new business I'm looking into.
- Green Goddesses?
- It's a maid-service franchise that hires hot maids and only uses green products.
Hot maids?
Where are you going to find beautiful women who want to clean toilets?
Men have been looking for that for thousands of years.
They help you.
You give Green Goddesses $10,000 and they give you the logo, the cleaning supplies, and the short skirts.
It's a no-brainer.
So for 10 grand you get Lysol and a logo of a dolphin with tits and a mop?
First of all, it's a mermaid with an eco-friendly dolphin's head.
And why do you have to be so negative?
Remember Downward Dog, the yoga studio... for dogs?
- Cleo.
- It's Derek on the outside.
Hi, I don't think we've met.
Uh, this is Derek, an old ballplayer buddy.
This is my ex-wife Jennifer.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Why would you ex this?
Well, who says it was his idea?
I don't recognize you.
Where did you and Charlie play?
He played at Akron.
Hell of a ballplayer.
Switch-hitter.
Mom, let's go to the bus.
We're going to be late.
- All right.
- Bye, kiddo.
Bye.
Nice meeting you.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I went to see my wife.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You have a wife?
I'm PG, man.
Prison gay.
What happens in jail stays in jail.
So what happened with your wife?
She said she was going to wait for me, but there's a Jack in the Box where my house was.
She moved to San Diego with some Chinese guy, and they got three kids.
And a damn dog named Cleo.
Wow, that really sucks.
So can I get you some water or something?
- You know why I'm here.
- For water?
My parole officer said if I don't find an address by tonight, I got to go to a county facility.
I need a place to stay.
Look, look, Derek, I would love to help you, but I got to keep our relationship strictly professional.
But if you want to come here for anger therapy classes,
I'd be more than happy to do that.
- When's the next session?
- Tomorrow, 2:00 PM.
Great!
I'm going to wait on the couch.
Everybody, this is Derek.
Derek is a former member of my prison group.
I want to remind you all that, as always, everyone's private life is confidential.
- Nothing leaves this room.
- Unless he steals it.
Okay, let's just pick up where we left off last time.
- Patrick?
- Right, so...
I was at this restaurant having dinner with a friend, and this prick next to me says that I'm too loud and threatens to call the manager.
I got something like that.
I shared a cell with a Russian gangster and he said I talked too loud and if I didn't stop, he'd tie my balls around my neck.
He called it a "Moscow Bow Tie."
Look how much we all have in common.
- And what happened, Patrick?
- Never mind.
Lacey, how are things going with your mom?
She's insane.
If I want to keep getting my allowance, I have to get a job.
I thought parents were supposed to fund you unconditionally.
That's love you unconditionally.
They don't let dogs do that.
Well, she gives my dog an allowance, too, and he doesn't have to get a job.
I feel you, girl.
Parents can be frustrating.
Mine would burn me with cigarettes.
You learn to stop reaching across the table for food real quick.
Ed, I'm assuming you're going to pass on the story about the gum wrappers?
Uh, yeah.
You know, Prison-break Jones over there is not the only guy who has had a tough life.
I'm sorry, forgot your name.
My mother burned me, too, with unending, subtle critiques of my clothes.
You may not see the scars, but they're there.
Well, I think we can all take a lesson from this.
When you think your problems are really big, remember, at least no one is tying your junk around your neck.
Don't quote me on that.
- Hey, Derek.
How are you doing?
- Good, good.
Charlie's letting me crash for a few days, so I thought I'd help out a little.
Well, don't mind me.
I'm just going to borrow.
Charlie's washing machine for a couple of loads.
Mine keeps lighting up "unbalanced."
I think it's making fun of me.
You know what?
Let me get that for you.
I'm doing Charlie's and mine anyway.
Jennifer:
Wow, thank you.
Don't mind the granny panties.
They're not mine.
They just came with the basket.
If your washing machine's broke, I'm pretty handy.
- I can take a look at it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
That'd be great.
That'd be amazing.
Thank you.
Why is he doing your laundry?
Because he offered, like a gentleman, Charlie.
Is there a Mrs. Gentleman?
Wow.
Okay, I...
I should probably tell you something about Derek.
Not a ballplayer.
He was a member of the prison group I volunteer with.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Hard-core criminal. 12 years behind bars, grand theft auto, repeat offender, the whole package.
So he's good-looking, not afraid of commitment, and always drives a nice new car?
- Don't go there, Jen.
- Pardon me?
Don't get involved with this guy, Jen.
Do you really think I'm dumb enough to date a felon?
Why do you always second-guess everything I do?
Are you sure you want to ask me that question?
Why wouldn't...
hey, quit it.
As soon as you write my alimony check, give me some of that pizza and he's done with my laundry,
I'm out of here.
I can take care of myself.
Did you TiVo "Project Runway" for me?
- Yeah.
- I'm going to go watch it.
- Hi.
- Hey.
See that guy down there?
He's my patient.
- Oh, is he the one that can't get mad?
- Yeah, we'll see.
He thinks he's here because I'm setting him up on a date, but I want you to do everything you can to get him to the breaking point.
How about I marry him?
No, we're trying to get him mad, not kill him.
- Oh, I'm wet.
- Oh, I am so sorry.
I hope those weren't your good clothes.
No, I'm meeting a girl, but it's okay.
It was an honest mistake.
Oops.
That wasn't as honest.
Maybe I'll just have nuts.
Well, at least now you've got some where yours ought to be.
What's your name?
And I feel bad that Jen walked away thinking I called her stupid.
- Do you think Jen's stupid?
- No, no.
I mean, you and I, we have degrees, we read books, we're academic smart.
Jen is more...
"I'm going up the down escalator,
"I'm not getting anywhere, so I should probably turn around" smart.
You know, you might want to get down off your high horse there for a minute, buddy.
I know Jennifer, and while she's no Rhodes scholar, she's probably smarter than you are in a lot of ways.
I know one way she's not.
I know what Rhodes scholar means.
You know, there's lots of different types of intelligence, Charlie.
I bet, if I wanted to, I could make you feel dumb.
For example, spatial visual intelligence.
Move only two matches to make a decagon.
That's easy.
Define decagon.
10-sided figure.
And don't worry, even though you're dumb,
I still think you're pretty, and we're having sex tonight.
What's this?
You have to make a 10-sided figure moving only two matches.
I can do it moving one.
- There.
- Oh, my God.
She's a genius.
And if I do this and this... stick man with a boner.
Might have been a fluke.
You're right.
You're right.
I can be the bigger man.
I'm going to go apologize.
I'll meet you back at your place later.
- Okay.
- And for the record... stick man with a coke problem.
Stick man after a car accident... because of his coke problem.
Stick man living in a tent because he lost his house because of the car accident and his coke problem.
Who's the genius now?
Just a minute.
Oh, I'm sorry, I should have called.
Yeah, that would have been a good idea.
I was driving home and I thought,
I owe you an apology.
You're not stupid.
You're a smart person and you know exactly what you're doing.
Baby, if that's the food, just bring it to bed.
I'm getting ready to massage.
Oh, damn.
You don't answer the door when your nails are we but you're in the middle of a prison rub-down and it's "Come on in."
How stupid can one woman be?
I know this game.
Sarah Palin, Nancy Pelosi, or Jennifer your ex-wife.
- She's sleeping with Derek.
- I know it's unpopular, but I'm going to go with the liberal, Pelosi.
- Okay, pants off.
- I told her not to and then she got mad at me for assuming she'd do something stupid, and then what does she do?
The gay felon.
Did she even know he was gay?
Yeah, she knows.
She's a big girl.
She takes precautions.
I'm worried about the felon part.
Yeah, that's a reasonable concern.
Okay, I'll get the shirt.
I don't want this guy in my life.
He was in prison.
He steals things and hides them in his ass.
Hey, Charlie, where are your candlesticks?
I don't know.
Why don't you check my ex-wife's boyfriend's ass?
Charlie, you're upset.
We have a session tomorrow and we'll talk about this, so hold that thought.
But right now hold this and press the blue button three times.
One, two, three.
She knows what she's doing.
She's only doing this to piss me off.
- Whoa.
- Exactly.
I don't know how far she'll take this.
Are you listening to me?
I can do two things at once.
If she's doing this just to piss you off, then the worst thing you can do... is show her you're upset.
Okay, I can't do two things at once.
Okay, you know what... just don't do anything and she'll stop acting crazy.
You're right.
She's just trying to get a reaction out of me.
- I'm not going to feed into that.
- Good.
Now, I need all of your attention.
I just want you to put all your efforts into pleasing me.
- What?
I just push the button again?
- Yeah.
- Am I actually a part of this?
- Shh.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I made breakfast.
I feel bad about yesterday.
Oh, it's all good.
You can kick it with Jen.
She's not my bitch no mo'.
She's just my baby mama.
- Are you trying to talk black?
- A little bit.
That's just how Charlie do.
Yeah, well, Charlie, don't.
You know, I'm proud of you.
I mean, in group, you tell us to let go of our anger and you do it.
You really walk the walk.
- Thank you.
- Because under normal circumstances, a guy comes into your house, eats your food, sleeps in your bed, oils up your ex-wife, a guy's got to get upset about that.
- Well, I always say lead by example.
- Yeah.
- Could you pass the butter, please?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
That's my butter!
You didn't ask!
You just took it!
And now you're going to smear it all over your toast right in front of me.
If you don't want me using your butter,
- all you got to do is say so.
- I don't want you using my butter.
It sure seems like a waste of good butter.
We're not talking about butter.
I know, I know, I know.
I'm going to put some honey on those biscuits.
- That's cool, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Honey is just honey.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.
Hey, Boo.
Ready to head out to the beach?
Yeah, uh, about that...
- Can I talk to you out on the porch for a second?
- Okay.
Mmm, honey and biscuits.
- Ah!
- You son of a bitch!
- You told Derek to stop seeing me.
- What do you care?
This isn't about Derek.
You're just seeing him to piss me off.
You're so full of yourself, it's unbelievable!
I can't just like him?
- He's a felon.
- He's an ex-felon, and I'm a 40-year-old single mother living in Los Angeles.
I had to open up the dating pool.
I now accept bartenders, pirates, and magicians.
Look, I was in jail for a long time, but I earned my GED.
And I'm only two tests away from becoming a certified VCR repairman.
So...
See?
You always have to control everything that I do.
That's over.
From now on, I'm doing whatever I want to do and you have no say about it.
I don't agree with anything you just said.
And I don't care.
Starting now, we're just a normal divorced couple.
We're not friends.
When we run into each other at the market, it's weird.
If you're five minutes late dropping off Sam, we've got a problem.
Oh, and by the way, Green Goddesses... the woman who bought the LA franchise just got a boatload of contracts.
She's cleaning up.
And I meant to say st like that!
You're not supposed to be friends with your ex-wife anyway.
That's against nature.
I'm not saying it was easy, but it was definitely worth it.
And as a person, I like Jen.
My ex-wife and I hate each other.
- What about your kids?
- We hate them, too.
What the hell is...
I knew this guy was trouble.
Call the police.
Not every black man running has committed a crime.
They're right behind me!
I just stole a car!
You're making me look bad in front of my friend.
I'm going back to prison, Charlie.
I tried to make it work, but I miss Donovan.
Now I got to go get arrested in San Bernardino so I go back to the same prison.
No, this is crazy.
What about Jennifer?
Oh, your ex-wife is a beautiful woman, but it just didn't feel right.
I miss my monster.
I gotta go, Charlie.
I hope you're not disappointed in me.
Well, it would've been nice if you'd have made your life work on the outside, but...
I got very little time and you're going on a bit.
Oh, I told Jennifer and she's a mess.
You might want to check in on her.
I'll see you next week in group.
That's great.
Now you're here to rub it in my face?
- Jennifer...
- No, no, no.
You did it, Charlie.
Once again, you proved you're smarter than me.
Smarter than I.
But that doesn't matter.
That's not why I'm here.
What's wrong with me?
I just...
I can't find it.
What?
- I don't make good decisions.
- Yes, you do.
You dumped me.
That was mostly my mom and my sisters, a couple of psychics.
Look, you're not the one who has to change anything.
I think you're right.
I do try to control you.
I don't know, maybe it's just my way of making sure you still need me.
Or maybe you're just a butt-hole.
We can talk semantics all day.
What's important is that we stay friends.
It's been great for Sam and it's been great for me.
All right.
- But no more judging, okay?
- You got it.
Now, Hold Onto Your Hat.
- What?
- No, that's the company name.
It's a little Velcro strap that attaches your hat to your collar.
Thousands of hats are lost every year due to rainstorms, boats, and amusement park rides.
No one has an exact number, but the financial loss reaches well into the millions.
- What do you think?
- I think...
I mean, nobody likes losing a hat.
That's amazing!
That's our motto!
"Nobody likes losing a hat."
I...
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.
It's... it's a horrible idea.
You'll lose everything.
- That was just a test.
- No, it wasn't.
Okay, I'm into them for $1,000.
God, I need help.
It's okay.
We'll try and finance some kind of a twelve-step franchise anonymous program.
I bet there isn't one.
- We can start that.
- Shut up.
Let's move on.
Donovan, I know that you and Cleo had some words about how much time you've been spending in the library.
So do you want to talk about that?
Yes.
Cleo has been real supportive lately.

You want to tell us why you were able to let that go?
I don't want to, but I have to.
Donovan, you know how we said that if one of us gets out before the other that we would kill ourselves?
I-I'd like to revisit that.

No, no, it's all right.

Well, he did kill three people already for less, so good call.
- I'm so sorry, monster.
- No!
I'm not your monster any more.
You broke my heart, Cleo.
I could have traded you for Jell-O and I didn't.
- Here you go, bro.
- Ahh!
- ( Cleo crying )
- How about now?
Now's good.
Okay, I know it goes without saying, but I'm going to go ahead and say it.
We never hand the angry man a second chair.
Now remember, when you approach the dish, you got to do something to distract the pitcher.
Wink at her like maybe you know something she doesn't.
Like this generation will be the first to do worse than their parents and we're all doomed for failure?
- Just try to hit the ball and have fun.

- Oh, is he the one that can't get mad?
- Yeah, we'll see.
He thinks he's here because I'm setting him up on a date, but I want you to do everything you can to get him to the breaking point.
How about I marry him?
No, we're trying to get him mad, not kill him.
- Oh, I'm wet.
- Oh, I am so sorry.
I hope those weren't your good clothes.
No, I'm meeting a girl, but it's okay.
It was an honest mistake.
Oops.
That wasn't as honest.
Maybe I'll just have nuts.
Well, at least now you've got some where yours ought to be.
What's your name?
And I feel bad that Jen walked away thinking I called her stupid.
- Do you think Jen's stupid?
- No, no.
I mean, you and I, we have degrees, we read books, we're academic smart.
Jen is more...
"I'm going up the down escalator,
"I'm not getting anywhere, so I should probably turn around" smart.
You know, you might want to get down off your high horse there for a minute, buddy.
I know Jennifer, and while she's no Rhodes scholar, she's probably smarter than you are in a lot of ways.
I know one way she's not.
I know what Rhodes scholar means.
You know, there's lots of different types of intelligence, Charlie.
I bet, if I wanted to, I could make you feel dumb.
For example, spatial visual intelligence.
Move only two matches to make a decagon.
That's easy.
Define decagon.
10-sided figure.
And don't worry, even though you're dumb,
I still think you're pretty, and we're having sex tonight.
What's this?
You have to make a 10-sided figure moving only two matches.
I can do it moving one.
- There.
- Oh, my God.
She's a genius.
And if I do this and this... stick man with a boner.
( Mumbling )
Might have been a fluke.
You're right.
You're right.
I can be the bigger man.
I'm going to go apologize.
I'll meet you back at your place later.
- Okay.
- And for the record... stick man with a coke problem.
Stick man after a car accident... because of his coke problem.
Stick man living in a tent because he lost his house because of the car accident and his coke problem.
Who's the genius now?
- ( Knocking on door )
- Just a minute.
Oh, I'm sorry, I should have called.
Yeah, that would have been a good idea.
I was driving home and I thought,
I owe you an apology.
You're not stupid.
You're a smart person and you know exactly what you're doing.
Baby, if that's the food, just bring it to bed.
I'm getting ready to massage.
Oh, damn.
You don't answer the door when your nails are we but you're in the middle of a prison rub-down and it's "Come on in."
( humming )
How stupid can one woman be?
I know this game.
Sarah Palin, Nancy Pelosi, or Jennifer your ex-wife.
- She's sleeping with Derek.
- I know it's unpopular, but I'm going to go with the liberal, Pelosi.
- Okay, pants off.
- I told her not to and then she got mad at me for assuming she'd do something stupid, and then what does she do?
The gay felon.
Did she even know he was gay?
Yeah, she knows.
She's a big girl.
She takes precautions.
I'm worried about the felon part.
Yeah, that's a reasonable concern.
Okay, I'll get the shirt.
I don't want this guy in my life.
He was in prison.
He steals things and hides them in his ass.
Hey, Charlie, where are your candlesticks?
I don't know.
Why don't you check my ex-wife's boyfriend's ass?
Charlie, you're upset.
We have a session tomorrow and we'll talk about this, so hold that thought.
But right now hold this and press the blue button three times.
One, two, three.
She knows what she's doing.
She's only doing this to piss me off.
- Whoa.
- Exactly.
I don't know how far she'll take this.
- Are you listening to me?
- ( Moans )
I can do two things at once.
If she's doing this just to piss you off, then the worst thing you can do... is show her you're upset.
Okay, I can't do two things at once.
Okay, you know what... just don't do anything and she'll stop acting crazy.
You're right.
She's just trying to get a reaction out of me.
- I'm not going to feed into that.
- Good.
Now, I need all of your attention.
I just want you to put all your efforts into pleasing me.
- What?
I just push the button again?
- Yeah.
- Am I actually a part of this?
- Shh.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I made breakfast.
I feel bad about yesterday.
Oh, it's all good.
You can kick it with Jen.
She's not my bitch no mo'.
She's just my baby mama.
- Are you trying to talk black?
- A little bit.
That's just how Charlie do.
Yeah, well, Charlie, don't.
You know, I'm proud of you.
I mean, in group, you tell us to let go of our anger and you do it.
You really walk the walk.
- Thank you.
- Because under normal circumstances, a guy comes into your house, eats your food, sleeps in your bed, oils up your ex-wife, a guy's got to get upset about that.
- Well, I always say lead by example.
- Yeah.
- Could you pass the butter, please?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
That's my butter!
You didn't ask!
You just took it!
And now you're going to smear it all over your toast right in front of me.
If you don't want me using your butter,
- all you got to do is say so.
- I don't want you using my butter.
It sure seems like a waste of good butter.
We're not talking about butter.
I know, I know, I know.
I'm going to put some honey on those biscuits.
- That's cool, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Honey is just honey.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.
Hey, Boo.
Ready to head out to the beach?
Yeah, uh, about that...
- Can I talk to you out on the porch for a second?
- Okay.
Mmm, honey and biscuits.
- Ah!
- You son of a bitch!
- You told Derek to stop seeing me.
- What do you care?
This isn't about Derek.
You're just seeing him to piss me off.
You're so full of yourself, it's unbelievable!
I can't just like him?
- He's a felon.
- He's an ex-felon, and I'm a 40-year-old single mother living in Los Angeles.
I had to open up the dating pool.
I now accept bartenders, pirates, and magicians.
Look, I was in jail for a long time, but I earned my GED.
And I'm only two tests away from becoming a certified VCR repairman.
So...
See?
You always have to control everything that I do.
That's over.
From now on, I'm doing whatever I want to do and you have no say about it.
I don't agree with anything you just said.
And I don't care.
Starting now, we're just a normal divorced couple.
We're not friends.
When we run into each other at the market, it's weird.
If you're five minutes late dropping off Sam, we've got a problem.
Oh, and by the way, Green Goddesses... the woman who bought the LA franchise just got a boatload of contracts.
She's cleaning up.
And I meant to say st like that!
You're not supposed to be friends with your ex-wife anyway.
That's against nature.
I'm not saying it was easy, but it was definitely worth it.
And as a person, I like Jen.
My ex-wife and I hate each other.
- What about your kids?
- We hate them, too.
- ( Tires screeching )
- What the hell is...
I knew this guy was trouble.
Call the police.
Not every black man running has committed a crime.
They're right behind me!
I just stole a car!
You're making me look bad in front of my friend.
I'm going back to prison, Charlie.
I tried to make it work, but I miss Donovan.
Now I got to go get arrested in San Bernardino so I go back to the same prison.
No, this is crazy.
What about Jennifer?
Oh, your ex-wife is a beautiful woman, but it just didn't feel right.
I miss my monster.
( Helicopter blades whirring )
I gotta go, Charlie.
I hope you're not disappointed in me.
Well, it would've been nice if you'd have made your life work on the outside, but...
I got very little time and you're going on a bit.
Oh, I told Jennifer and she's a mess.
You might want to check in on her.
( Lisping ) I'll see you next week in group.
( Knocking on door )
That's great.
Now you're here to rub it in my face?
- Jennifer...
- No, no, no.
You did it, Charlie.
Once again, you proved you're smarter than me.
Smarter than I.
But that doesn't matter.
That's not why I'm here.
What's wrong with me?
I just...
I can't find it.
- ( laughing )
- What?
- I don't make good decisions.
- Yes, you do.
You dumped me.
That was mostly my mom and my sisters, a couple of psychics.
Look, you're not the one who has to change anything.
I think you're right.
I do try to control you.
I don't know, maybe it's just my way of making sure you still need me.
Or maybe you're just a butt-hole.
We can talk semantics all day.
What's important is that we stay friends.
It's been great for Sam and it's been great for me.
All right.
- But no more judging, okay?
- You got it.
Now, Hold Onto Your Hat.
- What?
- No, that's the company name.
It's a little Velcro strap that attaches your hat to your collar.
Thousands of hats are lost every year due to rainstorms, boats, and amusement park rides.
No one has an exact number, but the financial loss reaches well into the millions.
- What do you think?
- I think...
I mean, nobody likes losing a hat.
That's amazing!
That's our motto!
"Nobody likes losing a hat."
I...
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.
It's... it's a horrible idea.
You'll lose everything.
- That was just a test.
- No, it wasn't.
Okay, I'm into them for $1,000.
God, I need help.
It's okay.
We'll try and finance some kind of a
♪ franchise anonymous program.
I bet there isn't one.
- We can start that.
- Shut up.
Let's move on.
Donovan, I know that you and Cleo had some words about how much time you've been spending in the library.
So do you want to talk about that?
Yes.
Cleo has been real supportive lately.
He knows that I have to get my law degree so I can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I'm innocent.
They have you on videotape stabbing three people at a Relax The Back store.
I ain't said it was going to be easy.
Now, Cleo, I know you were angry about not spending enough time with Donovan.
You want to tell us why you were able to let that go?
I don't want to, but I have to.
Donovan, you know how we said that if one of us gets out before the other that we would kill ourselves?
I-I'd like to revisit that.
What?
I'm getting out today.
I got a letter last week... something about prison overcrowded.
What?
!
- You knew for a week?
!
- Donovan, Donovan, you're obviously hurt.
You need to express to Cleo how that makes you feel.
Otherwise, hurt turns to anger, anger turns to rage, and rage turns to... holy crap!
No, no, it's all right.
Why didn't you tell me?
!
I thought you might get mad.
Well, he did kill three people already for less, so good call.
- I'm so sorry, monster.
- No!
I'm not your monster any more.
You broke my heart, Cleo.
I could have traded you for Jell-O and I didn't.
- Here you go, bro.
- Ahh!
How about now?
Now's good.
Okay, I know it goes without saying, but I'm going to go ahead and say it.
We never hand the angry man a second chair.
Now remember, when you approach the dish, you got to do something to distract the pitcher.
Wink at her like maybe you know something she doesn't.
Like this generation will be the first to do worse than their parents and we're all doomed for failure?
- Just try to hit the ball and have fun.
- Gotcha.
This tournament's making me nuts.
I don't even know how Sam's going to deal with the bus ride there with her OCD and everything.
She's terrified of truck stop bathrooms.
Hey, I want my teenage daughter terrified of truck stop bathrooms.
Good point.
Hey, while we have a second, will you look at something?
It's a new business I'm looking into.
- Green Goddesses?
- It's a maid-service franchise that hires hot maids and only uses green products.
Hot maids?
Where are you going to find beautiful women who want to clean toilets?
Men have been looking for that for thousands of years.
They help you.
You give Green Goddesses $10,000 and they give you the logo, the cleaning supplies, and the short skirts.
It's a no-brainer.
So for 10 grand you get Lysol and a logo of a dolphin with tits and a mop?
First of all, it's a mermaid with an eco-friendly dolphin's head.
And why do you have to be so negative?
Remember Downward Dog, the yoga studio... for dogs?
- Cleo.
- It's Derek on the outside.
Hi, I don't think we've met.
Uh, this is Derek, an old ballplayer buddy.
This is my ex-wife Jennifer.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Why would you ex this?
Well, who says it was his idea?
I don't recognize you.
Where did you and Charlie play?
He played at Akron.
Hell of a ballplayer.
Switch-hitter.
Mom, let's go to the bus.
We're going to be late.
- All right.
- Bye, kiddo.
Bye.
Nice meeting you.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I went to see my wife.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You have a wife?
I'm PG, man.
Prison gay.
What happens in jail stays in jail.
So what happened with your wife?
She said she was going to wait for me, but there's a Jack in the Box where my house was.
She moved to San Diego with some Chinese guy, and they got three kids.
And a damn dog named Cleo.
Wow, that really sucks.
So can I get you some water or something?
- You know why I'm here.
- For water?
My parole officer said if I don't find an address by tonight, I got to go to a county facility.
I need a place to stay.
Look, look, Derek, I would love to help you, but I got to keep our relationship strictly professional.
But if you want to come here for anger therapy classes,
I'd be more than happy to do that.
- When's the next session?
- Tomorrow, 2:00 PM.
Great!
I'm going to wait on the couch.
Everybody, this is Derek.
Derek is a former member of my prison group.
I want to remind you all that, as always, everyone's private life is confidential.
- Nothing leaves this room.
- Unless he steals it.
Okay, let's just pick up where we left off last time.
- Patrick?
- Right, so...
I was at this restaurant having dinner with a friend, and this prick next to me says that I'm too loud and threatens to call the manager.
I got something like that.
I shared a cell with a Russian gangster and he said I talked too loud and if I didn't stop, he'd tie my balls around my neck.
He called it a "Moscow Bow Tie."
Look how much we all have in common.
- And what happened, Patrick?
- Never mind.
Lacey, how are things going with your mom?
She's insane.
If I want to keep getting my allowance, I have to get a job.
I thought parents were supposed to fund you unconditionally.
That's love you unconditionally.
They don't let dogs do that.
Well, she gives my dog an allowance, too, and he doesn't have to get a job.
I feel you, girl.
Parents can be frustrating.
Mine would burn me with cigarettes.
You learn to stop reaching across the table for food real quick.
Ed, I'm assuming you're going to pass on the story about the gum wrappers?
Uh, yeah.
You know, Prison-break Jones over there is not the only guy who has had a tough life.
I'm sorry, forgot your name.
My mother burned me, too, with unending, subtle critiques of my clothes.
You may not see the scars, but they're there.
Well, I think we can all take a lesson from this.
When you think your problems are really big, remember, at least no one is tying your junk around your neck.
Don't quote me on that.
- Hey, Derek.
How are you doing?
- Good, good.
Charlie's letting me crash for a few days, so I thought I'd help out a little.
Well, don't mind me.
I'm just going to borrow.
Charlie's washing machine for a couple of loads.
Mine keeps lighting up "unbalanced."
I think it's making fun of me.
You know what?
Let me get that for you.
I'm doing Charlie's and mine anyway.
Jennifer:
Wow, thank you.
Don't mind the granny panties.
They're not mine.
They just came with the basket.
If your washing machine's broke, I'm pretty handy.
- I can take a look at it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
That'd be great.
That'd be amazing.
Thank you.
Why is he doing your laundry?
Because he offered, like a gentleman, Charlie.
Is there a Mrs. Gentleman?
Wow.
Okay, I...
I should probably tell you something about Derek.
Not a ballplayer.
He was a member of the prison group I volunteer with.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Hard-core criminal. 12 years behind bars, grand theft auto, repeat offender, the whole package.
So he's good-looking, not afraid of commitment, and always drives a nice new car?
- Don't go there, Jen.
- Pardon me?
Don't get involved with this guy, Jen.
Do you really think I'm dumb enough to date a felon?
Why do you always second-guess everything I do?
Are you sure you want to ask me that question?
Why wouldn't...
hey, quit it.
As soon as you write my alimony check, give me some of that pizza and he's done with my laundry,
I'm out of here.
I can take care of myself.
Did you TiVo "Project Runway" for me?
- Yeah.
- I'm going to go watch it.
- Hi.
- Hey.
See that guy down there?
He's my patient.
- Oh, is he the one that can't get mad?
- Yeah, we'll see.
He thinks he's here because I'm setting him up on a date, but I want you to do everything you can to get him to the breaking point.
How about I marry him?
No, we're trying to get him mad, not kill him.
- Oh, I'm wet.
- Oh, I am so sorry.
I hope those weren't your good clothes.
No, I'm meeting a girl, but it's okay.
It was an honest mistake.
Oops.
That wasn't as honest.
Maybe I'll just have nuts.
Well, at least now you've got some where yours ought to be.
What's your name?
And I feel bad that Jen walked away thinking I called her stupid.
- Do you think Jen's stupid?
- No, no.
I mean, you and I, we have degrees, we read books, we're academic smart.

You're right.
You're right.
I can be the bigger man.
I'm going to go apologize.

Now, Hold Onto Your Hat.
- What?
- No, that's the company name.
It's a little Velcro strap that attaches your hat to your collar.
Thousands of hats are lost every year due to rainstorms, boats, and amusement park rides.
No one has an exact number, but the financial loss reaches well into the millions.
- What do you think?
- I think...
I mean, nobody likes losing a hat.
That's amazing!
That's our motto!
"Nobody likes losing a hat."
I...
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.
It's... it's a horrible idea.
You'll lose everything.
- That was just a test.
- No, it wasn't.
Okay, I'm into them for $1,000.
God, I need help.
It's okay.
We'll try and finance some kind of a twelve-step franchise anonymous program.
I bet there isn't one.
- We can start that.
- Shut up.
Let's move on.
Donovan, I know that you and Cleo had some words about how much time you've been spending in the library.
So do you want to talk about that?
Yes.
Cleo has been real supportive lately.
He knows that I have to get my law degree so I can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I'm innocent.
They have you on videotape stabbing three people at a Relax The Back store.
I ain't said it was going to be easy.
Now, Cleo, I know you were angry about not spending enough time with Donovan.
You want to tell us why you were able to let that go?
I don't want to, but I have to.
Donovan, you know how we said that if one of us gets out before the other that we would kill ourselves?
I-I'd like to revisit that.
What?
I'm getting out today.
I got a letter last week... something about prison overcrowded.
What?
!
- You knew for a week?
!
- Donovan, Donovan, you're obviously hurt.
You need to express to Cleo how that makes you feel.
Otherwise, hurt turns to anger, anger turns to rage, and rage turns to... holy crap!
No, no, it's all right.
Why didn't you tell me?
!
I thought you might get mad.
Well, he did kill three people already for less, so good call.
- I'm so sorry, monster.
- No!
I'm not your monster any more.
You broke my heart, Cleo.
I could have traded you for Jell-O and I didn't.
- Here you go, bro.
- Ahh!
How about now?
Now's good.
Okay, I know it goes without saying, but I'm going to go ahead and say it.
We never hand the angry man a second chair.
Now remember, when you approach the dish, you got to do something to distract the pitcher.
Wink at her like maybe you know something she doesn't.
Like this generation will be the first to do worse than their parents and we're all doomed for failure?
- Just try to hit the ball and have fun.
- Gotcha.
This tournament's making me nuts.
I don't even know how Sam's going to deal with the bus ride there with her OCD and everything.
She's terrified of truck stop bathrooms.
Hey, I want my teenage daughter terrified of truck stop bathrooms.
Good point.
Hey, while we have a second, will you look at something?
It's a new business I'm looking into.
- Green Goddesses?
- It's a maid-service franchise that hires hot maids and only uses green products.
Hot maids?
Where are you going to find beautiful women who want to clean toilets?
Men have been looking for that for thousands of years.
They help you.
You give Green Goddesses $10,000 and they give you the logo, the cleaning supplies, and the short skirts.
It's a no-brainer.
So for 10 grand you get Lysol and a logo of a dolphin with tits and a mop?
First of all, it's a mermaid with an eco-friendly dolphin's head.
And why do you have to be so negative?
Remember Downward Dog, the yoga studio... for dogs?
- Cleo.
- It's Derek on the outside.
Hi, I don't think we've met.
Uh, this is Derek, an old ballplayer buddy.
This is my ex-wife Jennifer.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Why would you ex this?
Well, who says it was his idea?
I don't recognize you.
Where did you and Charlie play?
He played at Akron.
Hell of a ballplayer.
Switch-hitter.
Mom, let's go to the bus.
We're going to be late.
- All right.
- Bye, kiddo.
Bye.
Nice meeting you.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I went to see my wife.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You have a wife?
I'm PG, man.
Prison gay.
What happens in jail stays in jail.
So what happened with your wife?
She said she was going to wait for me, but there's a Jack in the Box where my house was.
She moved to San Diego with some Chinese guy, and they got three kids.
And a damn dog named Cleo.
Wow, that really sucks.
So can I get you some water or something?
- You know why I'm here.
- For water?
My parole officer said if I don't find an address by tonight, I got to go to a county facility.
I need a place to stay.
Look, look, Derek, I would love to help you, but I got to keep our relationship strictly professional.
But if you want to come here for anger therapy classes,
I'd be more than happy to do that.
- When's the next session?
- Tomorrow, 2:00 PM.
Great!
I'm going to wait on the couch.
Everybody, this is Derek.
Derek is a former member of my prison group.
I want to remind you all that, as always, everyone's private life is confidential.
- Nothing leaves this room.
- Unless he steals it.
Okay, let's just pick up where we left off last time.
- Patrick?
- Right, so...
I was at this restaurant having dinner with a friend, and this prick next to me says that I'm too loud and threatens to call the manager.
I got something like that.
I shared a cell with a Russian gangster and he said I talked too loud and if I didn't stop, he'd tie my balls around my neck.
He called it a "Moscow Bow Tie."
Look how much we all have in common.
- And what happened, Patrick?
- Never mind.
Lacey, how are things going with your mom?
She's insane.
If I want to keep getting my allowance, I have to get a job.
I thought parents were supposed to fund you unconditionally.
That's love you unconditionally.
They don't let dogs do that.
Well, she gives my dog an allowance, too, and he doesn't have to get a job.
I feel you, girl.
Parents can be frustrating.
Mine would burn me with cigarettes.
You learn to stop reaching across the table for food real quick.
Ed, I'm assuming you're going to pass on the story about the gum wrappers?
Uh, yeah.
You know, Prison-break Jones over there is not the only guy who has had a tough life.
I'm sorry, forgot your name.
My mother burned me, too, with unending, subtle critiques of my clothes.
You may not see the scars, but they're there.
Well, I think we can all take a lesson from this.
When you think your problems are really big, remember, at least no one is tying your junk around your neck.
Don't quote me on that.
- Hey, Derek.
How are you doing?
- Good, good.
Charlie's letting me crash for a few days, so I thought I'd help out a little.
Well, don't mind me.
I'm just going to borrow.
Charlie's washing machine for a couple of loads.
Mine keeps lighting up "unbalanced."
I think it's making fun of me.
You know what?
Let me get that for you.
I'm doing Charlie's and mine anyway.
Jennifer:
Wow, thank you.
Don't mind the granny panties.
They're not mine.
They just came with the basket.
If your washing machine's broke, I'm pretty handy.
- I can take a look at it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
That'd be great.
That'd be amazing.
Thank you.
Why is he doing your laundry?
Because he offered, like a gentleman, Charlie.
Is there a Mrs. Gentleman?
Wow.
Okay, I...
I should probably tell you something about Derek.
Not a ballplayer.
He was a member of the prison group I volunteer with.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Hard-core criminal. 12 years behind bars, grand theft auto, repeat offender, the whole package.
So he's good-looking, not afraid of commitment, and always drives a nice new car?
- Don't go there, Jen.
- Pardon me?
Don't get involved with this guy, Jen.
Do you really think I'm dumb enough to date a felon?
Why do you always second-guess everything I do?
Are you sure you want to ask me that question?
Why wouldn't...
hey, quit it.
As soon as you write my alimony check, give me some of that pizza and he's done with my laundry,
I'm out of here.
I can take care of myself.
Did you TiVo "Project Runway" for me?
- Yeah.
- I'm going to go watch it.
- Hi.
- Hey.
See that guy down there?
He's my patient.
- Oh, is he the one that can't get mad?
- Yeah, we'll see.
He thinks he's here because I'm setting him up on a date, but I want you to do everything you can to get him to the breaking point.
How about I marry him?
No, we're trying to get him mad, not kill him.
- Oh, I'm wet.
- Oh, I am so sorry.
I hope those weren't your good clothes.
No, I'm meeting a girl, but it's okay.
It was an honest mistake.
Oops.
That wasn't as honest.
Maybe I'll just have nuts.
Well, at least now you've got some where yours ought to be.
What's your name?
And I feel bad that Jen walked away thinking I called her stupid.
- Do you think Jen's stupid?
- No, no.
I mean, you and I, we have degrees, we read books, we're academic smart.
Jen is more...
"I'm going up the down escalator,
"I'm not getting anywhere, so I should probably turn around" smart.
You know, you might want to get down off your high horse there for a minute, buddy.
I know Jennifer, and while she's no Rhodes scholar, she's probably smarter than you are in a lot of ways.
I know one way she's not.
I know what Rhodes scholar means.
You know, there's lots of different types of intelligence, Charlie.
I bet, if I wanted to, I could make you feel dumb.
For example, spatial visual intelligence.
Move only two matches to make a decagon.
That's easy.
Define decagon.
10-sided figure.
And don't worry, even though you're dumb,
I still think you're pretty, and we're having sex tonight.
What's this?
You have to make a 10-sided figure moving only two matches.
I can do it moving one.
- There.
- Oh, my God.
She's a genius.
And if I do this and this... stick man with a boner.
Might have been a fluke.
You're right.
You're right.
I can be the bigger man.
I'm going to go apologize.
I'll meet you back at your place later.
- Okay.
- And for the record... stick man with a coke problem.
Stick man after a car accident... because of his coke problem.
Stick man living in a tent because he lost his house because of the car accident and his coke problem.
Who's the genius now?
Just a minute.
Oh, I'm sorry, I should have called.
Yeah, that would have been a good idea.
I was driving home and I thought,
I owe you an apology.
You're not stupid.
You're a smart person and you know exactly what you're doing.
Baby, if that's the food, just bring it to bed.
I'm getting ready to massage.
Oh, damn.
You don't answer the door when your nails are we but you're in the middle of a prison rub-down and it's "Come on in."
How stupid can one woman be?
I know this game.
Sarah Palin, Nancy Pelosi, or Jennifer your ex-wife.
- She's sleeping with Derek.
- I know it's unpopular, but I'm going to go with the liberal, Pelosi.
- Okay, pants off.
- I told her not to and then she got mad at me for assuming she'd do something stupid, and then what does she do?
The gay felon.
Did she even know he was gay?
Yeah, she knows.
She's a big girl.
She takes precautions.
I'm worried about the felon part.
Yeah, that's a reasonable concern.
Okay, I'll get the shirt.
I don't want this guy in my life.
He was in prison.
He steals things and hides them in his ass.
Hey, Charlie, where are your candlesticks?
I don't know.
Why don't you check my ex-wife's boyfriend's ass?
Charlie, you're upset.
We have a session tomorrow and we'll talk about this, so hold that thought.
But right now hold this and press the blue button three times.
One, two, three.
She knows what she's doing.
She's only doing this to piss me off.
- Whoa.
- Exactly.
I don't know how far she'll take this.
Are you listening to me?
I can do two things at once.
If she's doing this just to piss you off, then the worst thing you can do... is show her you're upset.
Okay, I can't do two things at once.
Okay, you know what... just don't do anything and she'll stop acting crazy.
You're right.
She's just trying to get a reaction out of me.
- I'm not going to feed into that.
- Good.
Now, I need all of your attention.
I just want you to put all your efforts into pleasing me.
- What?
I just push the button again?
- Yeah.
- Am I actually a part of this?
- Shh.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I made breakfast.
I feel bad about yesterday.
Oh, it's all good.
You can kick it with Jen.
She's not my bitch no mo'.
She's just my baby mama.
- Are you trying to talk black?
- A little bit.
That's just how Charlie do.
Yeah, well, Charlie, don't.
You know, I'm proud of you.
I mean, in group, you tell us to let go of our anger and you do it.
You really walk the walk.
- Thank you.
- Because under normal circumstances, a guy comes into your house, eats your food, sleeps in your bed, oils up your ex-wife, a guy's got to get upset about that.
- Well, I always say lead by example.
- Yeah.
- Could you pass the butter, please?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
That's my butter!
You didn't ask!
You just took it!
And now you're going to smear it all over your toast right in front of me.
If you don't want me using your butter,
- all you got to do is say so.
- I don't want you using my butter.
It sure seems like a waste of good butter.
We're not talking about butter.
I know, I know, I know.
I'm going to put some honey on those biscuits.
- That's cool, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Honey is just honey.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.
Hey, Boo.
Ready to head out to the beach?
Yeah, uh, about that...
- Can I talk to you out on the porch for a second?
- Okay.
Mmm, honey and biscuits.
- Ah!
- You son of a bitch!
- You told Derek to stop seeing me.
- What do you care?
This isn't about Derek.
You're just seeing him to piss me off.
You're so full of yourself, it's unbelievable!
I can't just like him?
- He's a felon.
- He's an ex-felon, and I'm a 40-year-old single mother living in Los Angeles.
I had to open up the dating pool.
I now accept bartenders, pirates, and magicians.
Look, I was in jail for a long time, but I earned my GED.
And I'm only two tests away from becoming a certified VCR repairman.
So...
See?
You always have to control everything that I do.
That's over.
From now on, I'm doing whatever I want to do and you have no say about it.
I don't agree with anything you just said.
And I don't care.
Starting now, we're just a normal divorced couple.
We're not friends.
When we run into each other at the market, it's weird.
If you're five minutes late dropping off Sam, we've got a problem.
Oh, and by the way, Green Goddesses... the woman who bought the LA franchise just got a boatload of contracts.
She's cleaning up.
And I meant to say st like that!
You're not supposed to be friends with your ex-wife anyway.
That's against nature.
I'm not saying it was easy, but it was definitely worth it.
And as a person, I like Jen.
My ex-wife and I hate each other.
- What about your kids?
- We hate them, too.
What the hell is...
I knew this guy was trouble.
Call the police.
Not every black man running has committed a crime.
They're right behind me!
I just stole a car!
You're making me look bad in front of my friend.
I'm going back to prison, Charlie.
I tried to make it work, but I miss Donovan.
Now I got to go get arrested in San Bernardino so I go back to the same prison.
No, this is crazy.
What about Jennifer?
Oh, your ex-wife is a beautiful woman, but it just didn't feel right.
I miss my monster.
I gotta go, Charlie.
I hope you're not disappointed in me.
Well, it would've been nice if you'd have made your life work on the outside, but...
I got very little time and you're going on a bit.
Oh, I told Jennifer and she's a mess.
You might want to check in on her.
I'll see you next week in group.
That's great.
Now you're here to rub it in my face?
- Jennifer...
- No, no, no.
You did it, Charlie.
Once again, you proved you're smarter than me.
Smarter than I.
But that doesn't matter.
That's not why I'm here.
What's wrong with me?
I just...
I can't find it.
What?
- I don't make good decisions.
- Yes, you do.
You dumped me.
That was mostly my mom and my sisters, a couple of psychics.
Look, you're not the one who has to change anything.
I think you're right.
I do try to control you.
I don't know, maybe it's just my way of making sure you still need me.
Or maybe you're just a butt-hole.
We can talk semantics all day.
What's important is that we stay friends.
It's been great for Sam and it's been great for me.
All right.
- But no more judging, okay?
- You got it.
Now, Hold Onto Your Hat.
- What?
- No, that's the company name.
It's a little Velcro strap that attaches your hat to your collar.

That's amazing!
That's our motto!
"Nobody likes losing a hat."
I...
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.
It's... it's a horrible idea.
You'll lose everything.
- That was just a test.
- No, it wasn't.
Okay, I'm into them for $1,000.
God, I need help.
It's okay.
We'll try and finance some kind of a twelve-step franchise anonymous program.
I bet there isn't one.
- We can start that.
- Shut up.
Let's move on. (CLEARS THROAT)
Donovan, I know that you and Cleo had some words about how much time you've been spending in the library.

(SCREAMING)
No, no, wait, wait, wait.
I got this.
I got this.
I got this.
Donovan, Donovan.
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you might get mad.
Well, he did kill three people over a back pillow, so good call.
I'm so sorry, monster.
No!
I'm not your monster anymore.
You broke my heart, Cleo.
I could have traded you for Jell-O, and I didn't.
Here you go, bro.
(CLEO WAILING)
- How about now?
- Now's good.
Okay, I know it goes without saying, but I'm going to go ahead and say it.

(SOFTLY) Cleo.
(WHISPERING) it's Derek on the outside.
Hi.

This is Derek, an old ballplayer buddy.
This is my ex-wife, Jennifer.

And I feel bad that Jen walked away thinking I called her stupid.
Do you think Jen's stupid?
No, no.
I mean, you and I, we have degrees, we read books, we're academic smart.
Jen is more "I'm going up the down escalator",
"I'm not getting anywhere, so I should probably turn around" smart.
You know, you might want to get down off your high horse there for a minute, buddy.
I know Jennifer, and while she's no Rhodes Scholar, she's probably smarter than you are in a lot of ways.
I know one way she's not.
I know what Rhodes Scholar means.
You know, there's lots of different types of intelligence, Charlie.
I bet, if I wanted to, I could make you feel dumb.
For example, spatial-visual intelligence.
Move only two matches to make a decagon.
(SCOFFS) That's easy.
Define "decagon."
Ten-sided figure.
And don't worry.
Even though you're dumb, I still think you're pretty, and we're having sex tonight.
What's this?
KATE:
You have to make a 10-sided figure moving only two matches.
I can do it moving one.
There.
Oh, my God!
She's a genius.
And if I do this and this...
Stick man with a boner.
Might have been a fluke.
You're right.
You're right.
I can be the bigger man.
I'm going to go apologize.
I'll meet you back at your place later.
Okay.
And for the record...
Stick man with a coke problem.
Stick man after a car accident,
(SIGHS) because of his coke problem.
Stick man living in a tent because he lost his house because of the car accident and his coke problem.
Who's the genius now?
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Just a minute.
Oh!
I'm sorry, I should have called.
Yeah, that would have been a good idea.
I was driving home, and I thought I owe you an apology.
You're not stupid.
You're a smart person and you know exactly what you're doing.
Baby, if that's the food, just bring it to bed.
I'm ready to give you a massage.
Oh, damn!
You don't answer the door when your nails are wet, but you're in the middle of a prison rub-down and it's, "Come on in."
(HUMS EXCITEDLY)
How stupid can one woman be?
I know this game.
Sarah Palin, Nancy Pelosi, or Jennifer, your ex-wife.
She's sleeping with Derek.
I know it's unpopular, but I'm going to go with the liberal, Pelosi.
Okay, pants off.
I told her not to, and then she got mad at me for assuming she'd do something stupid.
And then what does she do?
The gay felon.
Did she even know he was gay?
Yeah, she knows.
She's a big girl.
She takes precautions.
It's not what I'm worried about.
I'm worried about the felon part.
Yeah, that's a reasonable concern.
Okay, I'll get the shirt.
I don't want this guy in my life.
He was in prison.
He steals things and hides them in his ass.
"Hey, Charlie, where are your candlesticks?"
"I don't know.
Why don't you check my ex-wife's boyfriend's ass?"
Charlie, you're upset.
We have a session tomorrow and we'll talk about this, so hold that thought.
But right now, hold this and press the blue button three times.
One, two, three.
Look.
She knows what she's doing.
She's only doing this to piss me off.
- Whoa!
- Exactly.
I don't know how far she'll take it.
Are you listening to me?
(BREATHES HEAVILY) I can do two things at once.
If she's doing this just to piss you off, then the worst thing you can (MOANING) do is show her you're upset.
Okay, I can't do two things at once.
Okay, you know what?
Just don't do anything and she'll stop acting crazy.
You're right.
She's just trying to get a reaction out of me.
I'm not going to feed into that.
Good.
Now, I need all of your attention.
I just want you to put all your efforts into pleasing me.
Oh!
What?
I just push the button again?
Yeah.
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
Am I actually a part of this?
(SHUSHING)
- Hey.
- Hey.
I made breakfast.
I feel bad about yesterday.
It's all good.
You can kick it with Jen.
She's not my bitch no mo'.
She's just my baby mama.
Are you trying to talk black?
A little bit.
That's just how Charlie do.
Yeah, well, Charlie don't.
You know, I'm proud of you.
I mean, in group, you tell us to let go of our anger, and you do it.
You really walk the walk.
Thank you.
Because under normal circumstances, a guy comes into your house, eats your food, sleeps in your bed, oils up your ex-wife, a guy could get pretty upset about that.
Well, I always say lead by example.
Yeah.
Could you pass the butter, please?
Oh, yeah.
That's my butter!
You didn't ask!
You just took it!
And now you're going to smear it all over your toast right in front of me.
If you don't want me using your butter, all you got to do is say so.
I don't want you using my butter.
It sure seems like a waste of good butter.
We're not talking about butter.
I know, I know, I know.
I'm going to put some honey on those biscuits.
That's cool, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Honey is just honey.
- Hey, Charlie.
- CHARLIE:
Hey.
Hey, boo.
Ready to head out to the beach?
Yeah, about that, can I talk to you out on the porch for a second?
Okay.
Mmm.
Honey and biscuits.
- You son of a bitch!
- What?
You told Derek to stop seeing me.
What do you care?
This isn't about Derek.
You're just seeing him to piss me off.
You're so full of yourself, it's unbelievable!
I can't just like him?
- He's a felon.
- He's an ex-felon.
And I'm a 40-year-old single mother living in Los Angeles.
I had to open up the dating pool.
I now accept bartenders, pirates, and magicians.
For the record, I was in jail for a long time, but I earned my GED.
And I'm only two tests away from being a certified VCR repairman, so...
Boom!
See?
You always have to control everything that I do.
That's over.
From now on, I'm doing whatever I want to do and you have no say about it.
I don't agree with anything you just said.
And I don't care!
Starting now, we're just a normal divorced couple.
We're not friends.
When we run into each other at the market, it's weird.
If you're five minutes late dropping off Sam, we've got a problem.
Oh!
And by the way, Green Goddesses, the woman who bought the LA franchise just got a boatload of contracts.
She's cleaning up.
And I meant to say it like that!
You're not supposed to be friends with your ex-wife anyway.
That's against nature.
I'm not saying it was easy, but it was definitely worth it.
And as a person, I like Jen.
My ex-wife and I hate each other.
How about your kids?
We hate them, too.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
What the hell is...
I knew this guy was trouble.
Call the police.
Not every black man running has committed a crime.
They're right behind me!
I just stole a car!
You're making me look bad in front of my friend.
I'm going back to prison, Charlie.
I tried to make it work, but I miss Donovan.
Now I got to go get arrested in San Bernardino so I go back to the same prison.
No, this is crazy.
What about Jennifer?
Oh!
Your ex-wife is a beautiful woman, but it just didn't feel right.
I miss my monster.
(HELICOPTER HOVERING)
I gotta go, Charlie.
I hope you're not disappointed in me.
It would've been nice if you'd have made your life work on the outside...
I got very little time and you're going on a bit here.
I told Jennifer and she's a mess.
You might want to check in on her.
I'll see you next week in group.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
That's great.
Now you're here to rub it in my face?
- Jennifer...
- No, no, no.
You did it, Charlie.
Once again, you proved you're smarter than me.
"Smarter than I."
But that doesn't matter.
That's not why I'm here.
What's wrong with me?
I just...
I can't find it. (LAUGHING)
What?
I don't make good decisions.
Yes, you do.
You dumped me.
That was mostly my mom, and my sisters, a couple of psychics.
Look, you're not the one who has to change anything.
I think you're right.
L do try to control you.
I don't know, maybe it's just my way of making sure you still need me.
Or maybe you're just a butt-hole.
We can talk semantics all day.
What's important is that we stay friends.
It's been great for Sam and it's been great for me.
All right.
But no more judging, okay?
You got it.
Now, Hold Onto Your Hat.
What?
No, that's the company name.
It's a little Velcro strap that attaches your hat to your collar.
Thousands of hats are lost every year due to rainstorms, boats, and amusement park rides.
No one has an exact number, but the financial loss reaches well into the millions.
What do you think?
I think...
I mean, nobody likes losing a hat.
That's amazing!
That's our motto!
"Nobody likes losing a hat."
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.
It's a horrible idea.
You'll lose everything.
That was just a test.
No, it wasn't.
Okay, I'm into them for $1,000.
God, I need help.
- It's okay.
- (SIGHS)
We'll try and find you some kind of a 12-step franchise anonymous program.
I'll bet there isn't one.
We could start that.
Shut up.
Let's move on.
Donovan, I know that you and Cleo had some words about how much time you've been spending in the library.
So do you want to talk about that?
Yes.
Cleo has been real supportive lately.
He knows that I have to get my law degree so I can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I'm innocent.
They have you on videotape stabbing three people at a Relax The Back store.
I ain't said it was going to be easy.
Now, Cleo, I know you were angry about not spending enough time with Donovan.
You want to tell us why you were able to let that go?
I don't want to, but I have to.
Donovan, you know how we said that if one of us gets out before the other that we would kill ourselves?
I-I'd like to revisit that.
What?
I'm getting out today.
I got a letter last week... something about prison overcrowded.
What?
!
- You knew for a week?
!
- Donovan, Donovan, you're obviously hurt.
You need to express to Cleo how that makes you feel.
Otherwise, hurt turns to anger, anger turns to rage, and rage turns to... holy crap!
No, no, it's all right.
Why didn't you tell me?
!
I thought you might get mad.
Well, he did kill three people already for less, so good call.
- I'm so sorry, monster.
- No!
I'm not your monster any more.
You broke my heart, Cleo.
I could have traded you for Jell-O and I didn't.
- Here you go, bro.
- Ahh!
How about now?
Now's good.
Okay, I know it goes without saying, but I'm going to go ahead and say it.
We never hand the angry man a second chair.
Now remember, when you approach the dish, you got to do something to distract the pitcher.
Wink at her like maybe you know something she doesn't.
Like this generation will be the first to do worse than their parents and we're all doomed for failure?
- Just try to hit the ball and have fun.
- Gotcha.
This tournament's making me nuts.
I don't even know how Sam's going to deal with the bus ride there with her OCD and everything.
She's terrified of truck stop bathrooms.
Hey, I want my teenage daughter terrified of truck stop bathrooms.
Good point.
Hey, while we have a second, will you look at something?
It's a new business I'm looking into.
- Green Goddesses?
- It's a maid-service franchise that hires hot maids and only uses green products.
Hot maids?
Where are you going to find beautiful women who want to clean toilets?
Men have been looking for that for thousands of years.
They help you.
You give Green Goddesses $10,000 and they give you the logo, the cleaning supplies, and the short skirts.
It's a no-brainer.
So for 10 grand you get Lysol and a logo of a dolphin with tits and a mop?
First of all, it's a mermaid with an eco-friendly dolphin's head.
And why do you have to be so negative?
Remember Downward Dog, the yoga studio... for dogs?
- Cleo.
- It's Derek on the outside.
Hi, I don't think we've met.
Uh, this is Derek, an old ballplayer buddy.
This is my ex-wife Jennifer.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Why would you ex this?
Well, who says it was his idea?
I don't recognize you.
Where did you and Charlie play?
He played at Akron.
Hell of a ballplayer.
Switch-hitter.
Mom, let's go to the bus.
We're going to be late.
- All right.
- Bye, kiddo.
Bye.
Nice meeting you.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I went to see my wife.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You have a wife?
I'm PG, man.
Prison gay.
What happens in jail stays in jail.
So what happened with your wife?
She said she was going to wait for me, but there's a Jack in the Box where my house was.
She moved to San Diego with some Chinese guy, and they got three kids.
And a damn dog named Cleo.
Wow, that really sucks.
So can I get you some water or something?
- You know why I'm here.
- For water?
My parole officer said if I don't find an address by tonight, I got to go to a county facility.
I need a place to stay.
Look, look, Derek, I would love to help you, but I got to keep our relationship strictly professional.
But if you want to come here for anger therapy classes,
I'd be more than happy to do that.
- When's the next session?
- Tomorrow, 2:00 PM.
Great!
I'm going to wait on the couch.
Everybody, this is Derek.
Derek is a former member of my prison group.
I want to remind you all that, as always, everyone's private life is confidential.
- Nothing leaves this room.
- Unless he steals it.
Okay, let's just pick up where we left off last time.
- Patrick?
- Right, so...
I was at this restaurant having dinner with a friend, and this prick next to me says that I'm too loud and threatens to call the manager.
I got something like that.
I shared a cell with a Russian gangster and he said I talked too loud and if I didn't stop, he'd tie my balls around my neck.
He called it a "Moscow Bow Tie."
Look how much we all have in common.
- And what happened, Patrick?
- Never mind.
Lacey, how are things going with your mom?
She's insane.
If I want to keep getting my allowance, I have to get a job.
I thought parents were supposed to fund you unconditionally.
That's love you unconditionally.
They don't let dogs do that.
Well, she gives my dog an allowance, too, and he doesn't have to get a job.
I feel you, girl.
Parents can be frustrating.
Mine would burn me with cigarettes.
You learn to stop reaching across the table for food real quick.
Ed, I'm assuming you're going to pass on the story about the gum wrappers?
Uh, yeah.
You know, Prison-break Jones over there is not the only guy who has had a tough life.
I'm sorry, forgot your name.
My mother burned me, too, with unending, subtle critiques of my clothes.
You may not see the scars, but they're there.
Well, I think we can all take a lesson from this.
When you think your problems are really big, remember, at least no one is tying your junk around your neck.
Don't quote me on that.
- Hey, Derek.
How are you doing?
- Good, good.
Charlie's letting me crash for a few days, so I thought I'd help out a little.
Well, don't mind me.
I'm just going to borrow.
Charlie's washing machine for a couple of loads.
Mine keeps lighting up "unbalanced."
I think it's making fun of me.
You know what?
Let me get that for you.
I'm doing Charlie's and mine anyway.
Jennifer:
Wow, thank you.
Don't mind the granny panties.
They're not mine.
They just came with the basket.
If your washing machine's broke, I'm pretty handy.
- I can take a look at it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
That'd be great.
That'd be amazing.
Thank you.
Why is he doing your laundry?
Because he offered, like a gentleman, Charlie.
Is there a Mrs. Gentleman?
Wow.
Okay, I...
I should probably tell you something about Derek.
Not a ballplayer.
He was a member of the prison group I volunteer with.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Hard-core criminal. 12 years behind bars, grand theft auto, repeat offender, the whole package.
So he's good-looking, not afraid of commitment, and always drives a nice new car?
- Don't go there, Jen.
- Pardon me?
Don't get involved with this guy, Jen.
Do you really think I'm dumb enough to date a felon?
Why do you always second-guess everything I do?
Are you sure you want to ask me that question?
Why wouldn't...
hey, quit it.
As soon as you write my alimony check, give me some of that pizza and he's done with my laundry,
I'm out of here.
I can take care of myself.
Did you TiVo "Project Runway" for me?
- Yeah.
- I'm going to go watch it.
- Hi.
- Hey.
See that guy down there?
He's my patient.
- Oh, is he the one that can't get mad?
- Yeah, we'll see.
He thinks he's here because I'm setting him up on a date, but I want you to do everything you can to get him to the breaking point.
How about I marry him?
No, we're trying to get him mad, not kill him.
- Oh, I'm wet.
- Oh, I am so sorry.
I hope those weren't your good clothes.
No, I'm meeting a girl, but it's okay.
It was an honest mistake.
Oops.
That wasn't as honest.
Maybe I'll just have nuts.
Well, at least now you've got some where yours ought to be.
What's your name?
And I feel bad that Jen walked away thinking I called her stupid.
- Do you think Jen's stupid?
- No, no.
I mean, you and I, we have degrees, we read books, we're academic smart.
Jen is more...
"I'm going up the down escalator,
"I'm not getting anywhere, so I should probably turn around" smart.
You know, you might want to get down off your high horse there for a minute, buddy.
I know Jennifer, and while she's no Rhodes scholar, she's probably smarter than you are in a lot of ways.

Move only two matches to make a decagon.
That's easy.
Define decagon.
10-sided figure.
And don't worry, even though you're dumb,
I still think you're pretty, and we're having sex tonight.
What's this?
You have to make a 10-sided figure moving only two matches.
I can do it moving one.
- There.
- Oh, my God.
She's a genius.
And if I do this and this... stick man with a boner.
Might have been a fluke.
You're right.
You're right.
I can be the bigger man.
I'm going to go apologize.
I'll meet you back at your place later.
- Okay.
- And for the record... stick man with a coke problem.
Stick man after a car accident... because of his coke problem.
Stick man living in a tent because he lost his house because of the car accident and his coke problem.
Who's the genius now?
Just a minute.
Oh, I'm sorry, I should have called.
Yeah, that would have been a good idea.
I was driving home and I thought,
I owe you an apology.
You're not stupid.
You're a smart person and you know exactly what you're doing.
Baby, if that's the food, just bring it to bed.
I'm getting ready to massage.
Oh, damn.
You don't answer the door when your nails are we but you're in the middle of a prison rub-down and it's "Come on in."
How stupid can one woman be?
I know this game.
Sarah Palin, Nancy Pelosi, or Jennifer your ex-wife.

- That was just a test.
- No, it wasn't.
Okay, I'm into them for $1,000.
God, I need help.
It's okay.
We'll try and finance some kind of a
♪ franchise anonymous program.
I bet there isn't one.
- We can start that.
- Shut up.
Let's move on.
Donovan, I know that you and Cleo had some words about how much time you've been spending in the library.
So do you want to talk about that?
Yes.
Cleo has been real supportive lately.
He knows that I have to get my law degree so I can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I'm innocent.
They have you on videotape stabbing three people at a Relax The Back store.
I ain't said it was going to be easy.
Now, Cleo, I know you were angry about not spending enough time with Donovan.
You want to tell us why you were able to let that go?
I don't want to, but I have to.
Donovan, you know how we said that if one of us gets out before the other that we would kill ourselves?
I-I'd like to revisit that.
What?
I'm getting out today.
I got a letter last week... something about prison overcrowded.
What?
!
- You knew for a week?
!
- Donovan, Donovan, you're obviously hurt.
You need to express to Cleo how that makes you feel.
Otherwise, hurt turns to anger, anger turns to rage, and rage turns to...
- holy crap!
- ( Screaming )
No, no, it's all right.
Why didn't you tell me?
!
I thought you might get mad.
Well, he did kill three people already for less, so good call.
- I'm so sorry, monster.
- No!
I'm not your monster any more.
You broke my heart, Cleo.
I could have traded you for Jell-O and I didn't.
- Here you go, bro.
- Ahh!
- ( Cleo crying )
- How about now?
Now's good.
Okay, I know it goes without saying, but I'm going to go ahead and say it.
We never hand the angry man a second chair.
Now remember, when you approach the dish, you got to do something to distract the pitcher.
Wink at her like maybe you know something she doesn't.
Like this generation will be the first to do worse than their parents and we're all doomed for failure?
- Just try to hit the ball and have fun.
- Gotcha.
This tournament's making me nuts.
I don't even know how Sam's going to deal with the bus ride there with her OCD and everything.
She's terrified of truck stop bathrooms.
Hey, I want my teenage daughter terrified of truck stop bathrooms.
Good point.
Hey, while we have a second, will you look at something?
It's a new business I'm looking into.
- Green Goddesses?
- It's a maid-service franchise that hires hot maids and only uses green products.
Hot maids?
Where are you going to find beautiful women who want to clean toilets?
Men have been looking for that for thousands of years.
They help you.
You give Green Goddesses $10,000 and they give you the logo, the cleaning supplies, and the short skirts.
It's a no-brainer.
So for 10 grand you get Lysol and a logo of a dolphin with tits and a mop?
First of all, it's a mermaid with an eco-friendly dolphin's head.
- And why do you have to be so negative?
- ( Knocking on door )
Remember Downward Dog, the yoga studio... for dogs?
- Cleo.
- It's Derek on the outside.
Hi, I don't think we've met.
Uh, this is Derek, an old ballplayer buddy.
This is my ex-wife Jennifer.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Why would you ex this?
Well, who says it was his idea?
I don't recognize you.
Where did you and Charlie play?
He played at Akron.
Hell of a ballplayer.
Switch-hitter.
Mom, let's go to the bus.
We're going to be late.
- All right.
- Bye, kiddo.
Bye.
Nice meeting you.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I went to see my wife.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You have a wife?
I'm PG, man.
Prison gay.
What happens in jail stays in jail.
So what happened with your wife?
She said she was going to wait for me, but there's a Jack in the Box where my house was.
She moved to San Diego with some Chinese guy, and they got three kids.
And a damn dog named Cleo.
Wow, that really sucks.
So can I get you some water or something?
- You know why I'm here.
- For water?
My parole officer said if I don't find an address by tonight, I got to go to a county facility.
I need a place to stay.
Look, look, Derek, I would love to help you, but I got to keep our relationship strictly professional.
But if you want to come here for anger therapy classes,
I'd be more than happy to do that.
- When's the next session?
- Tomorrow, 2:00 PM.
Great!
I'm going to wait on the couch.
Everybody, this is Derek.
Derek is a former member of my prison group.
I want to remind you all that, as always, everyone's private life is confidential.
- Nothing leaves this room.
- Unless he steals it.
Okay, let's just pick up where we left off last time.
- Patrick?
- Right, so...
I was at this restaurant having dinner with a friend, and this prick next to me says that I'm too loud and threatens to call the manager.
I got something like that.
I shared a cell with a Russian gangster and he said I talked too loud and if I didn't stop, he'd tie my balls around my neck.
He called it a "Moscow Bow Tie."
Look how much we all have in common.
- And what happened, Patrick?
- Never mind.
Lacey, how are things going with your mom?
She's insane.
If I want to keep getting my allowance, I have to get a job.
I thought parents were supposed to fund you unconditionally.
That's love you unconditionally.
They don't let dogs do that.
Well, she gives my dog an allowance, too, and he doesn't have to get a job.
I feel you, girl.
Parents can be frustrating.
Mine would burn me with cigarettes.
You learn to stop reaching across the table for food real quick.
Ed, I'm assuming you're going to pass on the story about the gum wrappers?
Uh, yeah.
You know, Prison-break Jones over there is not the only guy who has had a tough life.
I'm sorry, forgot your name.
My mother burned me, too, with unending, subtle critiques of my clothes.
You may not see the scars, but they're there.
Well, I think we can all take a lesson from this.
When you think your problems are really big, remember, at least no one is tying your junk around your neck.
Don't quote me on that.
- Hey, Derek.
How are you doing?
- Good, good.
Charlie's letting me crash for a few days, so I thought I'd help out a little.
Well, don't mind me.
I'm just going to borrow.
Charlie's washing machine for a couple of loads.
Mine keeps lighting up "unbalanced."
I think it's making fun of me.
You know what?
Let me get that for you.
I'm doing Charlie's and mine anyway.
Jennifer:
Wow, thank you.
Don't mind the granny panties.
They're not mine.
They just came with the basket.
If your washing machine's broke, I'm pretty handy.
- I can take a look at it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
That'd be great.
That'd be amazing.
Thank you.
Why is he doing your laundry?
Because he offered, like a gentleman, Charlie.
Is there a Mrs. Gentleman?
Wow.
Okay, I...
I should probably tell you something about Derek.
Not a ballplayer.
He was a member of the prison group I volunteer with.
- You're kidding.
- No.
Hard-core criminal. 12 years behind bars, grand theft auto, repeat offender, the whole package.
So he's good-looking, not afraid of commitment, and always drives a nice new car?
- Don't go there, Jen.
- Pardon me?
Don't get involved with this guy, Jen.
Do you really think I'm dumb enough to date a felon?
Why do you always second-guess everything I do?
Are you sure you want to ask me that question?
Why wouldn't...
hey, quit it.
As soon as you write my alimony check, give me some of that pizza and he's done with my laundry,
I'm out of here.
I can take care of myself.
Did you TiVo "Project Runway" for me?
- Yeah.
- I'm going to go watch it.
- Hi.
- Hey.
See that guy down there?
He's my patient.
- Oh, is he the one that can't get mad?
- Yeah, we'll see.
He thinks he's here because I'm setting him up on a date, but I want you to do everything you can to get him to the breaking point.
How about I marry him?
No, we're trying to get him mad, not kill him.
- Oh, I'm wet.
- Oh, I am so sorry.
I hope those weren't your good clothes.
No, I'm meeting a girl, but it's okay.
It was an honest mistake.
Oops.
That wasn't as honest.
Maybe I'll just have nuts.
Well, at least now you've got some where yours ought to be.
What's your name?
And I feel bad that Jen walked away thinking I called her stupid.
- Do you think Jen's stupid?
- No, no.
I mean, you and I, we have degrees, we read books, we're academic smart.
Jen is more...
"I'm going up the down escalator,
"I'm not getting anywhere, so I should probably turn around" smart.
You know, you might want to get down off your high horse there for a minute, buddy.
I know Jennifer, and while she's no Rhodes scholar, she's probably smarter than you are in a lot of ways.
I know one way she's not.
I know what Rhodes scholar means.
You know, there's lots of different types of intelligence, Charlie.
I bet, if I wanted to, I could make you feel dumb.
For example, spatial visual intelligence.
Move only two matches to make a decagon.
That's easy.
Define decagon.
10-sided figure.
And don't worry, even though you're dumb,
I still think you're pretty, and we're having sex tonight.
What's this?
You have to make a 10-sided figure moving only two matches.
I can do it moving one.
- There.
- Oh, my God.
She's a genius.
And if I do this and this... stick man with a boner.
( Mumbling )
Might have been a fluke.
You're right.
You're right.
I can be the bigger man.
I'm going to go apologize.
I'll meet you back at your place later.
- Okay.
- And for the record... stick man with a coke problem.
Stick man after a car accident... because of his coke problem.
Stick man living in a tent because he lost his house because of the car accident and his coke problem.
Who's the genius now?
- ( Knocking on door )
- Just a minute.
Oh, I'm sorry, I should have called.
Yeah, that would have been a good idea.
I was driving home and I thought,
I owe you an apology.
You're not stupid.
You're a smart person and you know exactly what you're doing.
Baby, if that's the food, just bring it to bed.
I'm getting ready to massage.
Oh, damn.
You don't answer the door when your nails are wet but you're in the middle of a prison rub-down and it's "Come on in."
( humming )
How stupid can one woman be?
I know this game.
Sarah Palin, Nancy Pelosi, or Jennifer your ex-wife.
- She's sleeping with Derek.
- I know it's unpopular, but I'm going to go with the liberal, Pelosi.
- Okay, pants off.
- I told her not to and then she got mad at me for assuming she'd do something stupid, and then what does she do?
The gay felon.
Did she even know he was gay?
Yeah, she knows.
She's a big girl.
She takes precautions.
I'm worried about the felon part.
Yeah, that's a reasonable concern.
Okay, I'll get the shirt.
I don't want this guy in my life.
He was in prison.
He steals things and hides them in his ass.
Hey, Charlie, where are your candlesticks?
I don't know.
Why don't you check my ex-wife's boyfriend's ass?
Charlie, you're upset.
We have a session tomorrow and we'll talk about this, so hold that thought.
But right now hold this and press the blue button three times.
One, two, three.
She knows what she's doing.
She's only doing this to piss me off.
- Whoa.
- Exactly.
I don't know how far she'll take this.
- Are you listening to me?
- ( Moans )
I can do two things at once.
If she's doing this just to piss you off, then the worst thing you can do... is show her you're upset.
Okay, I can't do two things at once.
Okay, you know what... just don't do anything and she'll stop acting crazy.
You're right.
She's just trying to get a reaction out of me.
- I'm not going to feed into that.
- Good.
Now, I need all of your attention.
I just want you to put all your efforts into pleasing me.
- What?
I just push the button again?
- Yeah.
- Am I actually a part of this?
- Shh.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I made breakfast.
I feel bad about yesterday.
Oh, it's all good.
You can kick it with Jen.
She's not my bitch no mo'.
She's just my baby mama.
- Are you trying to talk black?
- A little bit.
That's just how Charlie do.
Yeah, well, Charlie, don't.
You know, I'm proud of you.
I mean, in group, you tell us to let go of our anger and you do it.
You really walk the walk.
- Thank you.
- Because under normal circumstances, a guy comes into your house, eats your food, sleeps in your bed, oils up your ex-wife, a guy's got to get upset about that.
- Well, I always say lead by example.
- Yeah.
- Could you pass the butter, please?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
That's my butter!
You didn't ask!
You just took it!
And now you're going to smear it all over your toast right in front of me.
If you don't want me using your butter,
- all you got to do is say so.
- I don't want you using my butter.
It sure seems like a waste of good butter.
We're not talking about butter.
I know, I know, I know.
I'm going to put some honey on those biscuits.
- That's cool, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
Honey is just honey.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.
Hey, Boo.
Ready to head out to the beach?
Yeah, uh, about that...
- Can I talk to you out on the porch for a second?
- Okay.
Mmm, honey and biscuits.
- Ah!
- You son of a bitch!
- You told Derek to stop seeing me.
- What do you care?
This isn't about Derek.
You're just seeing him to piss me off.
You're so full of yourself, it's unbelievable!
I can't just like him?
- He's a felon.
- He's an ex-felon, and I'm a 40-year-old single mother living in Los Angeles.
I had to open up the dating pool.
I now accept bartenders, pirates, and magicians.
Look, I was in jail for a long time, but I earned my GED.
And I'm only two tests away from becoming a certified VCR repairman.
So...
See?
You always have to control everything that I do.
That's over.
From now on, I'm doing whatever I want to do and you have no say about it.
I don't agree with anything you just said.
And I don't care.
Starting now, we're just a normal divorced couple.
We're not friends.
When we run into each other at the market, it's weird.
If you're five minutes late dropping off Sam, we've got a problem.
Oh, and by the way, Green Goddesses... the woman who bought the LA franchise just got a boatload of contracts.
She's cleaning up.
And I meant to say it like that!
You're not supposed to be friends with your ex-wife anyway.
That's against nature.
I'm not saying it was easy, but it was definitely worth it.
And as a person, I like Jen.
My ex-wife and I hate each other.
- What about your kids?
- We hate them, too.
- ( Tires screeching )
- What the hell is...
I knew this guy was trouble.
Call the police.
Not every black man running has committed a crime.
They're right behind me!
I just stole a car!
You're making me look bad in front of my friend.
I'm going back to prison, Charlie.
I tried to make it work, but I miss Donovan.
Now I got to go get arrested in San Bernardino so I go back to the same prison.
No, this is crazy.
What about Jennifer?
Oh, your ex-wife is a beautiful woman, but it just didn't feel right.
I miss my monster.
( Helicopter blades whirring )
I gotta go, Charlie.
I hope you're not disappointed in me.
Well, it would've been nice if you'd have made your life work on the outside, but...
I got very little time and you're going on a bit.
Oh, I told Jennifer and she's a mess.
You might want to check in on her.
( Lisping ) I'll see you next week in group.
( Knocking on door )
That's great.
Now you're here to rub it in my face?
- Jennifer...
- No, no, no.
You did it, Charlie.
Once again, you proved you're smarter than me.
Smarter than I.
But that doesn't matter.
That's not why I'm here.
What's wrong with me?
I just...
I can't find it.
- ( laughing )
- What?
- I don't make good decisions.
- Yes, you do.
You dumped me.
That was mostly my mom and my sisters, a couple of psychics.
Look, you're not the one who has to change anything.
I think you're right.
I do try to control you.
I don't know, maybe it's just my way of making sure you still need me.
Or maybe you're just a butt-hole.
We can talk semantics all day.
What's important is that we stay friends.
It's been great for Sam and it's been great for me.
All right.
- But no more judging, okay?
- You got it.
Now, Hold Onto Your Hat.
- What?
- No, that's the company name.
It's a little Velcro strap that attaches your hat to your collar.
Thousands of hats are lost every year due to rainstorms, boats, and amusement park rides.
No one has an exact number, but the financial loss reaches well into the millions.
- What do you think?
- I think...
I mean, nobody likes losing a hat.
That's amazing!
That's our motto!
"Nobody likes losing a hat."
I...
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.
It's... it's a horrible idea.
You'll lose everything.
- That was just a test.
- No, it wasn't.
Okay, I'm into them for $1,000.
God, I need help.
It's okay.
We'll try and finance some kind of a
♪ franchise anonymous program.
I bet there isn't one.
- We can start that.
- Shut up.

BY BECOMING "ADMIRAL KIZARU" OF THE NAVY?

I DIDN'T COME HERE TO REMEMBER THE PAST.
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO MATCH MY SPEED WITH THAT HEAVY WEAPON.
WHAT WILL YOU USE THE DYNA ROCKS FOR?
I NEVER GOT ALONG WITH YOU!
RETURN THE DYNA ROCKS.
THEY SAY THAT THE DYNA ROCKS RIVAL THE ANCIENT WEAPONS.
HOW ABOUT WE USE THEM TO CELEBRATE OUR REUNION?
DYNA ROCKS CAUSE A MASSIVE EXPLOSION WHEN EXPOSED TO OXYGEN.
LET'S GO!

DAMM!
WHAT IN THE HELL IS THE NAVY DOING?
COME ON!

I'M ALWAYS A LIVELY SKELETON.

IT'S GOOD DRINKING WHILE WATCHING THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS.
CHOPPER?
YES!
I LOVE DRINKING MILK WHILE WATCHING THE LEAVES AS WELL!
IT'S ME!
MEAT!
IT STINKS!
I SMELL POISON!
IT'S A DEADLY POISON!
CHOPPER?
HE WAS POISONED?
CHOPPER!
HE TOOK POISON...
I REMEMBERED!
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT IT IS?
LISTEN TO THIS SONG..."THE POISON I TOOK".
IT'S A SONG?

THE TASTE OF THE DRINK IS...
OR WAS IT ALWAYS LIKE THIS?
THEY ARE ALWAYS SO LIVELY.
TAKING CARE OF PLANTS.
MY CHILDREN!
I WANT YOU TO GIVE BIRTH TO A LOT OF POP GREENS!

USOPP!
SO IT'S YOUR FAULT!
LOOK!
USOPP WAS CAUGHT BY THE POISONOUS MILK!
IT'S YOUR FAULT FOR BEING THERE!
THE POISON IS FOR KILLING WORMS!
IT MEANS YOU ARE WORMS!
WE ARE NOT INSECTS.
ARE YOU OK?
BUT IT'S ALSO PRETTY GOOD.
IT'S A LITTLE BITTER...
IS IT BECAUSE I'M BECOMING AN ADULT?
LET ME TRY IT.
THAT'S HORRIBLE!
AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS ALSO AFFECT THE HUMAN BODY.
I AM THE CHERRY TREE...
I'M SLOWLY SPREADING...

IT'S SNOW!
ITS NOT FREEZING TO BE SNOW.
WHAT IS IT?
THIS IS...
VOLCANIC ASHES!
VOLCANIC ASHES?

ONE PIECE FILM Z!

THAT'S DISGUSTING!
DID IT NOT?
LET'S TAKE A BATH TOGETHER AFTER.
-BATH?
-TOGETHER?

TODAY IS NOT MY BATH DAY...
THIS IS VERY DISGUSTING.
ME...
CAN I TAKE A BATH WITH YOU AS WELL?
CAN I?
MY FACE IS ALSO DISGUSTING!
DON'T HURT YOUR FEELINGS BY WHAT YOU SAID.
NO...
YOU CAN TAKE A BATH WITH ME!
CHOPPER!
NAMI!
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA?
THE NEEDLE THAT POINTED TO THE DIRECTION THAT CAME THE VOLCANIC ASHES
BEGAN ROTATING RANDOMLY.
IT IS A STRANGE MOVEMENT.
IT LOOKS LIKE A LOST CHILD WHO LOST THEIR PARENTS.
LOST?
HOW SO?
COULD'VE EXPLODED THE ENTIRE ISLAND.
AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE NEEDLE STOPPED POINTING?
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
THIS IS THE NEW WORLD!
?
YOU BASTARD.
DON'T BE SURPRISED.
DISAPPEAR BEFORE THE BEAUTY OF NAMI.
YOU CHERRY SHIT.
SOME TEA.
THANK YOU.
THE ISLAND THE NEEDLE WAS POINTING AT.
NAMI...
THERE IS SOMEONE WE CAN'T SHOW THAT POINTER BY ANY MEANS.
THAT'S TRUE.
CHOOSING THE SAFEST ROUTE
AND GUARANTEE THE CREW LIFE IS MY JOB.
THAT NEEDLE IS MOVING VERY INTERESTINGLY!
LUFFY!
?
LET'S GO THERE!
CRAP!
HE SAW IT!
I SMELL ADVENTURE!
THOSE ASHES WERE...
GUYS!
OUR ROUTE HAS BEEN DECIDED!
GET READY!
LUFFY!
...
BUT...
HOW WILL WE KNOW WHERE THE ISLAND IS...
BE QUIET.
I'M A NAVIGATOR.
I CAN TAKE YOU ANYWHERE.
KEEP AN EYE OUT.
LEAVE IT TO ME!
IS IT REALLY ALRIGHT CHOOSING IT LIKE THIS?
THE PATH YOU CHOOSE CAN COST US OUR LIVES.
TURN 20 DEGREES TO PORT.
TURNING 20 DEGREES TO PORT.
DO YOU HEAR ME?
SO PREPARE YOURSELVES!
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
HE IS THE CAPTAIN.
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED WITH VOLCANOES
OR ANYTHING THAT CAN THREATEN OUR LIVES!
CASTAWAY LOCATED.
PREPARE TO RESCUE HIM IMMEDIATELY!
HE'S BEING DRAGGED!
LEAVE IT TO ME!
WHATS WRONG?
I'M RUNNING OUT OF STRENGTH...
PULL!
DON'T LET GO YET!
ARE YOU OK?
SO?
IS HE ALIVE?
HE'S NOT IN DANGER.
REALLY?
I HOPE WE DIDN'T GET SOMEONE PROBLEMATIC AGAIN.
A BIG GUY ALL BRUISED!
AND THIS BUSINESS IN HIS LEFT ARM...
ANYONE CAN TELL ITS NOT JUST SOMETHING.
THATS REALLY MADE OF KAIROUSEKI.
I GET IT!
THATS WHY LUFFY LOST HIS STRENGTH WHEN HE TOUCHED IT.
A POWERFUL WEAPON MADE OF KAIROUSEKI...
AWESOME!
THATS NOT IT!
KAIROUSEKI HAS THE SAME ENERGY AS THE OCEAN.
A WEAPON MADE FROM THAT MATERIAL...
MEANS THAT IT WAS MADE TO END DEVIL FRUIT USERS.
HE MIGHT BE AN ENEMY.
AND WE CAN'T LOWER OUR GUARD IN THE NEW WORLD.
THROW HIM OVERBOARD.
IDIOT!
WE CAN'T DO THAT.
I DON'T WANT TO!
HE MIGHT KILL YOU AS SOON AS YOU HEAL HIM.
I'M A DOCTOR!
I CAN'T ABANDON HIM.
WHATS THE PROBLEM?
CHOPPER.
I'LL FINISH HIM OFF.
IS THAT ALRIGHT?
LUFFY!
OF COURSE IT'S ALRIGHT.
THEY ARE SO CAREFREE.
I REALLY HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS...
RIGHT?
THERE IS NO NEED FOR THAT KIND OF EXCITEMENT.
IT LOOKS LIKE HE WOKE UP!
IT SEEMS SO.
CRAPPY COOKER.
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
YOU SHIT MARIMO.
GOT THAT?
WE CAUGHT A BIG FISH.
ARE YOU OK?
YOU DON'T NEED TO FORCE YOURSELF.
DO YOU REMEMBER IT?
I REMEMBER.
THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT TREATMENT.
DOCTOR...?
CHOPPER!
DOCTOR CHOPPER.
YOU ARE A GREAT MEDIC.
YOU IDIOT!
YOU ARE THE CAPTAIN OF THIS SHIP?
CAN YOU TELL?
YES I CAN.
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU.
I'M A SPECIALIST WHEN IT COMES TO UNDERSTANDING YOUR POWERS.
REALLY?
WHAT WILL YOU DO?
STAY WITH US UNTIL WE ARRIVE TO THE NEXT ISLAND?
MY FRIENDS SHOULD BE USING THAT TO GET HERE.
OLD MAN...
THATS A COOL WEAPON!
WHERE DO THEY SELL THOSE?
A CRAZY SCIENTIST FROM THE NAVY MADE THIS ONE FOR ME.
BATTLE SMASHER.
THE WEAKNESS OF THE DEVIL FRUIT USERS
THIS WAY I DESTROY THEIR POWER AND CRUSH THEM WITH THIS POWERFUL SQUEEZE.
I DON'T RECOMMEND SOMETHING HEAVY LIKE THIS.
AWESOME!
SO SOMETHING TERRIBLE CAN HAPPEN
IF I FALL WITH IT ON THE OCEAN.
ARE YOU A MARINE?
SO I LEFT THEM.
I'M DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT NOW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M FIGHTING FOR THE MISSION I GAVE MYSELF.
WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING AGAINST?
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M BEING QUESTIONED.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
IT'S JUST THAT IT WOULD BE BAD FOR US IF YOU WERE A MARINE.
WOULD THERE BE A PROBLEM IF I WERE A MARINE?
WE ARE PIRATES.
REALLY?
YOU ARE PIRATES.
LUFFY!
GO OUTSIDE!
PLEASE.
HOW PAINFUL...
A PUNCH FROM A KAIROUSEKI WEAPON REALLY WORKS.
STRAW HAT...
WHY ARE YOU A PIRATE?

DAMN!
BROOKE!
LET'S FIGHT TOO!
OK!
THEY'RE HERE?
AIN!
WE ARE CONFISCATING THIS PIRATE SHIP.
DO NOT RESIST.
YOU WILL ONLY SHORTEN YOUR LIVES.
THERE IS NO PIRATE THAT DOESN'T RESIST WHEN HE'S ASKED NOT TO!
EVEN WE STARTED TO ATTACK!
MOSA MOSA!
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
-THATS IS...
-A DEVIL FRUIT USER!
MOSA MOSA NO MI ABILITY...
MOSA MOSA DANCE CAN CONTROL EVERY PLANT THERE IS!
THINGS LOOK DANGEROUS OUT THERE AS WELL.

MOSA MOSA!
HE'S SO FAST THAT I CAN'T ESTABLISH A TARGET!
MOSA MOSA!
MOSA MOSA MOSA!

BROOKE!
STOP!
SEIS FLEUR!
RIGHT?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH NAMI AND CHOPPER?
ROBIN!
STOP USING YOUR ABILITY!
MODO MODO!
I ATE THE MONO MONO NO MI.
I AM A REGRESSIVE PERSON.
MY ABILITY CAN TRANSFORM ANYTHING 12 YEARS IN TIME.
NOW YOU SHOULD BE ABOUT 18 YEARS OLD.
I'M SO TINY!
MAKING YOUR EXISTENCE DISAPPEAR.
SMASH BUSTER!
MOSA MOSA!
YOU'LL BECOME THE PIRATE KING WITH THAT POWER ALONE?
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.
SHOULD I CRUSH YOU LIKE THIS?
PIRATE KING?
WHAT'S YOU'RE NAME?
MONKEY D. LUFFY.
I GET IT.
YOU'RE GARP GRANDSON.
I'M HAPPY YOU'RE ALRIGHT.
WE'RE DESTROYING THIS PIRATE SHIP WITH A SIMULTANEOUS ATTACK FROM OUT FLEET.
LUFFY!
LUFFY?
Z!
I WILL OBLITERATE EVERY SINGLE PIRATE!
TRY TO SURVIVE WHILE YOU STILL CAN.
PIRATES!
DAMN!
WAIT!
...
OUR FIGHT...
OUR FIGHT ISN'T OVER YET!
SUNNY!
...
DAMN!
TAKE THAT OFF!
WE'RE REALLY IN DANGER!
LUFFY!
LET'S RUN!
LET'S RETREAT!
COME ON!
DAMN!
I'M FREE!
SUPER!
...
SUNNY!
I BELIEVE IN YOU!
EMERGENCY ESCAPE SYSTEM!
COUP D'BURST!
THEY REALLY DID THAT.
THEY ARE OUR TRUMP CARD TO PROTECT THE FINAL POINTS OF THE PIRATES.
USING THE DYNA ROCKS TO DESTROY THE FINAL POINTS...
THE FIRST FINAL POINT SANK WITH THE BASE THAT PROTECTED THEM.
Z OBJECTIVE IS TO DESTROY THE THREE FINAL POINTS AND DESTROY THE SEA OF THE NEW WORLD.
EVEN THAT MAN WOULD GET INJURED IF HE WAS CAUGHT IN THE DYNA ROCKS EXPLOSION.
HE'S ALIVE.
EVERYONE HERE MUST KNOW THIS.
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHEN TO FALL.
Z....
BLACK FIST ZEPHYR
HE IS ALIVE.
NO MATTER THE COST.
HE MAY HAVE TAKEN CARE OF US IN THE PAST...
ENEMY OF JUSTICE.
AND EVERYONE WHO'S PART OF THE NEW NAVY EVEN IF Z IS ALIVE.
THEY ALL SHOULD BE DISPOSED OF IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE.
HUNT Z AND HIS NEW NAVY WITH ALL THE POWER OF THE NAVY!
LET'S RECOVER THE DYNA ROCKS AND EXECUTE ABSOLUTE JUSTICE!
THE WORLD WOULD BE AS WELL.
IS THAT REALLY A LIE?
YOU THINK THAT IF IT WAS A LIE WE WOULD TAKE THIS SO SERIOUSLY?
I UNDERSTAND WHAT Z IS PLANING.
HE WANTS TO END WITH ALL THE PIRATES OF THE NEW WORLD.
THAT BECOMES POSSIBLE.
HE'LL KILL ALL THE INNOCENT CITIZENS AS WELL.
VICE-ADMIRAL GARP...
WHO IS THIS Z?
A MAN WHO WAS OUR COMRADE ONCE.
WE WERE FRIENDS.
WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMRADES.
ZEPHYR...
YOUR ANGER IS SO STRONG TO DESTROY THE WORLD?
DO YOU HATE US THAT MUCH?
LUFFY!
I'M GOING TO COMPLETELY FIX SUNNY!
RIGHT?
I'M LEAVING SUNNY WITH YOU!
THIS IS FOR THE DOCTOR.
THIS IF FOR THE LOAD...
I'M SO SORRY...
ALL OF THIS BECAUSE I WANTED TO SAVE THAT Z.
DON'T APOLOGIZE.
A PIRATE SHOULDN'T REGRET DOING WHAT HE BELIEVED IN.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
WE ALL KNOW THAT.
THANK YOU.
NEW NAVY...
WHO COULD THAT Z BE?
E ATTACKED OUT OF NOWHERE!
THE ABILITY OF THAT BINZ IS PROBLEMATIC.
NEXT TIME WE ARE GOING TO SETTLE THINGS STRAIGHT.
THAT SHOWED SO MUCH BRAVERY.
WE WOULD ALL BE SWIMMING AT SEA BECAUSE OF THE NAVY ATTACK.
WE NEED TO FIND THAT NEW NAVY AND PAY THEM BACK.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
!
I DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH THOSE DANGEROUS PEOPLE AGAIN.
LET'S JUST STAY IN THIS ISLAND UNTIL SUNNY IS REPAIRED!
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
MY BODY WON'T RETURN TO NORMAL!
ME NEITHER!
I DON'T WANT TO STAY LIKE THIS!
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING!
THE NAVIGATION IN THE NEW WORLD WILL BE A LOT HARDER!
SO I CAN GUIDE SUNNY GO!
THAT'S RIGHT!
I DIDN'T SAID FOR YOU TO CONTINUE LIKE THIS.
IT WOULD BE A PROBLEM IF I DIDN'T RETURN TO NORMAL AS WELL.
I BET YOU'RE HAPPY TO BE 18 AGAIN AND HAVING EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT PLACE AGAIN.
I'M SORRY!
HONESTLY.
DON'T JOKE AROUND WHEN OUR LADIES ARE IN TROUBLE.
WAIT A SECOND...
THAT MEANS I'LL BE ABLE TO CLOSELY FOLLOW NAMI'S PRECIOUS DAYS WHILE HER BODY MATURES?
I'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THE MOMENT WHEN THE LARVA TURNS INTO A BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY?
!
THAT'S INCREDIBLY AWESOME!
DISGUSTING.
YOU MARIMO!
I'D GIVE YOU A LESSON.
IDIOT!
...
I'D DEFEAT YOU EVEN AS A KID!
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
WITH 3 YEAR OLD!
IDIOT!
...
AND I WOULD HAVE DEFEATED YOU WHEN I WAS A BABY!
-HU?
!
-WHAT DID YOU SAY?
!
THIS IS NO TIME TO FIGHT!
YOU KNOW...
MY AGE WAS ALSO DECREASED...
IT LOOKS LIKE...
IT DIDN'T CHANGE...
ANYTHING...
I WAS ALSO TOUCHED BY THAT AIN FROM THE NEW NAVY.
IT'S TRUE.
BUT IT DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING...
DEAD AND ONLY BONES.
I'VE BEEN A CORPSE FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS...
BUT SOMETHING CHANGED THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.
MY AGE WENT BACK 12 YEARS.
MY HAIR HAS THE SOFTNESS OF 12 YEARS AGO!
NO IT HASN'T!
YOU PAINTED YOUR HAIR!
THEN WERE YOU HAPPY TO REJUVENATE?
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO BACK?
THAT'S RIGHT.
NO!
I ALSO WANT...
TO RETURN TO NORMAL?
HOW DO I KNOW?
!
WE HAVE TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT Z AND THE NEW NAVY.
OLD MAN?
TALK TO OUR NAVIGATOR.
DID Z SHOWED UP AGAIN?
DO YOU KNOW Z?
MANY PIRATE SHIPS HAVE BEEN ATTACKED AROUND HERE AND COMES TO THESE DOCKS.
ALL THE INJURED PIRATES SAY THEY WERE ATTACKED BY Z.
THEY ARE ALL PIRATES SAYING THEY WERE ATTACKED BY Z.
WE RECEIVE THE SHIPS THAT WERE TOTALLY DESTROYED BY THE NAVY.
SO HE TAKES CARE OF THE PIRATES OR ANYONE THAT COMES WITH A PROBLEM.
SEARCHING FOR THEIR DREAMS.
LOST THEIR WAY AND ABANDONED THE NEW WORLD.
Z IS STEALING THE MEN FREEDOM ON THE SEA.
I WON'T ACCEPT THAT.
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU MY STRONGEST EQUIPMENT I HAVE STORED.
STRONGEST EQUIPMENT?
AMAZING!
A POWERFUL EQUIPMENT!
WAIT A SECOND!
NAMI?
HE SAID THE STRONGEST!
THE STRONGEST!
WE HAVE TO PURSUE Z!
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT FIRST.
WE'RE GOING TO RAISE SUSPICION WHEN WE ARE LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT HIM.
FIRST WE HAVE TO GATHER INFORMATION AND CLOTHES!
THE STRONGEST EQUIPMENT TO DEFEAT Z COMES AFTER THAT!
GOT IT.
RIGHT?
DO YOU HAVE ANY BIG CITY ON THIS ISLAND WHERE WE CAN GET SOME INFORMATION AND CLOTHES?
THIS ISLAND HAS NOTHING BESIDES OUR DOCKS.
HOW ABOUT YOU GO TO THE NEIGHBORING ISLAND?
THEY ARE VERY POPULAR FOR THE HOT SPRINGS AND VOLCANOES.
IT HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE VISITING!
SEA TRAIN?
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THAT SEA TRAIN?
YES.
BONES.
YOU GUYS ARE VERY STRANGE.
LEAVE IT TO US THAT WE'LL GATHER THE INFORMATION.
ROBIN-CHWAN?
SANJI.
A LOVER FACE ALSO WON'T DO.
WE WILL GATHER THE INFORMATION!
NO...
BUT I WANTED TO GO WITH YOU...
LET'S ENJOY THE HOT SPRINGS.
HOW ABOUT WE REST BEFORE THE BATTLE?
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM.
LOOKS LIKE THERE IS SOME GREAT BRANDS ON THIS ISLAND.
WE'RE HERE!
DON'T GET YOURSELVES CAUGHT BY THE NAVY!
SPREAD OUT!
HONESTLY...
DEVIL FRUIT USERS ARE FULL OF WEAK POINTS!
THEY LOSE THEIR STRENGTH EVEN WITH THAT?
WE WILL STILL SURVIVE.
THAT'S NICE.
CAN WE REALLY STAY HERE WASTING OUR TIME?
THAT Z!
YOU IDIOT!
IT WILL CAUSE US TROUBLE AGAIN.
RIGHT?
THAT WE'RE LETTING THEM AND CHOPPER GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT Z?
RIGHT?
A BEAUTIFUL DANCER!
....
EVERYONE IS SO EXCITED!
SIR.
SIR?
PLEASE!
I CAN FEEL IT...
I CAN FEEL IT IN MY BONES...
EVERYTHING GOES AWAY ALONG WITH THE EXHAUSTION.
Z....
I GOT DISTRACTED WITH THE WEAPON IN HIS ARM AND I LET MY GUARD DOWN.
AND YOU ATTACK HIM WITHOUT THINKING...
YOU'LL LOSE ALL YOUR STRENGTH.
LET ME AND MARIMO TAKE CARE OF Z.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO ANYTHING.
I WILL FINISH HIM OFF.
I'LL DODGE THAT ARM OF HIS AND ATTACK HIM WITH EVERYTHING I GOT!
YOU'RE LIVELY AS ALWAYS.
I GOT TIRED OF WAITING FOR YOU GUYS HERE.
AOKIJI!
GUYS?
WHO IS THIS PERSON?
A MARINE!
ADMIRAL AOKIJI OF THE NAVY!
ADMIRAL?
!
HI THERE.
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?
WE'VE FINISHED POSITIONING THE DYNA ROCKS.
UNDERSTOOD.
THOSE NAVY BRATS...
WILL KNOW OF MY RAGE AND THE SCALE OF MY HATRED.
SANJI!
-YES!
WHAT DOES AN ADMIRAL WANT WITH ME?
DON'T GET TOO EXCITED.
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH US?
DON'T TELL ME...
IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT.
I DON'T WANT TO CAPTURE YOU NOW.
YOU SHOULD'VE KNOWN THAT.
I'M NOT A NAVY ADMIRAL ANYMORE.
THEN WHAT ARE YOU?
WHAT?
I DON'T LIKE A SKELETON ASKING ME THAT...
BUT SINCE I'M NOT AN ADMIRAL ANYMORE...
AM I AN ALLY OF JUSTICE?
THAT'S NOT IT...
WHAT AM I?
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?
THAT'S IT.
I HAVE NO INTENTION OF FIGHTING WITH YOU NOW.
I WOULDN'T BE IN A HOT SPRING WHERE I CAN'T USE MY POWERS.
YOU WERE WAITING FOR US?
THAT'S RIGHT.
I DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE ANYMORE...
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REST OUTSIDE.
THIS?
...
I GOT CARRIED AWAY TOO MUCH.
HAVE YOU FOUND ANYTHING?
I HEARD SOME RUMORS THAT A FEW MARINES CAME TO THIS ISLAND AFTER Z.
BUT I COULDN'T GET ANYTHING MORE.
HU?
REALLY HAS MORE MARINES ARRIVING BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE OF Z OR DUE TO ROBIN'S POPULARITY.
ROBIN IS THAT MUCH POPULAR?
JUST LOOK AT HOW MUCH I GOT FOR BEING HER MANAGER!
AWESOME!
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH RUMORS ALONE.
WHAT WILL WE DO?
I KNOW!
LEAVE IT TO ME.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU LEG?
THERE ARE THINGS THAT IT'S BEST NOT TO ASK?
THEN I WON'T ASK...
WHY DID YOU FOUGHT AGAINST AKAINU?
AREN'T YOU BOTH FRIENDS?
WELL.
YOU'RE REALLY A BRAT WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION..
NO COMMENTS ABOUT THAT TOO.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
YOU REALLY DON'T LEARN ANYTHING.
THAT I CAN ANSWER YOU.
ENJOYING THE HOT SPRINGS.
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO SAY...
I CAN'T STAY RELAXING TOO MUCH.
I'M CHASING AFTER A CERTAIN MAN.
RIGHT?
Z...
WASN'T HE?
HE IS A FORMER NAVY ADMIRAL.
SORRY FOR THE WAIT.
THANK YOU.
BUT YOU STRIVE A LOT.
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY COOL STORY TO TELL ME?
YOU KNOW Z?
HOW DO YOU KNOW Z?
EVERYONE KNOWS HIM!
THE ADULTS ARE TALKING...
THAT YOU'VE COME HERE TO CAPTURE Z!
THE RUMORS ARE ALREADY SAYING THAT?
HEY!
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
Z IS REALLY IN THIS ISLAND?
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'VE COME HERE TO TAKE THE BAD GUY Z.
WE ARE HEROES OF JUSTICE!
WHAT IS Z OBJECTIVE?
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE ON THIS ISLAND?
THAT'S ENOUGH.
TO DESTROY THE END POINT.
END POINT?
...
IS THAT A LIE JUST TO SCARE ME?
IT SO HAPPENS THAT IT'S NOT A LIE...
THAT'S ENOUGH!
YOU GUYS DRANK TOO MUCH ALREADY.
YOU'RE TALKING TOO MUCH.
SIR!
YOUNG LADY.
IS THERE ANY OBJECTIVE BEHIND THAT?
NO!
THAT MAN ASKED ME TO ASK ABOUT Z!
CRAP!
IT REALLY IS A STRANGE MAN.
NAMI THREW THE BLAME ON US!
SHOULD WE RUN FOR IT?
BUT IT'S ENOUGH DISGUISING MYSELF AS A MANAGER.
I HAVE GOT TO WORK.
YOUNG LADY?
LET ME GO!
SEIS FLEUR!
-LET'S RUN AWAY!
-YES.
-CAPTAIN!
-ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
THAT'S THE POWER OF THE HANA HANA NO MI!
THAT WOMAN IS NICO ROBIN OF THE STRAW HAT PIRATES!
DON'T LET HER ESCAPE!
SIR!
THE WORLD IS IN THE GREAT ERA OF THE PIRATES.
ARISE AND VANISH PIRATES THAT GO AFTER THE ONE PIECE.
OTHER ARE BORN.
DOES PIRATES APPEAR BECAUSE THE ONE PIECE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEA OF THE NEW WORLD?
OR DOES ONE PIECE EXISTS BECAUSE PIRATES ALSO EXIST?
DO DREAMS COME FIRST?
OR IS IT THE PEOPLE?
...
THEY LOOSE THEIR HAPPINESS AND THE LOVED ONES CRY FOR THEM.
WHAT MUST BE DONE?
IS THERE AN ANSWER?
FOUND AN ANSWER BY FORCE.
SO WILL THE PIRATES.
IS IT NOT?
BUT I WANT TO SEE WHERE DOES THE BATH THAT Z HAS CHOSEN WILL TAKE HIM.
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT.
STRAW HAT LUFFY.
RIGHT?
SHOW ME YOUR ANSWER.
SEE YOU LATER.
Z IS ON THIS ISLAND.
WE ENDED UP CREATING A HUGE CONFLICT!
BUT WE GOT THE INFORMATION WE NEEDED!
Z IS ON THIS ISLAND!
DESPITE NOT KNOWING WHAT HE PLANS.
THERE THEY ARE!
GO ON AHEAD!
DEVIL!
THAT'S IT!
LET'S REGROUP WITH LUFFY AND THE OTHERS?
YES!
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE CLOTHES I GOT YOU?
I MEAN.
-WITH YOU?
!
I HAVE A GREAT TASTE.
SHUT UP...
PIRATES!
LUFFY!
USOPP AND THE OTHER ARRIVED.
AND THEY BROUGHT A LOT OF FRIENDS ALONG.
THEY CAUSED A MESS.
WE SHOULD HAVE ...
LEAVE A FEW UNHARMED!
TAKE CARE OF THEM...
PLEASE.
THAT'S...
HAOUSHOKU NO HAKI...
HEY!
WHERE IS Z?
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND.
MY SQUAD SHOULD BE CHASING HIM NOW.
TEKKAI!
YOUR JUSTICE IS USELESS.
FREEDOM...
YOU'LL HAVE TO START EVERYTHING ALL OVER AGAIN.
IT LOOKS LIKE THE DYNA ROCKS WORKED ON THIS ISLAND.
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SECOND END POINT WAS A SUCCESS.
GRANDE IMBUTO.
WE'LL ACHIEVE THAT GOAL WHEN THE THIRD END POINT IS DESTROYED.
A BEAUTIFUL DAWN.
GOMU GOMU NO...
RIFLE!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU PIRATE BRATS......!
WHO ARE YOU CALLING A BRAT?
OLD GEEZER!
OLD MAN!
RETURN MY FRIENDS BACK TO NORMAL!
BINZ!
YES!
UNDERSTOOD.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE SWORDSMAN.
DAMN MARIMO!
GOING AHEAD LIKE THAT...
GUYS!
MOSA!
MOSA!
RIGHT?
COME AND GET IT THE PIRATE WAY!
DAMN!
WE'VE GOT NOT CHOICE.
USOPP!
I'M GOING TO FIGHT Z ONE ON ONE.
LUFFY!
Z...!
HELP ME!
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN AWAY!
SOMEONE HELP US!
STOP RIGHT THERE.
GO TO THE SEA TRAIN AND BE CAREFUL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
DOESN'T HE CARE ABOUT ANYONE?
ISN'T THIS TOO MUCH CRAZINESS?
THIS TIME YOU WONT CATCH ME WITH THAT WEAPON!
YOU ACCELERATED THE FLOW OF YOUR BLOOD.
TO INCREASE THE SKILLS OF YOUR BODY OVER THE LIMIT?
GEAR SECOND!
RIGHT?
YES!
I'LL FIND THE ONE PIECE AND BECOME THE PIRATE KING!
I GET IT NOW...
BUT DO YOU HAVE DETERMINATION?
ARE YOU DETERMINED TO RISK YOUR OWN LIFE?
I AM!
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS?
!
ARE YOU PREPARED TO SACRIFICE YOUR FRIENDS IN ORDER TO FULFILL YOUR OBJECTIVE
AND WALK ON TOP OF THEIR CORPSES TO CONTINUE?
HURRY UP!
THEIR NOT HERE YET?
WE'LL ALSO BE CAUGHT BY THE VOLCANO!
ARE THEY ALRIGHT?
MODO!
THAT'S ENOUGH!
I'LL KILL YOU NEXT TIME.
TIME'S UP!
LOOK AT THIS!
SHE RAN AWAY?
WHAT A CRAZY NINJA...
YOU WON'T HIT ME WITH ANY ATTACK!
WHO SAID I WAS AFRAID?
!
...
FEAR AND PAIN WEAKEN YOUR DETERMINATION.
SMASH TORNADO!
BULLETS WONT WORK!
REALLY?
I'M LOOSING MY STRENGTH...
YOUR BODY WON'T MOVE ANYMORE.
THIS AMMO IS MADE OF KAIROUSEKI.
DID YOU?
IT'S NOT AN EASY TASK GETTING KAIROUSEKI.
BUT WORKS WONDERS ON THOSE WHO ARE TOO CONVINCED IN THEIR OWN POWER AND LET THEIR GUARD DOWN.
YOU TOO ARE A SINFUL MAN.
THIS STRAW HAT ALSO GOT OLD...
TOGETHER WITH THIS GREAT PIRATE AGE.
GIVE IT BACK!
TO TAKE CARE OF IT!
I PROMISED I WOULD FIND HIM AND GIVE HIM THAT HAT BACK!
GIVE IT BACK!
THE REDHEAD?
!
HIS SINS ARE ALSO DEEP...
GIVE IT BACK.
DON'T YOU WORRY.
HE WILL HAVE THE SAME FATE AS YOU.
THOSE CONVINCED FOOLS WHO CALL THEM SELVES THE FOUR EMPERORS...
WILL ALL DIE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DO ANYTHING...
WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING OF MY PLAN.
DON'T MOCK ON SHANKS!
THAT'S NOT GOOD!
IT SEEMS THAT THE PYROCLASTIC FLOW BEGAN.
USOPP!
WHERE IS LUFFY?
...
LUFFY!
LUFFY!
LUFFY!
LUFFY!
LUFFY!
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING AGAINST THAT.
GUYS!
REALLY?
THEY SAY ITS MORE THAN 100 KM/H!
I GET IT!
HISSATSU MIDORI BOSSHI!
BOATY BANANA!
JUMP!
WE NEED MORE SPEED!
IT HAS NO ENGINE!
IT'S JUST A BOAT!
LOOK OUT!
WE'RE GONNA HIT!
IT ALSO HAS NO HELM!
IT'S JUST A BOAT!
...
TO THE RIGHT!
NOW IT'S DIVIDED IN TWO!
WE WON'T MAKE IT!
DAMN IT!
THEY'RE HERE!
HUH!
IT BLEW UP THE ENTIRE ISLAND...
MASTER...
WHAT ABOUT THAT STRAW HAT GUY?
THE FIRE MOUNTAIN WILL DECIDE HIS FATE.
ONE PIECE?
EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD?
WHAT A RIDICULOUS DREAM.
HOW MANY SACRIFICES DO THEY THINK IT TOOK?
HOW MUCH SUFFERING AND HATRED?
THEN I'LL SQUASH IT ALL!
TO THE VERY LAST.
YOUR DREAMS WILL END IN DEEP HATRED.
WILL CLOSE THE CURTAINS ON THE GREAT PIRATE AGE!
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM IN THE PAST WAS REALLY TERRIBLE.
INVOLVING INNOCENT CIVILIANS AS A MOTIVE...
IT IS NOT RIGHT...
DRY AS ALWAYS...
NOT EVERYONE CAN EASILY SEPARATE THINGS LIKE YOU DO.
SENGOKU?
VICE-ADMIRAL GARP!
WHAT IS IT?
ADMIRAL ZEPHYR...
WHAT KIND OF PERSON WAS HE?
BELIEVED IN THE NAVY JUSTICE.
THEN WHY IS HE DOING THIS?
A CERTAIN ACCIDENT HAPPENED.
AN ACCIDENT?
ZEPHYR WAS A SERIOUS MAN.
AND HE RISKED HIS LIFE FIGHTING AGAINST THE RIVALS OF THAT ERA.
HE BECAME AN ADMIRAL OF THE NAVY WHEN HE WAS STILL YOUNG.
HIS WIFE AND SON WERE KILLED BY A PIRATE THAT HATED ZEPHYR.
BY FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE BURDEN OF HAVING A POSITION AS A NAVY ADMIRAL...
ZEPHYR KEPT THAT HATRED AND SADNESS IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART
AND CONTINUED HIS MISSION.
THE YEARS PASSED AND ZEPHYR PLEDGED HIMSELF ON TRAINING THE YOUNG MARINES.
THE MAN WHO CREATED ALL MARINES...
ARE HIS APPRENTICES.
I WANT TO CREATE A HERO.
A BIGGER TRAGEDY FELL UPON HIM.
THE TRAINING SHIP OF THE NEW RECRUITS COMMANDED BY ZEPHYR
WAS ATTACKED BY A PIRATE WITH DEVIL FRUIT POWERS.
EVERYONE ELSE WERE KILLED.
ZEPHYR LOST HIS ARM.
TOOK AN ARM FROM A NAVY ADMIRAL?
FROM THE NAVY SCIENTISTS.
HE CREATED AN ATTACK UNIT.
AND HE HUNTED DOWN DEVIL FRUIT USERS.
BUT THAT WAS WHEN THEY WEREN'T DISAPPOINTED WITH THE NAVY.
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS KEEPING HIM IN THE NAVY WAS DESTROYED.
WAS CHOSEN TO BE A WAR LORD BY THE GOVERNMENT.
ZEPHYR LEFT THE NAVY.
AND NOW HE SHOWED UP IN THE NEW WORLD.
HATING PIRATES...
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE NAVY...
THE NEW NAVY.
THE UNACCEPTABLE REALITY...
HAS CHANGED THAT MAN.
NAVY!
WHY DOES BLACK FIST ZEPHYR IS CALLED Z NOW?
Z..........
WHO KNOWS?
I CAN'T SAY THAT.
ENEMIES WITHOUT HESITATION ARE STRONG.
THE SEA IS WATCHING...
THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD...
THE SEA KNOWS...
OF THE END OF THE WORLD...
EVEN IF I DISAPPEAR...
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING...
YOU SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID THE ORIENTATIONS OF THE SEA.
AS YOU ARE HERE YOU SHOULD NOT FEAR IT.
BECAUSE YOUR FRIEND ARE WAITING FOR YOU.
MASTER.
A SONG FOR THE MARINES WHO TRAVEL NORTH DOES NOT EXCITE ME.
DIDN'T YOU?
YES.
THIS IS THE BEST DRINK.
IMITATING YOU.
I WANTED TO BE A COOL MAN LIKE YOU.
YOU CAME TO GIVE A LECTURE TO A STUBBORN OLD MAN?
BUT I WON'T STOP.
DO YOU INTEND TO DIE?
THERE IS NO PROBLEM.
IT'S TO GET RID OF THE EVIL CALLED PIRATES.
THE NAVY CAN'T EXECUTE THE TRUE JUSTICE.
BUT STEP ASIDE.
LET'S DRINK TOGETHER.
I DON'T WANT TO KILL YOU.
NEITHER DO I.
MASTER ZEPHYR...
THIS IS A KAIROUSEKI BULLET?
IT WAS ON LUFFY'S SHOULDER.
HOW LONG WILL YOU STAY HERE?
A-AOKIJI!
YOU!
...
WHAT IS AOKIJI DOING HERE?
IT'S ALRIGHT.
WE MET A FEW MOMENTS AGO.
Z IS A FORMER NAVY ADMIRAL?
HE STOLE THE DYNA ROCKS FROM THE NAVY.
DYNA ROCKS?
!
WHAT IS THAT?
THOSE ARE ROCKS THEY SAY IT HAS A POWER COMPARABLE TO THE ANCIENT WEAPONS.
THEY CREATE A MASSIVE EXPLOSION.
IT'S USE IS FORBIDDEN IN CIVIL ZONES.
THE NAVY HAS CONTROL OF THEM ALL.
AND NOW Z STOLE THEM?
HE WANTS TO USE THEM TO DESTROY THE THREE END POINT'S OF THE NEW WORLD.
STOP RIGHT THERE!
WHAT ARE THESE END POINTS?
AND THEY CALL IT END POINT.
I DOUBTED IT...
DOES THAT REALLY EXIST?
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT BREASTED LADY TURNED INTO THIS DULL LITTLE GIRL...
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?
!
DOES THE END POINT REALLY EXIST?
OR NOT?
THEY DO.
SECOND...
ALL THE PIRATES MUST BE LAUGHING THINKING THINKING IT'S NONSENSE.
BUT NO ONES BELIEVES IT.
BUT THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATED AND DECLARED THE LEGEND WAS FALSE!
IT'S BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATION RESULTS WERE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS ANNOUNCED.
THE GOVERNMENT USED EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS TO MAKE THE WORLD BELIEVE IT WAS A LIE.
DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE IF PIRATES SHOWED UP WANTING TO USE THAT?
ONLY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE NAVY SUPERIORS KNOW ABOUT THAT.
BUT NO ONE NEVER THOUGHT A FORMER ADMIRAL WOULD USE THAT.
THAT'S TRUE.
THE NAVY WOULDN'T BE SO DESPERATE.
WE GOT INVOLVED WITH A VERY DANGEROUS MAN.
Z ALREADY DESTROYED TWO END POINTS WITH THE DYNA ROCKS.
IF HE DESTROYS THE LAST ONE...
THERE WILL BE A CHAIN REACTION THAT CONNECTS ALL THREE END POINTS.
REACTION?
THAT WILL BURN THE ENTIRE NEW WORLD SEA!
EVERY SINGLE PIRATE IN THE NEW WORLD WILL GET BURNED TO DEATH.
HE'LL ALSO INVOLVE THE INNOCENT PEOPLE!
WAIT A SECOND!
HE WILL INVOLVE CIVILIANS...
THAT'S JUST WRONG!
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE THINKING TOO MUCH ABOUT YOURSELVES?
HOW MUCH FEAR AND VICTIMS DO YOU THINK PIRATES CAUSE IN THE WORLD?
DON'T TELL ME YOU DON'T KNOW.
Z HATES ALL OF THAT...
HE HATES IT SO MUCH THAT HE DOESN'T CARE IF HE DIES ALONG.
IT DOESN'T MATTER!
I'M GOING THERE TO GET MY HAT BACK!
I'M GOING TO SETTLE THINGS WITH HIM!
LUFFY?
THE NEW WORLD WILL BE DESTROYED!
I PROMISED SHANKS.
THAT I WOULD BECOME A GREAT PIRATE AND RETURN HIM THAT HAT.
I WON'T BE ABLE TO BECOME THE PIRATE KING.
BUT YOU KNOW...
THE NEW WORLD WILL...
THAT WON'T WORK WITH THE STUBBORNNESS OF OUR CAPTAIN.
WHICH WAY?
YES.
LET'S SEE...
SO I'LL FOLLOW HIM.
THEN LET'S GO.
DO WE REALLY NEED TO DO THAT?
ISN'T THE FATE OF THE NEW WORLD TOO MUCH FOR US?
YOU TWO WANT TO STAY?
YOU IDIOT?
WHEN DID I SAID THAT?
OF COURSE I'M GOING!
I'M THE BRAVE SEA WARRIOR!
CHOPPER?
YES!
LET'S GO!
WAR WITH THAT DARNED MAN!
HOW MUCH LONGER?
IT'S READY!
...
THE REPAIR IS FINISHED!
WE CAN GO AT ANY TIME!
SUPER!
THANK YOU!
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
IT SEEMS THEY'VE DECIDED.
WHERE Z IS...
IT'S THIS WAY.
AN ETERNAL POSE?
!
WHY ARE YOU GIVING THIS TO US?
WHY?
YOU CAN'T GO TO THE ISLAND WHERE Z IS.
BUT...
THEY ALSO WENT TO THE LAST ISLAND.
THE NAVY TOO?
THE NAVY IS TAKING IT SERIOUSLY NOW.
YOU'LL BE DESTROYED ALONG WITH THE NEW WORLD.
YOU'LL BE SURROUNDED BY THE NAVY AND YOU'LL ALSO BE DESTROYED.
I WANT TO SEE IT UNTIL THE END.
AND NOW IT TURNED INTO A BATTLE WITH THE FUTURE OF THE NEW WORLD AT STAKE.
DO YOU REMEMBER THE STRONGEST EQUIPMENT?
THEY BROUGHT THE SHIPS Z SUNK TO THESE DOCKS.
THE OLD WITH PITY TO THROW AWAY THE THINGS AND DREAMS THAT OTHERS HAVE LEFT BEHIND...
AND HE SAVED IT ALL.
ISN'T IT?
AND ATTACK HIM WITH EVERYTHING!
I'M COUNTING ON YOU!
THAT'S TRYING TO TAKE THE SAILORS FREEDOM!
GUYS!
I WANT TO BE A HERO!
A NAVY ADMIRAL OR A PIRATE?
PIRATES AREN'T HEROES.
REALLY?
THEY'RE BOTH THE SAME TO YOU?
YES...
YOU GUYS ARE COOL!
GARI!
THE BEST IS TO DO WHAT YOU LIKE!
KEEP GOING IN THIS DIRECTION!
PREPARE THE FRONTAL CANNON!
TARGET:
ENEMY FLEET!
READY...
FIRE!
I SEE IT!
IT'S THE LAST ISLAND!
THEY'RE HERE!
DON'T LET THEM REACH MASTER Z!
WHERE THE HELL IS Z?
LET US PASS!
YOU GO ON AHEAD!
TAKE THAT!
USOPP 100 TONS HAMMER!
TAKE THAT!
I'LL LEAVE THE REST WITH YOU!
USOPP!
GUARD POINT!
SHOOTING WITH FULL POWER!
Z...!
THEY GOT SEPARATED...
BUT IT'S AN AWESOME SIGHT...
MODO!
I WON'T LET YOU REACH THE MASTER!
I'M GOING TO STOP YOU!
I'M GLAD...
MAS THIS IS TO RETURN MY FRIENDS TO NORMAL.
I'M FIGHTING WITH EVERYTHING I GOT.
I'M NOT GOING TO WIN.
BUT I'LL WIN HIM SOME TIME.
I DON'T MIND DIEING FOR MASTER Z IDEALS.
UH...
SO YOU'RE READY TO THROW YOUR LIVES AWAY FOR THAT?
I FELT HESITATION IN YOU SWORD.
YOU PIRATE!
YOU LOWLY PIRATE!
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO LIVE!
DIE BEFORE MASTER Z!
BY ANY CHANCE?
I'M GETTING TIRED.
IT STARTED...

AND SO WHAT?
I'LL DO WHAT I WANT!
I ALSO WON'T BE ABLE TO BECOME THE PIRATE KING.
IS THAT SO?
YOU SOUND LIKE A KID.
YOU'LL DO WHAT YOU WANT?
I'LL DO THE SAME.
I'LL DEDICATE MY ENTIRE LIFE TO END WITH YOUR AMBITION!
COME AT ME!
THIS IS THE FINAL BATTLE!

I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT YOU'RE ALRIGHT.

KIZARU...!
IT'S A SHAME THAT THE STRAW HAT AND MASTER ZEPHYR ARE ALMOST DEAD.
IT'S THE SAME.
JUST AT TIME LIKE THIS...
YOU BROUGHT THEM ALL...
I DID WHAT I WANTED.
NOW I HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE FOR DOING WHAT I WANTED.
OR I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FACE THE ONES THAT WENT BEFORE ME.
STRAW HAT LUFFY.

OLD MAN!

WE'RE GOING TO REMEMBER THIS!
COME AT ME WHEN YOU WANT!
MY NAME IS...
Z!
...
TRANSLATED AND TIMED BY BROKEN SILENCE*
The sea is watching...
The beginning of the world...
The sea knows...
Of the end of the world...
So it shows...
The path to be followed...
So he guides us...
Towards a correct world...
Pain, suffering, he collects it all...
Big and gentle, he cuddles them all...
I will destroy all pirates!
I'll just follow master Z.
Mosa Mosa
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa!
Catch this!
I'll also follow master Z.
Smash Buster!
Smash Buster!
Retreat!
Fall back!
Master Z...
How long has it been?
Master.
What brings you here?
Borsalino!
I've warned you not to depend too much on you're Pika Pika no Mi power.
You're still hard as rock, like always.
Master Zephyr.
I abandoned that name.
I am Z!
Don't you think you're feeling too sure of yourself by becoming "Admiral Kizaru" of the Navy?
!
I didn't come here to remember the past.
You won't be able to match my speed with that heavy weapon.
What will you use the Dyna Rocks for?
Since ancient times, I never got along with you!
Come, return the Dyna Rocks.
They say that the Dyna Rocks rival the Ancient Weapons.
How about we use them to celebrate our reunion?
Dyna Rocks cause a massive explosion when exposed to oxygen.
Let's Go!
Master Z!
Damm!
What in the hell is the Navy doing?
Come on!
Come on, baby!
I'm always a lively skeleton.
Come on!
It's good drinking while watching the cherry blossoms.
Right, Chopper?
Yes!
I love drinking milk while watching the leaves as well!
Cherry...
No, It's me!
Super!
Meat!
It stinks!
I smell poison!
It's a deadly poison!
What is it, Chopper?
He was poisoned?
Chopper!
He took poison...
I remembered!
Do you have any idea of what it is?
Listen to this song..."The poison I took".
It's a song?
!
Now that I think about it, the taste of the drink is...
Wait, or was it always like this?
They are always so lively.
Plant care, taking care of plants.
Come on, my children!
I want you to give birth to a lot of Pop Greens!
The worms exterminator, the great Usopp, shall protect them!
Usopp!
So it's your fault!
Look!
Chopper was caught by the poisonous milk!
It's your fault for being there!
The poison is for killing worms!
If you die, it means you are worms!
Well, then we can relax.
After all, we are not insects.
So, are you ok?
The taste is a bit different, but it's also pretty good.
It's a little bitter...
is it because I'm becoming an adult?
Let me try it.
That's horrible!
Agricultural chemicals also affect the human body.
I am the cherry tree...
I'm slowly spreading...
Luffy, the cherry tree!
The autumn will end.
Wait a bit more, cherry!
Lets go!
It's south...
I'm going south!
Change of course!
Damn you, why did you spilled my drink?
Frankly, they make so much noise...
Why can't you rest quietly?
Hey, be quiet!
Damn it.
Nami!
Delivery of the special orange juice!
Thank you, Sanji.
I'd also love some dessert!
Nami!
Yes, with pleasure!
Hey, Sanji!
I also want dessert!
And meat!
I want some candies!
Me too!
I want cola!
My drink is ending!
I want dessert too!
Shut up, bastards!
When you ask something to someone, it has to be politely, you idiots!
I was born only for the ladies!
It taste bad!
Hey, Usopp, your poison is here again.
I'm not using it anymore!
What is this?
It's snow!
No, its not freezing to be snow.
What is it?
This is... volcanic ashes!
Volcanic ashes?
!
That's disgusting!
The ashes entered your fur, did it not?
Let's take a bath together after.
- Bath?
-Together?
!
Today is not my bath day...
But I'll take it, this is very disgusting.
Me...
Can I take a bath with you as well?
Can I?
Look, my face is also disgusting!
Don't hurt your feelings by what you said.
No...
Brooke, you can take a bath with me!
I love you, Chopper!
Hey, Nami!
Do you have any idea?
The needle that pointed to the direction that came the volcanic ashes began rotating randomly.
It is a strange movement.
It looks like a lost child who lost their parents.
Lost?
How so?
For example, the volcanic eruption that released those ashes, could've exploded the entire island.
And because of that the needle stopped pointing?
That's impossible!
This is the New World!
?
That's right, you bastard.
Don't be surprised.
Disappear before the beauty of Nami.
You cherry shit.
Nami, some tea.
Thank you.
Anyway, we have to avoid at all cost, the island the needle was pointing at.
In that case, Nami...
There is someone we can't show that pointer by any means.
That's true.
Choosing the safest route and guarantee the crew life is my job.
Hey, that needle is moving very interestingly!
Luffy!
?
Let's go there!
Crap!
He saw it!
I smell adventure!
Wait, Luffy!
You didn't listed correctly!
According to Nami, those ashes were...
Hey, guys!
Our route has been decided!
Get ready!
Luffy!
...
But...
If the pointer is crazy, how will we know where the island is...
Be quiet.
I'm a navigator.
If we decide to go, I can take you anywhere.
Luffy, keep an eye out.
Leave it to me!
Hey, is it really alright choosing it like this?
In the New World, the path you choose can cost us our lives.
Franky, Turn 20 degrees to port.
Turning 20 degrees to port.
Hey, do you hear me?
We don't know what might happen, so prepare yourselves!
We can't do anything.
After all, he is the captain.
But we don't want to get involved with volcanoes or anything that can threaten our lives!
Castaway located.
Prepare to rescue him immediately!
He's being dragged!
Leave it to me!
Luffy, whats wrong?
I'm running out of strength...
Pull, pull!
Luffy, don't let go yet!
Luffy, are you ok?
So?
Is he alive?
His heart rate and breathing are weak, but he's only passed out, he's not in danger.
Really?
I hope we didn't get someone problematic again.
A big guy all bruised!
And this business in his left arm...
Just by looking, anyone can tell its not just something.
Kairouseki:
Sea Stone
Thats really made of Kairouseki.
I get it!
Thats why Luffy lost his strength when he touched it.
A powerful weapon made of Kairouseki...
Awesome!
Thats not it!
Kairouseki has the same energy as the ocean.
A weapon made from that material... means that it was made to end Devil Fruit users.
He might be an enemy.
and we can't lower our guard in the New World.
If you're worried, throw him overboard.
Idiot!
We can't do that.
I don't want to!
He might kill you as soon as you heal him.
Even so, I'm a doctor!
I can't abandon him.
Whats the problem?
Heal him, Chopper.
If he's the enemy, I'll finish him off.
Is that alright?
Yes!
Thank you, Luffy!
Well, as a see warrior, of course it's alright.
Damn, they are so carefree.
I really have a bad feeling about this...
It's exciting, right?
There is no need for that kind of excitement.
Luffy, it looks like he woke up!
Yes, it seems so.
Hey, crappy cooker.
Shut your mouth.
I know, you shit marimo.
Got that?
We caught a big fish.
Are you ok?
You don't need to force yourself.
You were floating in the see, do you remember it?
Yes, I remember.
Thank you for the great treatment.
It looks like I came back to life, doctor...?
Chopper!
Doctor Chopper.
You are a great medic.
Praising me doesn't get me happy, you idiot!
You are the captain of this ship?
Can you tell?
Yes I can.
I've seen a lot of young man like you.
I'm a specialist when it comes to understanding your powers.
Really?
What will you do?
Stay with us until we arrive to the next island?
Vivre Card:
The Paper of Life
I got a Vivre Card, my friends should be using that to get here.
Old man... thats a cool weapon!
Where do they sell those?
When I lost my arm to a damn pirate, a crazy scientist from the Navy made this one for me.
Battle Smasher.
It's made of Kairouseki, the weakness of the Devil Fruit users this way I destroy their power and crush them with this powerful squeeze.
Dr. Chopper, I don't recommend something heavy like this.
Awesome!
I can't get it off without a special key, so something terrible can happen if I fall with it on the ocean.
Old man, are you a Marine?
No.
I got too old for that, so I left them.
I'm doing something different now.
What are you doing?
I'm fighting for the mission I gave myself.
What are you fighting against?
It looks like I'm being questioned.
I'm sorry about that.
It's just that it would be bad for us if you were a Marine.
Would there be a problem if I were a Marine?
Yes.
After all, we are pirates.
Really?
You are pirates.
Luffy!
Nami, go outside!
Take care of it, please.
How painful... a punch from a Kairouseki weapon really works.
Straw Hat...
Why are you a pirate?
To become the Pirate King!
Pirate King...
Pirate King?
!
He's strong!
Damn!
Brooke!
Let's fight too!
Ok!
They're here?
I am a Vice-Admiral of the New Navy, Ain!
We are confiscating this pirate ship.
Do not resist.
You will only shorten your lives.
There is no pirate that doesn't resist when he's asked not to!
Even we started to attack!
Mosa Mosa!
What the hell is this?
- Thats is...
-A Devil Fruit user!
Mosa Mosa no Mi ability...
Mosa Mosa no Mi:
Fast Growth Fruit
Mosa Mosa Dance can control every plant there is!
Things look dangerous out there as well.
Let's end this now!
Dos Fleur!
What...
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa!
He's so fast that I can't establish a target!
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa Mosa!
Can't breathe...
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa!
Be careful!
Don't come down!
Mosa Mosa!
What is this?
...
Stop it!
Mosa Mosa Mosa!
No!
No!
No!
Tornado Search!
Gust Sword!
Modo:
Go Back!
Modo Modo!
Nami!
How dare you do that with Nami?
!
Heavy Point!
Modo Modo!
Chopper!
No!
Stop...
Don't come close...
No!
No!
No!
Brooke!
Stop!
Seis Fleur!
You are also a Devil Fruit user, right?
What have you done with Nami and Chopper?
Robin!
Stop using your ability!
Modo Modo!
I ate the Mono Mono no Mi.
I am a regressive person.
My ability can transform anything 12 years in time.
Now you should be about 18 years old.
I'm so tiny!
If I touch you two more times, you will regress 12 years two times, in other words, 24 years,
Making your existence disappear.
Smash Buster!
Mosa Mosa!
You'll become the Pirate King with that power alone?
Don't make me laugh.
Should I crush you like this?
What do you think, Pirate King?
What's you're name?
Monkey D. Luffy.
I get it.
You're Garp grandson.
Master Z, I'm happy you're alright.
We're destroying this pirate ship with a simultaneous attack from out fleet.
Luffy!
Are you ok, Luffy?
I am the Commander of the New Navy, Z!
I will obliterate every single pirate!
Try to survive while you still can.
Pirates!
Damn!
Wait!
...
Our fight...
Our fight isn't over yet!
Sunny!
...
Damn!
Chopper, take that off!
We're really in danger!
Luffy!
Luffy, let's run!
Franky, let's retreat!
Come on!
Damn!
I'm free!
Super!
...
Come on, Sunny!
I believe in you!
Emergency escape system!
Coup D'Burst!
They really did that.
Originally, they are our trump card to protect the Final Points of the pirates.
Using the Dyna Rocks to destroy the Final Points...
The first Final Point sank with the base that protected them.
Z objective is to destroy the three Final Points and destroy the sea of the New World.
Even that man would get injured if he was caught in the Dyna Rocks explosion.
He's alive.
Everyone here must know this.
He doesn't know when to fall.
Z...
Or rather, former Admiral of the Navy, Black Fist Zephyr
He is alive.
Either way, we have to recover the Dyna Rocks, no matter the cost.
He may have taken care of us in the past but now he is our enemy, ...enemy of justice.
And everyone who's part of the New Navy even if Z is alive.
They all should be disposed of in the name of justice.
Hunt Z and his New Navy with all the power of the Navy!
Let's recover the Dyna Rocks and execute absolute justice!
If the Final Points were destroyed, the world would be as well.
Is that really a lie?
You think that if it was a lie we would take this so seriously?
I understand what Z is planing.
He wants to end with all the pirates of the New World.
If he uses the Final Points, that becomes possible.
But of course, he won't destroy only the pirates, he'll kill all the innocent citizens as well.
Vice-Admiral Garp...
Who is this Z?
A man who was our comrade once.
We were friends.
We should have been comrades.
Zephyr... your anger is so strong to destroy the world?
Do you hate us that much?
Luffy!
I'm going to completely fix Sunny!
It will take some time, but while I fix it you'll go after Z, right?
Yes, I'm leaving Sunny with you!
This is for the doctor.
This if for the load...
I'm so sorry...
All of this because I wanted to save that Z.
Don't apologize.
A pirate shouldn't regret doing what he believed in.
It's not your fault.
We all know that.
Thank you.
New Navy...
Who could that Z be?
When he found out we were pirated, e attacked out of nowhere!
The ability of that Binz is problematic.
Next time we are going to settle things straight.
Besides, we need to avenge Sunny, that showed so much bravery.
If it wasn't for Sunny strength, we would all be swimming at sea because of the Navy attack.
We need to find that New Navy and pay them back.
Are you serious?
!
I don't want to mess with those dangerous people again.
Let's just stay in this island until Sunny is repaired!
What are you talking about?
If we don't find them, my body won't return to normal!
Me neither!
I don't want to stay like this!
With this body of a child, I can't do anything!
The navigation in the New World will be a lot harder!
As navigator...
I need to get back to normal, so I can guide Sunny Go!
That's right!
I didn't said for you to continue like this.
It would be a problem if I didn't return to normal as well.
I bet you're happy to be 18 again and having everything in the right place again.
I'm sorry!
Honestly.
Don't joke around when our ladies are in trouble.
But, wait a second...
That means I'll be able to closely follow
Nami's precious days while her body matures?
I'll be able to see the moment when the larva turns into a beautiful butterfly?
!
That's incredibly awesome!
Disgusting.
Hu?
I'm going to kill you, you marimo!
If you went back into a kid, I'd give you a lesson.
Idiot!
...
I'd defeat you even as a kid!
What did you say?
Then I would defeat you even younger, with 3 year old!
Idiot!
...
And I would have defeated you when I was a baby!
- Hu?
!
-What did you say?
!
This is no time to fight!
You know...
Actually, my age was also decreased...
It looks like...
It didn't change...
Anything...
I was also touched by that Ain from the New Navy.
Speaking about it, it's true.
But it didn't change anything...
No!
Brooke, dead and only bones.
I've been a corpse for more than 50 years...
But something changed that had never happened before.
My age went back 12 years.
Look, my hair has the softness of 12 years ago!
No it hasn't!
You painted your hair!
Then were you happy to rejuvenate?
You don't need to go back?
Yes, that's right.
No, No!
I also want...
to return to normal?
How do I know?
!
For us to go back to normal, we have to gather information about Z and the New Navy.
Do you need something, old man?
If it's the price of consulting the doctor, talk to our navigator.
Did Z showed up again?
Old man, do you know Z?
Many pirate ships have been attacked around here and comes to these docks.
All the injured pirates say they were attacked by Z.
Grandpa told me that when when costumers come to the docks, they are all pirates saying they were attacked by Z.
They come to fix their ships and they use the docks,
We receive the ships that were totally destroyed by the navy.
My grandpa was a sailor, so he takes care of the pirates or anyone that comes with a problem.
I only like people that risks their lives here in the New World, searching for their dreams.
Many were totally defeated by Z, lost their way and abandoned the New World.
Z is stealing the men freedom on the sea.
Even if staying by their side is wrong, I won't accept that.
If you were defeated by Z and even so you want to face him,
I'd like to give you my strongest equipment I have stored.
Strongest equipment?
Amazing!
A powerful equipment!
Wait a second!
What, Nami?
He said the strongest!
The strongest!
Before that, we have to pursue Z!
And with Z attacks, our clothes were all burned,
So we have to take care of that first.
If we stay the whole time with these cherry fantasies, we're going to raise suspicion when we are looking for information about him.
First we have to gather information and clothes!
The strongest equipment to defeat Z comes after that!
Got it.
Nami is small, but she's the boss of it all, right?
Excuse me, do you have any... big city on this island where we can get some information and clothes?
This island has nothing besides our docks.
How about you go to the neighboring island?
They are very popular for the hot springs and volcanoes.
And now there is the sea train passing there, it has a lot of people visiting!
Sea train?
Are you talking about that sea train?
Yes.
That's right.
Luffy, Marino, Bones.
You guys are very strange.
Leave it to us that we'll gather the information.
Isn't that right, Nami-swan, Robin-chwan?
You're strange too, Sanji.
A lover face also won't do.
We will gather the information!
No...
But I wanted to go with you...
Let's enjoy the hot springs.
How about we rest before the battle?
Leave the new clothes to me, I'll take care of them.
Looks like there is some great brands on this island.
Okay, we're here!
Guys, don't get yourselves caught by the Navy!
Spread out!
Honestly...
Devil Fruit users are full of weak points!
They lose their strength even with that?
If we don't get the upper part wet, we will still survive.
That's nice.
Can we really stay here wasting our time?
Thats right!
I want to beat him up, that Z!
You Idiot!
If a delinquent like you starts walking though out this island full of Marines, it will cause us trouble again.
Nami told us already, right?
That we're letting them and Chopper gather information about Z?
Good, right?
A beautiful dancer!
...
Everyone is so excited!
I'm happy you liked it, sir.
Are you going on a date now, sir?
Yes.
Leave it shining, please!
I can feel it...
I can feel it in my bones...
Everything goes away along with the exhaustion.
Z...
I got distracted with the weapon in his arm and I let my guard down.
Since you're a Devil Fruit user, and you attack him without thinking... and get caught by that Kairouseki arm again, you'll lose all your strength.
Let me and Marimo take care of Z.
I don't want you to do anything.
I will finish him off.
Next time, I'll dodge that arm of his and attack him with everything I got!
You're lively as always.
I got tired of waiting for you guys here.
Aokiji!
What's wrong, guys?
Who is this person?
A Marine!
Admiral Aokiji of the Navy!
Admiral?
!
Hi there.
How long has it been?
We've finished positioning the Dyna Rocks.
Understood.
When this volcano erupts, those Navy brats...
Will know of my rage and the scale of my hatred.
- Zoro, Sanji!
- Yes!
What does an Admiral want with me?
Calm down, don't get too excited.
What do you want with us?
Don't tell me...
It's nothing like that.
I don't want to capture you now.
I left the Navy, you should've known that.
I'm not a Navy Admiral anymore.
Then what are you?
What?
I don't like a skeleton asking me that...
But since I'm not an Admiral anymore...
Am I an ally of justice?
No, that's not it...
What am I?
How should I know?
How will we know?
!
Well, that's it.
I have no intention of fighting with you now.
Think about it.
If I wished to fight, I wouldn't be in a hot spring where I can't use my powers.
You were waiting for us?
That's right.
I don't want to stay here anymore...
So, let's talk about the rest outside.
Ah, this?
...
Well, how can I say, I got carried away too much.
Chopper, have you found anything?
I heard some rumors that a few Marines came to this island after Z.
But I couldn't get anything more.
Only rumors, hu?
In the store I'm at, really has more Marines arriving but I don't know if it's because of Z...
...or due to Robin's popularity.
Robin is that much popular?
Just look at how much I got for being her manager!
Awesome!
We can't do anything with rumors alone.
So, what will we do?
I know!
Leave it to me.
What happened to you leg?
Have you ever heard that in the world, there are things that it's best not to ask?
Then I won't ask...
Bu the way, why did you fought against Akainu?
Aren't you both friends?
Well, well.
You're really a brat without any consideration..
No comments about that too.
Then, why are you here?
You really don't learn anything.
Well, that I can answer you.
Enjoying the hot springs.
That's what I'd like to say...
But actually, I can't stay relaxing too much.
I'm chasing after a certain man.
You guys fought against a strong guy, right?
Z...
That old man was strong, wasn't he?
After all, he is a former Navy Admiral.
Sorry for the wait.
Thank you.
Young lady, you are very small, but you strive a lot.
Mr. Marine, don't you have any cool story to tell me?
You know Z?
Young lady, how do you know Z?
Everyone knows him!
The adults are talking...
That you've come here to capture Z!
Ah, the rumors are already saying that?
Ah, hey!
What's the problem?
So, Z is really in this island?
That's right.
We've come here to take the bad guy Z.
We are heroes of justice!
So, what is Z objective?
What is he doing here on this island?
That's enough.
To destroy the End Point.
End Point?
...
Is that a lie just to scare me?
It so happens that it's not a lie...
That's enough!
You guys drank too much already.
You're talking too much.
We're truly sorry, sir!
And you've got a lot of interest in Z, young lady.
Is there any objective behind that?
No!
That man asked me to ask about Z!
Crap!
It really is a strange man.
Nami threw the blame on us!
Should we run for it?
It's really a shame, but it's enough disguising myself as a manager.
I have got to work.
Would you come with me, young lady?
Let me go!
Seis Fleur!
- Let's run away!
- Yes.
- Captain!
- Are you alright?
That's the power of the Hana Hana no Mi!
That woman is Nico Robin of the Straw Hat pirates!
Don't let her escape!
Yes, sir!
The world is in the Great Era of the pirates.
At sea, arise and vanish pirates that go after the One Piece.
When some disappear, other are born.
Does pirates appear because the One Piece is on the other side of the sea of the New World?
Or does One Piece exists because Pirates also exist?
Do dreams come first?
Or is it the people?
In some moments... when pirates choose their dreams, they loose their happiness and the loved ones cry for them.
What must be done?
Is there an answer?
The former Navy Admiral, Z, found an answer by force.
If the One Piece disappears, so will the pirates.
It's a very simple way of thinking, is it not?
I left the Navy, but I want to see where does the bath that Z has chosen will take him.
But I don't know what to do next.
Straw Hat Luffy.
You'll follow your conviction and face Z again, right?
Show me your answer.
See you later.
Z is on this island.
Even so well disguised, in the end, we ended up creating a huge conflict!
But we got the information we needed!
Z is on this island!
Despite not knowing what he plans.
There they are!
Go on ahead!
Hissatsu!
Midori Bosshi, Devil!
That's it!
Let's regroup with Luffy and the others?
Yes!
What do you think about the clothes I got you?
It combines a lot, doesn't it?
With me, I mean.
- With you?
!
I have a great taste.
Shut up...
Try to survive while you still can, Pirates!
Luffy, Luffy!
Usopp and the other arrived.
And they brought a lot of friends along.
In the end, they caused a mess.
If so, we should have ...
Hey, Luffy!
Let's ask them where Z is, leave a few unharmed!
Luffy, take care of them...
Please.
That's...
Haoushoku no Haki...
Hey!
Where is Z?
On the other side of the island.
My squad should be chasing him now.
Tekkai!
Your justice is useless.
Justice, freedom...
You'll have to start everything all over again.
It looks like the Dyna Rocks worked on this island.
With that, the destruction of the second End Point was a success.
Grande Imbuto.
We'll achieve that goal when the third End Point is destroyed.
The pirates will vanish from the sea, and the world will see once more, a beautiful dawn.
Gomu Gomu no...
Rifle!
What are you doing here?
You pirate brats...!
Who are you calling a brat?
If you keep talking, I'll kill you, old geezer!
Old man!
Return my friends back to normal!
Ain, Binz!
Yes!
Understood.
I'll take care of the swordsman.
Damn Marimo!
Going ahead like that...
Right!
I don't even need to fight!
Go on, guys!
Mosa!
Mosa, Mosa, Mosa!
When a pirate wants something, they take it by force, right?
If you want to return your friends to normal, come and get it the pirate way!
Damn!
We've got not choice.
Usopp!
I'm going to fight Z one on one.
Luffy!
Z...!
Help me!
We won't be able to run away!
Someone help us!
Stop right there.
Ladies, go to the sea train and be careful.
Thank you very much!
Doesn't he care about anyone?
Isn't this too much craziness?
This time you wont catch me with that weapon!
You accelerated the flow of your blood.
To increase the skills of your body over the limit?
Gear Second!
You said you'd become the Pirate King, Right?
Yes!
I'll find the One Piece and become the Pirate King!
I get it now...
But do you have determination?
Are you determined to risk your own life?
I am!
But what about your friends?
!
Are you prepared to sacrifice your friends in order to fulfill your objective and walk on top of their corpses to continue?
Hurry up!
Their not here yet?
If we wait too long, we'll also be caught by the volcano!
Are they alright?
Modo, Modo!
That's enough!
If we find each other again, I'll kill you next time.
Time's up!
Look at this!
She ran away?
What a crazy ninja...
If you stay always afraid of this Smasher, you won't hit me with any attack!
Who said I was afraid?
!
...
Fear and pain weaken your determination.
Smash Tornado!
I'm a rubber man, bullets wont work!
Really?
I'm loosing my strength...
Your body won't move anymore.
This ammo is made of Kairouseki.
You didn't expected this, did you?
After all, it's not an easy task getting Kairouseki.
This thing wouldn't hit the most powerful who live here in the New World, but works wonders on those who are too convinced in their own power and let their guard down.
You too are a sinful man.
This straw hat also got old...
I'm going to bury it with my own hands, together with this Great Pirate Age.
Give it back!
I got that hat from Shanks, to take care of it!
I promised I would find him and give him that hat back!
Give it back!
The one who dragged you into this pirate business was Shanks, the redhead?
!
His sins are also deep...
Give it back.
Don't you worry.
When my plan, the Grande Imbuto get's completed,
He will have the same fate as you.
Those convinced fools who call them selves the Four Emperors...
Will all die without being able to do anything...
Without even knowing of my plan.
Don't mock on Shanks!
That's not good!
It seems that the pyroclastic flow began.
Usopp!
Where is Luffy?
...
Luffy!
Luffy!
Luffy!
Luffy!
Luffy!
We can't do anything against that.
Lets go, guys!
How fast is that, really?
They say its more than 100 KM/h!
I get it!
I know!
If this is a descent,
Hissatsu Midori Bosshi!
Boaty Banana!
Jump!
We need more speed!
It has no engine!
It's just a boat!
Look out!
We're gonna hit!
It also has no helm!
It's just a boat!
...
To the right!
Now it's divided in two!
We won't make it!
Damn it!
They're here!
Those are some nice fireworks, huh!
It blew up the entire island...
Master...
What about that straw hat guy?
The fire mountain will decide his fate.
One Piece?
Everything in this world?
What a ridiculous dream.
How many sacrifices do they think it took?
How much suffering and hatred?
They can call that will, freedom...
If that's what they call the new age, then I'll squash it all!
I'll use my own hands to get rid of all the pirates in this world, to the very last.
Your dreams will end in deep hatred.
I, Z, will close the curtains on the Great Pirate Age!
What happened to him in the past was really terrible.
But causing a tragedy like this, involving innocent civilians as a motive...
It is not right...
Dry as always...
Not everyone can easily separate things like you do.
Am I right, Sengoku?
Vice-Admiral Garp!
What is it?
Z...
No, the former Marine, Admiral Zephyr...
What kind of person was he?
He, more than anyone, believed in the Navy justice.
Then why is he doing this?
A certain accident happened.
An accident?
Zephyr was a serious man.
Even on the dangerous battlefields, he was always in front of his subordinates, and he risked his life fighting against the rivals of that era.
He became an Admiral of the Navy when he was still young.
And when he was living an happy life, his wife and son were killed by a pirate that hated Zephyr.
By fully understanding the burden of having a position as a Navy Admiral...
Zephyr kept that hatred and sadness in the bottom of his heart and continued his mission.
The years passed and Zephyr pledged himself on training the young Marines.
The man who created all Marines...
Every soldier that raised their patents lately, are his apprentices.
I want to create a hero.
However, a bigger tragedy fell upon him.
The training ship of the new recruits commanded by Zephyr was attacked by a pirate with Devil Fruit powers.
And only Zephyr and two more survived, everyone else were killed.
Zephyr lost his arm.
Took an arm from a Navy Admiral?
And then, Zephyr got a weapon to defeat Devil Fruit users, from the Navy scientists.
And together with his disciples, he created an attack unit.
And he hunted down Devil Fruit users.
He was still in the Navy, but that was when they weren't disappointed with the Navy.
And then, the only thing that was keeping him in the Navy was destroyed.
That year, the pirate that had killed his disciples, was chosen to be a War Lord by the government.
And so, Zephyr left the navy.
And now he showed up in the New World.
Hating pirates...
Disappointed with the Navy...
Leading the organization he created, the New navy.
The unacceptable reality... has changed that man.
You suck, Navy!
Why does Black Fist Zephyr is called Z now?
Z...
Who knows?
I can't say that.
Enemies without hesitation are strong.
♪ The sea is watching... ♪
♪ The beginning of the world... ♪
♪ The sea knows... ♪
♪ Of the end of the world... ♪
♪ Even if I... ♪
♪ ...disappear... ♪
♪ He knows everything... ♪
♪ You shouldn't be afraid... ♪
♪ ...the orientations of the sea. ♪
♪ As you are here... ♪
♪ ...you should not fear it. ♪
♪ Because your friend are waiting for you. ♪
I hated that song, master.
A song for the Marines who travel north does not excite me.
You liked that, didn't you?
Yes.
This is the best drink.
I also used to drink that a lot, imitating you.
I wanted to be a cool man like you.
You came to give a lecture to a stubborn old man?
Sorry, but I won't stop.
Do you intend to die?
If that happens, there is no problem.
It's to get rid of the evil called pirates.
The Navy can't execute the true justice.
I'm sorry, but step aside.
Next time we meet, let's drink together.
Go now, I don't want to kill you.
Neither do I.
Master Zephyr...
This is a Kairouseki bullet?
It was on Luffy's shoulder.
How long will you stay here?
A-Aokiji!
You!
...
What is Aokiji doing here?
It's alright.
We met a few moments ago.
Z is a former Navy Admiral?
He stole the Dyna Rocks from the Navy.
Dyna Rocks?
!
What is that?
Those are rocks they say it has a power comparable to the Ancient Weapons.
If they receive an impact and are exposed to oxygen, they create a massive explosion.
But due to its massive power, it's use is forbidden in civil zones.
The Navy has control of them all.
And now Z stole them?
He wants to use them to destroy the three End Point's of the New World.
Stop right there!
What are these End Points?
At the New World sea there are three magma concentrations, and they call it End Point.
When I heard that from a Marine, I doubted it...
Does that really exist?
I can't believe that breasted lady turned into this dull little girl...
Are you listening to me?
!
Does the End Point really exist?
Or not?
They do.
First, second...
Even when they hear the news about those two islands, all the pirates must be laughing thinking thinking it's nonsense.
Many know the legend of the End Points, but no ones believes it.
But the government investigated and declared the legend was false!
It's because the investigation results were different from what was announced.
The government used every possible means to make the world believe it was a lie.
Don't you think it would be terrible if pirates showed up wanting to use that?
Only the Government and the Navy superiors know about that.
But no one never thought a former Admiral would use that.
That's true.
If it was a lie, the Navy wouldn't be so desperate.
We got involved with a very dangerous man.
Z already destroyed two End Points with the Dyna Rocks.
If he destroys the last one...
There will be a chain reaction that connects all three End Points.
Reaction?
There will be a major catastrophic eruption, that will burn the entire New World sea!
Every single pirate in the New World will get burned to death.
But if he does that, he'll also involve the innocent people!
Wait a second!
He will involve civilians...
That's just wrong!
Don't you think you're thinking too much about yourselves?
How much fear and victims do you think pirates cause in the world?
Don't tell me you don't know.
Z hates all of that...
He hates it so much that he doesn't care if he dies along.
It doesn't matter!
I'm going there to get my hat back!
I'm going to settle things with him!
Are you crazy, Luffy?
The New World will be destroyed!
I promised Shanks.
That I would become a great pirate and return him that hat.
If I let that guy take my hat, I won't be able to become the Pirate King.
But you know...
The New World will...
That won't work with the stubbornness of our captain.
Nami, which way?
Ah, yes.
Let's see...
I've already offered my life to captain Luffy, so I'll follow him.
Then let's go.
Do we really need to do that?
Isn't the fate of the New World too much for us?
You two want to stay?
What are you saying, you idiot?
When did I said that?
Of course I'm going!
I'm the brave sea warrior!
Isn't that right, Chopper?
Yes!
Let's go!
War with that darned man!
Franky, how much longer?
It's ready!
...
The repair is finished!
We can go at any time!
Super!
Guys, thank you!
What are you saying?
It seems they've decided.
The island where the last End Point is, where Z is...
It's this way.
An Eternal Pose?
!
Why are you giving this to us?
What do you mean, why?
Without it, you can't go to the island where Z is.
Well, that's true, but...
The Navy is moving, they also went to the last island.
The Navy too?
As two End Points were already destroyed, the Navy is taking it seriously now.
If you loose to Z, you'll be destroyed along with the New World.
Even if you win, you'll be surrounded by the Navy and you'll also be destroyed.
Anyway, I want to see it until the end.
Our initial objective was returning Nami and the others to normal, and now it turned into a battle with the future of the New World at stake.
Guys, do you remember the strongest equipment?
They brought the ships Z sunk to these docks.
The old with pity to throw away the things and dreams that others have left behind...
And he saved it all.
So, it's great, isn't it?
Let's bring along the feelings of the pirates defeated by Z, and attack him with everything!
I'm counting on you!
Defeat Z, that's trying to take the sailors freedom!
Guys!
When I grow up, I want to be a hero!
Which one should I be, a Navy Admiral or a Pirate?
Pirates aren't Heroes.
Really?
They're both the same to you?
Yes...
You guys are cool!
Gari!
The best is to do what you like!
Keep going in this direction!
Prepare the frontal cannon!
Target:
Enemy fleet!
Ready...
Frontal cannon, fire!
I see it!
It's the last island!
They're here!
Don't let them reach Master Z!
Where the hell is Z?
Let us pass!
You go on ahead!
Take that!
Usopp 100 Tons Hammer!
Take that!
I'll leave the rest with you!
Leave the rest to me, Usopp!
Guard Point!
Shooting with full power!
Z...!
They got separated...
But it's an awesome sight...
Modo, Modo!
I won't let you reach the master!
I'm going to stop you!
I'm glad...
I have nothing against you, mas this is to return my friends to normal.
I'm fighting with everything I got.
Indeed, if we fight normally, I'm not going to win.
But I'll win him some time.
I don't mind dieing for Master Z ideals.
Your master ideals, uh...
So you're ready to throw your lives away for that?
However, I felt hesitation in you sword.
Don't be so sure of your self, you pirate!
You lowly pirate!
You have no right to live!
Die before Master Z!
Master...
Master... always that, are you kids, by any chance?
I'm getting tired.
It started...
So that the old man doesn't get sad, we're going to kill the Straw Hat's without leaving any of them alive.
Gomu Gomu no Pistol!
- Don't let him get away!
- Shoot him!
Take that!
Modo, Modo!
Listen do the requiem of the other world.
Soul Solid!
Mil Fleur!
Gigantesco Mano!
Stomp!
Take that!
Hissatsu Midori Bosshi!
Take Javelin!
I'm going to show you the power of my Magical Clima-Tact!
Heat Ball!
Cool Ball!
Thunderbolt Tempo!
Damn you Nami!
You got us too!
That was quite a shock!
- It was good, wasn't it?
- What was good?
You guys defeated a lot of them.
What about Luffy?
He went on ahead...
Then let's go right after him...
Guys, look!
Those are the Pacifists!
But those are different from the ones we saw before...
You came, boy.
The explosion that's going to destroy the last End Point already began.
I didn't come here for that.
I'm only here to get my straw hat back!
This hat?
...
What does it mean to you?
It's what shows me the path.
The path to become the Pirate King.
I wont allow pirates to have dreams!
And I'll destroy the sea you keep sailing!
Remember this...
The name of whom will destroy evil... my name is Z!
That's useless!
Did you stopped thinking and came here just to attack me?
Not good!
Sorry it took so long, guys!
Let's go, partner!
It's here!
Iron Pirate!
General Franky!
Awesome!
Franky Radical Beam!
That's so cool!
Mosa, Mosa!
Sky Walk!
Diable Jumble!
Take this!
Santoryu!
Seiryuuin!
Ryuusui!
If you're not sure, cut them your self.
I prefer the sexy Nami!
Burn, sexy fire!
Take this!
Meteor attack of love!
You can fall in love, Nami.
I'm back!
I also came back to normal!
- Really?
It's really great!
The 90 years!
Zoro and the other did it!
Now there is only Z left!
Let's join Luffy!
It's useless!
You can't destroy my justice!
Gomu Gomu no Pistol!
Gatling!
Even being a pirate, you have courage.
Much better than that wimpy Navy!
But...!
Gear Third!
Gigant Pistol!
I am...
Z!
Z!
...
Smash Buster!
Luffy.
Boy...
Why do you want to face me so much?
Even if you defeat me, in the end, you're still a pirate.
Nobody from the society will thank you.
And so what?
I'll do what I want!
If I'm not able to defeat you, I also won't be able to become the Pirate King.
Is that so?
You sound like a kid.
You'll do what you want?
If that's the case, I'll do the same.
I'll dedicate my entire life to end with your ambition!
Come at me!
This is the final battle!
Black Fist Zephyr... has returned!
I will do it!
I will become the Pirate King!
My name is...
Z!
You bastard!
I got old...
With only that and my body doesn't want to move anymore...
What a shame...
That fun moment ended so quickly...
Frankly, that battle ended right on time, what a close call.
Luffy!
Those who follow their dreams, destroy everything and move on.
Take your straw hat and my life.
I don't want your life.
I'm already satisfied.
If you want to continue, I don't mind.
No.
I'm also satisfied.
Luffy!
Are you okey, Luffy?
Guys!
...
"Guys", nothing!
You went on ahead again!
Master Z!
Ain...
Binz...
Forgive me... for giving you so much work...
Me...
Me...
I'm happy to see that you're alright.
It seems everyone is gathered here.
Kizaru...!
It's a shame that the Straw Hat and Master Zephyr are almost dead.
But seeing you're all going to die anyway, it's the same.
Damn it, just at time like this...
You brought them all...
At the end, I did what I wanted.
Now I have to pay the price for doing what I wanted.
Or I wouldn't be able to face the ones that went before me.
Straw Hat Luffy.
You have your own adventure, don't you?
Leave the rest with me, Z!
Old man!
No, Master!
Kuzan!
You made a place where I'd be able to die?
Master!
Master!
Master...
Master...
Yasakani no Magatama!
Borsalino!
Good bye, master Zephyr!
I'll give you guys your last training!
Don't cry!
He ended his life as he wanted to.
Don't you think he's incredible?
We're going to remember this!
Come at me when you want!
I'm the hero of justice, my name is...
Z!
...
The sea is watching...
The beginning of the world...
The sea knows...
Of the end of the world...
So it shows...
The path to be followed...
So he guides us...
Towards a correct world...
Pain, suffering, he collects it all...
Big and gentle, he cuddles them all...
I will destroy all pirates!
I'll just follow master Z.
Catch this!
I'll also follow master Z.
Smash Buster!
Smash Buster!
Retreat!
Fall back!
Master Z...
How long has it been?
Master.
What brings you here?
Borsalino!
I've warned you not to depend too much on you're Pika Pika no Mi power.
You're still hard as rock, like always.
Master Zephyr.
I abandoned that name.
I am Z!
Don't you think you're feeling too sure of yourself by becoming "Admiral Kizaru" of the Navy?
!
I didn't come here to remember the past.
You won't be able to match my speed with that heavy weapon.
What will you use the Dyna Rocks for?
Since ancient times, I never got along with you!
Come, return the Dyna Rocks.
They say that the Dyna Rocks rival the Ancient Weapons.
How about we use them to celebrate our reunion?
Dyna Rocks cause a massive explosion when exposed to oxygen.
Let's Go!
Master Z!
Damm!
What in the hell is the Navy doing?
Come on!
Come on, baby!
I'm always a lively skeleton.
Come on!
It's good drinking while watching the cherry blossoms.
Right, Chopper?
Yes!
I love drinking milk while watching the leaves as well!
Cherry...
No, It's me!
Meat!
It stinks!
I smell poison!
It's a deadly poison!
What is it, Chopper?
He was poisoned?
Chopper!
He took poison...
I remembered!
Do you have any idea of what it is?
Listen to this song..."The poison I took".
It's a song?
!
Now that I think about it, the taste of the drink is...
Wait, or was it always like this?
They are always so lively.
Plant care, taking care of plants.
Come on, my children!
I want you to give birth to a lot of Pop Greens!
The worms exterminator, the great Usopp, shall protect them!
Usopp!
So it's your fault!
Look!
Usopp was caught by the poisonous milk!
It's your fault for being there!
The poison is for killing worms!
If you die, it means you are worms!
Well, then we can relax.
After all, we are not insects.
So, are you ok?
The taste is a bit different, but it's also pretty good.
It's a little bitter...
is it because I'm becoming an adult?
Let me try it.
That's horrible!
Agricultural chemicals also affect the human body.
I am the cherry tree...
I'm slowly spreading...
Luffy, the cherry tree!
The autumn will end.
Wait a bit more, cherry!
Lets go!
It's south...
I'm going south!
Change of course!
Damn you, why did you spilled my drink?
Frankly, they make so much noise...
Why can't you rest quietly?
Hey, be quiet!
Damn it.
Nami!
Delivery of the special orange juice!
Thank you, Sanji.
I'd also love some dessert!
Nami!
Yes, with pleasure!
Hey, Sanji!
I also want dessert!
And meat!
I want some candies!
Me too!
I want cola!
My drink is ending!
I want dessert too!
Shut up, bastards!
When you ask something to someone, it has to be politely, you idiots!
I was born only for the ladies!
It taste bad!
Hey, Usopp, your poison is here again.
I'm not using it anymore!
What is this?
It's snow!
No, its not freezing to be snow.
What is it?
This is... volcanic ashes!
Volcanic ashes?
!
One Piece Film Z!
Translated and Timed by:
broken silence*
That's disgusting!
The ashes entered your fur, did it not?
Let's take a bath together after.
-Bath?
-Together?
!
Today is not my bath day...
But I'll take it, this is very disgusting.
Me...
Can I take a bath with you as well?
Can I?
Look, my face is also disgusting!
Don't hurt your feelings by what you said.
No...
Brooke, you can take a bath with me!
I love you, Chopper!
Hey, Nami!
Do you have any idea?
The needle that pointed to the direction that came the volcanic ashes began rotating randomly.
It is a strange movement.
It looks like a lost child who lost their parents.
Lost?
How so?
For example, the volcanic eruption that released those ashes, could've exploded the entire island.
And because of that the needle stopped pointing?
That's impossible!
This is the New World!
?
That's right, you bastard.
Don't be surprised.
Disappear before the beauty of Nami.
You cherry shit.
Nami, some tea.
Thank you.
Anyway, we have to avoid at all cost, the island the needle was pointing at.
In that case, Nami...
There is someone we can't show that pointer by any means.
That's true.
Choosing the safest route and guarantee the crew life is my job.
Hey, that needle is moving very interestingly!
Luffy!
?
Let's go there!
Crap!
He saw it!
I smell adventure!
Wait, Luffy!
You didn't listed correctly!
According to Nami, those ashes were...
Hey, guys!
Our route has been decided!
Get ready!
Luffy!
...
But...
If the pointer is crazy, how will we know where the island is...
Be quiet.
I'm a navigator.
If we decide to go, I can take you anywhere.
Luffy, keep an eye out.
Leave it to me!
Hey, is it really alright choosing it like this?
In the New World, the path you choose can cost us our lives.
Franky, Turn 20 degrees to port.
Turning 20 degrees to port.
Hey, do you hear me?
We don't know what might happen, so prepare yourselves!
We can't do anything.
After all, he is the captain.
But we don't want to get involved with volcanoes or anything that can threaten our lives!
Castaway located.
Prepare to rescue him immediately!
He's being dragged!
Leave it to me!
Luffy, whats wrong?
I'm running out of strength...
Pull, pull!
Luffy, don't let go yet!
Luffy, are you ok?
So?
Is he alive?
His heart rate and breathing are weak, but he's only passed out, he's not in danger.
Really?
I hope we didn't get someone problematic again.
A big guy all bruised!
And this business in his left arm...
Just by looking, anyone can tell its not just something.
Thats really made of Kairouseki.
I get it!
Thats why Luffy lost his strength when he touched it.
A powerful weapon made of Kairouseki...
Awesome!
Thats not it!
Kairouseki has the same energy as the ocean.
A weapon made from that material... means that it was made to end Devil Fruit users.
He might be an enemy.
and we can't lower our guard in the New World.
If you're worried, throw him overboard.
Idiot!
We can't do that.
I don't want to!
He might kill you as soon as you heal him.
Even so, I'm a doctor!
I can't abandon him.
Whats the problem?
Heal him, Chopper.
If he's the enemy, I'll finish him off.
Is that alright?
Yes!
Thank you, Luffy!
Well, as a see warrior, of course it's alright.
Damn, they are so carefree.
I really have a bad feeling about this...
It's exciting, right?
There is no need for that kind of excitement.
Luffy, it looks like he woke up!
Yes, it seems so.
Hey, crappy cooker.
Shut your mouth.
I know, you shit marimo.
Got that?
We caught a big fish.
Are you ok?
You don't need to force yourself.
You were floating in the see, do you remember it?
Yes, I remember.
Thank you for the great treatment.
It looks like I came back to life, doctor...?
Chopper!
Doctor Chopper.
You are a great medic.
Praising me doesn't get me happy, you idiot!
You are the captain of this ship?
Can you tell?
Yes I can.
I've seen a lot of young man like you.
I'm a specialist when it comes to understanding your powers.
Really?
What will you do?
Stay with us until we arrive to the next island?
I got a Vivre Card, my friends should be using that to get here.
Old man... thats a cool weapon!
Where do they sell those?
When I lost my arm to a damn pirate, a crazy scientist from the Navy made this one for me.
Battle Smasher.
It's made of Kairouseki, the weakness of the Devil Fruit users this way I destroy their power and crush them with this powerful squeeze.
Dr. Chopper, I don't recommend something heavy like this.
Awesome!
I can't get it off without a special key, so something terrible can happen if I fall with it on the ocean.
Old man, are you a Marine?
No.
I got too old for that, so I left them.
I'm doing something different now.
What are you doing?
I'm fighting for the mission I gave myself.
What are you fighting against?
It looks like I'm being questioned.
I'm sorry about that.
It's just that it would be bad for us if you were a Marine.
Would there be a problem if I were a Marine?
Yes.
After all, we are pirates.
Really?
You are pirates.
Luffy!
Nami, go outside!
Take care of it, please.
How painful... a punch from a Kairouseki weapon really works.
Straw Hat...
Why are you a pirate?
To become the Pirate King!
Pirate King...
Pirate King?
!
He's strong!
Damn!
Brooke!
Let's fight too!
Ok!
They're here?
I am a Vice-Admiral of the New Navy, Ain!
We are confiscating this pirate ship.
Do not resist.
You will only shorten your lives.
There is no pirate that doesn't resist when he's asked not to!
Even we started to attack!
Mosa Mosa!
What the hell is this?
-Thats is...
-A Devil Fruit user!
Mosa Mosa no Mi ability...
Mosa Mosa Dance can control every plant there is!
Things look dangerous out there as well.
Let's end this now!
Dos Fleur!
What...
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa!
He's so fast that I can't establish a target!
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa Mosa!
Can't breathe...
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa!
Be careful!
Don't come down!
Mosa Mosa!
What is this?
...
-Stop it!
-Mosa Mosa Mosa!
No!
No!
No!
Gust Sword!
Modo Modo!
Nami!
How dare you do that with Nami?
!
Heavy Point!
Modo Modo!
Chopper!
No!
Stop...
Don't come close...
No!
No!
No!
Brooke!
Stop!
Seis Fleur!
You are also a Devil Fruit user, right?
What have you done with Nami and Chopper?
Robin!
Stop using your ability!
Modo Modo!
I ate the Mono Mono no Mi.
I am a regressive person.
My ability can transform anything 12 years in time.
Now you should be about 18 years old.
I'm so tiny!
If I touch you two more times, you will regress 12 years two times, in other words, 24 years,
Making your existence disappear.
Smash Buster!
Mosa Mosa!
You'll become the Pirate King with that power alone?
Don't make me laugh.
Should I crush you like this?
What do you think, Pirate King?
What's you're name?
Monkey D. Luffy.
I get it.
You're Garp grandson.
Master Z, I'm happy you're alright.
We're destroying this pirate ship with a simultaneous attack from out fleet.
Luffy!
Are you ok, Luffy?
I am the Commander of the New Navy, Z!
I will obliterate every single pirate!
Try to survive while you still can.
Pirates!
Damn!
Wait!
...
Our fight...
Our fight isn't over yet!
Sunny!
...
Damn!
Chopper, take that off!
We're really in danger!
Luffy!
Luffy, let's run!
Franky, let's retreat!
Come on!
Damn!
I'm free!
Super!
...
Come on, Sunny!
I believe in you!
Emergency escape system!
Coup D'Burst!
They really did that.
Originally, they are our trump card to protect the Final Points of the pirates.
Using the Dyna Rocks to destroy the Final Points...
The first Final Point sank with the base that protected them.
Z objective is to destroy the three Final Points and destroy the sea of the New World.
Even that man would get injured if he was caught in the Dyna Rocks explosion.
He's alive.
Everyone here must know this.
He doesn't know when to fall.
Z....
Or rather, former Admiral of the Navy, Black Fist Zephyr
He is alive.
Either way, we have to recover the Dyna Rocks, no matter the cost.
He may have taken care of us in the past but now he is our enemy, enemy of justice.
And everyone who's part of the New Navy even if Z is alive.
They all should be disposed of in the name of justice.
Hunt Z and his New Navy with all the power of the Navy!
Let's recover the Dyna Rocks and execute absolute justice!
If the Final Points were destroyed, the world would be as well.
Is that really a lie?
You think that if it was a lie we would take this so seriously?
I understand what Z is planing.
He wants to end with all the pirates of the New World.
If he uses the Final Points, that becomes possible.
But of course, he won't destroy only the pirates, he'll kill all the innocent citizens as well.
Vice-Admiral Garp...
Who is this Z?
A man who was our comrade once.
We were friends.
We should have been comrades.
Zephyr... your anger is so strong to destroy the world?
Do you hate us that much?
Luffy!
I'm going to completely fix Sunny!
It will take some time, but while I fix it you'll go after Z, right?
Yes, I'm leaving Sunny with you!
This is for the doctor.
This if for the load...
I'm so sorry...
All of this because I wanted to save that Z.
Don't apologize.
A pirate shouldn't regret doing what he believed in.
It's not your fault.
We all know that.
Thank you.
New Navy...
Who could that Z be?
When he found out we were pirated, e attacked out of nowhere!
The ability of that Binz is problematic.
Next time we are going to settle things straight.
Besides, we need to avenge Sunny, that showed so much bravery.
If it wasn't for Sunny strength, we would all be swimming at sea because of the Navy attack.
We need to find that New Navy and pay them back.
Are you serious?
!
I don't want to mess with those dangerous people again.
Let's just stay in this island until Sunny is repaired!
What are you talking about?
If we don't find them, my body won't return to normal!
Me neither!
I don't want to stay like this!
With this body of a child, I can't do anything!
The navigation in the New World will be a lot harder!
As navigator, I need to get back to normal, so I can guide Sunny Go!
That's right!
I didn't said for you to continue like this.
It would be a problem if I didn't return to normal as well.
I bet you're happy to be 18 again and having everything in the right place again.
I'm sorry!
Honestly.
Don't joke around when our ladies are in trouble.
But, wait a second...
That means I'll be able to closely follow Nami's precious days while her body matures?
I'll be able to see the moment when the larva turns into a beautiful butterfly?
!
That's incredibly awesome!
Disgusting.
Hu?
I'm going to kill you, you marimo!
If you went back into a kid, I'd give you a lesson.
Idiot!
...
I'd defeat you even as a kid!
What did you say?
Then I would defeat you even younger, with 3 year old!
Idiot!
...
And I would have defeated you when I was a baby!
-Hu?
!
-What did you say?
!
This is no time to fight!
You know...
Actually, my age was also decreased...
It looks like...
It didn't change...
Anything...
I was also touched by that Ain from the New Navy.
Speaking about it, it's true.
But it didn't change anything...
No!
Brooke, dead and only bones.
I've been a corpse for more than 50 years...
But something changed that had never happened before.
My age went back 12 years.
Look, my hair has the softness of 12 years ago!
No it hasn't!
You painted your hair!
Then were you happy to rejuvenate?
You don't need to go back?
Yes, that's right.
No, No!
I also want...
to return to normal?
How do I know?
!
For us to go back to normal, we have to gather information about Z and the New Navy.
Do you need something, old man?
If it's the price of consulting the doctor, talk to our navigator.
Did Z showed up again?
Old man, do you know Z?
Many pirate ships have been attacked around here and comes to these docks.
All the injured pirates say they were attacked by Z.
Grandpa told me that when when costumers come to the docks, they are all pirates saying they were attacked by Z.
They come to fix their ships and they use the docks,
We receive the ships that were totally destroyed by the navy.
My grandpa was a sailor, so he takes care of the pirates or anyone that comes with a problem.
I only like people that risks their lives here in the New World, searching for their dreams.
Many were totally defeated by Z, lost their way and abandoned the New World.
Z is stealing the men freedom on the sea.
Even if staying by their side is wrong, I won't accept that.
If you were defeated by Z and even so you want to face him,
I'd like to give you my strongest equipment I have stored.
Strongest equipment?
Amazing!
A powerful equipment!
Wait a second!
What, Nami?
He said the strongest!
The strongest!
Before that, we have to pursue Z!
And with Z attacks, our clothes were all burned,
So we have to take care of that first.
If we stay the whole time with these cherry fantasies, we're going to raise suspicion when we are looking for information about him.
First we have to gather information and clothes!
The strongest equipment to defeat Z comes after that!
Got it.
Nami is small, but she's the boss of it all, right?
Excuse me, do you have any big city on this island where we can get some information and clothes?
This island has nothing besides our docks.
How about you go to the neighboring island?
They are very popular for the hot springs and volcanoes.
And now there is the sea train passing there, it has a lot of people visiting!
Sea train?
Are you talking about that sea train?
Yes.
That's right.
Luffy, Marino, Bones.
You guys are very strange.
Leave it to us that we'll gather the information.
Isn't that right, Nami-swan, Robin-chwan?
You're strange too, Sanji.
A lover face also won't do.
We will gather the information!
No...
But I wanted to go with you...
Let's enjoy the hot springs.
How about we rest before the battle?
Leave the new clothes to me, I'll take care of them.
Looks like there is some great brands on this island.
Okay, we're here!
Guys, don't get yourselves caught by the Navy!
Spread out!
Honestly...
Devil Fruit users are full of weak points!
They lose their strength even with that?
If we don't get the upper part wet, we will still survive.
That's nice.
Can we really stay here wasting our time?
Thats right!
I want to beat him up, that Z!
You Idiot!
If a delinquent like you starts walking though out this island full of Marines, it will cause us trouble again.
Nami told us already, right?
That we're letting them and Chopper gather information about Z?
Good, right?
A beautiful dancer!
....
Everyone is so excited!
I'm happy you liked it, sir.
Are you going on a date now, sir?
Yes.
Leave it shining, please!
I can feel it...
I can feel it in my bones...
Everything goes away along with the exhaustion.
Z....
I got distracted with the weapon in his arm and I let my guard down.
Since you're a Devil Fruit user, and you attack him without thinking... and get caught by that Kairouseki arm again, you'll lose all your strength.
Let me and Marimo take care of Z.
I don't want you to do anything.
I will finish him off.
Next time, I'll dodge that arm of his and attack him with everything I got!
You're lively as always.
I got tired of waiting for you guys here.
Aokiji!
What's wrong, guys?
Who is this person?
A Marine!
Admiral Aokiji of the Navy!
Admiral?
!
Hi there.
How long has it been?
We've finished positioning the Dyna Rocks.
Understood.
When this volcano erupts, those Navy brats...
Will know of my rage and the scale of my hatred.
-Zoro, Sanji!
-Yes!
What does an Admiral want with me?
Calm down, don't get too excited.
What do you want with us?
Don't tell me...
It's nothing like that.
I don't want to capture you now.
I left the Navy, you should've known that.
I'm not a Navy Admiral anymore.
Then what are you?
What?
I don't like a skeleton asking me that...
But since I'm not an Admiral anymore...
Am I an ally of justice?
No, that's not it...
What am I?
How should I know?
How will we know?
!
Well, that's it.
I have no intention of fighting with you now.
Think about it.
If I wished to fight, I wouldn't be in a hot spring where I can't use my powers.
You were waiting for us?
That's right.
I don't want to stay here anymore...
So, let's talk about the rest outside.
Ah, this?
...
Well, how can I say, I got carried away too much.
Chopper, have you found anything?
I heard some rumors that a few Marines came to this island after Z.
But I couldn't get anything more.
Only rumors, hu?
In the store I'm at, really has more Marines arriving but I don't know if it's because of Z or due to Robin's popularity.
Robin is that much popular?
Just look at how much I got for being her manager!
Awesome!
We can't do anything with rumors alone.
So, what will we do?
I know!
Leave it to me.
What happened to you leg?
Have you ever heard that in the world, there are things that it's best not to ask?
Then I won't ask...
Bu the way, why did you fought against Akainu?
Aren't you both friends?
Well, well.
You're really a brat without any consideration..
No comments about that too.
Then, why are you here?
You really don't learn anything.
Well, that I can answer you.
Enjoying the hot springs.
That's what I'd like to say...
But actually, I can't stay relaxing too much.
I'm chasing after a certain man.
You guys fought against a strong guy, right?
Z...
That old man was strong, wasn't he?
After all, he is a former Navy Admiral.
Sorry for the wait.
Thank you.
Young lady, you are very small, but you strive a lot.
Mr. Marine, don't you have any cool story to tell me?
You know Z?
Young lady, how do you know Z?
Everyone knows him!
The adults are talking...
That you've come here to capture Z!
Ah, the rumors are already saying that?
Ah, hey!
What's the problem?
So, Z is really in this island?
That's right.
We've come here to take the bad guy Z.
We are heroes of justice!
So, what is Z objective?
What is he doing here on this island?
That's enough.
To destroy the End Point.
End Point?
...
Is that a lie just to scare me?
It so happens that it's not a lie...
That's enough!
You guys drank too much already.
You're talking too much.
We're truly sorry, sir!
And you've got a lot of interest in Z, young lady.
Is there any objective behind that?
No!
That man asked me to ask about Z!
Crap!
It really is a strange man.
Nami threw the blame on us!
Should we run for it?
It's really a shame, but it's enough disguising myself as a manager.
I have got to work.
Would you come with me, young lady?
Let me go!
Seis Fleur!
-Let's run away!
-Yes.
-Captain!
-Are you alright?
That's the power of the Hana Hana no Mi!
That woman is Nico Robin of the Straw Hat pirates!
Don't let her escape!
Yes, sir!
The world is in the Great Era of the pirates.
At sea, arise and vanish pirates that go after the One Piece.
When some disappear, other are born.
Does pirates appear because the One Piece is on the other side of the sea of the New World?
Or does One Piece exists because Pirates also exist?
Do dreams come first?
Or is it the people?
In some moments,... when pirates choose their dreams, they loose their happiness and the loved ones cry for them.
What must be done?
Is there an answer?
The former Navy Admiral, Z, found an answer by force.
If the One Piece disappears, so will the pirates.
It's a very simple way of thinking, is it not?
I left the Navy, but I want to see where does the bath that Z has chosen will take him.
But I don't know what to do next.
Straw Hat Luffy.
You'll follow your conviction and face Z again, right?
Show me your answer.
See you later.
Z is on this island.
Even so well disguised, in the end, we ended up creating a huge conflict!
But we got the information we needed!
Z is on this island!
Despite not knowing what he plans.
There they are!
Go on ahead!
Hissatsu!
Midori Bosshi, Devil!
That's it!
Let's regroup with Luffy and the others?
Yes!
What do you think about the clothes I got you?
It combines a lot, doesn't it?
With me, I mean.
-With you?
!
I have a great taste.
Shut up...
Try to survive while you still can, Pirates!
Luffy, Luffy!
Usopp and the other arrived.
And they brought a lot of friends along.
In the end, they caused a mess.
If so, we should have ...
Hey, Luffy!
Let's ask them where Z is, leave a few unharmed!
Luffy, take care of them...
Please.
That's...
Haoushoku no Haki...
Hey!
Where is Z?
On the other side of the island.
My squad should be chasing him now.
Tekkai!
Your justice is useless.
Justice, freedom...
You'll have to start everything all over again.
It looks like the Dyna Rocks worked on this island.
With that, the destruction of the second End Point was a success.
Grande Imbuto.
We'll achieve that goal when the third End Point is destroyed.
The pirates will vanish from the sea, and the world will see once more, a beautiful dawn.
Gomu Gomu no...
Rifle!
What are you doing here?
You pirate brats......!
Who are you calling a brat?
If you keep talking, I'll kill you, old geezer!
Old man!
Return my friends back to normal!
Ain, Binz!
Yes!
Understood.
I'll take care of the swordsman.
Damn Marimo!
Going ahead like that...
Right!
I don't even need to fight!
Go on, guys!
Mosa!
Mosa, Mosa, Mosa!
When a pirate wants something, they take it by force, right?
If you want to return your friends to normal, come and get it the pirate way!
Damn!
We've got not choice.
Usopp!
I'm going to fight Z one on one.
Luffy!
Z...!
Help me!
We won't be able to run away!
Someone help us!
Stop right there.
Ladies, go to the sea train and be careful.
Thank you very much!
Doesn't he care about anyone?
Isn't this too much craziness?
This time you wont catch me with that weapon!
You accelerated the flow of your blood.
To increase the skills of your body over the limit?
Gear Second!
You said you'd become the Pirate King, Right?
Yes!
I'll find the One Piece and become the Pirate King!
I get it now...
But do you have determination?
Are you determined to risk your own life?
I am!
But what about your friends?
!
Are you prepared to sacrifice your friends in order to fulfill your objective and walk on top of their corpses to continue?
Hurry up!
Their not here yet?
If we wait too long, we'll also be caught by the volcano!
Are they alright?
Modo, Modo!
That's enough!
If we find each other again, I'll kill you next time.
Time's up!
Look at this!
She ran away?
What a crazy ninja...
If you stay always afraid of this Smasher, you won't hit me with any attack!
Who said I was afraid?
!
...
Fear and pain weaken your determination.
Smash Tornado!
I'm a rubber man, bullets wont work!
Really?
I'm loosing my strength...
Your body won't move anymore.
This ammo is made of Kairouseki.
You didn't expected this, did you?
After all, it's not an easy task getting Kairouseki.
This thing wouldn't hit the most powerful who live here in the New World, but works wonders on those who are too convinced in their own power and let their guard down.
You too are a sinful man.
This straw hat also got old...
I'm going to bury it with my own hands, together with this Great Pirate Age.
Give it back!
I got that hat from Shanks, to take care of it!
I promised I would find him and give him that hat back!
Give it back!
The one who dragged you into this pirate business was Shanks, the redhead?
!
His sins are also deep...
Give it back.
Don't you worry.
When my plan, the Grande Imbuto get's completed,
He will have the same fate as you.
Those convinced fools who call them selves the Four Emperors...
Will all die without being able to do anything...
Without even knowing of my plan.
Don't mock on Shanks!
That's not good!
It seems that the pyroclastic flow began.
Usopp!
Where is Luffy?
...
Luffy!
Luffy!
Luffy!
Luffy!
Luffy!
We can't do anything against that.
Lets go, guys!
How fast is that, really?
They say its more than 100 KM/h!
I get it!
I know!
If this is a descent,
Hissatsu Midori Bosshi!
Boaty Banana!
Jump!
We need more speed!
It has no engine!
It's just a boat!
Look out!
We're gonna hit!
It also has no helm!
It's just a boat!
...
To the right!
Now it's divided in two!
We won't make it!
Damn it!
They're here!
Those are some nice fireworks, huh!
It blew up the entire island...
Master...
What about that straw hat guy?
The fire mountain will decide his fate.
One Piece?
Everything in this world?
What a ridiculous dream.
How many sacrifices do they think it took?
How much suffering and hatred?
They can call that will, freedom...
If that's what they call the new age, then I'll squash it all!
I'll use my own hands to get rid of all the pirates in this world, to the very last.
Your dreams will end in deep hatred.
I, Z, will close the curtains on the Great Pirate Age!
What happened to him in the past was really terrible.
But causing a tragedy like this, involving innocent civilians as a motive...
It is not right...
Dry as always...
Not everyone can easily separate things like you do.
Am I right, Sengoku?
Vice-Admiral Garp!
What is it?
Z...
No, the former Marine, Admiral Zephyr...
What kind of person was he?
He, more than anyone, believed in the Navy justice.
Then why is he doing this?
A certain accident happened.
An accident?
Zephyr was a serious man.
Even on the dangerous battlefields, he was always in front of his subordinates, and he risked his life fighting against the rivals of that era.
He became an Admiral of the Navy when he was still young.
And when he was living an happy life, his wife and son were killed by a pirate that hated Zephyr.
By fully understanding the burden of having a position as a Navy Admiral...
Zephyr kept that hatred and sadness in the bottom of his heart and continued his mission.
The years passed and Zephyr pledged himself on training the young Marines.
The man who created all Marines...
Every soldier that raised their patents lately, are his apprentices.
I want to create a hero.
However, a bigger tragedy fell upon him.
The training ship of the new recruits commanded by Zephyr was attacked by a pirate with Devil Fruit powers.
And only Zephyr and two more survived, everyone else were killed.
Zephyr lost his arm.
Took an arm from a Navy Admiral?
And then, Zephyr got a weapon to defeat Devil Fruit users, from the Navy scientists.
And together with his disciples, he created an attack unit.
And he hunted down Devil Fruit users.
He was still in the Navy, but that was when they weren't disappointed with the Navy.
And then, the only thing that was keeping him in the Navy was destroyed.
That year, the pirate that had killed his disciples, was chosen to be a War Lord by the government.
And so, Zephyr left the navy.
And now he showed up in the New World.
Hating pirates...
Disappointed with the Navy...
Leading the organization he created, the New navy.
The unacceptable reality... has changed that man.
You suck, Navy!
Why does Black Fist Zephyr is called Z now?
Z..........
Who knows?
I can't say that.
Enemies without hesitation are strong.
The sea is watching...
The beginning of the world...
The sea knows...
Of the end of the world...
Even if I disappear...
He knows everything...
You shouldn't be afraid the orientations of the sea.
As you are here you should not fear it.
Because your friend are waiting for you.
I hated that song, master.
A song for the Marines who travel north does not excite me.
You liked that, didn't you?
Yes.
This is the best drink.
I also used to drink that a lot, imitating you.
I wanted to be a cool man like you.
You came to give a lecture to a stubborn old man?
Sorry, but I won't stop.
Do you intend to die?
If that happens, there is no problem.
It's to get rid of the evil called pirates.
The Navy can't execute the true justice.
I'm sorry, but step aside.
Next time we meet, let's drink together.
Go now, I don't want to kill you.
Neither do I.
Master Zephyr...
This is a Kairouseki bullet?
It was on Luffy's shoulder.
How long will you stay here?
A-Aokiji!
You!
...
What is Aokiji doing here?
It's alright.
We met a few moments ago.
Z is a former Navy Admiral?
He stole the Dyna Rocks from the Navy.
Dyna Rocks?
!
What is that?
Those are rocks they say it has a power comparable to the Ancient Weapons.
If they receive an impact and are exposed to oxygen, they create a massive explosion.
But due to its massive power, it's use is forbidden in civil zones.
The Navy has control of them all.
And now Z stole them?
He wants to use them to destroy the three End Point's of the New World.
Stop right there!
What are these End Points?
At the New World sea there are three magma concentrations, and they call it End Point.
When I heard that from a Marine, I doubted it...
Does that really exist?
I can't believe that breasted lady turned into this dull little girl...
Are you listening to me?
!
Does the End Point really exist?
Or not?
They do.
First, second...
Even when they hear the news about those two islands, all the pirates must be laughing thinking thinking it's nonsense.
Many know the legend of the End Points, but no ones believes it.
But the government investigated and declared the legend was false!
It's because the investigation results were different from what was announced.
The government used every possible means to make the world believe it was a lie.
Don't you think it would be terrible if pirates showed up wanting to use that?
Only the Government and the Navy superiors know about that.
But no one never thought a former Admiral would use that.
That's true.
If it was a lie, the Navy wouldn't be so desperate.
We got involved with a very dangerous man.
Z already destroyed two End Points with the Dyna Rocks.
If he destroys the last one...
There will be a chain reaction that connects all three End Points.
Reaction?
There will be a major catastrophic eruption, that will burn the entire New World sea!
Every single pirate in the New World will get burned to death.
But if he does that, he'll also involve the innocent people!
Wait a second!
He will involve civilians...
That's just wrong!
Don't you think you're thinking too much about yourselves?
How much fear and victims do you think pirates cause in the world?
Don't tell me you don't know.
Z hates all of that...
He hates it so much that he doesn't care if he dies along.
It doesn't matter!
I'm going there to get my hat back!
I'm going to settle things with him!
Are you crazy, Luffy?
The New World will be destroyed!
I promised Shanks.
That I would become a great pirate and return him that hat.
If I let that guy take my hat, I won't be able to become the Pirate King.
But you know...
The New World will...
That won't work with the stubbornness of our captain.
Nami, which way?
Ah, yes.
Let's see...
I've already offered my life to captain Luffy, so I'll follow him.
Then let's go.
Do we really need to do that?
Isn't the fate of the New World too much for us?
You two want to stay?
What are you saying, you idiot?
When did I said that?
Of course I'm going!
I'm the brave sea warrior!
Isn't that right, Chopper?
Yes!
Let's go!
War with that darned man!
Franky, how much longer?
It's ready!
...
The repair is finished!
We can go at any time!
Super!
Guys, thank you!
What are you saying?
It seems they've decided.
The island where the last End Point is, where Z is...
It's this way.
An Eternal Pose?
!
Why are you giving this to us?
What do you mean, why?
Without it, you can't go to the island where Z is.
Well, that's true, but...
The Navy is moving, they also went to the last island.
The Navy too?
As two End Points were already destroyed, the Navy is taking it seriously now.
If you loose to Z, you'll be destroyed along with the New World.
Even if you win, you'll be surrounded by the Navy and you'll also be destroyed.
Anyway, I want to see it until the end.
Our initial objective was returning Nami and the others to normal, and now it turned into a battle with the future of the New World at stake.
Guys, do you remember the strongest equipment?
They brought the ships Z sunk to these docks.
The old with pity to throw away the things and dreams that others have left behind...
And he saved it all.
So, it's great, isn't it?
Let's bring along the feelings of the pirates defeated by Z, and attack him with everything!
I'm counting on you!
Defeat Z, that's trying to take the sailors freedom!
Guys!
When I grow up, I want to be a hero!
Which one should I be, a Navy Admiral or a Pirate?
Pirates aren't Heroes.
Really?
They're both the same to you?
Yes...
You guys are cool!
Gari!
The best is to do what you like!
Keep going in this direction!
Prepare the frontal cannon!
Target:
Enemy fleet!
Ready...
Frontal cannon, fire!
I see it!
It's the last island!
They're here!
Don't let them reach Master Z!
Where the hell is Z?
Let us pass!
You go on ahead!
Take that!
Usopp 100 Tons Hammer!
Take that!
I'll leave the rest with you!
Leave the rest to me, Usopp!
Guard Point!
Shooting with full power!
Z...!
They got separated...
But it's an awesome sight...
Modo, Modo!
I won't let you reach the master!
I'm going to stop you!
I'm glad...
I have nothing against you, mas this is to return my friends to normal.
I'm fighting with everything I got.
Indeed, if we fight normally, I'm not going to win.
But I'll win him some time.
I don't mind dieing for Master Z ideals.
Your master ideals, uh...
So you're ready to throw your lives away for that?
However, I felt hesitation in you sword.
Don't be so sure of your self, you pirate!
You lowly pirate!
You have no right to live!
Die before Master Z!
Master...
Master... always that, are you kids, by any chance?
I'm getting tired.
It started...
So that the old man doesn't get sad, we're going to kill the Straw Hat's without leaving any of them alive.
Gomu Gomu no Pistol!
-Don't let him get away!
-Shoot him!
Take that!
Modo, Modo!
Listen do the requiem of the other world.
Soul Solid!
Mil Fleur!
Gigantesco Mano!
Stomp!
Take that!
Hissatsu Midori Bosshi!
Take Javelin!
I'm going to show you the power of my Magical Clima-Tact!
Heat Ball!
Cool Ball!
Thunderbolt Tempo!
Damn you Nami!
You got us too!
That was quite a shock!
-It was good, wasn't it?
-What was good?
You guys defeated a lot of them.
What about Luffy?
He went on ahead...
Then let's go right after him...
Guys, look!
Those are the Pacifists!
But those are different from the ones we saw before...
You came, boy.
The explosion that's going to destroy the last End Point already began.
I didn't come here for that.
I'm only here to get my straw hat back!
This hat?
...
What does it mean to you?
It's what shows me the path.
The path to become the Pirate King.
I wont allow pirates to have dreams!
And I'll destroy the sea you keep sailing!
Remember this...
The name of whom will destroy evil... my name is Z!
That's useless!
Did you stopped thinking and came here just to attack me?
Not good!
Sorry it took so long, guys!
Let's go, partner!
It's here!
Iron Pirate!
General Franky!
Awesome!
Franky Radical Beam!
That's so cool!
Mosa, Mosa!
Sky Walk!
Diable Jumble!
Take this!
Santoryu!
Seiryuuin!
Ryuusui!
If you're not sure, cut them your self.
I prefer the sexy Nami!
Burn, sexy fire!
Take this!
Meteor attack of love!
You can fall in love, Nami.
I'm back!
I also came back to normal!
-Really?
It's really great!
The 90 years!
Zoro and the other did it!
Now there is only Z left!
Let's join Luffy!
It's useless!
You can't destroy my justice!
Gomu Gomu no Pistol!
Gatling!
Even being a pirate, you have courage.
Much better than that wimpy Navy!
But...!
Gear Third!
Gigant Pistol!
I am...
Z!
Z!
...
Smash Buster!
Luffy.
Boy...
Why do you want to face me so much?
Even if you defeat me, in the end, you're still a pirate.
Nobody from the society will thank you.
And so what?
I'll do what I want!
If I'm not able to defeat you, I also won't be able to become the Pirate King.
Is that so?
You sound like a kid.
You'll do what you want?
If that's the case, I'll do the same.
I'll dedicate my entire life to end with your ambition!
Come at me!
This is the final battle!
Black Fist Zephyr... has returned!
I will do it!
I will become the Pirate King!
My name is...
Z!
You bastard!
I got old...
With only that and my body doesn't want to move anymore...
What a shame...
That fun moment ended so quickly...
Frankly, that battle ended right on time, what a close call.
Luffy!
Those who follow their dreams, destroy everything and move on.
Take your straw hat and my life.
I don't want your life.
I'm already satisfied.
If you want to continue, I don't mind.
No.
I'm also satisfied.
Luffy!
Are you okey, Luffy?
Guys!
...
"Guys", nothing!
You went on ahead again!
Master Z!
Ain...
Binz...
Forgive me... for giving you so much work...
Me...
Me...
I'm happy to see that you're alright.
It seems everyone is gathered here.
Kizaru...!
It's a shame that the Straw Hat and Master Zephyr are almost dead.
But seeing you're all going to die anyway, it's the same.
Damn it, just at time like this...
You brought them all...
At the end, I did what I wanted.
Now I have to pay the price for doing what I wanted.
Or I wouldn't be able to face the ones that went before me.
Straw Hat Luffy.
You have your own adventure, don't you?
Leave the rest with me, Z!
Old man!
No, Master!
Kuzan!
You made a place where I'd be able to die?
Master!
Master!
Master...
Master...
Yasakani no Magatama!
Borsalino!
Good bye, master Zephyr!
I'll give you guys your last training!
Don't cry!
He ended his life as he wanted to.
Don't you think he's incredible?
We're going to remember this!
Come at me when you want!
I'm the hero of justice, my name is...
Z!
...
Translated and timed by broken silence*
The sea is watching...
The beginning of the world...
The sea knows...
Of the end of the world...
So it shows...
The path to be followed...
So he guides us...
Towards a correct world... he collects it all... he cuddles them all...
I will destroy all pirates!
I'll just follow master Z.
Catch this!
I'll also follow master Z.
Smash Buster!
Smash Buster!
Retreat!
Fall back!
Master Z...
How long has it been?
Master.
What brings you here?
Borsalino!
I've warned you not to depend too much on you're Pika Pika no Mi power.
like always.
Master Zephyr.
I abandoned that name.
I am Z!
Don't you think you're feeling too sure of yourself by becoming "Admiral Kizaru" of the Navy?
!
I didn't come here to remember the past.
You won't be able to match my speed with that heavy weapon.
What will you use the Dyna Rocks for?
I never got along with you!
return the Dyna Rocks.
They say that the Dyna Rocks rival the Ancient Weapons.
How about we use them to celebrate our reunion?
Dyna Rocks cause a massive explosion when exposed to oxygen.
Let's Go!
Master Z!
Damm!
What in the hell is the Navy doing?
Come on!
baby!
I'm always a lively skeleton.
Come on!
It's good drinking while watching the cherry blossoms.
Chopper?
Yes!
I love drinking milk while watching the leaves as well!
It's me!
Meat!
It stinks!
I smell poison!
It's a deadly poison!
Chopper?
He was poisoned?
Chopper!
He took poison...
I remembered!
Do you have any idea of what it is?
Listen to this song..."The poison I took".
It's a song?
!
the taste of the drink is... or was it always like this?
They are always so lively.
taking care of plants.
my children!
I want you to give birth to a lot of Pop Greens!
shall protect them!
Usopp!
So it's your fault!
Look!
Usopp was caught by the poisonous milk!
It's your fault for being there!
The poison is for killing worms!
it means you are worms!
we are not insects.
are you ok?
but it's also pretty good.
It's a little bitter...
is it because I'm becoming an adult?
Let me try it.
That's horrible!
Agricultural chemicals also affect the human body.
I am the cherry tree...
I'm slowly spreading... the cherry tree!
The autumn will end.
cherry!
Lets go!
It's south...
I'm going south!
Change of course!
why did you spilled my drink?
they make so much noise...
Why can't you rest quietly?
be quiet!
Damn it.
Nami!
Delivery of the special orange juice!
Sanji.
I'd also love some dessert!
with pleasure!
Sanji!
I also want dessert!
And meat!
I want some candies!
Me too!
I want cola!
My drink is ending!
I want dessert too!
bastards!
you idiots!
I was born only for the ladies!
It taste bad!
your poison is here again.
I'm not using it anymore!
What is this?
It's snow!
its not freezing to be snow.
What is it?
This is... volcanic ashes!
Volcanic ashes?
!
One Piece Film Z!
Translated and Timed by:
broken silence*
That's disgusting!
did it not?
Let's take a bath together after.
-Bath?
-Together?
!
Today is not my bath day... this is very disgusting.
Me...
Can I take a bath with you as well?
Can I?
my face is also disgusting!
Don't hurt your feelings by what you said.
No... you can take a bath with me!
Chopper!
Nami!
Do you have any idea?
The needle that pointed to the direction that came the volcanic ashes began rotating randomly.
It is a strange movement.
It looks like a lost child who lost their parents.
Lost?
How so? could've exploded the entire island.
And because of that the needle stopped pointing?
That's impossible!
This is the New World!
?
you bastard.
Don't be surprised.
Disappear before the beauty of Nami.
You cherry shit.
some tea.
Thank you.
the island the needle was pointing at.
Nami...
There is someone we can't show that pointer by any means.
That's true.
Choosing the safest route and guarantee the crew life is my job.
that needle is moving very interestingly!
Luffy!
?
Let's go there!
Crap!
He saw it!
I smell adventure!
those ashes were... guys!
Our route has been decided!
Get ready!
Luffy!
...
But... how will we know where the island is...
Be quiet.
I'm a navigator.
I can take you anywhere.
keep an eye out.
Leave it to me!
is it really alright choosing it like this?
the path you choose can cost us our lives.
Turn 20 degrees to port.
Turning 20 degrees to port.
do you hear me?
so prepare yourselves!
We can't do anything.
he is the captain.
But we don't want to get involved with volcanoes or anything that can threaten our lives!
Castaway located.
Prepare to rescue him immediately!
He's being dragged!
Leave it to me!
whats wrong?
I'm running out of strength... pull!
don't let go yet!
are you ok?
So?
Is he alive?
he's not in danger.
Really?
I hope we didn't get someone problematic again.
A big guy all bruised!
And this business in his left arm... anyone can tell its not just something.
Thats really made of Kairouseki.
I get it!
Thats why Luffy lost his strength when he touched it.
A powerful weapon made of Kairouseki...
Awesome!
Thats not it!
Kairouseki has the same energy as the ocean.
A weapon made from that material... means that it was made to end Devil Fruit users.
He might be an enemy.
and we can't lower our guard in the New World.
throw him overboard.
Idiot!
We can't do that.
I don't want to!
He might kill you as soon as you heal him.
I'm a doctor!
I can't abandon him.
Whats the problem?
Chopper.
I'll finish him off.
Is that alright?
Luffy!
of course it's alright.
they are so carefree.
I really have a bad feeling about this... right?
There is no need for that kind of excitement.
it looks like he woke up!
it seems so.
crappy cooker.
Shut your mouth.
you shit marimo.
Got that?
We caught a big fish.
Are you ok?
You don't need to force yourself.
do you remember it?
I remember.
Thank you for the great treatment.
doctor...?
Chopper!
Doctor Chopper.
You are a great medic.
you idiot!
You are the captain of this ship?
Can you tell?
Yes I can.
I've seen a lot of young man like you.
I'm a specialist when it comes to understanding your powers.
Really?
What will you do?
Stay with us until we arrive to the next island?
my friends should be using that to get here.
Old man... thats a cool weapon!
Where do they sell those?
a crazy scientist from the Navy made this one for me.
Battle Smasher.
the weakness of the Devil Fruit users this way I destroy their power and crush them with this powerful squeeze.
I don't recommend something heavy like this.
Awesome!
so something terrible can happen if I fall with it on the ocean.
are you a Marine?
so I left them.
I'm doing something different now.
What are you doing?
I'm fighting for the mission I gave myself.
What are you fighting against?
It looks like I'm being questioned.
I'm sorry about that.
It's just that it would be bad for us if you were a Marine.
Would there be a problem if I were a Marine?
we are pirates.
Really?
You are pirates.
Luffy!
go outside!
please.
How painful... a punch from a Kairouseki weapon really works.
Straw Hat...
Why are you a pirate?
To become the Pirate King!
Pirate King...
Pirate King?
!
He's strong!
Damn!
Brooke!
Let's fight too!
Ok!
They're here?
Ain!
We are confiscating this pirate ship.
Do not resist.
You will only shorten your lives.
There is no pirate that doesn't resist when he's asked not to!
Even we started to attack!
Mosa Mosa!
What the hell is this?
-Thats is...
-A Devil Fruit user!
Mosa Mosa no Mi ability...
Mosa Mosa Dance can control every plant there is!
Things look dangerous out there as well.
Let's end this now!
Dos Fleur!
What...
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa!
He's so fast that I can't establish a target!
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa Mosa!
Can't breathe...
Mosa Mosa!
Mosa Mosa!
Be careful!
Don't come down!
Mosa Mosa!
What is this?

-Stop it!
-Mosa Mosa Mosa!
No!
No!
No!

How dare you do that with Nami?

Stop...
Don't come close...

Stop!
Seis Fleur!
right?
What have you done with Nami and Chopper?
Robin!
Stop using your ability!
Modo Modo!
I ate the Mono Mono no Mi.
I am a regressive person.
My ability can transform anything 12 years in time.
Now you should be about 18 years old.
I'm so tiny! Making your existence disappear.
Smash Buster!
Mosa Mosa!
You'll become the Pirate King with that power alone?
Don't make me laugh.
Should I crush you like this?
Pirate King?
What's you're name?
Monkey D. Luffy.
I get it.
You're Garp grandson.
I'm happy you're alright.
We're destroying this pirate ship with a simultaneous attack from out fleet.
Luffy!
Luffy?
Z!
I will obliterate every single pirate!
Try to survive while you still can.
Pirates!
Damn!
Wait!
...
Our fight...
Our fight isn't over yet!
Sunny!
...
Damn!
take that off!
We're really in danger!
Luffy!
let's run!
let's retreat!
Come on!
Damn!
I'm free!
Super!
...
Sunny!
I believe in you!
Emergency escape system!
Coup D'Burst!
They really did that.
they are our trump card to protect the Final Points of the pirates.
Using the Dyna Rocks to destroy the Final Points...
The first Final Point sank with the base that protected them.
Z objective is to destroy the three Final Points and destroy the sea of the New World.
Even that man would get injured if he was caught in the Dyna Rocks explosion.
He's alive.
Everyone here must know this.
He doesn't know when to fall.
Z....
Black Fist Zephyr
He is alive.
no matter the cost.
He may have taken care of us in the past... enemy of justice.
And everyone who's part of the New Navy even if Z is alive.
They all should be disposed of in the name of justice.
Hunt Z and his New Navy with all the power of the Navy!
Let's recover the Dyna Rocks and execute absolute justice!
the world would be as well.
Is that really a lie?
You think that if it was a lie we would take this so seriously?
I understand what Z is planing.
He wants to end with all the pirates of the New World.
that becomes possible.
he'll kill all the innocent citizens as well.
Vice-Admiral Garp...
Who is this Z?
A man who was our comrade once.
We were friends.
We should have been comrades.
Zephyr... your anger is so strong to destroy the world?
Do you hate us that much?
Luffy!
I'm going to completely fix Sunny!
right?
I'm leaving Sunny with you!
This is for the doctor.
This if for the load...
I'm so sorry...
All of this because I wanted to save that Z.
Don't apologize.
A pirate shouldn't regret doing what he believed in.
It's not your fault.
We all know that.
Thank you.
New Navy...
Who could that Z be?
e attacked out of nowhere!
The ability of that Binz is problematic.
Next time we are going to settle things straight.
that showed so much bravery. we would all be swimming at sea because of the Navy attack.
We need to find that New Navy and pay them back.
Are you serious?
!
I don't want to mess with those dangerous people again.
Let's just stay in this island until Sunny is repaired!
What are you talking about?
my body won't return to normal!
Me neither!
I don't want to stay like this!
I can't do anything!
The navigation in the New World will be a lot harder!
so I can guide Sunny Go!
That's right!
I didn't said for you to continue like this.
It would be a problem if I didn't return to normal as well.
I bet you're happy to be 18 again and having everything in the right place again.
I'm sorry!
Honestly.
Don't joke around when our ladies are in trouble.
wait a second...
That means I'll be able to closely follow Nami's precious days while her body matures?
I'll be able to see the moment when the larva turns into a beautiful butterfly?
!
That's incredibly awesome!
Disgusting.
you marimo!
I'd give you a lesson.
Idiot!
...
I'd defeat you even as a kid!
What did you say?
with 3 year old!
Idiot!
...
And I would have defeated you when I was a baby!
-Hu?
!
-What did you say?
!
This is no time to fight!
You know... my age was also decreased...
It looks like...
It didn't change...
Anything...
I was also touched by that Ain from the New Navy.
it's true.
But it didn't change anything... dead and only bones.
I've been a corpse for more than 50 years...
But something changed that had never happened before.
My age went back 12 years.
my hair has the softness of 12 years ago!
No it hasn't!
You painted your hair!
Then were you happy to rejuvenate?
You don't need to go back?
that's right.
No!
I also want...
to return to normal?
How do I know?
!
we have to gather information about Z and the New Navy.
old man?
talk to our navigator.
Did Z showed up again?
do you know Z?
Many pirate ships have been attacked around here and comes to these docks.
All the injured pirates say they were attacked by Z. they are all pirates saying they were attacked by Z. We receive the ships that were totally destroyed by the navy.
so he takes care of the pirates or anyone that comes with a problem.
searching for their dreams.
lost their way and abandoned the New World.
Z is stealing the men freedom on the sea.
I won't accept that.
I'd like to give you my strongest equipment I have stored.
Strongest equipment?
Amazing!
A powerful equipment!
Wait a second!
Nami?
He said the strongest!
The strongest!
we have to pursue Z! So we have to take care of that first. we're going to raise suspicion when we are looking for information about him.
First we have to gather information and clothes!
The strongest equipment to defeat Z comes after that!
Got it.
right?
do you have any big city on this island where we can get some information and clothes?
This island has nothing besides our docks.
How about you go to the neighboring island?
They are very popular for the hot springs and volcanoes.
it has a lot of people visiting!
Sea train?
Are you talking about that sea train?
Yes.
Bones.
You guys are very strange.
Leave it to us that we'll gather the information.
Robin-chwan?
Sanji.
A lover face also won't do.
We will gather the information!
No...
But I wanted to go with you...
Let's enjoy the hot springs.
How about we rest before the battle?
I'll take care of them.
Looks like there is some great brands on this island.
we're here!
don't get yourselves caught by the Navy!
Spread out!
Honestly...
Devil Fruit users are full of weak points!
They lose their strength even with that?
we will still survive.
That's nice.
Can we really stay here wasting our time?
that Z!
You Idiot! it will cause us trouble again.
right?
That we're letting them and Chopper gather information about Z?
right?
A beautiful dancer!
....
Everyone is so excited!
sir.
sir?
please!
I can feel it...
I can feel it in my bones...
Everything goes away along with the exhaustion.
Z....
I got distracted with the weapon in his arm and I let my guard down.
and you attack him without thinking... you'll lose all your strength.
Let me and Marimo take care of Z.
I don't want you to do anything.
I will finish him off.
I'll dodge that arm of his and attack him with everything I got!
You're lively as always.
I got tired of waiting for you guys here.
Aokiji!
guys?
Who is this person?
A Marine!
Admiral Aokiji of the Navy!
Admiral?
!
Hi there.
How long has it been?
We've finished positioning the Dyna Rocks.
Understood. those Navy brats...
Will know of my rage and the scale of my hatred.
Sanji!
-Yes!
What does an Admiral want with me?
don't get too excited.
What do you want with us?
Don't tell me...
It's nothing like that.
I don't want to capture you now.
you should've known that.
I'm not a Navy Admiral anymore.
Then what are you?
What?
I don't like a skeleton asking me that...
But since I'm not an Admiral anymore...
Am I an ally of justice?
that's not it...
What am I?
How should I know?
that's it.
I have no intention of fighting with you now.
I wouldn't be in a hot spring where I can't use my powers.
You were waiting for us?
That's right.
I don't want to stay here anymore... let's talk about the rest outside.
this?
...
I got carried away too much.
have you found anything?
I heard some rumors that a few Marines came to this island after Z.
But I couldn't get anything more.
hu?
really has more Marines arriving but I don't know if it's because of Z or due to Robin's popularity.
Robin is that much popular?
Just look at how much I got for being her manager!
Awesome!
We can't do anything with rumors alone.
what will we do?
I know!
Leave it to me.
What happened to you leg?
there are things that it's best not to ask?
Then I won't ask... why did you fought against Akainu?
Aren't you both friends?
well.
You're really a brat without any consideration..
No comments about that too.
why are you here?
You really don't learn anything.
that I can answer you.
Enjoying the hot springs.
That's what I'd like to say...
I can't stay relaxing too much.
I'm chasing after a certain man.
right?
Z... wasn't he?
he is a former Navy Admiral.
Sorry for the wait.
Thank you.
but you strive a lot.
don't you have any cool story to tell me?
You know Z?
how do you know Z?
Everyone knows him!
The adults are talking...
That you've come here to capture Z!
the rumors are already saying that?
hey!
What's the problem?
Z is really in this island?
That's right.
We've come here to take the bad guy Z.
We are heroes of justice!
what is Z objective?
What is he doing here on this island?
That's enough.
To destroy the End Point.
End Point?
...
Is that a lie just to scare me?
It so happens that it's not a lie...
That's enough!
You guys drank too much already.
You're talking too much.
sir!
young lady.
Is there any objective behind that?
No!
That man asked me to ask about Z!
Crap!
It really is a strange man.
Nami threw the blame on us!
Should we run for it?
but it's enough disguising myself as a manager.
I have got to work.
young lady?
Let me go!
Seis Fleur!
-Let's run away!
-Yes.
-Captain!
-Are you alright?
That's the power of the Hana Hana no Mi!
That woman is Nico Robin of the Straw Hat pirates!
Don't let her escape!
sir!
The world is in the Great Era of the pirates.
arise and vanish pirates that go after the One Piece.
other are born.
Does pirates appear because the One Piece is on the other side of the sea of the New World?
Or does One Piece exists because Pirates also exist?
Do dreams come first?
Or is it the people?
... they loose their happiness and the loved ones cry for them.
What must be done?
Is there an answer?
found an answer by force.
so will the pirates.
is it not?
but I want to see where does the bath that Z has chosen will take him.
But I don't know what to do next.
Straw Hat Luffy.
right?
Show me your answer.
See you later.
Z is on this island.
we ended up creating a huge conflict!
But we got the information we needed!
Z is on this island!
Despite not knowing what he plans.
There they are!
Go on ahead!
Devil!
That's it!
Let's regroup with Luffy and the others?
Yes!
What do you think about the clothes I got you?
I mean.
-With you?
!
I have a great taste.
Shut up...
Pirates!
Luffy!
Usopp and the other arrived.
And they brought a lot of friends along.
they caused a mess.
we should have ... leave a few unharmed!
take care of them...
Please.
That's...
Haoushoku no Haki...
Hey!
Where is Z?
On the other side of the island.
My squad should be chasing him now.
Tekkai!
Your justice is useless.
freedom...
You'll have to start everything all over again.
It looks like the Dyna Rocks worked on this island.
the destruction of the second End Point was a success.
Grande Imbuto.
We'll achieve that goal when the third End Point is destroyed. a beautiful dawn.
Gomu Gomu no...
Rifle!
What are you doing here?
You pirate brats......!
Who are you calling a brat?
old geezer!
Old man!
Return my friends back to normal!
Binz!
Yes!
Understood.
I'll take care of the swordsman.
Damn Marimo!
Going ahead like that... guys!
Mosa!
Mosa!
right?
come and get it the pirate way!
Damn!
We've got not choice.
Usopp!
I'm going to fight Z one on one.
Luffy!
Z...!
Help me!
We won't be able to run away!
Someone help us!
Stop right there.
go to the sea train and be careful.
Thank you very much!
Doesn't he care about anyone?
Isn't this too much craziness?
This time you wont catch me with that weapon!
You accelerated the flow of your blood.
To increase the skills of your body over the limit?
Gear Second!
Right?
Yes!
I'll find the One Piece and become the Pirate King!
I get it now...
But do you have determination?
Are you determined to risk your own life?
I am!
But what about your friends?
!
Are you prepared to sacrifice your friends in order to fulfill your objective and walk on top of their corpses to continue?
Hurry up!
Their not here yet?
we'll also be caught by the volcano!
Are they alright?
Modo!
That's enough!
I'll kill you next time.
Time's up!
Look at this!
She ran away?
What a crazy ninja... you won't hit me with any attack!
Who said I was afraid?
!
...
Fear and pain weaken your determination.
Smash Tornado!
bullets wont work!
Really?
I'm loosing my strength...
Your body won't move anymore.
This ammo is made of Kairouseki.
did you?
it's not an easy task getting Kairouseki. but works wonders on those who are too convinced in their own power and let their guard down.
You too are a sinful man.
This straw hat also got old... together with this Great Pirate Age.
Give it back!
to take care of it!
I promised I would find him and give him that hat back!
Give it back!
the redhead?
!
His sins are also deep...
Give it back.
Don't you worry.
He will have the same fate as you.
Those convinced fools who call them selves the Four Emperors...
Will all die without being able to do anything...
Without even knowing of my plan.
Don't mock on Shanks!
That's not good!
It seems that the pyroclastic flow began.
Usopp!
Where is Luffy?
...
Luffy!
Luffy!
Luffy!
Luffy!
Luffy!
We can't do anything against that.
guys!
really?
They say its more than 100 KM/h!
I get it! Hissatsu Midori Bosshi!
Boaty Banana!
Jump!
We need more speed!
It has no engine!
It's just a boat!
Look out!
We're gonna hit!
It also has no helm!
It's just a boat!
...
To the right!
Now it's divided in two!
We won't make it!
Damn it!
They're here!
huh!
It blew up the entire island...
Master...
What about that straw hat guy?
The fire mountain will decide his fate.
One Piece?
Everything in this world?
What a ridiculous dream.
How many sacrifices do they think it took?
How much suffering and hatred?
then I'll squash it all!
to the very last.
Your dreams will end in deep hatred.
will close the curtains on the Great Pirate Age!
What happened to him in the past was really terrible.
involving innocent civilians as a motive...
It is not right...
Dry as always...
Not everyone can easily separate things like you do.
Sengoku?
Vice-Admiral Garp!
What is it?
Admiral Zephyr...
What kind of person was he?
believed in the Navy justice.
Then why is he doing this?
A certain accident happened.
An accident?
Zephyr was a serious man. and he risked his life fighting against the rivals of that era.
He became an Admiral of the Navy when he was still young.
his wife and son were killed by a pirate that hated Zephyr.
By fully understanding the burden of having a position as a Navy Admiral...
Zephyr kept that hatred and sadness in the bottom of his heart and continued his mission.
The years passed and Zephyr pledged himself on training the young Marines.
The man who created all Marines... are his apprentices.
I want to create a hero.
a bigger tragedy fell upon him.
The training ship of the new recruits commanded by Zephyr was attacked by a pirate with Devil Fruit powers.
everyone else were killed.
Zephyr lost his arm.
Took an arm from a Navy Admiral?
from the Navy scientists.
he created an attack unit.
And he hunted down Devil Fruit users. but that was when they weren't disappointed with the Navy.
the only thing that was keeping him in the Navy was destroyed.
was chosen to be a War Lord by the government.
Zephyr left the navy.
And now he showed up in the New World.
Hating pirates...
Disappointed with the Navy... the New navy.
The unacceptable reality... has changed that man.
Navy!
Why does Black Fist Zephyr is called Z now?
Z..........
Who knows?
I can't say that.
Enemies without hesitation are strong.
The sea is watching...
The beginning of the world...
The sea knows...
Of the end of the world...
Even if I disappear...
He knows everything...
You shouldn't be afraid the orientations of the sea.
As you are here you should not fear it.
Because your friend are waiting for you.
master.
A song for the Marines who travel north does not excite me.
didn't you?
Yes.
This is the best drink.
imitating you.
I wanted to be a cool man like you.
You came to give a lecture to a stubborn old man?
but I won't stop.
Do you intend to die?
there is no problem.
It's to get rid of the evil called pirates.
The Navy can't execute the true justice.
but step aside.
let's drink together.
I don't want to kill you.
Neither do I.
Master Zephyr...
This is a Kairouseki bullet?
It was on Luffy's shoulder.
How long will you stay here?
A-Aokiji!
You!
...
What is Aokiji doing here?
It's alright.
We met a few moments ago.
Z is a former Navy Admiral?
He stole the Dyna Rocks from the Navy.
Dyna Rocks?
!
What is that?
Those are rocks they say it has a power comparable to the Ancient Weapons.
they create a massive explosion.
it's use is forbidden in civil zones.
The Navy has control of them all.
And now Z stole them?
He wants to use them to destroy the three End Point's of the New World.
Stop right there!
What are these End Points? and they call it End Point.
I doubted it...
Does that really exist?
I can't believe that breasted lady turned into this dull little girl...
Are you listening to me?
!
Does the End Point really exist?
Or not?
They do.
second... all the pirates must be laughing thinking thinking it's nonsense.
but no ones believes it.
But the government investigated and declared the legend was false!
It's because the investigation results were different from what was announced.
The government used every possible means to make the world believe it was a lie.
Don't you think it would be terrible if pirates showed up wanting to use that?
Only the Government and the Navy superiors know about that.
But no one never thought a former Admiral would use that.
That's true.
the Navy wouldn't be so desperate.
We got involved with a very dangerous man.
Z already destroyed two End Points with the Dyna Rocks.
If he destroys the last one...
There will be a chain reaction that connects all three End Points.
Reaction?
that will burn the entire New World sea!
Every single pirate in the New World will get burned to death.
he'll also involve the innocent people!
Wait a second!
He will involve civilians...
That's just wrong!
Don't you think you're thinking too much about yourselves?
How much fear and victims do you think pirates cause in the world?
Don't tell me you don't know.
Z hates all of that...
He hates it so much that he doesn't care if he dies along.
It doesn't matter!
I'm going there to get my hat back!
I'm going to settle things with him!
Luffy?
The New World will be destroyed!
I promised Shanks.
That I would become a great pirate and return him that hat.
I won't be able to become the Pirate King.
But you know...
The New World will...
That won't work with the stubbornness of our captain.
which way?
yes.
Let's see... so I'll follow him.
Then let's go.
Do we really need to do that?
Isn't the fate of the New World too much for us?
You two want to stay?
you idiot?
When did I said that?
Of course I'm going!
I'm the brave sea warrior!
Chopper?
Yes!
Let's go!
War with that darned man!
how much longer?
It's ready!
...
The repair is finished!
We can go at any time!
Super!
thank you!
What are you saying?
It seems they've decided.
where Z is...
It's this way.
An Eternal Pose?
!
Why are you giving this to us?
why?
you can't go to the island where Z is.
but... they also went to the last island.
The Navy too?
the Navy is taking it seriously now.
you'll be destroyed along with the New World.
you'll be surrounded by the Navy and you'll also be destroyed.
I want to see it until the end. and now it turned into a battle with the future of the New World at stake.
do you remember the strongest equipment?
They brought the ships Z sunk to these docks.
The old with pity to throw away the things and dreams that others have left behind...
And he saved it all.
isn't it?
and attack him with everything!
I'm counting on you!
that's trying to take the sailors freedom!
Guys!
I want to be a hero!
a Navy Admiral or a Pirate?
Pirates aren't Heroes.
Really?
They're both the same to you?
Yes...
You guys are cool!
Gari!
The best is to do what you like!
Keep going in this direction!
Prepare the frontal cannon!
Target:
Enemy fleet!
Ready... fire!
I see it!
It's the last island!
They're here!
Don't let them reach Master Z!
Where the hell is Z?
Let us pass!
You go on ahead!
Take that!
Usopp 100 Tons Hammer!
Take that!
I'll leave the rest with you!
Usopp!
Guard Point!
Shooting with full power!
Z...!
They got separated...
But it's an awesome sight...
Modo!
I won't let you reach the master!
I'm going to stop you!
I'm glad... mas this is to return my friends to normal.
I'm fighting with everything I got.
I'm not going to win.
But I'll win him some time.
I don't mind dieing for Master Z ideals.
uh...
So you're ready to throw your lives away for that?
I felt hesitation in you sword.
you pirate!
You lowly pirate!
You have no right to live!
Die before Master Z!
by any chance?
I'm getting tired.
It started... we're going to kill the Straw Hat's without leaving any of them alive.
Gomu Gomu no Pistol!
-Don't let him get away!
-Shoot him!
Take that!
Modo!
Listen do the requiem of the other world.
Soul Solid!
Mil Fleur!
Gigantesco Mano!
Stomp!
Take that!
Hissatsu Midori Bosshi!
Take Javelin!
I'm going to show you the power of my Magical Clima-Tact!
Heat Ball!
Cool Ball!
Thunderbolt Tempo!
Damn you Nami!
You got us too!
That was quite a shock!
wasn't it?
-What was good?
You guys defeated a lot of them.
What about Luffy?
He went on ahead...
Then let's go right after him... look!
Those are the Pacifists!
But those are different from the ones we saw before... boy.
The explosion that's going to destroy the last End Point already began.
I didn't come here for that.
I'm only here to get my straw hat back!
This hat?
...
What does it mean to you?
It's what shows me the path.
The path to become the Pirate King.
I wont allow pirates to have dreams!
And I'll destroy the sea you keep sailing!
Remember this...
The name of whom will destroy evil... my name is Z!
That's useless!
Did you stopped thinking and came here just to attack me?
Not good!
guys!
partner!
It's here!
Iron Pirate!
General Franky!
Awesome!
Franky Radical Beam!
That's so cool!
Mosa!
Sky Walk!
Diable Jumble!
Take this!
Santoryu!
Seiryuuin!
Ryuusui!
cut them your self.
I prefer the sexy Nami!
sexy fire!
Take this!
Meteor attack of love!
Nami.
I'm back!
I also came back to normal!
-Really?
It's really great!
The 90 years!
Zoro and the other did it!
Now there is only Z left!
Let's join Luffy!
It's useless!
You can't destroy my justice!
Gomu Gomu no Pistol!
Gatling!
you have courage.
Much better than that wimpy Navy!
But...!
Gear Third!
Gigant Pistol!
I am...
Z!
Z!
...
Smash Buster!
Luffy.
Boy...
Why do you want to face me so much?
you're still a pirate.
Nobody from the society will thank you.
And so what?
I'll do what I want!
I also won't be able to become the Pirate King.
Is that so?
You sound like a kid.
You'll do what you want?
I'll do the same.
I'll dedicate my entire life to end with your ambition!
Come at me!
This is the final battle!
Black Fist Zephyr... has returned!
I will do it!
I will become the Pirate King!
My name is...
Z!
You bastard!
I got old...
With only that and my body doesn't want to move anymore...
What a shame...
That fun moment ended so quickly... what a close call.
Luffy!
destroy everything and move on.
Take your straw hat and my life.
I don't want your life.
I'm already satisfied.
I don't mind.
No.
I'm also satisfied.
Luffy!
Luffy?
Guys!
... nothing!
You went on ahead again!
Master Z!
Ain...
Binz...
Forgive me... for giving you so much work...
Me...
Me...
I'm happy to see that you're alright.
It seems everyone is gathered here.
Kizaru...!
It's a shame that the Straw Hat and Master Zephyr are almost dead.
it's the same.
just at time like this...
You brought them all...
I did what I wanted.
Now I have to pay the price for doing what I wanted.
Or I wouldn't be able to face the ones that went before me.
Straw Hat Luffy.
don't you?
Z!
Old man!
Master!
Kuzan!
You made a place where I'd be able to die?
Master!
Master!
Master...
Master...
Yasakani no Magatama!
Borsalino!
master Zephyr!
I'll give you guys your last training!
Don't cry!
He ended his life as he wanted to.
Don't you think he's incredible?
We're going to remember this!
Come at me when you want!
my name is...
Z!

Get me the fuck in VIP.
Look, I'm not trying to get in the middle--
And I really don't wanna hear anything you gotta say, okay?
He has a girl up there, doesn't he?
I'm just trying to have a good time.
Do you promise to behave?
Look, you promise-- I'm not taking you in there
- unless you promise.
- I promise.

You know, sometimes we say growing up, it's important to have someone that you look up to, like a role model.
And in my case, that was my best friend.
You deserve everything you have, my man.
You've got a lot of good shit coming your way.
Yo, man, nice speech.
Come on, seriously.
We've been at this thing for a while.
And I know we make it look easy, but the shit is really pretty hard.
You know what I'm saying?
Hey, but we work hard, so we can play hard.

- Please.
Please.
You need to chill.
I'm about to throw you up outta here.
Kalif, get the fuck outta here.
You think you running shit?
You ain't running nothing.
You just like one of Prime's hos.
Always on his dick, even when he treats you like shit.
Yeah, and what you need to do-- take care of your babies, okay?
- What is it now?
- You leave my family out of this!
Three babies by two different baby mamas?
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Get the fuck outta here, Autumn.
- No, you don't tell me what to do.
- The fuck you talking about?
- Me and you are done!
It's over.
- Oh, really?
Really?
- We've been done.
- And how am I supposed to know that?
Because you were man enough to tell me?
And we both know that didn't happen.
So, what, I can't come toast the great Optimus Prime?
- Is that it?
- What is wrong with you, Autumn?
- Get her outta here, China.
- Get off me!
Her shit so good, you gotta shame me in front of all these fucking people?

- Hi, Grandma, just checking on you.
Skylar, why are you calling me from a party?
Oh God, you should see this place.
It's amazing.
It's like a million beautiful people here.
- What's wrong with that?
- I don't know.
- Woman: ...fabulous in that dress.
- Listen to me, baby.
You can't let anyone steal yourjoy.
Woman:
If he'd just look my way tonight, he's so gonna get it.
Woman #2:
Wasn't he with someone?
Who?
Little Miss Muffet?
She can't keep a man like Prime.
I saw how excited you were to go to that party, so if you're there, be there.
- (chattering)
- Make them remember your name.
No, I'm just gonna come home a little earlier.
It better not be because it's time for me
- to take those blood-thinner pills.
- No, ma'am.
(sighs) Honestly, I'd just rather be there than here.
All right, baby.
I'll see you in a little while.

- No, everything's okay.
I'm gonna leave, actually.
But I thought you were having a good time.
I am.
I'm having a great time.
I don't like leaving my grandmother by herself for a long time.
- Mmm.
- Sorry.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry.
All right.

You don't have to walk me out.

There isn't much I don't know how to do, Lonzo.
- Thought you'd know this by now.
- There, you see, you see?
You can't just be sexy, can you?
Huh-uh.
You gotta be cocky too.
Hey, I'm not being cocky.
I'm just telling the truth.
- Right.
- Seriously though, I actually did study under some of the top chefs in Paris for like a year.
- Mmm.
I love France.
- Yeah?
I love it.
I shot a film there a few years ago.
I swear, the food there is like--
- Oh, it's just so good.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's delicious.
- Yes, my mom firmly believes that a woman should be able to cook for her man.
Sounds like you have a smart mother.
(chuckles) You have no idea.
You're absolutely beautiful.
You know that?
Thank you.
- And you can cook?
- (laughs)
(sighs)
Skylar.
Just wanted to give you a call, make sure you made it home safe.
It was really nice to see you tonight.
Yeah.
Hey, why don't you give me a call in the morning?
Maybe we can grab brunch or something.
All right?
Sleep well.
(doorbell chimes)

- (sniffles)
- What are you doing here?

(RB music playing)
Kalif:
Time out.
Tell me I didn't throw a kick-ass party last night, man.
- (hooting)
- Diddy ain't got shit on me.
Bad shit-- bad shit, seriously.
Lonzo:
What I wanna know is where the fuck were you all night?
I already told you-- rule #1.
What's rule #1 again?
ABC-
- Always Be Closing.
Bingo.
Right there, my man.
Those rules don't work, man.
Come on.
Had to close down the Carnegie chick last night.
- Yo, how'd she do, man?
- She had a Prime Alexander night.
28 points, shot 54 % from the three-point line.
- Damn, that's pretty good.
- Kalif:
That is a good night.
- (laughter)
- Lonzo:
Are you gonna see her again?
(chuckles) Nah.
I'm already working on my next lottery pick.
Lonzo:
Of course you are.
Hey, hold up.
Seriously, what was up with Autumn?
That's what I wanna know.
Dude, she was tripping all night.
Yo, that's Dallas.
I told you not to let her ass in the party.
She was fine until she saw you kiss Skylar.
What?
Yo, look, she was crazy from the jump, man.
- Red flag.
- Lonzo:
I told his ass.
- Kalif:
Amen.
- Will you guys relax?
- Damn, man!
- Dallas:
Relax.
It's all good.
Whatever, man.
Yo, anyone else close last night?
Well, I had a trez Nathaniel.
- Lonzo:
A trez what?
- Dallas:
A dude?
A dude?
No, man, the two chicks from the pool last night.
Man!
I'm telling you-- strawberries and wine, candles.
(chuckles) It was quite exquisite.
I'm feeling that.
I'm very happy for you.
- What about you, Zo?
- Oh, I had a good time, man.
Y'all know he was handcuffed to Katalina all night, talking about "I love you, baby.
I love you, baby."
- I'll fucking kill you.
- (laughs)
Yo, what's up with you and her, anyway?
Man, I don't know.
I like her.
- I like her a lot.
Yeah.
- Okay.
Okay.
You know, just be careful with her.
- I will.
- Yeah.
You know what?
Actually, go ahead and let's redesign
- this whole setup over here.
- The scarves?
Yeah, I don't like it.
And let's redress her too.
- Okay.
- Anyway, like I was saying, his tie and handkerchief matched my dress, Prime warned me that I should've put my sunglasses on
- in the car, but--
- Ooh!
- I know, right?
- At night?
- (door opens)
- Oh!
- Hey!
- Hi!
How are you, girls?
- You look so cute.
- You too.
- Hello.
- Hey, Heidi.
Hi, honey, how are you?
- Super cute.
Have a seat.
- Thanks.
Dylan, do you mind getting us a couple of glasses of wine?
- Not at all.
- Mm-hmm.
So how are you guys doing?
- Good.
- Good, how are you?
- Fabulous as always.
- Woman:
Of course.
So I guess you know why we're here.
We need something amazing to wear to the Rico Terrell gala.
- Oh, okay.
Of course.
- And I heard this year it's an all-black affair.
I wonder who decided to do that.
- Mmm, that's me.
- Heidi:
Oh, okay.
I'll go and get you guys the book and I'll show you what I have coming in next week.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Ladies.
- Both:
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Here you go, sweetie.
- Woman:
So, Autumn...
- Mm-hmm?
...is this the wine that you purchased while you were in San Francisco last week?
I wasn't in San Francisco last week.
Why?
What's going on?
- It's probably nothing.
- What's probably nothing?
Okay, spill it.
Jessica said that she saw Prime in San Francisco last week with another woman.
And that gossip website said that you were kicked out of Prime's party.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, you shouldn't believe everything you read.
Okay, first of all I was not kicked out.
We had a fight.
It wasn't the first and it won't be the last.
Okay, and what about that girl that he was kissing at his party?
- You know, the one he was all up on?
- Oh, you mean the peasant who was rocking last year's rummage-sale collection?
- I'm not worried about her in the least.
- Ahem!
Maybe we could show them the new Norell collection.
Mmm!
Yes, I am sure one of these beauties can pull off such a stunning dress.
(chuckles) You know what?
I have work to do, so I'm gonna go.
But you ladies shop.
- Okay?
- Thank you.
Okay, um, maybe let's take a look at a few dresses.
Do you mind?
- Just bring out what you have.
- Yeah.
- I'd be happy to.
- (whispering)
Carnegie, if you don't stop checking that phone-- do you think it's gonna ring just because you want it to?
I'm just checking the service.
Sometimes it gets spotty in here.
Uh-huh.
Yet I have the same carrier and I'm four bars strong.
I know, I know, I know.
Why hasn't he called me?
You just saw him last night.
He's probably working today.
I know, I know.
It's just... that was the most amazing date.
Well, what did he say when he dropped you off?
You-- you mean when he left?
- So he came in?
- Oh yeah.
Yeah.
- Well...
- It was amazing.
I'm not even kidding.
This is the best date I've ever been on.
- Hands down.
Hands down.
- So you slept with him after dinner and he hasn't called you back.
- It's not like that.
- Not like what?
You're making it seem like because he slept with me he doesn't want to be with me.
Well, have you ever gone on this long
- without him speaking to you?
- I mean... not-- not since we met.
It's probably nothing.
- You think?
- I know.
I'm sure you're right.
Sounds like you guys have an amazing connection.
Now let's get dressed and get some drinks at Duke's.
Your phone rings in other places besides the living room.
- (knocks) - (door opens)
- Hey.
- Hey, you.
Well, they're gone.
(chuckles)
- (door closes)
- Umm... how you doing?
Are you doing okay?
(hesitantly) I'm fine.
You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
- (both laugh)
No, I'm just wondering, 'cause having them catty bitches in your store- you know.
- Who, Heidi and Shannon?
- Yes, Heidi and Shannon.
- Oh, I'm not worried about them at all.
They will never change.
But you know, as long as they continue to shop here,
I really don't care.
Amen.
Umm... so you looking at that website?
I don't even know what website they're talking about, so--
Girl, please, do not let the bougie fool you.
You know I keep up on my gossip.
(chuckles)
My college girlfriend runs the site.
(sighs)
Umm...
I saw these pictures this morning--
Prime kissing that girl.
Honey, why didn't you just tell me that you guys were having trouble?
Because it's no big deal.
- It--
- It's not that serious.
- It's serious.
- (chuckles)
Dylan, I really don't wanna talk about this right now, so- (door opens)
- Man:
Yo yo yo, I got a delivery.
- (bell dings)
- Umm... (chuckles) I'll get it.
(door closes)
- Hi, Quenton.
- Hi.
Dylan, when are you gonna stop playing and let me take you out to dinner?
- Huh.
- Mmm.
Man.
- What is this?
- It's a delivery for your cousin.
- On a Saturday?
- Apparently it's a special delivery.
- Okay.
Right this way.
- (chuckles)
- (Dylan knocks) Sorry.
Delivery.
- (door opens)
- Oh, hey, Que.
- Miss lady.
I have a delivery for you.
- Are you serious?
- (chuckles)
- (laughs)
- Umm...
Are you waiting for a tip?
Seriously?
You- he just asked me out.
- Hey, I gotta save up.
We all know how you singletary ladies are.
- Bye, Que.
- Wow.
Nuh-uh.
Dylan, call me.
You won't regret it.
I-
- I don't even know.
What is this?
Is this from Milan?
What'd you get?
Did that say it was from Prime?
Maybe it's some new shoes.
Autumn?
These are-- is this your stuff from Prime's house?
- (strained) It looks that way.
- He cut up your pictures?
Apparently so.
Honey, I'm--
I'm so sorry.
But this is stupid, okay?
This is petty.
- Look-- okay, I'm gonna-- - (sobs)
I'm gonna take care of this, okay?
Yeah, don't-- don't worry about it.
Umm, I got it.
Okay?
(laptop thuds)
(knocks on door)
(grunts)
Hm-mmm, Grandma.
I got it.
- Mmm.
- Whew.
- Hi, can I help you?
- Miss Hathaway?
- Yes.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
I'm your driver for today, compliments of Mr. Prime Alexander.
Your first appointment is at 1 :00 p.m.
My first appointment?
Yes, ma'am.
I can't tell you where we're going, but I do have a schedule here for your grandmother so she's not worried.
So this is one of those scavenger hunts or something.
I'm not at liberty to say, ma'am, but I do expect your granddaughter to have a lovely evening.
- Gimme one minute.
- Not a problem, ma'am.
You remember that purse that I lost last year in Vegas?
Uh-huh, 'cause you forgetful.
Why is that the newer version in purple?
- You want it?
- I do.
I love it.
Well, I got a surprise for you waiting at the house.
I think you might like it.
- Shut up.
No, you don't.
- I guarantee I do.
- Stop!
- Right next to the new shoes I got you.
Hi, Cash.
- Keep it moving.
- Baby, come on.
Let's go see if they have that bag you was looking at last week.
Huh-uh, don't try to change the subject.
How the hell does that ho gonna come over here, talking some "hey, Cash," like she knows you like that?
- I don't know that girl.
- Where do you know that girl from?
- Like I said, I don't--
- Where do you know that girl from?
Maybe she was at the club or somewhere with Prime.
- You know he got groupies everywhere.
- Next time you need to tell your little bitches not to come over and talk to you...
- My bitches?
- ...when they see you with your woman.
I'm glad you recognize that.
Now can we keep it moving?
- No, I'm serious, Kalif.
- You causing as scene for nothing.
Try me if you think I'm playing.
I'm so tired of that simple shit.
- I don't care if I'm causing a scene.
- Look, I ain't do shit, a'ight?
No, you ain't do shit.
You think you slick.
You think I'm stupid.
But I got something for that ass.
You wait and see.
- See, that's your problem right there.
- I gonna find her.
You always trying to threaten somebody.
I'm not threatening you.
That shit was disrespectful.
- Come on.
You know what?
- No.
No no no, come here.
- Let's go introduce--
- Don't embarrass me in public.
- 'Cause you about to get you--
- See, you're always wiling out.
This is your first appointment for the day here.
When you need me, I will be outside here waiting on you.

Hello.
Hey, sexy.
Is it too late to call?
It's 6:30.
- I know.
I'm just playing.
- (chuckles)
So what's up?
I thought you were going out with Kalif and Dallas.
Yeah, I was, but I have a really big, important meeting on Tuesday and I don't wanna be out drinking with the guys and-
- I don't know.
I just kinda wanna keep my head right, you know?
Wow.
Smart guy.
I think I like you.
Wait, you think you like me?
What's up with that?
- You don't know by now?
- Oh, I know.
So what are you doing?
Well, that's why I was calling.
My family and I are having a little movie night tonight and I wanted to see what you were doing, see if you wanted to roll through.
Maybe watch one of those chick flicks my mom's been begging me to watch with her.
Okay, so you're telling me that you're spending a Saturday chilling with your mom, watching chick flicks?
- How cute.
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Mama's my rock.
Wow.
Not a lot of people can say that.
What do you mean?
You're not close to your mom?
Let's just say my mom is married and she has children, but "close"
isn't a word I use to describe her relationship with anyone.
Wow, Katalina.
I'm really sorry to hear that, honey.
So what movies does your mom have on the lineup?
Oh, we've got "Love and Other Drugs,"
and "Good Will Hunting," of course.
Oh, my vote is definitely for "Good Will Hunting."
I love me some Matt Damon and Cole Hauser-- good old Boston bad-asses.
- Mm-hmm.
- So, 20 minutes?
Awesome.
That's perfect.
Okey-dokey.
Just so you know, I look a little crazy.
I definitely was curled up in a ball reading a book in some sweats.
Oh.
Oh, my bad.
I see what you're doing.
Okay.
That's right, you're fishing for compliments right now.
We can play this game.
No, you know what?
I can't even-- you are-- you are naturally beautiful from head to toe, so--
Thank you, very very sweet of you.
All right, well, drive safe, honey.
Okay?
- Okay.
- I'll see you soon.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- (gasps)
- Well?
Oh my-- ooh, that is soft.
I know.
I was surprised to find that your hair's still natural.
You know, you have so many options when it is.
So I wanted to soften up your curls a bit.
It's absolutely beautiful.
Thank you.
Oh wow.
So how long have you been dating Prime?
Oh, I wouldn't call it dating just yet.
Only we met a few months ago, so we've hung out a few times.
But I like him.
He's really nice.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
So all the things you hear about the great Optimus Prime- it isn't true?
- You know, to be honest,
I wouldn't have a clue as to what they say about him.
I moved out here to take care of my grandmother, so she's been my main focus.
All that matters is that he's nice to me.
So you're not one of those jersey chasers running behind him because he has all those millions?
Definitely not one of those.
(chuckles)
I don't know.
Maybe it's just me, but...
I'm more concerned about how a man treats me than what's in his wallet.
You know?
I actually had a run-in with a few of his admirers the other night at the club.
(chuckles)
Just being in a room with those women made my skin crawl.
I would totally understand if he had trust issues dealing with those type of women, just throwing themselves at him.
Yeah, you'd be surprised, honey, they're everywhere.
That's why I make it my business to find out if these girls are dating my brother for the right reasons or because he's a pro basketball player.
Prime is your brother?
Milan Alexander at your services.
(chuckles)
I had no idea.
I-
- I don't know what to say.
You don't have to say anything, honey.
You've said enough.
I'm just happy to find out that my brother's with someone who's with him for the right reasons.
You're a sweetheart.
Keep it that way.
And don't break his heart.
- (hip-hop music playing) - (engine revs)
So what's up, baby?
Baby, come on.
- You know we be off the hook, baby.
- Shanita:
Kalif!
Kalif!
- Hold on.
Oh shit.
- Who the hell plays basketball this damn late at night?
- You better have your ass back by 9:00!
- Yo, come on, man, go!
I'm not playing with you, Dallas!
Mira:
Why can't you just find somebody else tonight
- and have a little fun?
- Carnegie:
No one gets me like Dallas.
Oh God, nobody gets you-- okay, what does he tell you?
- I mean--
- Carnegie:
I mean--
Mira:
I don't know.
This guy sounds like he's kinda full of it.
Carnegie:
No, but you're always negative like this.
Every time I like somebody, you jump down my throat.
You gotta go with my gut.
And my gut is I really like him.
Okay, go with your gut.
What about your heart?
My gut-- oh, Chad's working.
Probably get some free drinks.
- Isn't that Dallas?
- (gasps) Let's go!
Oh, wait wait wait wait.
He's with a girl.
(rock music playing)
(laughs) No no, that's probably like his friend or his cousin or something.
It's all right.
That's-- that's definitely-- definitely--
- Let's go investigate.
- Umm...
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Just-- excuse me.
Just trying to get to my boyfriend here.
Excuse me, guys.
- Dallas:
To a lot of luck, baby.
Whoo!
- All:
Whoo!
Dallas!
Dallas!
Hey.
Oh hey, Carnegie.
What are you doing here?
I was gonna ask you the same thing.
Excuse me, guys.
♪ Work that body, get your sexy on... ♪
Dylan:
He should be embarrassed.
- He's acting like a child.
- Honey, I was dragged out of a club-- dragged out of a club by two people holding me down.
It was embarrassing.
- It was very embarrassing.
- I wish I was there.
Look, Carnegie, you know I don't want anything, right?
I'm a single man.
I'm not looking for anything serious right now.
Whoa.
Umm...
I wish you would've told me that last night, because I didn't get that memo when you were in my bed.
To go through that by yourself, that's not--
- What?
- That's Dallas.
I'm sorry you feel like that.
I thought we were just hanging out, enjoying each other's company.
- Carnegie, come on, let's go.
- Yeah well, I didn't know that, Dallas.
Okay?
And the only reason why you're in the clear is because you never mentioned the word "relationship"
when you were wining and dining me and bringing me my favorite cupcakes.
You're in the clear because you could do whatever you want and my feelings is no consequence to how you feel!
He's doing the exact same thing that Prime did to you.
Why do they all act like that?
Why do they get to get away with that?
- They won't.
They won't.
- You got what you wanted, and now you're done.
Right?
Is that how it goes?
- Is that how it goes?
- Come on, Carnegie, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Listen to your girl.
Screw you, Dallas!
- (crickets chirping) - (car door shuts)
Nice.
20 minutes, huh?
- Two hours later...
- (chuckles) Whatever.
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- Who's this little princess?
- This beautiful thing is my niece.
- Hello there.
- Hi.
- She's so precious.
- She's so cute.
Are you ready to go inside?
They have been waiting to meet my beautiful girlfriend all day.
- Your girlfriend?
- Did I say something wrong?
No, babe.
Girlfriend is just fine.
I like that.
Come on.
My name is Katalina too.
Hi, family.
This is Katalina, everyone.
Katalina, this is my family.
Lonzo, don't have her thinking you were raised by wolves.
Oh, here we go.
That's my sister.
Nice to meet you, Katalina.
I'm Susie.
- Nice to meet you, Susie.
- This is my father,
- Mr. Juan Rodriguez.
- Mr. Rodriguez, a pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet you too, Katalina.
Hope you don't mind.
I brought some cake for dessert.
Oh, I don't mind.
What kind of cake do we have?
It don't matter what kind of cake it is.
You ain't having any.
What do you mean I'm not gonna have any?
A man should be able to have cake in his own house if he wants to.
- Yeah, that's-- that's my family.
- That's my cake.
- Yeah.
- (both laugh)
- (rattling)
- Carnegie, come on!
Come on, you cannot let him embarrass you like this!
Don't let him win!
He's such a fucking asshole!
Are you gonna come out?
Come on, Carnegie!
She's right, you know.
You need to pay him back for what he did to you.
I'm sorry, but that was ridiculous.
Um, who are you?
My name is Autumn, I used to date one of Dallas's friends, Prime, and he embarrassed me in the exact same way that he embarrassed you.
- Carnegie.
- (crying)
What did you say?
I'm sorry.
I saw that back there and that was ridiculous.
I cannot believe he did that to you.
- It is not right.
- Why does this always happen to me?
I always fall in love with assholes.
Autumn:
Look, Dallas, Prime, Lonzo, Kalif-- all of them, that whole little crew-- they're dogs, okay?
They don't give a shit about anyone else but themselves.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
- I feel so stupid.
I feel--
- Mira:
No.
- Yes, I feel stupid.
- Do not blame yourself.
I'm sure he wined and dined you,
- did all that sweet shit.
- Cupcakes.
Autumn:
That's what they do.
Look, honey--
- I'm so sorry.
- Carnegie:
Thank you.
It's a game to them, okay?
They don't care about who they hurt in the process.
It's not even about the sex to them.
They just wanna conquer as many women as they can and they don't care who gets hurt in the process.
Trust me.
Times like these, I'm glad I do women.
Look, if I were you, I would confront him.
I would let him have it.
I mean, did you see his smug ass out there?
All those guys out there, they think he's a hero.
And those women?
They still will talk to him because they think it's something you did.
They never think it's something they did.
Dylan:
You didn't deserve that, no matter what.
- He doesn't even care about you.
- Not at all.
- Carnegie:
Hm-mmm.
- We've gotta do something.
Don't let him get away with this at all.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Autumn:
At all.
- Dylan:
Yeah.
- All right, I'm gonna go out there.
Yes!
Dry your eyes.
- All right, you look cute.
- I'm going.
Okay.
Skylar:
Are you guys sure about this dress?
It's cut really low.
Miss Hathaway, are you in the dress?
Yes.
- Are you in the shoes?
- Yes.
Then get the hell out of my dressing room
- so we can see you.
- (curtain slides)
- You look fantastic.
- (softly) Beautiful.
Come come.
You did it.
(laughs)
Absolutely beautiful.
Vidal, you did this.
- Yes, I did.
- Oh my God, it's so beautiful.
Oh, wait wait wait, don't forget about the purse.
- Oh, I don't have a purse.
- Of course you do.
- That is so beautiful.
- Isn't it?
- You know, you guys are so--
- No no no no, yeah yeah yeah yeah.
- Both:
We know.
- Get going.
- Thank you.
- Put in a good word for us.
(crickets chirping)
- (whispers, gasps)
- You're welcome.
(laughs)
Oh.
I have had the most amazing day of my life.
Well, you deserve it.
I mean, I know taking care of your grandmother can't be that easy.
Wow.
Now come on.
The night has only begun.
(mouths)
- (chattering) - (whispers) Oh shit.
She's coming back, she's coming back.
I can't believe all this shit.
So how do you know our mutual friend Dallas?
- Excuse me?
- Carnegie:
Well, let's see.
You're having drinks at his favorite place to be seen, so you must be new.
He took me here on our second date.
We snuggled in a booth over drinks.
Has he brought you pastries yet?
Oh, I'm sure he's asked you all about your favorite things by now, huh?
Mmm!
I love that bracelet.
Let me guess, let me guess.
He said it reminded you of him when he got it, because it's dainty, just like your wrist.
Mine's gold.
He gave it to me before we walked in here last time.
Hey, yo, you balling like that, man?
But don't worry.
He's not gonna try anything tonight, because the sex won't be good enough until you're hooked.
He likes sweet kisses that he feels are escaped-- well, that's what he told me at least.
But from the look of it, you got about 10 more days of access to him and then he'll fuck you like he fucked me last night.
- (Kalif laughs)
- And then there's no more phone calls just to hear your voice.
He's gonna make it seem like you did something, and he's gonna act like you're a psycho if he runs into you in public, make everybody think you're some stalker girl he just can't break.
Well, he told me that about the girl before me.
I'm sure he told you the same thing about me, right?
Carnegie, what are you trying to prove here?
Just trying to get it off my chest, Dallas.
I'm just trying to get all the facts straight.
You know what I mean?
Because you're fucking good.
You're really good.
You should be an actor like Lonzo.
You would win an Academy Award, hands down.
Hands down.
Ooh!
I'll take one of these.
The least you can do is buy me a drink.
Mmm mmm!
That's good.
Real smooth.
Real-- mmm.
Mmm, but then it leaves this bitter taste in your mouth.
Mira:
Ooh!
That was awesome!
- You go, girl.
- Dylan:
Oh my gosh, it was.
Yo, hey, let me help you, bro.
(laughing) Hey, you know--
Oh, I ain't never gonna let you hear the end of this.
Very classy, Carnegie.
Thank you!

- Carnegie:
Try to keep your lips--
- Katalina:
Mm-hmm, exactly.
- Those earrings are really cute.
- Really?
- I wanna steal them from you.
- My mom bought them at your store.
- She did?
- Yes, those are our spring line.
- Learn your line.
- Vidal:
Wait wait wait wait.
First of all, that's not my job.
Thank you.
Vidal:
Please.
Sweetie, you need to come to my place and I'll hook you up with a nice dress to go along with 'em.
- Katalina:
Thank you.
- You know what?
Huh-uh.
Do not try to steal my clients, all right?
- Please.
- Thank you.
Now how's your mom doing?
I haven't seen her in a while.
She's doing so good.
Her and my dad actually just got back.
- They were away for three weeks.
- Really?
- Shopping.
Shopping.
- Yeah, shopping.
Paris Fashion Week.
That's when my family suddenly
- needs to get international as well.
- Exactly.
- Vidal:
OMG.
Excuse me!
- Katalina:
Big shot with all her--
- Miss Hathaway!
- Who are you yelling at?
- Vidal:
Miss Hathaway!
- Katalina:
Who is that?
- Vidal:
You just wait and see.
- Who's that?
- Who is it?
I don't know.
- Skylar:
Oh my God, Vidal,
- I was gonna call you...
- Prime's new girlfriend.
...tomorrow and say thank you for everything.
- How are you, sweetie?
- I'm good.
Wait, what are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be having breakfast in bed?
No, I'm here to pick up a to-go order for my grandmother.
Where are my manners?
Ladies, this is Skylar.
- Skylar, this is Katalina...
- Hi.
- Carnegie...
- Hi.
What was your name again, baby?
- Mira.
- Yeah, mirror-- get one.
(scoffs) I could break you in two, man.
- Hello.
- Hi.
This is Dylan and that's Autumn over there in the corner.
Hi.
I remember you from the other night.
- Hi.
- Nice to see you again.
Wait a second.
How do you two know each other?
We ran into each other the other night at Prime's party.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Grab a seat, sweetie.
Your food isn't ready.
- Oh, thanks.
- Vidal:
Grab a seat.
Well, how did it go?
Tell me all about it.
- Oh, ladies.
- What?
I had the pleasure of dressing Miss Skylar for the fabulous evening with Mr. Prime Alexander.
- (soft chuckle)
- Okay.
- Wow.
- That's really--
A date, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- You have a good time?
Oh yeah, it was really nice.
I mean, we just went and had dinner, walked in the park.
Vidal:
Please, don't try to downplay it.
She got the works-- hair, makeup, everything.
And then he sent her to my place to pick out a fabulous outfit.
- Mira:
Wow.
- Vidal:
Mm-hmm.
- Wow.
- Sounds quite familiar.
Reminds me of Dallas.
I hate him.
Dylan:
You had a nice time, huh?
Yeah, I did.
He's absolutely the sweetest guy I've ever met.
- He's just really nice.
- (guffaws)
(Carnegie laughs)
Wow.
The biggest sweetheart ever?
- Autumn:
Dylan.
- No, I mean, wow.
Well, you know that Autumn dated Prime and he wasn't the biggest sweetheart to her near the end.
So... it's weird.
Huh?
No, I mean she should know.
She should know what she's getting into, right?
Look look.
We don't even know her and we don't even owe her anything to even explain what happened with Autumn, make her relive the experience, so...
I don't think we really need to explain anything.
I'm gonna let you guys eat your lunch.
Thanks.
Skylar, wait.
Look, I'm sorry.
She's my cousin.
I get a little protective.
But I do think that you should know what you're getting yourself into before you go too deep.
Please stay.
Honestly, I really didn't know.
If you don't mind me asking, what happened?
That's a very good question.
Honestly, I don't know what happened.
We got into this fight, and then the next thing I know he's like cursing me out in public, throwing my things out, calling out my name.
It's just-- what I thought was a little fight was the end of my relationship.
Is that what happened the other night?
Yup.
(sighs) I wish someone would've given me the heads up about Dallas.
I hate that motherfucker.
I really do hate him.
I'm sorry.
I hate him.
- Hate him.
- I'm sorry.
Who's Dallas?
He's one of Prime's friends.
(sighs) Seriously, just like Autumn, for the first couple of months he was like a fucking unicorn.
I mean, calling two, three times a day, emailing-- the whole nine.
Then I spent the night with him and guess what.
The whole next day, nothing.
So Mira and I go to the bar, get a few drinks.
And he is cuddled up with some other chick wearing the exact same bracelet he gave me.
So anyways, I confronted him and he basically had me in the bathroom crying.
And that's when Mira and Autumn were like--
I'm sorry, Dylan was there too, sorry-- "Go out there and confront him.
He's out there having a great time with those girls."
She actually looked like a hooker.
Anyways, so I went out there and I called him out on his shit.
I handled some business, didn't I, girls?
- She did too.
- Carnegie:
I did.
But that's exactly what she should've done, because those guys-- they do it to everybody, they get away with it and nobody says anything.
Dallas, Kalif, Prime--
- I don't know about Lonzo.
- Birds of a feather do flock together.
- Hey, watch it.
- Carnegie:
Yes they do.
- We don't know.
We don't know.
- They do.
- We need to put a stop to it.
- Mira:
That's like saying
I'm drinking as much as this one over here.
- Girl, you go.
- What?
Really?
Birds of a feather flock together?
- Cut off.
- I'm celebrating.
- I'm celebrating.
- Oh, hold on.
Look, all the ladies are trying to say is just be careful.
That's all.
Okay.
Thanks.
I'm gonna go.
It was nice meeting you ladies.
- I'm sorry if we--
- Katalina:
Nice meeting you too.
- Just letting you know.
- It was-- yeah.
- Just take care.
- Thanks.
How is it that you're not like Kalif, Dallas and Prime?
What do you mean?
(snorts)
Look, I've known you guys for a while now and you know they're shady.
I wouldn't even talk to you if I thought you were like them.
- Katalina, they are not shady.
- Tsk.
They're not.
I'm telling you.
Look, I've known those guys my whole life, practically.
I met Prime when I was eight years old, for crying out loud.
I used to be taller than that fool back then.
- (snickers)
- I swear to God.
- Then we met Kalif in high school...
- Wow.
...and Dallas in college.
They're good guys.
Their problem is they love women.
What's so bad about that?
Okay, but... let's say a girl really really likes a guy and she's in it for all the right reasons.
- Mm-hmm.
- They're just chilling, seeing where things go.
And they finally sleep together, then he dumps her.
Someone that does this repeatedly...
- Mm-hmm.
- ...that's a good guy?
That's not fair.
It's not.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's not.
Besides, Autumn brought that shit upon herself.
- You know that.
- I know for a fact that Autumn is not the only woman he's done that to.
Okay okay, first off-- first off-- you can't say that.
It's a completely different situation, babe.
All right?
Think about it.
They were dating for over a year.
- Right?
- Yeah.
Okay, and he was really good to her.
Look, regardless of all this crap, that's their life, right?
What happened between them is between them.
I'm cool with that.
(both chuckle)
Look, what you need to be focusing on right now is not what Prime and Autumn were doing.
(Katalina laughs)
Mmm, it's that you will never do that to me.
- You understand me?
- (sighs)
You know I won't, baby.
- You promise?
- I promise.
C'mon.
(chuckles)
(sighs)
(birds chirping)
- What are you doing here, Autumn?
- Nice new car.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
(sighs) Why haven't you returned any of my phone calls?
I tried to contact you for over a month now.
I got your emails, I got your messages,
- but Prime insists that we don't speak.
- (laughs)
And being that things are really good with us...
- Ah.
- ...
I don't think that we should either.
Okay.
Oh, I see.
Look, I'm not trying to tell you anything.
Okay?
I just have something you simply need to see.
- We'll just take a short ride.
- (laughs)
It won't take long and I will never bother you again.
Okay, you're crazy if you think I'm going anywhere with you.
No one asked you to.
You have a fancy new car.
Follow me.
Trust me, you'll wanna see this.
(hip-hop music playing)
(car door opens)
(people chattering)
(kids playing)
Okay, so you brought me to a kid's birthday party.
Autumn:
Look a little bit closer.
Prime:
Now shoot.
Shoot.
Oh!
I think we gotta get it again.
Come on.
All right, there you go.
(laughs)
Oh, good job, little fella.
- Dallas:
Guys, hey.
- Prime:
Go on wit' your mommy.
Woman:
Let's go.
Hey, Skylar, Skylar, you don't wanna do this right here.
Hey, wait a sec, wait a sec.
Wait.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- Prime:
Skylar, Skylar.
- Really?
Really, Prime?
- Look, baby, I can explain.
- Explain what?
That you have a wife?
That you have kids?
- Uh...
- How are you gonna explain this?
- I can't.
Not here.
- (crying) I trusted you.
Everybody tried to warn me and I trusted you.
You know what, Skylar?
Please,
- let me take you home.
- Stop stop.
Look--
What is wrong with you?
Why would you do this?
I'm not one of these groupie girls out here trying to trap you.
- Why would you treat me like I was one?
- Skylar.
Baby, listen.
Look, let's just talk about this later.
All right?
Just-- it's not what it looks like.
I have listened to everything that you said, every single thing that you have told me.
I listened and I believed you.
What is wrong with you?
You have a family, Prime.
You have a fucking family.
- Prime:
Uh...
- I hate you.
(guitar ballad playing)
♪ Looking back it's all clear to me ♪
♪ Should have known it all along... ♪
I trusted him.
Like...
I did everything that I could for him, and he still did this.
They always win.
At least you found out now and not like a year from now.
Listen, you two are much stronger women than I am.
If I had been at that birthday party, ooh, no, some people would've gone down.
I mean kids, baby mamas, like the jumping castle-- something.
But she still can.
So can we.
They humiliated us publicly.
Let's do it to them.
I don't know, Carnegie.
- Mira:
How?
- Just think, okay?
Prime always has a million cameras in his face.
So call him out on his shit like I did with Dallas.
You really think that that worked?
You thought that did something?
I'm sorry, but he's probably been with at least three women since you.
I hate him so much.
I don't know what I even saw in him.
He has a unicorn tattoo.
He probably waxes his butthole.
(women laugh)
Look, what are you trying to get out of this?
Honestly, what are you trying to propose that we do?
I mean, I get why you're angry and why Skylar's pissed, but...
Oh, so I don't have a reason to be hurt, Katalina?
Is that it?
Really?
I mean, come on.
Autumn, you knew that Prime had a fiancée.
So it's not like it's some surprise to you.
Okay, fuck that.
No one really cares what you have to say.
Okay, boo boo?
And first of all, yes, I knew he had children, and no, I did not know he had a fiancée.
And when I finally found out, he told me that he was no longer with her, so--
No, exactly.
And doesn't Kennedy live in Louisiana or something?
- Exactly.
- Dylan:
If he told her that they weren't together anymore, why wouldn't she believe him?
So you thought you would be the one to change him, when he's the type that wouldn't change for anyone, unless he was forced to.
Okay, that's like not expecting a scorpion to sting you.
Okay, you know what?
I am not gonna justify my feelings for any of you, especially you.
- The point is that you stayed!
- (laughs)
You stayed!
Look, we all know the risk of dating an athlete, especially Prime Alexander.
But I didn't.
I didn't know.
What did I do?
What did I do that was
- so bad that I deserve this?
(crying)
- Nothing.
I gave Prime a year of my life.
All the broken promises.
(laughs) He sold me on this idea of like a fairy-tale life.
Where's my happy ending?
(chuckles) You know what?
How much do we have to put up with before they realize that they can't just break our hearts and pretend like nothing happened?
- Katalina:
But that's Prime Alexander.
- Oh my God.
And nobody is going to change Prime Alexander!
Autumn:
Unless we force him to.
What they did to us was cruel and it was wrong.
And they need to be held accountable for their actions.
Look, you can't make somebody change that doesn't want to change.
- You just can't.
- Dylan:
Yes, you can.
Listen, all you have to do is use everything about them against them.
Quickly, without remorse.
They get their strength from running in a pack like dogs.
You shake up the bonds, destroy the pack.
Exactly.
Skylar:
You're right.
Let's do it.
(sighs)
Hi, yes, I'm with Pryor Lamborghini and we have a lease on a car that's in arrears that needs to be picked up.
Yes, I know exactly where it's going to be on Saturday.
The license plates read "work"-
- W-O-R-K.
- Yes.
- Carnegie:
Hello?
Hi, I'd like to report someone.
I know seven women he's given herpes to-- well, probably more than that.
His name?
It's Dallas Lauderdale.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Mira, it's your turn!
(cellphone vibrating)
- Hello?
- Shanita?
This is Shanita.
This is Mr. Prime Alexander's publicist, Dahni.
Okay.
Prime is setting up a special surprise for Mr. Kalif Wyatt at the upcoming Rico Terrell gala and would like you to attend.
- Okay.
- Great!
He'll send a car for you at 8:00 p.m. on Saturday.
And he asks that you keep this a secret.
Thank you.
(laughs)
Now this is completely anonymous though, right?
I mean, you're my girl and I'm sending this to you 'cause I want you to get the scoop, but I can't have this traced back to me.
Okay.
Are you ready for this?
Well, have you heard a little rumor about Kalif Wyatt and his very very close boyfriends?
Gay clubs and stripping.
And, honey, I have a picture, and I am sending it to you right... now.
(laughs)
You are welcome.
Girl, you're my sorority sister.
I gotta hook you up.
(laughs) Hell yeah, you can come through.
You gotta bring a friend though.
Yo, I gotta get out of this mall, girl.
I'm feeling all eyes from all guys.
- Holy shit.
Hey, Kalif.
- This is crazy.
- Yo, hold up.
- What?
Kalif?
Yo, how you know my name, little man?
Oh, baby, I make it a point to keep up with all the available ass out there.
What?
What the hell you talking about, man?
- Who what?
- They got the whole exposé, exposing your love for the boys.
Love for the boys?
Man, I'm all about the ladies, and the ladies know it.
Ask your girl, she know.
- What?
Excuse you.
- I'm just going based off what I read.
What you read?
You read wrong, homey.
Who what?
Yo, look, I don't know what the hell y'all talking about.
I'm out.
I feeling too much of a sugar rush
- in this motherfucker.
- Let's go.
Dallas.
- Yeah, Dad?
What's up?
- What the hell is this?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?
- It's you, isn't it?
- Well yeah, but I don't know whose cam--
Oh, yes you do!
I'm telling you, I have no idea how it got there.
This is going to kill your mother.
It's all over the Internet!
It's in everybody's inboxes.
You need to get out of here, take one or two months.
Just get out of here!
- I swear, Dad, I--
- No.
Dallas, we're done.
(mutters) Fuck.
(phone ringing, vibrating)
Crap.
- Yo.
- Dallas:
Somebody emailed everybody at my dad's company my game tapes, and he damn near fired me!
- Wait.
What?
- How did it get out there, Prime?
Yo, man, why you asking me?
I don't know.
I don't be watching your game tapes.
Autumn.
What?
Nothing, man.
Lemme call you back.
Yeah, whatever.
Where is she?
Hi.
May I help you with something?
Where is Autumn, Dylan?
I'm sorry.
She's not here.
Why?
She knows why.
You tell her I know she did it.
Did what?
(door opens, shuts)
Hmm.
Well.
So it begins.
That's gonna be $2,476.32.
- All right.
- Mr. Prime, good to see you again.
V-dog, good to see you.
You look good.
- I see you built a wing on the back.
- Yeah.
This place looks great.
I love it.
- Thank you.
- Oh, um, Mr. Alexander?
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.
Your credit card declined.
(laughs)
Why don't you just swipe that again for me?
- I already ran it twice.
- Camille, swipe it again.
I'm sure there's a computer glitch or something.
- It's been doing that lately, you know?
- Yeah.
(sighs) Yeah, see?
It declined again.
Do you have another card?
- Let me do it.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- Give me two seconds.
Not to worry.
- No problem.
- Yeah...
- It was declined.
Yo, what do you mean it was-- that's a limitless card.
There must be a problem with the bank.
- I--
- Gimme that.
- Vidal:
I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Katalina:
What are you laughing at?
You looking at me like I'm crazy.
No, come on.
I'm delirious,
- I'm so hungry right now.
- Clearly.
- How's the food?
- Is that good?
- Mm-hmm.
- Kalif:
Oh my God!
- Oh shit!
- Oh my God.
Babe!
- Shit!
- (laughs)
- Was that Kalif?
- That ass-- was that your boy Kalif?
- He was naked.
- Yo.
Please call that man.
What is he doing?
Why--
He's on something.
Yo, that-- did that really just happen?
- Am I bugging?
- Hey!
Dawg, I swear to God we just saw some dude that looked just like you run down the street
- with his balls flapping, bro.
- No bueno.
We're at the restaurant we always hang at.
(birds chirping)
- Good look in the clothes, man.
- Dawg.
Can't believe that shit happened.
(Lonzo claps) Yo!
What up, brothers?
The fuck wrong with y'all?
Hey, did I see you running down the street naked?
Oh shit, man!
What?
You saw me and you didn't even try to help me?
!
- That was you?
- We supposed to be boys, man!
(laughs) Dude, I tried calling you.
What the hell?
Tried calling me?
Did it look like I had my fucking phone on?
Look!
I need to know right now-- did one of y'all let out my game tapes?
- Lonzo:
What?
- Somebody uploaded on the Internet, emailed to everyone in my company's directory.
Ah.
My mom-- fuck, she's gonna kill me.
- (sighs)
- Prime:
Something ain't right.
How the hell all of us gonna have a bad day all at the same time?
Flames been hounding me all week!
And now this shit?
What the fuck happened to you?
- All my cards were canceled.
- Lonzo:
What?
$100-million man and I ain't got no money.
What kind of shit is that?
All this can't be a coincidence, can it?
All right, look, I don't know what the fuck is going on right now, but we've got this gala in a few hours, right?
Dude, we've gotta get our minds right for that.
- (crowd chattering)
- Woman:
Mr. Alexander!
Mr. Alexander, over here, please.
Prime!
Over here, please, sir.
A really quick interview.
Thank you so much, sir.
Mr. Alexander.
- Hi, how are you doing tonight?
- Great.
- Wow, you look really great.
- Thank you.
So this is the 5th Annual
Rico Terrell Benefit Gala for sickle-cell anemia.
What makes this such an important cause for you?
Well, when I was a rookie, I volunteered at the children's hospital and I met so many amazing children who suffer from this disease.
And I vowed right then that I was gonna do all that I could to help fund research to find a cure one day.
And I kept my word.
That is awesome.
How much have you raised this year so far?
Well, at this point with this event, we've raised $3.5 million.
Congrats.
That's truly a great accomplishment.
Oh, and next year we'll do $5 million.
Wow.
Thank you so much for your time.
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thank you.
(hip-hop music playing)
(silent)
So what's up, baby?
Yo, deal me out.
- Kalif.
Surprise.
- (grunts)
Baby?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?
Mmm, Prime set all this up.
He wanted to surprise you.
- Oh my gosh, this place is beautiful.
- Tell me about it.
You know he always got a trick up his sleeve.
No, I mean, he didn't really set it up.
His publicist did.
But anything for my baby.
You know I was gonna be here.
Well, baby, I'm glad you here.
Look, I gotta work the room, so why don't you go to our table?
I'll be there in about 10 minutes, all right?
All right, sweetie.
Go do your thing.
- Hey, baby.
- What?
- I love you.
- I love you too.
(mutters) Oh shit.
- Yo, Prime, what's up, man?
- What's up, bro?
- Your publicist invited Shanita?
- No, why the hell would she do that?
Shit, I don't know.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.
Man, she right over there.
Oh shit.
I need a drink, man.
Somebody give me a drink.
Please.
Quick.
Make it fast.

Prime:
So all of you are behind all this shit, huh?
I'm sorry.
I don't know exactly what you're talking about.
My credit cards, Dallas's video.
Calling my baby mama.
- Shit is real cute.
- Okay, you know what?
We're just here to have a good time, just like everybody else.
- Okay.
- Okay.
All right.
Have fun.
Can I speak to you for a second?
(whispers) Okay.
What do you want, Prime?
Look, I just wanna... explain myself.
Explain what?
That you have a wife and kids?

(chattering)
- Hey.
- Hey.
(chuckles)
I was surprised to hear from you.
I was surprised that I texted you.
Mm-hmm.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
(clears throat)
So?
I'm not ready to forgive you for what you did.
I gave you everything that I had and you really hurt me.
Why didn't you just tell me you had kids and a girl from the jump?
Um, I thought you would leave if I did.
That doesn't give you the right to take that choice from me.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I guess I wasn't thinking.
You said that everything isn't what it appears.
So explain.
My kids mean everything to me.
And I'll do whatever it takes in order to be with them.
So you're basically saying that you're only with Kennedy so that she doesn't take your kids from you.
- Yeah.
- Hmm.
Her family's from Louisiana and she would take them there.
- I know she would.
- So where does that leave me?
Skylar.
Look, yo, I care for you.
I really do.
- Please believe--
- Is this seat taken?
Uh, Kennedy.
Thanks for the call, Skylar.
Why don't you scoot over?
- (Prime sighs)
- I'm gonna let you guys talk.
No no no, please stay.
You have just as much a right to be here as I do.
(laughs)
You're looking all scared.
What, you don't have anything to say?
No lies, no excuses?
We're all here now.
Talk.
(scoffs)
So you're the girl from the website, huh?
She's a bit younger than Autumn.
How's your grandmother?
Excuse me?
(chuckles) Oh.
Oh, you thought I didn't know about you until you called this morning?
Come on, I know everything that Prime does.
Everything-- from the helicopter rides to the shopping sprees to the condo on East Lake Drive.
Everything.
I know what you're thinking.
If I know this, why don't I leave?
Because I love him.
He's the father of my children.
And I love his ass.
(chuckles, sighs)
What you need to know, Miss Thing, is before you get romantically involved with a man, make sure you know everything there is to know about him.
You see, arrogant, selfish, rich individuals like my fiancé,
they prey upon sweet innocent women... like you.
I know he hurt you.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have called.
And I'm sorry for that.
But trust me, he won't hurt you again.
Now if you'll excuse us, my fiancé and I have a few things to discuss.
(huffs)
What did I tell you the last time?
I told you if you do this to me again, it's over.
I can't put up with this.
I won't.
I've been here with you through everything, Prime.
Everything.
(Kennedy laughs)
I'm the mother of your children.
Does that mean nothing to you?
I've dealt with this before and I'm not dealing with it again.
I can't sit around until you figure out if you want to be what you should be.
Look.
Look, baby.
(sighs)
I'm sorry.
Kennedy, I-
- I don't--
No, just stop it.
I'm done.
I'm done.
(chuckles)
I am so done.
You know, you want to be the $100-million playboy?
So be it.
Me and the kids are leaving.
I'm going back to Louisiana.
- You're just--
- Baby.
(chuckles)
Oh yeah.
(ring clinks)
Ice cream?
You wanna go get ice cream?
- All girls like ice cream.
- Well, that's true.
Umm, Prime.
Pri-- excu--
Pri-- excuse me.
Prime, you can't go back there!
- My fucking life, you stupid-ass bitch!
- (screaming)
I should kill your fucking ass!
I should kill your ass!
Prime, no!
Get-
- Que!
- Oh my God!
- Prime!
Prime!
Let's go, man.
- I'm calling the police!
- (grunts)
Yes, it's an emergency.
- Prime Alexander attacked my cousin.
- (Autumn coughing)
- Come on, man.
Calm down.
- Get off me!
Camelback and 24th.
It's a boutique,
Autumn de Brise.
Please-- please hurry.
Please.
Autumn?
(crying)
I just know there's so much stupid drama.
(Autumn sighs) I can't believe this shit.
(sniffling) Fucking asshole.
- (Dylan mutters)
- Autumn:
Oh my God.
Dylan:
Take a breath.
Outside, come on.
We need to deal with it.
- (sniffling)
- Okay?
- Hey, thank you, guys, for coming.
- You okay?
- What happened?
- He attacked me.
- Did you press charges?
- Are all of you happy now?
- We're not gonna talk about--
- You got what you wanted?
- Let's go.
- You wanted to humiliate me?
You know what?
Fuck you, Prime!
Fuck you!
You got exactly what you deserve!
And you need to be glad that I didn't press charges.
I can't believe how far y'all took this shit!
Uploading pictures on the Internet, calling my baby mama!
And to torture me?
I ain't done nothing to none of y'all!
It don't make any difference.
I mean, even with all this, me and my boys, we gonna still do us.
Mm-hmm, you and your boys?
You'll still do you, right?
'Cause you're so close, right?
Best friends?
- Let's go.
- No no. 'Cause you're so close?
Hmm, let me think.
Did Dallas tell you that I've been fucking him for the last two months?
- Oh shit.
- Hey.
- Are you kidding?
- What?
You've been having sex with Dallas this entire time!
- Wow.
- Are you serious?
Dylan:
This isn't about that, all right?
So you eating off my sloppy seconds, I see, huh?
That's how she found the fucking sex tapes.
You know, all this proves is how much of a ho you are, just like you were cheating on me with Jeff Trepagnier.
Seriously?
She wasn't cheating on you with Jeff.
She was cheating on Jeff with you, you arrogant--
- Let's go.
You don't need this.
- Yeah, that's right.
Do the math.
Do the math, Prime.
I was with him when I met you.
Autumn, what the fuck is wrong with you?
You just gonna roll down the assembly line?
Is that what you gonna do?
Hmm?
- What about Kalif?
- Yeah, where my slice at?
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe I should.
Then maybe I'll be just like Prime, especially since he fucked Katalina.
- What?
- Yeah, you thought I didn't know.
- Really?
- What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with--
- Yeah, why are you starting shit?
Prime and Katalina?
Prime and Katalina never hooked up.
Really?
Prime?
Hey.
Um, look, man, that was a long long time ago, man.
Don't get worked up over that.
This--
Don't get worked-- (grunts)
Kalif:
The fuck's he doing, man!
Chill out!
- Hey, Lonzo!
Hey!
- Chill!
- Dallas:
Relax!
- Man, I would've told you a fucking long time ago!
It was before you even knew her!
- 1080 for life, huh?
- Chill out, man?
- Lonzo:
Really?
- Look.
Baby, listen.
- Don't "baby" me.
- It was a long-
- I tried to tell you!
This whole thing was part of your plan, wasn't it?
- This whole thing, right?
- This had nothing to do with us.
- Carnegie:
Nothing to do with us.
- It's all your sick little revenge.
- Autumn:
You know-- shut up!
- Fuck you, Autumn!
- I bet you wish you could!
- Hey!
Stop!
Stop!
That's enough!
It's enough!
(crying) You know what?
I don't even need this shit.

We just went on two dates.

Don't push me away.
Just try.

You just tell me what you want.
I don't know.
It's not that easy.
(sighs)
Look, umm...
I'm really sorry for ruining Katalina's birthday.
(sighs)

Don't you ever lie to me again.
- Do you hear me?
- Promise.

This is not the day for his ass to be late.

You know, sometimes we say growing up, it's important to have someone that you look up to, like a role model.
And in my case, that was my best friend.
You deserve everything you have, my man.
You've got a lot of good shit coming your way.
Yo, man, nice speech.
Come on, seriously.
We've been at this thing for a while.
And I know we make it look easy, but the shit is really pretty hard.
You know what I'm saying?
Hey, but we work hard, so we can play hard.

Always on his dick, even when he treats you like shit.
Yeah, and what you need to do...

You can't let anyone steal yourjoy.
Lf he'd just look my way tonight, he's so gonna get it.
Wasn't he with someone?
Who?
Little Miss Muffet?
She can't keep a man like Prime.
L saw how excited you were to go to that party, so if you're there, be there.
Make them remember your name.
No, I'm just gonna come home a little earlier.
Lt better not be because it's time for me
- to take those blood-thinner pills.
- No, ma'am.
Honestly, I'd just rather be there than here.

And you can cook?
Skylar.
Just wanted to give you a call, make sure you made it home safe.
Lt was really nice to see you tonight.
Yeah.
Hey, why don't you give me a call in the morning?
Maybe we can grab brunch or something.
All right?
Sleep well.
What are you doing here?
Time out.
Tell me I didn't throw a kick-ass party last night, man.
Diddy ain't got shit on me.
Bad shit... bad shit, seriously.
What I wanna know is where the fuck were you all night?
L already told you... rule ♪1.
What's rule ♪1 again?
ABC...
Always Be Closing.
Bingo.
Right there, my man.
Those rules don't work, man.
Come on.
Had to close down the Carnegie chick last night.
- Yo, how'd she do, man?
- She had a Prime Alexander night.
28 points, shot 54% from the three-point line.
- Damn, that's pretty good.
- That is a good night.
Are you gonna see her again?
Nah. I'm already working on my next lottery pick.
Of course you are.
Hey, hold up.
Seriously, what was up with Autumn?
That's what I wanna know.
Dude, she was tripping all night.
Yo, that's Dallas. I told you not to let her ass in the party.
She was fine until she saw you kiss Skylar.
What?
Yo, look, she was crazy from the jump, man.
- Red flag.
L told his ass.
- Amen.
- Will you guys relax?
- Damn, man!
- Relax.
Lt's all good.
Whatever, man.
Yo, anyone else close last night?
Well, I had a trez Nathaniel.
- A trez what?
- A dude?
A dude?
No, man, the two chicks from the pool last night.
Man!
I'm telling you...
strawberries and wine, candles.
Lt was quite exquisite.
L'm feeling that.
L'm very happy for you.
- What about you, Zo?
- Oh, I had a good time, man.
Y'all know he was handcuffed to Katalina all night, talking about "l love you, baby.
L love you, baby."
I'll fucking kill you.
Yo, what's up with you and her, anyway?
Man, I don't know.
L like her.
- l like her a lot.
Yeah.
- Okay.
Okay.
You know, just be careful with her.
- l will.
- Yeah.
You know what?
Actually, go ahead and let's redesign
- this whole setup over here.
- The scarves?
Yeah, I don't like it.
And let's redress her too.
- Okay.
- Anyway, like I was saying, his tie and handkerchief matched my dress,
Prime warned me that I should've put my sunglasses on
- in the car, but...
- Ooh!
- l know, right?
- At night?
Oh!
- Hey!
- Hi!
How are you, girls?
- You look so cute.
- You too.
- Hello.
- Hey, Heidi.
Hi, honey, how are you?
- Super cute.
Have a seat.
- Thanks.
Dylan, do you mind getting us a couple of glasses of wine?
- Not at all.
- Mm-hmm.
So how are you guys doing?
- Good.
- Good, how are you?
- Fabulous as always.
- Of course.
So I guess you know why we're here.
We need something amazing to wear to the Rico Terrell gala.
- Oh, okay.
Of course.
- And I heard this year it's an all-black affair.
L wonder who decided to do that.
- Mmm, that's me.
- Oh, okay.
L'll go and get you guys the book and I'll show you what I have coming in next week.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Ladies.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Here you go, sweetie.
- So, Autumn...
- Mm-hmm?
Is this the wine that you purchased while you were in San Francisco last week?
L wasn't in San Francisco last week.
Why?
What's going on?
- lt's probably nothing.
- What's probably nothing?
Okay, spill it.
Jessica said that she saw Prime in San Francisco last week with another woman.
And that gossip website said that you were kicked out of Prime's party.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, you shouldn't believe everything you read.
Okay, first of all I was not kicked out.
We had a fight.
Lt wasn't the first and it won't be the last.
Okay, and what about that girl that he was kissing at his party?
- You know, the one he was all up on?
- Oh, you mean the peasant who was rocking last year's rummage-sale collection?
- l'm not worried about her in the least.
- Ahem!
Maybe we could show them the new Norell collection.
Mmm!
Yes, I am sure one of these beauties can pull off such a stunning dress.
You know what?
L have work to do, so I'm gonna go.
But you ladies shop.
- Okay?
- Thank you.
Okay, um, maybe let's take a look at a few dresses.
Do you mind?
- Just bring out what you have.
- Yeah.
L'd be happy to.
Carnegie, if you don't stop checking that phone... do you think it's gonna ring just because you want it to?
L'm just checking the service.
Sometimes it gets spotty in here.
Uh-huh.
Yet I have the same carrier and I'm four bars strong.
L know, I know, I know.
Why hasn't he called me?
You just saw him last night.
He's probably working today.
L know, I know.
Lt's just... that was the most amazing date.
Well, what did he say when he dropped you off?
You... you mean when he left?
- So he came in?
- Oh yeah.
Yeah.
- Well...
- Lt was amazing.
L'm not even kidding.
This is the best date I've ever been on.
- Hands down.
Hands down.
- So you slept with him after dinner and he hasn't called you back.
- lt's not like that.
- Not like what?
You're making it seem like because he slept with me he doesn't want to be with me.
Well, have you ever gone on this long
- without him speaking to you?
- L mean... not... not since we met.
Lt's probably nothing.
- You think?
- L know. I'm sure you're right.
Sounds like you guys have an amazing connection.
Now let's get dressed and get some drinks at Duke's.
Your phone rings in other places besides the living room.
- Hey.
- Hey, you.
Well, they're gone.
Umm... how you doing?
Are you doing okay?
L'm fine.
You sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
No, I'm just wondering, 'cause having them catty bitches in your store...
- you know.
- Who, Heidi and Shannon?
- Yes, Heidi and Shannon.
- Oh, I'm not worried about them at all.
They will never change.
But you know, as long as they continue to shop here, I really don't care.
Amen.
Umm... so you looking at that website?
L don't even know what website they're talking about, so...
Girl, please, do not let the bougie fool you.
You know I keep up on my gossip.
My college girlfriend runs the site.
Umm... I saw these pictures this morning...
Prime kissing that girl.
Honey, why didn't you just tell me that you guys were having trouble?
Because it's no big deal.
- lt...
- Lt's not that serious.
Lt's serious.
Dylan, I really don't wanna talk about this right now, so...
Yo yo yo, I got a delivery.
Umm... I'll get it.
- Hi, Quenton.
- Hi.
Dylan, when are you gonna stop playing and let me take you out to dinner?
- Huh.
- Mmm.
Man.
- What is this?
- Lt's a delivery for your cousin.
- On a Saturday?
- Apparently it's a special delivery.
Okay.
Right this way.
Sorry.
Delivery.
- Oh, hey, Que.
- Miss lady. I have a delivery for you.
Are you serious?
Umm...
Are you waiting for a tip?
Seriously?
You...
- he just asked me out.
- Hey, I gotta save up.
We all know how you singletary ladies are.
- Bye, Que.
- Wow.
Nuh-uh.
Dylan, call me.
You won't regret it.
L...
I don't even know.
What is this?
is this from Milan?
What'd you get?
Did that say it was from Prime?
Maybe it's some new shoes.
Autumn?
These are... is this your stuff from Prime's house?
- lt looks that way.
- He cut up your pictures?
Apparently so.
Honey, I'm... I'm so sorry.
But this is stupid, okay?
This is petty.
Look... okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take care of this, okay?
Yeah, don't...
don't worry about it.
Umm, I got it.
Okay?
Hm-mmm, Grandma.
L got it.
- Mmm.
- Whew.
- Hi, can I help you?
- Miss Hathaway?
- Yes.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
L'm your driver for today, compliments of Mr. Prime Alexander.
Your first appointment 00 p.m.
My first appointment?
Yes, ma'am. I can't tell you where we're going, but I do have a schedule here for your grandmother so she's not worried.
So this is one of those scavenger hunts or something.
L'm not at liberty to say, ma'am, but I do expect your granddaughter to have a lovely evening.
- Gimme one minute.
- Not a problem, ma'am.
You remember that purse that I lost last year in Vegas?
Uh-huh, 'cause you forgetful.
Why is that the newer version in purple?
- You want it?
- L do. I love it.
Well, I got a surprise for you waiting at the house. I think you might like it.
- Shut up.
No, you don't.
- L guarantee I do.
- Stop!
- Right next to the new shoes I got you.
Hi, Cash.
- Keep it moving.
- Baby, come on.
Let's go see if they have that bag you was looking at last week.
Huh-uh, don't try to change the subject.
How the hell does that ho gonna come over here, talking some "hey, Cash," like she knows you like that?
- l don't know that girl.
- Where do you know that girl from?
- Like I said, I don't...
- Where do you know that girl from?
Maybe she was at the club or somewhere with Prime.
- You know he got groupies everywhere.
- Next time you need to tell your little bitches not to come over and talk to you...
- My bitches?
- ...when they see you with your woman.
L'm glad you recognize that.
Now can we keep it moving?
- No, I'm serious, Kalif.
- You causing as scene for nothing.
Try me if you think I'm playing.
L'm so tired of that simple shit.
- l don't care if I'm causing a scene.
- Look, I ain't do shit, a'ight?
No, you ain't do shit.
You think you slick.
You think I'm stupid.
But I got something for that ass.
You wait and see.
- See, that's your problem right there.
- L gonna find her.
You always trying to threaten somebody.
L'm not threatening you.
That shit was disrespectful.
- Come on.
You know what?
- No.
No no no, come here.
- Let's go introduce...
- Don't embarrass me in public.

Hello.
Hey, sexy.
Ls it too late to call?
Lt's 6:30.
L know. I'm just playing.
So what's up?
L thought you were going out with Kalif and Dallas.
Yeah, I was, but I have a really big, important meeting on Tuesday and I don't wanna be out drinking with the guys and...
I don't know. I just kinda wanna keep my head right, you know?
Wow.
Smart guy.
L think I like you.
Wait, you think you like me?
What's up with that?
- You don't know by now?
- Oh, I know.
So what are you doing?
Well, that's why I was calling.
My family and I are having a little movie night tonight and I wanted to see what you were doing, see if you wanted to roll through.
Maybe watch one of those chick flicks my mom's been begging me to watch with her.
Okay, so you're telling me that you're spending a Saturday chilling with your mom, watching chick flicks?
- How cute.
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah yeah yeah.
Mama's my rock.
Wow.
Not a lot of people can say that.
What do you mean?
You're not close to your mom?
Let's just say my mom is married and she has children, but "close"
isn't a word I use to describe her relationship with anyone.
Wow, Katalina. I'm really sorry to hear that, honey.
So what movies does your mom have on the lineup?
Oh, we've got "Love and Other Drugs,"
and "Good Will Hunting," of course.
Oh, my vote is definitely for "Good Will Hunting."
I love me some Matt Damon and Cole Hauser...
good old Boston bad-asses.
- Mm-hmm.
- So, 20 minutes?
Awesome.
That's perfect.
Okey-dokey.
Just so you know, I look a little crazy.
L definitely was curled up in a ball reading a book in some sweats.
Oh.
Oh, my bad.
L see what you're doing.
Okay.
That's right, you're fishing for compliments right now.
We can play this game.
No, you know what?
L can't even... you are... you are naturally beautiful from head to toe, so...
Thank you, very very sweet of you.
All right, well, drive safe, honey.
Okay?
- Okay.
- L'll see you soon.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Well?
Oh my... ooh, that is soft.
L know. I was surprised to find that your hair's still natural.
You know, you have so many options when it is.
So I wanted to soften up your curls a bit.
Lt's absolutely beautiful.
Thank you.
Oh wow.
So how long have you been dating Prime?
Oh, I wouldn't call it dating just yet.
Only we met a few months ago, so we've hung out a few times.
But I like him.
He's really nice.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
So all the things you hear about the great Optimus Prime...
- it isn't true?
- You know, to be honest, I wouldn't have a clue as to what they say about him.
L moved out here to take care of my grandmother, so she's been my main focus.
All that matters is that he's nice to me.
So you're not one of those jersey chasers running behind him because he has all those millions?
Definitely not one of those.
L don't know.
Maybe it's just me, but... I'm more concerned about how a man treats me than what's in his wallet.
You know?
L actually had a run-in with a few of his admirers the other night at the club.
Just being in a room with those women made my skin crawl.
L would totally understand if he had trust issues dealing with those type of women, just throwing themselves at him.
Yeah, you'd be surprised, honey, they're everywhere.
That's why I make it my business to find out if these girls are dating my brother for the right reasons or because he's a pro basketball player.
Prime is your brother?
Milan Alexander at your services.
L had no idea.
L...
I don't know what to say.
You don't have to say anything, honey.
You've said enough.
L'm just happy to find out that my brother's with someone who's with him for the right reasons.
You're a sweetheart.
Keep it that way.
And don't break his heart.
So what's up, baby?
Baby, come on.
- You know we be off the hook, baby.
- Kalif!
Kalif!
- Hold on.
Oh shit.
- Who the hell plays basketball this damn late at night?
- You better have your ass back by 9:00!
- Yo, come on, man, go!
L'm not playing with you, Dallas!
Why can't you just find somebody else tonight
- and have a little fun?
- No one gets me like Dallas.
Oh God, nobody gets you...
okay, what does he tell you?
- l mean...
I mean... I don't know.
This guy sounds like he's kinda full of it.
No, but you're always negative like this.
Every time I like somebody, you jump down my throat.
You gotta go with my gut.
And my gut is I really like him.
Okay, go with your gut.
What about your heart?
My gut... oh, Chad's working.
Probably get some free drinks.
- lsn't that Dallas?
- Let's go!
Oh, wait wait wait wait.
He's with a girl.
No no, that's probably like his friend or his cousin or something.
Lt's all right.
That's... that's definitely... definitely...
- Let's go investigate.
- Umm...
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Just... excuse me.
Just trying to get to my boyfriend here.
Excuse me, guys.
- To a lot of luck, baby.
Whoo!
- Whoo!
Dallas!
Dallas!
Hey.
Oh hey, Carnegie.
What are you doing here?
L was gonna ask you the same thing.
Excuse me, guys.
♪ Work that body, get your sexy on... ♪
He should be embarrassed.
- He's acting like a child.
- Honey, I was dragged out of a club... dragged out of a club by two people holding me down.
Lt was embarrassing.
- lt was very embarrassing.
- L wish I was there.
Look, Carnegie, you know I don't want anything, right?
L'm a single man.
L'm not looking for anything serious right now.
Whoa.
Umm... I wish you would've told me that last night, because I didn't get that memo when you were in my bed.
To go through that by yourself, that's not...
- What?
- That's Dallas.
L'm sorry you feel like that.
L thought we were just hanging out, enjoying each other's company.
- Carnegie, come on, let's go.
- Yeah well, I didn't know that, Dallas.
Okay?
And the only reason why you're in the clear is because you never mentioned the word "relationship"
when you were wining and dining me and bringing me my favorite cupcakes.
You're in the clear because you could do whatever you want and my feelings is no consequence to how you feel!
He's doing the exact same thing that Prime did to you.
Why do they all act like that?
Why do they get to get away with that?
- They won't.
They won't.
- You got what you wanted, and now you're done.
Right?
is that how it goes?
- ls that how it goes?
- Come on, Carnegie, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Listen to your girl.
Screw you, Dallas!
Nice.
20 minutes, huh?
- Two hours later...
- Whatever.
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- Who's this little princess?
- This beautiful thing is my niece.
- Hello there.
- Hi.
- She's so precious.
- She's so cute.
Are you ready to go inside?
They have been waiting to meet my beautiful girlfriend all day.
- Your girlfriend?
- Did I say something wrong?
No, babe.
Girlfriend is just fine.
L like that.
Come on.
My name is Katalina too.
Hi, family.
This is Katalina, everyone.
Katalina, this is my family.
Lonzo, don't have her thinking you were raised by wolves.
Oh, here we go.
That's my sister.
Nice to meet you, Katalina.
L'm Susie.
- Nice to meet you, Susie.
- This is my father,
- Mr. Juan Rodriguez.
- Mr. Rodriguez, a pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet you too, Katalina.
Hope you don't mind.
L brought some cake for dessert.
Oh, I don't mind.
What kind of cake do we have?
Lt don't matter what kind of cake it is.
You ain't having any.
What do you mean I'm not gonna have any?
A man should be able to have cake in his own house if he wants to.
- Yeah, that's... that's my family.
- That's my cake.
Yeah.
Carnegie, come on!
Come on, you cannot let him embarrass you like this!
Don't let him win!
He's such a fucking asshole!
Are you gonna come out?
Come on, Carnegie!
She's right, you know.
You need to pay him back for what he did to you.
L'm sorry, but that was ridiculous.
Um, who are you?
My name is Autumn, I used to date one of Dallas's friends, Prime, and he embarrassed me in the exact same way that he embarrassed you.
Carnegie.
What did you say?
L'm sorry.
L saw that back there and that was ridiculous.
L cannot believe he did that to you.
- lt is not right.
- Why does this always happen to me?
L always fall in love with assholes.
Look, Dallas, Prime, Lonzo, Kalif... all of them, that whole little crew...
they're dogs, okay?
They don't give a shit about anyone else but themselves.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
- l feel so stupid. I feel...
No.
- Yes, I feel stupid.
- Do not blame yourself.
L'm sure he wined and dined you,
- did all that sweet shit.
- Cupcakes.
That's what they do.
Look, honey...
- l'm so sorry.
- Thank you.
Lt's a game to them, okay?
They don't care about who they hurt in the process.
Lt's not even about the sex to them.
They just wanna conquer as many women as they can and they don't care who gets hurt in the process.
Trust me.
Times like these, I'm glad I do women.
Look, if I were you, I would confront him.
L would let him have it.
L mean, did you see his smug ass out there?
All those guys out there, they think he's a hero.
And those women?
They still will talk to him because they think it's something you did.
They never think it's something they did.
You didn't deserve that, no matter what.
- He doesn't even care about you.
- Not at all.
Hm-mmm.
- We've gotta do something.
Don't let him get away with this at all.
- Okay.
Okay.
- At all.
- Yeah.
- All right, I'm gonna go out there.
Yes!
Dry your eyes.
- All right, you look cute.
- L'm going.
Okay.
Are you guys sure about this dress?
Lt's cut really low.
Miss Hathaway, are you in the dress?
Yes.
- Are you in the shoes?
- Yes.
Then get the hell out of my dressing room so we can see you.
- You look fantastic.
- Beautiful.
Come come.
You did it.
Absolutely beautiful.
Vidal, you did this.
- Yes, I did.
- Oh my God, it's so beautiful.
Oh, wait wait wait, don't forget about the purse.
- Oh, I don't have a purse.
- Of course you do.
- That is so beautiful.
- Lsn't it?
- You know, you guys are so...
- No no no no, yeah yeah yeah yeah.
- We know.
- Get going.
- Thank you.
- Put in a good word for us.
You're welcome.
Oh.
L have had the most amazing day of my life.
Well, you deserve it.
L mean, I know taking care of your grandmother can't be that easy.
Wow.
Now come on.
The night has only begun.
Oh shit.
She's coming back, she's coming back.
L can't believe all this shit.
So how do you know our mutual friend Dallas?
- Excuse me?
- Well, let's see.
You're having drinks at his favorite place to be seen, so you must be new.
He took me here on our second date.
We snuggled in a booth over drinks.
Has he brought you pastries yet?
Oh, I'm sure he's asked you all about your favorite things by now, huh?
Mmm!
L love that bracelet.
Let me guess, let me guess.
He said it reminded you of him when he got it, because it's dainty, just like your wrist.
Mine's gold.
He gave it to me before we walked in here last time.
Hey, yo, you balling like that, man?
But don't worry.
He's not gonna try anything tonight, because the sex won't be good enough until you're hooked.
He likes sweet kisses that he feels are escaped... well, that's what he told me at least.
But from the look of it, you got about 10 more days of access to him and then he'll fuck you like he fucked me last night.
And then there's no more phone calls just to hear your voice.
He's gonna make it seem like you did something, and he's gonna act like you're a psycho if he runs into you in public, make everybody think you're some stalker girl he just can't break.
Well, he told me that about the girl before me.
L'm sure he told you the same thing about me, right?
Carnegie, what are you trying to prove here?
Just trying to get it off my chest, Dallas.
L'm just trying to get all the facts straight.
You know what I mean?
Because you're fucking good.
You're really good.
You should be an actor like Lonzo.
You would win an Academy Award, hands down.
Hands down.
Ooh!
I'll take one of these.
The least you can do is buy me a drink.
Mmm mmm!
That's good.
Real smooth.
Real... mmm.
Mmm, but then it leaves this bitter taste in your mouth.
Ooh!
That was awesome!
- You go, girl.
- Oh my gosh, it was.
Yo, hey, let me help you, bro.
Hey, you know...
Oh, I ain't never gonna let you hear the end of this.
Very classy, Carnegie.

Try to keep your lips...
Mm-hmm, exactly.
- Those earrings are really cute.
- Really?
- l wanna steal them from you.
- My mom bought them at your store.
- She did?
- Yes, those are our spring line.
- Learn your line.
- Wait wait wait wait.
First of all, that's not my job.
Thank you.
Please.
Sweetie, you need to come to my place and I'll hook you up with a nice dress to go along with 'em.
- Thank you.
- You know what?
Huh-uh.
Do not try to steal my clients, all right?
- Please.
- Thank you.
Now how's your mom doing?
L haven't seen her in a while.
She's doing so good.
Her and my dad actually just got back.
- They were away for three weeks.
- Really?
- Shopping.
Shopping.
- Yeah, shopping.
Paris Fashion Week.
That's when my family suddenly
- needs to get international as well.
- Exactly.
- OMG.
Excuse me!
- Big shot with all her...
- Miss Hathaway!
- Who are you yelling at?
- Miss Hathaway!
- Who is that?
- You just wait and see.
- Who's that?
- Who is it?
I don't know.
- Oh my God, Vidal,
- l was gonna call you...
- Prime's new girlfriend.
Tomorrow and say thank you for everything.
- How are you, sweetie?
- L'm good.
Wait, what are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be having breakfast in bed?
No, I'm here to pick up a to-go order for my grandmother.
Where are my manners?
Ladies, this is Skylar.
- Skylar, this is Katalina...
- Hi.
- Carnegie...
- Hi.
What was your name again, baby?
- Mira.
- Yeah, mirror... get one.
L could break you in two, man.
- Hello.
- Hi.
This is Dylan and that's Autumn over there in the corner.
Hi. I remember you from the other night.
- Hi.
- Nice to see you again.
Wait a second.
How do you two know each other?
We ran into each other the other night at Prime's party.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Grab a seat, sweetie.
Your food isn't ready.
- Oh, thanks.
- Grab a seat.
Well, how did it go?
Tell me all about it.
- Oh, ladies.
- What?
L had the pleasure of dressing Miss Skylar for the fabulous evening with Mr. Prime Alexander.
Okay.
- Wow.
- That's really...
A date, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
- You have a good time?
Oh yeah, it was really nice.
L mean, we just went and had dinner, walked in the park.
Please, don't try to downplay it.
She got the works...
hair, makeup, everything.
And then he sent her to my place to pick out a fabulous outfit.
- Wow.
Mm-hmm.
- Wow.
- Sounds quite familiar.
Reminds me of Dallas.
L hate him.
You had a nice time, huh?
Yeah, I did.
He's absolutely the sweetest guy I've ever met.
He's just really nice.
Wow.
The biggest sweetheart ever?
- Dylan.
- No, I mean, wow.
Well, you know that Autumn dated Prime and he wasn't the biggest sweetheart to her near the end.
So... it's weird.
Huh?
No, I mean she should know.
She should know what she's getting into, right?
Look look.
We don't even know her and we don't even owe her anything to even explain what happened with Autumn, make her relive the experience, so... I don't think we really need to explain anything.
L'm gonna let you guys eat your lunch.
Thanks.
Skylar, wait.
Look, I'm sorry.
She's my cousin.
L get a little protective.
But I do think that you should know what you're getting yourself into before you go too deep.
Please stay.
Honestly, I really didn't know.
Lf you don't mind me asking, what happened?
That's a very good question.
Honestly, I don't know what happened.
We got into this fight, and then the next thing I know he's like cursing me out in public, throwing my things out, calling out my name.
Lt's just... what I thought was a little fight was the end of my relationship.
Ls that what happened the other night?
Yup.
L wish someone would've given me the heads up about Dallas.
L hate that motherfucker.
L really do hate him.
L'm sorry. I hate him.
- Hate him.
- L'm sorry.
Who's Dallas?
He's one of Prime's friends.
Seriously, just like Autumn, for the first couple of months he was like a fucking unicorn.
L mean, calling two, three times a day, emailing... the whole nine.
Then I spent the night with him and guess what.
The whole next day, nothing.
So Mira and I go to the bar, get a few drinks.
And he is cuddled up with some other chick wearing the exact same bracelet he gave me.
So anyways, I confronted him and he basically had me in the bathroom crying.
And that's when Mira and Autumn were like... I'm sorry, Dylan was there too, sorry...
"Go out there and confront him.
He's out there having a great time with those girls."
She actually looked like a hooker.
Anyways, so I went out there and I called him out on his shit.
L handled some business, didn't I, girls?
- She did too.
L did.
But that's exactly what she should've done, because those guys...
they do it to everybody, they get away with it and nobody says anything.
Dallas, Kalif, Prime...
- l don't know about Lonzo.
- Birds of a feather do flock together.
- Hey, watch it.
- Yes they do.
- We don't know.
We don't know.
- They do.
- We need to put a stop to it.
- That's like saying I'm drinking as much as this one over here.
- Girl, you go.
- What?
Really?
Birds of a feather flock together?
- Cut off.
- L'm celebrating.
- l'm celebrating.
- Oh, hold on.
Look, all the ladies are trying to say is just be careful.
That's all.
Okay.
Thanks.
L'm gonna go.
Lt was nice meeting you ladies.
- l'm sorry if we...
Nice meeting you too.
- Just letting you know.
- Lt was... yeah.
- Just take care.
- Thanks.
How is it that you're not like Kalif, Dallas and Prime?
What do you mean?
Look, I've known you guys for a while now and you know they're shady.
L wouldn't even talk to you if I thought you were like them.
- Katalina, they are not shady.
- Tsk.
They're not. I'm telling you.
Look, I've known those guys my whole life, practically.
L met Prime when I was eight years old, for crying out loud.
L used to be taller than that fool back then.
L swear to God.
- Then we met Kalif in high school...
- Wow.
And Dallas in college.
They're good guys.
Their problem is they love women.
What's so bad about that?
Okay, but... let's say a girl really really likes a guy and she's in it for all the right reasons.
- Mm-hmm.
- They're just chilling, seeing where things go.
And they finally sleep together, then he dumps her.
Someone that does this repeatedly...
- Mm-hmm.
- ...that's a good guy?
That's not fair. lt's not.
- Mm-hmm.
- Lt's not.
Besides, Autumn brought that shit upon herself.
- You know that.
- L know for a fact that Autumn is not the only woman he's done that to.
Okay okay, first off...
first off... you can't say that. lt's a completely different situation, babe.
All right?
Think about it.
They were dating for over a year.
- Right?
- Yeah.
Okay, and he was really good to her.
Look, regardless of all this crap, that's their life, right?
What happened between them is between them.
L'm cool with that.
Look, what you need to be focusing on right now is not what Prime and Autumn were doing.
Mmm, it's that you will never do that to me.
You understand me?
You know I won't, baby.
- You promise?
- L promise.
C'mon.
- What are you doing here, Autumn?
- Nice new car.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
Why haven't you returned any of my phone calls?
L tried to contact you for over a month now.
L got your emails, I got your messages, but Prime insists that we don't speak.
And being that things are really good with us...
- Ah.
- ...
I don't think that we should either.
Okay.
Oh, I see.
Look, I'm not trying to tell you anything.
Okay?
I just have something you simply need to see.
We'll just take a short ride.
Lt won't take long and I will never bother you again.
Okay, you're crazy if you think I'm going anywhere with you.
No one asked you to.
You have a fancy new car.
Follow me.
Trust me, you'll wanna see this.
Okay, so you brought me to a kid's birthday party.
Look a little bit closer.
Now shoot.
Shoot.
Oh!
L think we gotta get it again.
Come on.
All right, there you go.
Oh, good job, little fella.
- Guys, hey.
- Go on wit' your mommy.
Let's go.
Hey, Skylar, Skylar, you don't wanna do this right here.
Hey, wait a sec, wait a sec.
Wait.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- Skylar, Skylar.
- Really?
Really, Prime?
- Look, baby, I can explain.
- Explain what?
That you have a wife?
That you have kids?
- Uh...
- How are you gonna explain this?
- l can't.
Not here.
- L trusted you.
Everybody tried to warn me and I trusted you.
You know what, Skylar?
Please,
- let me take you home.
- Stop stop.
Look...
What is wrong with you?
Why would you do this?
L'm not one of these groupie girls out here trying to trap you.
- Why would you treat me like I was one?
- Skylar.
Baby, listen.
Look, let's just talk about this later.
All right?
Just...
it's not what it looks like.
L have listened to everything that you said, every single thing that you have told me.
L listened and I believed you.
What is wrong with you?
You have a family, Prime.
You have a fucking family.
Uh...
- L hate you.
♪ Looking back it's all clear to me ♪
♪ Should have known it all along... ♪
I trusted him.
Like... I did everything that I could for him, and he still did this.
They always win.
At least you found out now and not like a year from now.
Listen, you two are much stronger women than I am.
Lf I had been at that birthday party, ooh, no, some people would've gone down.
L mean kids, baby mamas, like the jumping castle...
something.
But she still can.
So can we.
They humiliated us publicly.
Let's do it to them.
L don't know, Carnegie.
- How?
- Just think, okay?
Prime always has a million cameras in his face.
So call him out on his shit like I did with Dallas.
You really think that that worked?
You thought that did something?
L'm sorry, but he's probably been with at least three women since you.
L hate him so much.
L don't know what I even saw in him.
He has a unicorn tattoo.
He probably waxes his butthole.
Look, what are you trying to get out of this?
Honestly, what are you trying to propose that we do?
L mean, I get why you're angry and why Skylar's pissed, but...
Oh, so I don't have a reason to be hurt, Katalina?
Ls that it?
Really?
L mean, come on.
Autumn, you knew that Prime had a fiancée.
So it's not like it's some surprise to you.
Okay, fuck that.
No one really cares what you have to say.
Okay, boo boo?
And first of all, yes, I knew he had children, and no, I did not know he had a fiancée.
And when I finally found out, he told me that he was no longer with her, so...
No, exactly.
And doesn't Kennedy live in Louisiana or something?
- Exactly.
Lf he told her that they weren't together anymore, why wouldn't she believe him?
So you thought you would be the one to change him, when he's the type that wouldn't change for anyone, unless he was forced to.
Okay, that's like not expecting a scorpion to sting you.
Okay, you know what?
L am not gonna justify my feelings for any of you, especially you.
The point is that you stayed!
You stayed!
Look, we all know the risk of dating an athlete, especially Prime Alexander.
But I didn't. I didn't know.
What did I do?
What did I do that was
- so bad that I deserve this?
- Nothing.
L gave Prime a year of my life.
All the broken promises.
He sold me on this idea of like a fairy-tale life.
Where's my happy ending?
You know what?
How much do we have to put up with before they realize that they can't just break our hearts and pretend like nothing happened?
- But that's Prime Alexander.
- Oh my God.
And nobody is going to change Prime Alexander!
Unless we force him to.
What they did to us was cruel and it was wrong.
And they need to be held accountable for their actions.
Look, you can't make somebody change that doesn't want to change.
- You just can't.
- Yes, you can.
Listen, all you have to do is use everything about them against them.
Quickly, without remorse.
They get their strength from running in a pack like dogs.
You shake up the bonds, destroy the pack.
Exactly.
You're right.
Let's do it.
Hi, yes, I'm with Pryor Lamborghini and we have a lease on a car that's in arrears that needs to be picked up.
Yes, I know exactly where it's going to be on Saturday.
The license plates read "work"...
W-O-R-K.
- Yes.
- Hello?
Hi, I'd like to report someone.
L know seven women he's given herpes to... well, probably more than that.
His name?
Lt's Dallas Lauderdale.
Yeah, I'll hold.
Mira, it's your turn!
- Hello?
- Shanita?
This is Shanita.
This is Mr. Prime Alexander's publicist, Dahni.
Okay.
Prime is setting up a special surprise for Mr. Kalif Wyatt at the upcoming Rico Terrell gala and would like you to attend.
- Okay.
- Great!
He'll send a car for you at 8:00 p.m. on Saturday.
And he asks that you keep this a secret.
Thank you.
Now this is completely anonymous though, right?
L mean, you're my girl and I'm sending this to you 'cause I want you to get the scoop, but I can't have this traced back to me.
Okay.
Are you ready for this?
Well, have you heard a little rumor about Kalif Wyatt and his very very close boyfriends?
Gay clubs and stripping.
And, honey, I have a picture, and I am sending it to you right... now.
You are welcome.
Girl, you're my sorority sister.
L gotta hook you up.
Hell yeah, you can come through.
You gotta bring a friend though.
Yo, I gotta get out of this mall, girl.
L'm feeling all eyes from all guys.
- Holy shit.
Hey, Kalif.
- This is crazy.
- Yo, hold up.
- What?
Kalif?
Yo, how you know my name, little man?
Oh, baby, I make it a point to keep up with all the available ass out there.
What?
What the hell you talking about, man?
- Who what?
- They got the whole exposé, exposing your love for the boys.
Love for the boys?
Man, I'm all about the ladies, and the ladies know it.
Ask your girl, she know.
- What?
Excuse you.
- L'm just going based off what I read.
What you read?
You read wrong, homey.
Who what?
Yo, look, I don't know what the hell y'all talking about.
L'm out. i feeling too much of a sugar rush
- in this motherfucker.
- Let's go.
Dallas.
- Yeah, Dad?
What's up?
- What the hell is this?
- l don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?
- lt's you, isn't it?
- Well yeah, but I don't know whose cam...
Oh, yes you do!
L'm telling you, I have no idea how it got there.
This is going to kill your mother.
Lt's all over the Internet!
Lt's in everybody's inboxes.
You need to get out of here, take one or two months.
Just get out of here!
- l swear, Dad, I...
- No.
Dallas, we're done.
Fuck.
Crap.
- Yo.
- Somebody emailed everybody at my dad's company my game tapes, and he damn near fired me!
- Wait.
What?
- How did it get out there, Prime?
Yo, man, why you asking me?
L don't know.
L don't be watching your game tapes.
Autumn.
What?
Nothing, man.
Lemme call you back.
Yeah, whatever.
Where is she?
Hi.
May I help you with something?
Where is Autumn, Dylan?
L'm sorry.
She's not here.
Why?
She knows why.
You tell her I know she did it.
Did what?
Hmm.
Well.
So it begins.
That's gonna be $2,476.32.
- All right.
- Mr. Prime, good to see you again.
V-dog, good to see you.
You look good.
- l see you built a wing on the back.
- Yeah.
This place looks great.
L love it.
- Thank you.
- Oh, um, Mr. Alexander?
- Yeah?
- L'm sorry.
Your credit card declined.
Why don't you just swipe that again for me?
- l already ran it twice.
- Camille, swipe it again.
L'm sure there's a computer glitch or something.
- lt's been doing that lately, you know?
- Yeah.
Yeah, see?
Lt declined again.
Do you have another card?
- Let me do it.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- Give me two seconds.
Not to worry.
- No problem.
- Yeah...

Yo, what do you mean it was... that's a limitless card.
There must be a problem with the bank.

- Gimme that.
- l'm sorry.
- Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
You looking at me like I'm crazy.
No, come on. I'm delirious,

- Mm-hmm.

- Oh shit!
- Oh my God.
Babe!
Shit!

- That ass... was that your boy Kalif?
- He was naked.
- Yo.
Please call that man.
What is he doing?
Why...
He's on something.
Yo, that...
did that really just happen?
- Am I bugging?
- Hey!
Dawg, I swear to God we just saw some dude that looked just like you run down the street
- with his balls flapping, bro.
- No bueno.
We're at the restaurant we always hang at.
- Good look in the clothes, man.
- Dawg.
Can't believe that shit happened.
Yo!
What up, brothers?
The fuck wrong with y'all?
Hey, did I see you running down the street naked?
Oh shit, man!
What?
You saw me and you didn't even try to help me?
!
- That was you?
- We supposed to be boys, man!
Dude, I tried calling you.
What the hell?
Tried calling me?
Did it look like I had my fucking phone on?
Look!
I need to know right now... did one of y'all let out my game tapes?
- What?
- Somebody uploaded on the Internet, emailed to everyone in my company's directory.
Ah.
My mom...
fuck, she's gonna kill me.
Something ain't right.
How the hell all of us gonna have a bad day all at the same time?
Flames been hounding me all week!
And now this shit?
What the fuck happened to you?
- All my cards were canceled.
- What?
$100-million man and I ain't got no money.
What kind of shit is that?
All this can't be a coincidence, can it?
All right, look, I don't know what the fuck is going on right now, but we've got this gala in a few hours, right?
Dude, we've gotta get our minds right for that.
Mr. Alexander!
Mr. Alexander, over here, please.
Prime!
Over here, please, sir.
A really quick interview.
Thank you so much, sir.
Mr. Alexander.
- Hi, how are you doing tonight?
- Great.
- Wow, you look really great.
- Thank you.
So this is the 5th Annual
Rico Terrell Benefit Gala for sickle-cell anemia.
What makes this such an important cause for you?
Well, when I was a rookie, I volunteered at the children's hospital and I met so many amazing children who suffer from this disease.
And I vowed right then that I was gonna do all that I could to help fund research to find a cure one day.
And I kept my word.
That is awesome.
How much have you raised this year so far?
Well, at this point with this event, we've raised $3.5 million.
Congrats.
That's truly a great accomplishment.
Oh, and next year we'll do $5 million.
Wow.
Thank you so much for your time.
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thank you.
So what's up, baby?
Yo, deal me out.
Kalif.
Surprise.
Baby?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?
Mmm, Prime set all this up.
He wanted to surprise you.
- Oh my gosh, this place is beautiful.
- Tell me about it.
You know he always got a trick up his sleeve.
No, I mean, he didn't really set it up.
His publicist did.
But anything for my baby.
You know I was gonna be here.
Well, baby, I'm glad you here.
Look, I gotta work the room, so why don't you go to our table?
I'll be there in about 10 minutes, all right?
All right, sweetie.
Go do your thing.
- Hey, baby.
- What?
- l love you.
- L love you too.
Oh shit.
- Yo, Prime, what's up, man?
- What's up, bro?
- Your publicist invited Shanita?
- No, why the hell would she do that?
Shit, I don't know.
L'm trying to figure that out myself.
Man, she right over there.
Oh shit.
L need a drink, man.
Somebody give me a drink.
Please.
Quick.
Make it fast.

So all of you are behind all this shit, huh?
L'm sorry. I don't know exactly what you're talking about.
My credit cards, Dallas's video.
Calling my baby mama.
- Shit is real cute.
- Okay, you know what?
We're just here to have a good time, just like everybody else.
- Okay.
- Okay.
All right.
Have fun.
Can I speak to you for a second?
Okay.
What do you want, Prime?
Look, I just wanna... explain myself.

Mmm.
- Hey.
- Hey.
L was surprised to hear from you.
L was surprised that I texted you.
Mm-hmm.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
So?
L'm not ready to forgive you for what you did.
L gave you everything that I had and you really hurt me.
Why didn't you just tell me you had kids and a girl from the jump?
Um, I thought you would leave if I did.
That doesn't give you the right to take that choice from me.
You're right.
L'm sorry.
L guess I wasn't thinking.
You said that everything isn't what it appears.
So explain.
My kids mean everything to me.
And I'll do whatever it takes in order to be with them.
So you're basically saying that you're only with Kennedy so that she doesn't take your kids from you.
- Yeah.
- Hmm.
Her family's from Louisiana and she would take them there.
- l know she would.
- So where does that leave me?
Skylar.
Look, yo, I care for you.
L really do.
- Please believe...
- Ls this seat taken?
Uh, Kennedy.
Thanks for the call, Skylar.
Why don't you scoot over?
L'm gonna let you guys talk.
No no no, please stay.
You have just as much a right to be here as I do.
You're looking all scared.
What, you don't have anything to say?
No lies, no excuses?
We're all here now.
Talk.
So you're the girl from the website, huh?
She's a bit younger than Autumn.
How's your grandmother?
Excuse me?
Oh.
Oh, you thought I didn't know about you until you called this morning?
Come on, I know everything that Prime does.
Everything... from the helicopter rides to the shopping sprees to the condo on East Lake Drive.
Everything.
L know what you're thinking.
Lf I know this, why don't I leave?
Because I love him.
He's the father of my children.
And I love his ass.
What you need to know, Miss Thing, is before you get romantically involved with a man, make sure you know everything there is to know about him.
You see, arrogant, selfish, rich individuals like my fiancé,
they prey upon sweet innocent women... like you.
L know he hurt you.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have called.
And I'm sorry for that.
But trust me, he won't hurt you again.
Now if you'll excuse us, my fiancé and I have a few things to discuss.
What did I tell you the last time?
L told you if you do this to me again, it's over.
L can't put up with this.
L won't.
L've been here with you through everything, Prime.
Everything.
L'm the mother of your children.
Does that mean nothing to you?
L've dealt with this before and I'm not dealing with it again.
L can't sit around until you figure out if you want to be what you should be.
Look.
Look, baby.
L'm sorry.
Kennedy, I...
I don't...
No, just stop it.
L'm done.
L'm done.
L am so done.
You know, you want to be the $100-million playboy?
So be it.
Me and the kids are leaving.
L'm going back to Louisiana.
- You're just...
- Baby.
Oh yeah.
Lce cream?
You wanna go get ice cream?
- All girls like ice cream.
- Well, that's true.
Umm, Prime.
Pri... excu...
Pri... excuse me.
Prime, you can't go back there!
My fucking life, you stupid-ass bitch!
L should kill your fucking ass!
L should kill your ass!
Prime, no!
Get...
Que!
- Oh my God!
- Prime!
Prime!
Let's go, man.
L'm calling the police!
Yes, it's an emergency.
Prime Alexander attacked my cousin.
- Come on, man.
Calm down.
- Get off me!
Camelback and 24th.
Lt's a boutique,
Autumn de Brise.
Please... please hurry.
Please.
Autumn?
L just know there's so much stupid drama.
L can't believe this shit.
Fucking asshole.
Oh my God.
Take a breath.
Outside, come on.
We need to deal with it.
Okay?
- Hey, thank you, guys, for coming.
- You okay?
- What happened?
- He attacked me.
- Did you press charges?
- Are all of you happy now?
- We're not gonna talk about...
- You got what you wanted?
- Let's go.
- You wanted to humiliate me?
You know what?
Fuck you, Prime!
Fuck you!
You got exactly what you deserve!
And you need to be glad that I didn't press charges.
L can't believe how far y'all took this shit!
Uploading pictures on the Internet, calling my baby mama!
And to torture me?
L ain't done nothing to none of y'all!
Lt don't make any difference.
L mean, even with all this, me and my boys, we gonna still do us.
Mm-hmm, you and your boys?
You'll still do you, right?
'Cause you're so close, right?
Best friends?
- Let's go.
- No no. 'Cause you're so close?
Hmm, let me think.
Did Dallas tell you that I've been fucking him for the last two months?
- Oh shit.
- Hey.
- Are you kidding?
- What?
You've been having sex with Dallas this entire time!
- Wow.
- Are you serious?
This isn't about that, all right?
So you eating off my sloppy seconds, I see, huh?
That's how she found the fucking sex tapes.
You know, all this proves is how much of a ho you are, just like you were cheating on me with Jeff Trepagnier.
Seriously?
She wasn't cheating on you with Jeff.
She was cheating on Jeff with you, you arrogant...
- Let's go.
You don't need this.
- Yeah, that's right.
Do the math.
Do the math, Prime.
L was with him when I met you.
Autumn, what the fuck is wrong with you?
You just gonna roll down the assembly line?
Ls that what you gonna do?
Hmm?
- What about Kalif?
- Yeah, where my slice at?
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe I should.
Then maybe I'll be just like Prime, especially since he fucked Katalina.
- What?
- Yeah, you thought I didn't know.
- Really?
- What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with...
- Yeah, why are you starting shit?
Prime and Katalina?
Prime and Katalina never hooked up.
Really?
Prime?
Hey.
Um, look, man, that was a long long time ago, man.
Don't get worked up over that.
This...
Don't get worked...
The fuck's he doing, man!
Chill out!
- Hey, Lonzo!
Hey!
- Chill!
- Relax!
- Man, I would've told you a fucking long time ago!
Lt was before you even knew her!
- 1080 for life, huh?
- Chill out, man?
- Really?
- Look.
Baby, listen.
- Don't "baby" me.
- Lt was a long...
I tried to tell you!
This whole thing was part of your plan, wasn't it?
- This whole thing, right?
- This had nothing to do with us.
Nothing to do with us.
- Lt's all your sick little revenge.
- You know... shut up!
- Fuck you, Autumn!
- l bet you wish you could!
- Hey!
Stop!
Stop!
That's enough!
Lt's enough!
You know what?
L don't even need this shit.
Autumn, wait.

Thanks.
Look, I...
I know you probably hate me right now, but I just wanted an opportunity to explain.
Explain what?
The fact that you slept with my best friend?
Yeah, you know what, Katalina?
L think that's pretty self-explanatory, don't you?
Look, I dated Prime before I knew you... two years ago.
We just went on two dates.
That was it.
- You should've told me.
- L tried.
- You didn't want to hear...
- You should've tried... you should've tried a little harder.
You know what?
Just make sure you get something to eat.
Okay?
What?
Really, Lonzo?
Really?
So, what, you want me to act like this never happened?
You just expect me to let the best thing that's ever happened to me just walk right out of my life?
All I can do is see him when I see you.
Huh-uh.
What do you want me to do?
L want you to try.
Don't push me away.
Just try.
L think what we have is worth it.
L love you... with every inch of my soul.
Me too.
L don't know what you want me to do to prove that, to make you see that.
L'll do anything.
You just tell me what you want.
L don't know.
Lt's not that easy.
Look, umm... I'm really sorry for ruining Katalina's birthday.
God, I fucking love you, you know that?
Don't you ever lie to me again.
- Do you hear me?
- Promise.
Don't let me go.

- Come on Penny, call it.
Where the fuck are they?
- Uh... there!
- Brains!
- I can shoot through ya!
Right in the kisser.
- You know you don't have to take such pleasure Max.
That used to be a human being.
- Shut it, Penny!
Remember,
Direction is critical.
I wanna hear one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock--
- Ten to ten!
- Whoa!
- Christ, Penny, little help would be nice.
- OK!
- Old school.
- Nice.
Show off.
- Well?
- Uh... um...
I don't know.
I'm getting multiple readings.
- Multiple readings, piece of shit.
Soo-eee!
Zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie.
Soo-eee!
Brains.
Brains.
- Looks like this party's just getting started.
- Brains.
- Brains.- ?
- Eww!
Shh, Tina.
You'll wake Sarah and Craig.
It's just a bug.
- I'm sorry, Steve, I'm just not really used to all this...
nature.
- Don't worry, the family cottage is very modern.
The outhouse is barely 20 feet from the front door.
- Ha-ha, very funny.
OK, I need you to focus.
Think head table.
Ready?
A?
Or B?
- Uh...
A?
- Oh, my God, I'm so happy that you said that, 'cause otherwise I would have had to order in the yellow orchids from Thailand, and
I think they almost look the same.
- Almost.
Why don't you put that away for now, Tina?
You did promise you were gonna have fun this weekend.
- You're sweet.
I promise to have fun.
- Good.
- 'Cause I scheduled it in the itinerary.
- Um...
- I'm just joking.
That's not the itinerary for the weekend.
This is.
- Tina--
- Look, Steve, there's still so much to do, and you've been so busy with your whole work human resource thingy.
- Workplace conflict resolution initiatives.
- Yes, you've had all that stuff.
I guess I'm just feeling overwhelmed.
I know that 300 people may seem like a small guest list.
- 300 people?
- But in my family, it's tiny.
I've had to make a lot of compromises for this wedding, which I'm happy to do, but I just want this to be a special day for both of us.
- It will be, baby.
I promise you.
- No doubt in my mind.
- Roll over.
- Your sister snores like a man.
- I know.
It's cute.
- Yeah.
I never thought my matron of honour would snore louder than my husband, but...
- Tina.
- It's just that your sister and I are... different.
- I know, and I'm very happy that you chose her to be your maid of honour.
- Matron.
She's married, and older.
- Well, it really means a lot to me.
- Aw, honey, you mean a lot to me.
And you mean a lot to Muffins!
- You mean a lot to me too, Muffins.
Yes you do.
Yes you do.
- Aww.
So cute!
- Gross, Steve.
Those things eat their own shit.
- What are you talking about?
Germans?
- Tina's rodent.
- Sarah, would you like to hold him?
- No.
- I would.
Gimme this little shit eater.
Ah.
Ahhh.
- Get it away!
- Would you look at us?
One big happy family on vacation.
- Yeah, it's gonna be great.
- Yep.
I spy with my little eye something that is...
fluffy.
Ha-ha-ha!
You're talking about the rabbit!
I am talking about the rabbit!
You got it on the first go!
This is why we're together!
You're good!
Aaaaaaand... here we are.
So?
What do you think of the Williams family cottage?
- Uh...
It's... charming.
- Baby, I told you we're roughing it.
- Sarah!
I need to know where the cleaning products are.
We really need to give this place a once over.
- Yes, Miss Tina.
Right aways, Miss Tina.
- They hate each other.
- Yep.
- I thought asking her to be her maid of honour would bring them closer together.
- Well, bitches are crazy.
Even when they like each other, they hate each other.
- Maybe they really like each other.
- No, those bitches really hate each other.
- Well, I deal with conflict resolution opportunities like this every day.
I think I can, uh--
- No, listen, buddy, seriously, your whole corporate Jedi mind shit, it's not gonna work for your team-building skills here.
- I got a few activities planned I think will help mend this relationship.
- Mmm.
And I have a few activities planned that'll help us get shit faced!
- Craig, you're family.
I need you on board this weekend.
You're my best man!
- You are so...
sexy right now.
- Craig, I'm being serious.
- And our balls are kinda touching.
It's OK, we're family.
It's OK.
All right, don't mention that.
That one's free.
- Steve, honey, let's see.
Oh, well, look at you.
You're getting there.
Craig?
Wow, Craig, those are perfect.
- Yeah, can I drink now, please?
- Oh, God, this is brutal!
This is the cottage.
We're supposed to be having fun.
- Its just one more hour,
OK, guys?
I mean, we're almost done the place cards, and then all we have to do is pick out the readings, make the photographer's list, we're gonna rehearse the speeches real quick--
- Babe...
Sarah's right.
This is our first night here.
Why don't we play a game or something?
- Yes!
I'll grab the beers.
- What kind of game?
- Now, the object of this game is to untangle ourselves without letting go of each other's hands.
- Steve, is this a team-building exercise?
- It's a team-building GAME.
- So it's like a party game?
- It's kinda like a party game.
- It's kinda like retarded.
- Sarah, we have to work together as a team.
- Can I get my beer?
- No, we can't let go of each other's hands, and we can't talk.
- I can't drink and I can't talk?
- Non-verbal cues only.
- All right, fine.
- Starting...
- Ow!
- Sorry.
- Just... go under there.
- Guys!
Remember the rules.
There's no talking.
- Oh, God.
Time out.
Time out.
I can't breath!
Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry.
I tried to go under your arm, but I got stuck in your underarm fa-
- My what?
- OK, let's play another game, shall we?
- What, did my matronly underarm fat get in your way?
- Oh, Sarah, don't be so dramatic.
- I'm dramatic?
You're the one who's wedding is taking over our vacation.
- Well, if you really feel that way, then maybe I shouldn't have made you my matron of honour instead of one of my real friends!
- Hey, let's get drunk!
How does that sound?
- Way ahead of you, buddy.
- Fine!
I don't want to be your god damned matron!
- Fine!
- Fine!
- Calm down!
Let's get a little fresh air.
- Nobody wants fresh air but you, Steve.
- Ah.
Ow.
Will you please just--
What the...?
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
- Steve, what is wrong with you?
- Ow!
Jesus!
Ow!
- Steve?
- Ow!
Ah!
Ah!
- Oh, my God!
Steve!
- Holy fuck, dude!
Are you all right?
- It just kept coming at me.
I thought I killed it, and then it bit me again.
- Whoa!
That's a lot of blood.
- Oh, honey, are you all right?
- No, he's gonna be fine, all right?
Some dudes just can't take the sight of their own blood.
Like, I was sword fishing once, and buddy was casting off, and he catches his buddy's nose, and, like, rips like half of it off, there's blood everywhere--
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- All right, that is it.
Party is over.
We are going to bed.
- Yeah.
Definitely.
- Steve, seriously?
You're gonna make me drink alone?
- Groom's mess.
Best man cleans up.
I'm gonna go set some place cards on fire.
- That's a buzz kill.
Maybe we should go home in the morning.
This may not have been the best idea.
- Hmm?
- It's just that I get a lot of work done at home and, you know, the salon really needs me.
- No.
No, no, no.
I think we should stay.
- It's just that your sister is so...
Baby, are you OK?
You're as white as a ghost.
- I don't feel so good.
- Ohhh, is my big strong man scared of a little bit of blood?
I know what'll make you feel better.
You haven't had one of these in a while.
- Oh, yeah?
- A... foot massage!
- Oh.
Yeah!
It's weird.
I just...
I just don't feel right.
- You have cold feet.
- No.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, I don't.
It's, it's...
I'm stressed about everybody getting along.
- No, Steve, your feet are like icicles.
- Oh.
Sorry.
- That's OK.
Sarah and I... we just... we just rub each other the wrong way sometimes, that's all.
- I love you, baby.
- You're cute.
OK, I promise to make more of an effort to play nice with your sister.
- And I promise to make more of an effort not to get attacked by killer mosquitoes.
- You can't help it.
They like to suck your blood because you're so sweet.
Ah-ah.
- Hey, Penny.
- Yeah.
- Come here, get a picture of me with fat zombie here.
- You're a child, Max.
- Ooh, that'll be a keeper.
- This is weird.
I've never seen the orb--whoa-- flicker like this
- Really?
What's it saying?
- What?
- Tactical Bacon is... that way!
- Max.
- Are you hungry, fat zombie?
I want some Tactical Bacon!
- Max.
- Of course you're hungry, fat zombie.
You're a fat zombie.
- Max, we need to investigate the area, OK?
- All right.
Should we investigate the area, fat zombie?
Tactical Bacon now!
- The orb is never wrong, OK?
- Yeah, OK, right.
Well, we'll eat and then we'll check out the area.
But, uh, first, come here, come over here.
Come here.
- Yeah?
I want you to give fat zombie a little kiss.
- Eww, no!
- Why, is it 'cause he's fat?
- No!
- Jesus!
- Ah!
- My bad.
So much for your magic orb.
Let's eat.
- Uh, it's still flickering.
- Oh, Christ.
Happy?
- No, it's...
it's so strange.
It's a...
- Penny!
- It's as if...
- Tactical Bacon!
- Good morning!
Cory Cortex here, comin' at your undead heads with all the brainformation a hungry mind can handle, here at AM 640, The...
- ...
Brain!
- Where we get into your heads and sink our teeth into what really matters-- grey matter, that is!
Right now traffic is a real headache.
In fact, it's a bloody mess!
And before you head out to work, you--
- Good morning, husband.
Rise and shine.
- Huh.
Hmm!
- Come on, sweetie.
Have some breakfast.
- Did someone say breakfast?
- Oh, ha-ha!
Muah!
- Oh, hey, Steve.
Oh, that looks good!
You gonna eat all that?
- No, thank you.
Hey, Craig, do you want to go for a run?
- I would, pal, but the weather forecast says there could... be rain.
- Would anyone like a smoothie?
- I would.
Oh, no!
Brain freeeeeeeze!
- Well, let us help you with that.
- Mmm!
- Mmm!
So good!
Steve, you wanna come try this with us?
- Brains.
- Brains.
- Brains!
- Brains.
- Brains?
- THE brain!
- Oh, come on!
- Ah, brains.
- Brains.
- Brains.
- Brains.
- Brains.
- Are you sure I can't help, Tina?
- Nope!
I'm scheduled for breakfast.
And then I have you guys cleaning up, I have Steve and Sarah making lunch, and Craig and I will clean up, and then I have Steve and Craig starting dinner.
If that's cool with you guys.
AND
I even gave everyone colour- coded tabs to avoid confusion!
- Vacation itinerary.
Yay!
- Good morning!
- Hey,
Pooh bear.
You're up late.
Uh, ooh, no.
- Oh, my God.
You look like shit.
- Nothing a good run won't cure, right?
Everything OK with you girls?
Super.
OK, shall we?
- Don't be late.
I'm making quiche.
All right!
- You know, I could teach you how to cook.
- When you get married, man, it's like a constant battle to hang on to your manhood.
- You guys seem to be doing all right.
- Yeah, well, your sister's pretty cool.
She's like the female version of you.
That's why I married her.
- That's really disturbing.
- Yeah, well, they always say, marry your best friend, and in a weird sort a way
I suppose I did.
- OK, stop.
- To be honest, man, I don't even recognize you anymore.
You're all... safe.
What's the matter?
- Sorry.
I can't find my pulse.
- You should be looking for your balls.
- All right, enough.
You're my best man.
You're supposed to be--
- No, a best man is supposed to be the guy that's telling you exactly the way it is.
and that's what I'm doing.
I've known you since college.
Face it, Steve, you're about to settle into the big sleep...
Steve!
Listen to me, all right?
Men, we're all wired to be alpha dogs.
Even pussy ones like you who want to be Bill fuckin' Cosby, all right?
And women, they dig alpha dogs.
Even strong-willed bitches like ours.
You want to be happy?
Grow some 'nads, all right?
Don't care about peoples' feelings or expectations.
Take what you want, man.
- Take what you want...
Oh, God, that's gross, man!
- Come on!
You know what that was?
- Chimichanga?
- No, that was a selfish, thoughtless urge.
And I haven't heard or smelt you fart in like three years.
And do you know why?
'Cause you're not allowed to.
Heh!
Brutal.
- Do me a favour:
don't tell Sarah I was smoking.
How do I smell?
- You smell like ass!
And Mexican food.
Christ!
Eat a salad.
- Jealous.
- Steve, you know we're gonna eat at least twice more today, right?
- I can't help it.
I'm starving.
- I'm just happy that you're feeling better, honey.
- Eww!
Gross!
Steve, you know I don't like that.
- I am so sorry.
I don't know what just happened.
- Are you OK?
You look really pale.
too fast, didn't you?
Did you eats too fast?
Is there too many
- eggies in your little belly?
- Are you not feeling very goo--
- Excuse me.
- Uh...
I'm just, um...
I'm just gonna make sure he's OK.
I'll be right back.
- I know the itinerary says I'm supposed to clean up... but...
- It's fine.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You're smoking?
I thought you gave it up when you moved in with Craig.
- Yeah, I started again after you proposed to Tina.
- I don't know what's happening to me.
- You're marrying a fuckin' bitch?
- Don't start, please.
Why can't you just try to get along?
- I'm sorry, Steve, but I don't like her.
And I resent you for guilting me into being her matron of honour.
- I'm happy with Tina.
- Steve, you look like shit, OK?
And I think maybe this is your body's way of telling you something that your brain is afraid to.
- OK, I'm giving up a few things here and there.
That's it.
That's what a relationship is!
I'm not like you, Sarah.
I'm not--
- A bitch?
- No.
I'm not... super strongly opinionated.
All I want is to be content.
Satisfied.
Not struggling or hungry for anything.
- Well, then you're already dead.
Don't you want more to live for?
- I'm happy with the way things are.
Please, just...
just be nice.
- Fine.
If that's what you want.
- It is.
Thank you.
- Are you feeling any better?
- I'm still really hungry, actually.
- Well, I wouldn't recommend the quiche.
It was made by a fucking gutter cunt.
- Whoa!
- Sorry, I'm just getting my fill while I can.
Don't tell Craig I was smoking, K?
I'm going to go hose the puke off your bride to be.
- Max.
These readings are like nothing I've ever seen before.
- That piece o' shit's a thousand years old, Penny.
The warranty is long gone.
- Max, the orb is fine, OK?
It's these readings-- they're just, uh, different.
We have to interpret them.
- That's your department, sweet cheeks.
- Look, I, I can't be sure, but, um...
I think we might have a mutation on our hands.
- Mutated zombies?
Bring it!
- No, um, I don't think it's a zombie, actually.
- I thought that thing only searched out meat puppets.
- Well, I mean, it could be, but I also t--
Max?
Max...
Max!
Max!
Jesus Christ!
- OK, where's all the little lightning bolts?
- Uh, well, well, that's, that's the thing.
I mean, I mean, the charges indicate the presence of zombie DNA, so when one is near, it activates.
But this flickering could indicate a hybrid.
- Hybrid?
What, you mean like a fuckin' hippie car?
- No, Max, like a...
fucking resistant host.
- Oh, Christ, that reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.
- Max, this could be exactly what I've been looking for-
- Waaaah!
- Oh, Penny, for Christ's sake, that's the last time you drive.
- Look Max, this could be exactly what I've been looking for, OK?
A person with the genetic make-up to resist the symptoms!
- I'm tellin' ya, Penny, the only good zombie is a dead zombie.
- No, no, no.
This could be why the orb has been acting so strangely.
And if we can capture this... person, we could extract their DNA and find a vaccine, Max!
- Yeah, well, dream on.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, buddy!
- Where you guys going?
- Into town.
You wanna come?
- No, Steve should stay here and get some rest.
- Baby, I am so sorry about--
- Ah, it's OK.
It's just... you're not feeling well.
You know?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ooh!
Ugh...
Just... go lie down.
- K.
- Yeah.
- Have fun!
We won't!
- Max!
Max!
Pull in!
Pull in here!
- Oh, Sarah, it looks like you're not gonna get any sun this weekend.
It's OK!
I'll book you a spray tan before the wedding.
Hi.
Are you guys lost?
- Oh, uh, no.
We, um, are actually here because--
- Have you kids seen any zombies.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, we're looking for, uh, a, uh, undead creature.
Humanoid-lookin'.
Possibly, uh, droolin' and, uh, eatin' people's brains.
- OK, what my associate is trying to say is that there has been a Stage 1 outbreak--
- Oh, come on, Penny, we haven't got time for that.
- I recognize you guys from somewhere!
- Here we go.
- No, I totally saw you guys online!
the only good zombie is a dead zombie.
- That's ridiculous!
- Fuck.
No, fuck you!
- Ahhhhhhhhh!
- Fuck you!
- What were you doing on a website called
Never mind that.
All right, no, seriously, you guys are fucking hilarious!
And you, dude, you've got some real talent, all right?
"Only good zombie's a dead zombie!"
So fuckin' cheese, that is awesome, man!
Eww, gross!
What the fuck?
!
- What the fuck?
You're the fuck!
- Craig, get in the car!
- Why the fuck do I gotta get in the car?
He should get in the car.
Fucker spit on me!
- Just get in the car, Craig!
- Yeah, Craig get in the car.
- Get in the van, Max.
- Don't tell me to get in the van, Penny.
- Max, I need you to trust my judgement right now and get in the van.
- You want me to get in the van?
I'll get in the fuckin' van.
- Thank you, Max!
I'm sorry.
Um, he's been under a lot of stress lately.
- Right.
- Hey, P!
- Yeah?
- This is what I think of your fuckin' judgement!
- Whoa!
Max!
Max, no!
Oh, my God!
- Ha-ha-ha!
Fucking hilarious!
- Shut up!
- Max, what did you do?
- Fuck...
- Oh, my God.
This is bad.
Uh... do you have any, uh, crazy glue?
- No.
We have to go now.
- OK, no, I understand, um, but IF you see anything that's out of the ordinary, you can give us a call right there.
Penel-- that's me on the bottom there.
And I also have this for you.
Um... if you could just help--
It sticks.
Can you grab that?
- Yeah, no problem.
- Right here is... this!
- Ah.
- It's complimentary, and you can just give it a read.
When you have a moment.
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, sorry to bother you.
yeah.
OK, Bye.
- OK.
Bye-bye.
- Max!
Wait!
Wait!
Max!
Max!
- What a bunch of crazies.
This is not funny!
Max, it's not funny!
- Undead creature?
Humanoid-looking.
Yeah.
Probably drooling... and eating somebody's...
Ohhhh!
Eating somebody's brains.
Ugh!
Ugh!
Brains?
Ah!
Mm!
Mm!
I want brai-- Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm!
Mm-mmm!
Mm-mmm!
Mm-mmm!
No I don't!
No I don't!
I want, um...
I want a...!
Pecan pie!
Mmm!
Pecan pie!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Yeah!
This is so delicious!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Damn it!
I want brains.
Ugh!
Oh, God!
I'm a zombie!
I'm a god damned zombie.
Tina's gonna kill me.
No.
Yes.
Groovy.
Ouch!
Ahhhh...
Whew!
All right, you little bastards.
Food chain ends here.

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ?

- Oh, my God, it's moving.
Oh.
I don't know, Muffins.
Maybe I should just give up, turn myself in.
I'm a pretty crappy zombie.
Come here.
Come here, big guy.
Ohhhh.
Are you scared?
Sorry I scared you, buddy.
You thought I was going to eat you, didn't you?
Yeah, you thought I was going to eat you.
You thought I was going to eat your brain!
Wooo!
Did you take your fucking adrenaline?
- Steve.
I don't know how you think you're gonna eat an entire watermelon--
- Hi!
- Let me get this straight.
You think that you are a zombie?
- Little bit.
- Tina, this is ridiculous!
Look at the pressure that you're putting on him for this stupid wedding!
- What?
!
My rabbit just died!
- Oh, God, it was a glorified rat!
- Stop it!
You heard the guy in the driveway.
They said they were looking for me.
- Oh, God.
- Steve, this is the real world,
OK?
That guy was a psycho.
There are no such thing as zombies!
- Then how do you explain the brains?
Ugh!
Damn it!
- Oh, my God.
Gross!
My fiancé doesn't eat brains.
- Ugh.
Can we please not say that word?
- Actually, I think he does eat... brains.
- Ugh.
- Exhibit fuckin' A.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Steve, we are getting married, and you are just freaking out.
Lots of men do this before the big day.
- Honey, I obviously have a problem here.
- You have a problem?
I have a problem!
Do you know how many people are coming to our wedding?
How many meals I've skipped to fit into that $5,000 dress?
And now my fiancé tells me that he doesn't want to marry me by killing my rabbit!
- Baby, listen to me.
I love you.
Of course
I'm going to marry you!
This isn't cold feet.
I'm sick!
- Really?
Really, Steve?
OK, if you're a zombie, then how come you're not trying to eat my face?
- I don't know!
I don't want to.
I couldn't hurt anybody.
But baby, I...
I really need to eat!
I am so freakin' hungry right now!
I can't even eat regular food!
- So what do we do?
- We find me something I can eat.
- That's it?
- Yes!
It's not a big deal!
- I'm sorry, uh, no big deal?
Dude, you're a fucking zombie!
This is a huge deal.
- All right, everybody, let's just calm down.
Craig, does that book say anything about food?
- Page one.
- Mmm!
All right!
Just listen.
I feel great.
All right?
I feel good, I really do!
I just need to find myself some...
Mmm!
You know?
So I'm gonna go to the store and get them.
- We're coming with you.
- Thank you.
- No!
- I'll go change.
- This is bullshit.
He's not a zombie.
- Of course he's not.
But I'm gonna call him on it.
If he wants brains, I will get him brains.
I'll even mash them up and I will spoon feed him if I have to.
But afterwards, he's gonna tell me what this is really about.
- So... should I put this in the freezer?
- Really, Craig?
- Maybe a stew?
Look at this place, look at this!
This looks great!
Um...
OK.
- Creative Meats.
- Gross.
- Ew.
- Don't be rude.
I didn't realize meat was a medium for expressing creativity.
- Oh, dude!
What are ya...?
Whoa.
This place looks like a Civil War field hospital or something.
- Craig, a little positive thinking.
- Guys, look.
Skunk meat!
- Fresh skunk meat!
- Ah!
- You look like a gal with an adventurous palate.
You know, raccoon is more subtle than you might think, despite it's popular reputation as a garbage feeder.
Yes, ma'am, I do love me some 'coon meat!
- Who doesn't?
Ha-ha-ha-ha...
- Actually, we're looking for something, a...
little off the menu.
- Pardon me, sir, but this establishment does not condone the sale of illegal firearms.
I am but a simple butcher.
But, just out of curiosity, what type and calibre are we talking about?
- Ohhh.
No, actually, thank you.
Um, we're actually looking for some... brains.
- And maybe some of that racoon meat.
- Eww!
- What?
He made it...
he made it sound kinda good.
- Did I just hear you right, boy?
Did you just ask me for... brains?
- Yes.
- Well, hot dog!
I'm a brain man myself!
Wa-hooo!
This is your lucky day, muchacho
I don't get as much call for brains, on account of the cholesterol.
But I'll tell ya,
I'll take me a mass of pan-fried calves' brains over a rack of ribs 10 out of 10!
- Ugh!
- Sure.
Ha-ha!
Me too.
- These just came in this morning.
- Oh-ho-ho!
This is messed up.
- Yeah, I'm gonna be in the car.
- Now, these little ones are appetizer size.
Great for holiday entertaining.
We got squirrel, muskrat, and those little ones there, them's rattlesnake.
Choice eating, those!
- May I?
- I'm not big on free samples... but I don't get many chances to eat brains with a fellow gourmand, as it were, so...
Cheers.
- Steve!
That's enough.
You're not actually gonna eat that, are you?
- Oh, yeah.
- I will be in the car.
- Well, I guess it's a table for two, monsieur!
Unless...
- Oh, no.
No, I'm good.
Yeah.
- Mmm!
- Just like a little candy, right, Stevie?
- They are delicious!
- You like 'em raw, too!
A man after my own heart.
Mmm!
- What are those ones there?
- Oh, these are simply divine!
Here we got skunk, owl, Canadian beaver, and rabbit.
- Oh, rabbit!
Your favourite!
Too soon?
- Mm...
- And this... is la pièce de résistance.
This is genuine, Grade A, all-American grizzly bear brain.
It is to die for.
- It's beautiful.
- Grill this baby low and slow for--
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, he's gonna pay for that.
That's $19.99 a pound.
- Ahh.
Ahhh!
- So?
How do you feel?
- OK.
You know what?
I feel OK.
- We'll take it.
We'll take it all.
- Yeah!
Ha-ha-ha!
- See that?
Good as new.
You wanna kiss and make up?
- Pull over there.
- You want to stay here?
- Uh, listen.
Between the crazy glue and the painkillers for your foot, we have gone way over budget, OK?
So now we are roughing it.
Don't even!
- Fine.
I like it rough.
- Then don't moisturize your hand.
- OK, but you have to spit on it.
- I will glue that hand to your face!
Remove your hand.
Kindly remove your hand right now.
- Give me a little.
- That's real mature, Max.
You have pushed me to my limit.
- Can you please not do that right now?
- What?
- Eat like a fuckin' zombie pig!
- Craig, you're not helping.
- No.
I'm not, because I'm not a zombie collaborator.
- SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
YOU SHUT UP!
YOU SHUT UP!
- Ow!
What the fuck?
!
- Oh, my God!
- OK.
- Don't touch me right now!
- Look, I know this is a lot to take in, but it's really gonna be OK.
- Really?
How?
- Yeah, how?
- Here's an idea:
why don't we talk about this in the cabin?
- Oh, no, I think we should talk about this on the way home.
- Yeah, I agree.
I'll start packing.
- Guys!
Wait!
Great.
Thanks, Craig.
- Eat me!
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Would you two just please stop it!
- OK, damn it!
I know that you're scared, all right?
I am too.
- I'm not afraid.
- There's no reason for us to be treating each other like this.
Now, I'm starting to feel better.
The hunger's not so bad anymore.
Now, someone please tell me where are my snake brains are.
- They're in your hand.
- Which hand?
- The one in the car.
- Oh, oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry, baby!
- That's amazing!
I don't even feel that!
- What do you mean?
- I don't feel it.
At all.
- It doesn't hurt?
- Nope!
- Seriously?
- It's fine!
I'm OK!
- No pain?
- Uh-uh.
- Let's do that again.
- No!
- This is stupid!
- No, its actually pretty cool.
- OK, you could warn me next time.
- Oh, look, you, uh, dropped your little bag of snacks there.
Let me get that for ya.
- What the fuck, Craig!
- That was awesome!
- OK, that was a good one.
- No, but seriously, we should get you to a hospital.
- Why?
I mean, aside from the brains and a little numbness, I'm fine.
Besides, when it comes down to it, it's really just a dietary restriction.
- Yeah, it's like that chick I know, uh, what's her face?
Um, she's allergic to gluten and shit.
What's her face?
Fuck.
- It's me, you idiot!
Your wife?
I'm gluten intolerant!
- Steve,
I just want you to feel like yourself again.
- I do, Tina.
I feel great!
And you know what?
I'm happy.
And I'm in love with you.
- Ugh...
- OK, we can stay.
- Seriously?
Am I the only one that sees a problem with this?
You can't feel pain!
You eat brains!
- I don't even want to eat brains... that much.
Look, I promise, the first second that I feel bad, we'll go home.
All right?
- Fine.
But for the record, this is a bad idea.
- Lets just try to have some fun.
- Oh!
?
Woo!
- ?
...go away
?
Even though I didn't want to let go ?
?
Why can't you see that what you're looking for ?
- Oh!
Huh?
Hey!
- ?
And you're never gonna let it show ?
- Ah!
- ?
...girl like you
?
You you you you you you you you ?
?
No, no, I don't miss you now ?
?
But I will never find another one ?
?
No, no, you don't miss me now ?
?
But you will never...
- Woo!
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah!
- ?
...never find another one
- I feel great!
Oh, my God!
Oh, kill me!
- That's it, we have to get him to the hospital.
- He's fine.
Look at all the stuff he did today.
- Tina, he's not a superhero;
he's undead!
I think he's getting worse.
- How could this be worse?
- Look.
Right here it says:
"The undead host must consume living "human cerebral tissue.
Any dead or non-human tissue will eventually be rejected."
- Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?
- Animal brains are like junk food.
It's like he's yakking up zombie mini doughnuts.
- Why didn't you tell us about this before?
- What?
I hadn't gotten that far.
Look at how thick this bitch is!
- Nooo, my Steve is gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK just in time for the wedding.
- Tina, if this keeps up, by next week we'll be at his funeral.
- Oh, hey, buddy.
You get it all out?
- Oh, my God, Steve.
You look like death!
That's it, Tina.
We have to take him to the hospital now!
- Enough!
He's fine.
He's fine!
We are not taking him to some back-water hospital.
He's fine.
You just need some rest, right, baby?
You just need some rest, that's all.
- Ahhh...
Ah!
- Oh, my God!
- Holy fuck, dude!
That is your ear!
- OK, I draw the line at things falling off my brother's face.
Craig, get the car.
- Finally.
See you guys, later.
- No, they're coming with us.
- Son of a fuck!
- No!
We are not going anywhere!
Craig, go upstairs right now and get my cosmetic kit.
- Right.
- This is fucked.
- Honey, I see women that are way worse come into my salon, and you know what?
After I'm done with them, they're like, like new people!
- I'm in pretty bad shape, Tina.
- Look at me.
You and I are going to be doing the chicken dance with my Nonna at our wedding in one week.
OK?
But right now my man looks like shit, so we have some work to do.
Sarah, go get me a paper towel.
- Tina, you're not seri--
- Now!
Craig,
I need you to take Steve's ear and rinse it off.
- Fuck that noise!
- Craig!
- What's that?
- Oh, it's eyelash adhesive.
Yeah.
- Oh--
- Oh!
- What?
Just say they're piercings.
I'm not fucking touching it.
- Ugh...
OK...
Heh-heh...
Now, just... hold... still.
OK?
And...
- Ugh!
RESYNC BY BSpidey87
- Ahhhhh!
Ahhh, I feel like Frankenstein.
Thank you for being so sweet.
- Honey, I'm not giving up on you because of some eating disorder or, or a missing ear.
This wouldn't even turn a head at my family dinner table.
- I love you, baby.
- OK, now, stay straight.
You don't want to have crooked ears.
No. 'Cause my man has perfect ears.
- As long as he looks fine for your fucking wedding.
- Craig, can you come here for a sec?
- What?
- Hold this.
- Gross!
- Don't move, either of you.
Sarah, can I talk to you in the other room for a second?
- You sure can.
- Great.
- Whoa, wait.
Where are you guys going?
We'll be back.
- So, uh... zombie dick?
- Yeah, its pretty bad.
- So, what now, Tina?
You want to talk about the fringe on my matron of honour dress?
- All right, that is... it!
- What the fuck?
!
You just punched my tit!
- Come on, tough girl.
You got a problem with me?
Let's see what you-
- Oww!
Ow!
Jesus!
You punch like a man!
- What the hell is your problem?
!
- I just want us to get this out of our systems so that we can work together and help Steve.
- So you punch me in the tit?
!
What are you, 12?
- You're kind of a bad ass, so I...
I needed an advantage.
- Yeah?
Well, this bad ass is about to kick your ass!
If you're done playing zombie makeover with him, we can actually get him some god damn professional help.
- What the...?
- Yeah, and those people that came by, they seem like real humanitarians.
- Tina!
Sarah!
- Don't move that ear!
- Yeah, Steve.
This is hot.
- I'm sick of you and your Little Miss Perfect bullshit!
- Ugh!
- Girls!
- Just a bit longer.
- Don't you even!
Ah!
Stop it!
I hate you!
You!
- Bitch!
- Emo slut!
- Plastic whore!
- Enough!
Tina!
Try talking to Sarah!
- Fine!
Sarah, you're a bitch!
- Tina!
Stop using judgemental language, get to the heart of your conflict, and empathize with her point of view.
And Sarah, stop being so defensively aggressive and be an active listener.
- OK.
Sarah, I know how much you love your brother, and I know that you don't think that I'm right for him.
But I love him.
Right now, he's Steve.
But if we don't come up with something, he's gonna turn into a monster.
- He already is, you morons!
Look at him.
He needs... brains.
- Ugh.
- Ah, gross.
- OK...
Craig is right.
- Of course I'm right.
The book says I'm right.
- And they're gonna have to be human too.
But maybe I just need a bit.
Just enough so that I can function.
- What do you have in mind?
- I'm going to go into town.
I'm going to find somebody that won't be missed.
And I'm gonna eat their fucking brains.
- Come on.
That's rich.
- No, you're not.
- There's no way, Steve.
- What?
- Honey, I just accidentally pulled your ear off.
You're in no condition to hunt.
- Well, what then?
- I have an idea.
- Jesus!
Fff!
Look what you've done to our women, Steve.
And who the fuck packs hooker boots for a weekend at the cottage?
- I do, and you don't have to be involved if you're afraid.
- We're just afraid that you girls are gonna get into trouble.
- Honey, everything is gonna be fine.
- Family takes care of family.
- Yeah, and we're family, all right--the fuckin' Manson family!
So what are you girls gonna do Bring back some sorry prick so he can eat him.
- Wow.
Thug life.
Great.
- Steve, if we get someone, can you go through with this?
- I'm sure my zombie instincts will just kick in.
But get somebody really old.
Or like a real asshole.
- How about a really old asshole?
- Do you want a man or do you want a woman?
- Oh.
A man.
Definitely.
I don't think I could eat a woman.
- Gay.
Way to go, Steve.
You're the first gay-ass zombie.
You're really breaking a lot of ground this weekend.
- Craig, shut up.
Seriously, we have to... we have to get someone that you're gonna hate so you can...
I dunno, kill them without remorse.
Like a...
like a pedophile or a meth dealer.
- Or a hipster.
I really hate hipsters.
- Or a parking cop.
I hate those bastards.
- I hate the Portuguese.
Uh... um, anyways, you just need to make sure you're ready to do what you have to do when we come back.
- Craig'll help you get ready.
- What?
Fuck that!
- Come on.
- So, if, uh, things don't work out between you and Tina, and you decide to marry a gay zombie,
I do support your decision.
But I wont be at the reception, because I don't eat cock or brains.
- Yeah, you're hilarious there!
- Yeah, so I RSVP "no"
to gay zombie wedding.
Yup.
So long, Muffins.
- This place reminds me of where my parents would take me camping every summer.
- My father... sent me to a survival camp in the Philippines when I was nine.
They, uh, dropped me in the jungle in the middle of a monsoon.
I had to survive for seven days.
- Your father did that to you?
- It was my birthday.
I'm tellin' ya, though, those seven days...
made me tough.
Tough enough to take anything that comes my way.
Alive or undead.
- Max, why do you hate zombies so much?
I mean, what if your mother turned into a zombie?
What would you do?
- Shoot her in the face.
- You would not shoot your mother in the face if she was in a coma.
- No.
If she was in a coma, she wouldn't be trying to turn my head into a god damned fondue pot.
- Right.
Well, if we find this resistant host, we could find a vaccine.
You'd be a hero, Max.
- You're right, I am a god damn hero.
I'm tired of waiting for your orb to tell us what to do.
We're gonna do this my way!
- Uh, where are we going?
- To get some bait.
- Him?
He looks old.
Kinda.
- He looks like he could have Alzheimer's.
Is that contagious?
- This is just evil!
- Suck it up, Sarah.
Your brother needs us.
- Look.
Soul patch.
That guy's a douche for sure.
- He's too fat.
He's like a walking bucket of chicken.
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Sarah, you need to take that terrified look off your face,
OK?
We're not gonna get anyone unless you throw out a certain vibe.
- What kind of vibe?
- Watch and learn.
- Wow.
That's sexy.
- I know, right?
OK, now you try.
Relax, throw your shoulders back, and wipe that look off your face.
- OK, how's this look?
- Like you're having a pap smear.
- Ugh!
This isn't going to work!
- We can do this, Sarah!
- I just don't know how we're gonna pick somebody.
- We'll figure it out.
You know, just keep our eyes open and eventually somebody'll just end up in our laps.
- Oh, my God!
- What the fuck!
My car!
- Tina.
Look.
Big scary guy is checking us out.
Hi.
- Huh.
That big scary guy is a dead man.
Hey.
- Are you crazy?
She's crazy.
- OK.
So, apparently, eight bones make up the neurocranium.
So it's like a bone vault for the brain and brain stem.
This part over here is the parietal.
So, this little sucker is like a quarter of an inch thick and hard as shit.
All right, so you're gonna have to Babe Ruth smash the shit out of this thing so you can have access to the cerebral cortex.
- Got it.
Oh, that smells good.
Mmm!
- What the fuck, dude!
- What?
- You just smelled my fucking brain!
- No.
Let's not jump to conclusions here.
No, all right, you're a fucking monster!
- Craig!
- Just stay the fuck away from me, all right?
Gay-ass zombie!
- God damn!
- Wow!
That is so... hot!
My, uh... woman parts like you too.
Ha-ha-ha...
Ugh, how is he still standing?
He's had enough booze to knock out a rhino!
- Don't worry, it's OK.
I have a plan.
Just get him in the back seat.
- Are you fucking joking me?
No fucking way!
- Don't worry, he's harmless.
- Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
- Oh, my God!
- Come on!
I need you to suck it up, and be sexy, and get him in the back seat!
Come on!
Go!
Get outta here!
- Hey... big man.
So... so, you wanna, you wanna go for a ride?
Stud monkey.
You make Mommy so horny!
What?
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Go ahead, get in.
- Hey, there.
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa--
- Ahhh!
- You have a pink stun gun?
- Yeah.
It's cute, right?
OK, lets go!
I'll drive!
- Wait!
What about me?
- Pizza, pizza, pizza!
Ha-ho!
Pizza!
Pizza, pizza!
- Max.
- Pizza, pizza, pizza!
Ha-ha!
Evening, young lady.
- Hello!
Are you, uh, Captain Cletus?
- Where's the pizza?
- The...
No, uh, sorry.
We are actually here for something else.
- Ma'am, if you are implying I might be in possession of illegal firearms, I will kindly ask you to leave--
- No, we don't want guns, Admiral Redneck.
We need brains.
- Uh...
Max.
- Ya'll have a good night, now.
- No wait, OK, all we want is brains.
- Sorry, Missy, no can do.
Somebody cleaned me out earlier today.
- Who?
- Bunch of kids.
Now beat it.
- No, wait!
Can you tell us anything else about them?
- Couple o' pretty-looking ladies was hanging with some queer-looking feller and another that couldn't get enough of my brains!
Now, git!
- That's our zombie, Penny.
Come on.
- The cottage!
No, Max, wait!
If the infected one hasn't eaten the others yet, it must mean that he's resisting the infection!
Which is wonderful!
Shit!
Where is that cottage?
- Hey, man, did you order the Vegetarian Nightmare?
Extra Polish sausage, German sausage, Belgian Sausage,
Russian sausage--
- Nope.
- Fuckin' hate this job.
- Ugh!
Oh, God.
Ugh!
OK.
Oh, God.
Ugh!
- What the hell!
- I have been worried sick!
- Shut up, Steve!
Oh, baby, you look kinda better, that's good, but shut up.
You need to help us carry this in.
- This is ridiculous.
We need a dolly or something.
Where's Craig?
- Uh...
sleeping, I think.
- Sleeping?
!
- What?
- Yeah!
I can help.
- OK.
- Come on.
OK, I'll take his legs, or--
- Oh, my God!
How did you get this guy?
!
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- Holy crap!
- This is ridiculous!
Are you girls pulling?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!
- Fuckin' freak family.
- OK, we softened him up for you.
- That guy is huge!
- I know, honey, but he's out cold.
Are you ready?
- Oh this is crazy.
You girls just kidnapped a guy!
And now you're gonna eat him!
- OK, listen to me.
This is very important.
This is our new lifestyle, OK?
And if we're gonna walk down the aisle together, then we both just need to embrace this.
- OK, all right.
He's all tied up and he's still out of it.
I wouldn't wait too long.
- All right.
I'm gonna go downstairs and eat this guy!
- OK.
- Thank you!
You've both have been so incredible.
I'm so happy to see the two of you working together so well.
You know, I think if this weekend has taught us anything--
- Steve, just GO!
- Wah!
- Love you!
- Wait, wait, wait!
Here!
- Oh, my God!
Boots are killing me!
- Oof!
Ugh!
OK...
- I can smell his undead ass.
- Max, we haven't gotten a reading from the orb.
We've been driving around in circles for hours.
OK, you have all the bells and whistles in here.
You have this!
Who do you even talk to in this?
And yet you don't have a NAV system!
- I don't need a fucking computer.
I'm a fucking professional!
I can feel when they're close by.
I don't need a fucking piece of technology.
You're a stone-cold killer.
- You're a stone-cold killer.
You're a stone-cold killer.
- Get it.
- You're a stone-cold--
- Hello?
- Hey.
Uh, y-you guys came by my place today.
It's my friend, he's turned into a zombie.
- OK, uh, uh, calm down, and, uh, where are you?
- Uh, it's 42 Clear Lake Drive.
- 42 Clear Lake Drive.
- Who is it?
- Oh, we're close!
- Who is it?
!
you're just going to do tests, you're not gonna hurt him?
Your gonna make him back to normal again, right?
- Of course.
He's gonna be in good hands--
- You're fucking right he'll be in good hands.
Who the fuck is this?
- Who the fuck is this?
- Hey, calm the fuck down, pal.
- I don't want to calm the fuck down.
Fuck you, fucker!
You calm the fuck down!
- You fucking relax!
- No, you go fuck yourself and get the fuck over here, you fucker!
- No, you fuck yourself, you fuck!
- Fuck you.
- Fuck!
FUUUUUUUCK!
- Max!
Max, really?
Those things practically have feelings.
- Not anymore.
- Ha!
That's stupid.
Mmm... no.
Just do it!
Mmm.
- Hey.
- What the hell are you guys doing with all those guns?
- Hey there, pumpkin.
Nice of you to call us about your little friend-- 12 hours too late.
- You promised me you weren't gonna hurt him.
- No, no, no.
No, no, we won't hurt him, OK?
We promise.
Right, Max?
We won't hurt him.
- You stay here with sugar tits.
I got this one.
- No, wait, Max.
Max, this one is different.
OK, we cannot waste this opportunity.
It'd be like throwing away the cure for cancer.
OK, Max, listen!
- No, you listen!
Zombies are killin'.
- Max, we need this guy, OK?
- No, no!
- Christ.
- No, no, no, no!
- I don't need anybody.
Mmm...
- This orb was centuries... old.
- Lady, fuck your orb, all right?
Make sure that maniac doesn't hurt my friend!
Where is he?
- No, you don't understand!
- Don't you touch my brother!
- Where is he?
!
- Sorry, pal.
- Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the door!
- No!
- Open the door!
Open the door!
- No!
- Open the door!
Open the door!
Girls!
Girls!
Open the door!
Ah!
- Is that--
- Yes!
It is.
- You promised me you weren't gonna hurt him!
- Wait!
You called them?
!
- Uh-oh.
Awkward.
Hey!
What the hell is that?
- Oh, just hundreds of years of mystical antiquity that you selfishly discar--
- Oh, for Christ's sake, Penny, get over it!
- I wanna say goodbye to him.
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No, it's...
it's pretty messy.
- Thank you so much for coming.
I don't know what we would have done without you.
- Well, luckily, Little Miss Braveheart over here, she had the good sense to give us a call when she did.
Way to go, pumpkin.
Now you can sew a big, fat "Courage" badge on your Girl Scout sash.
Great big badge in the shape of a lion, giving you two thumbs up.
How about that, huh?
'Cause you are such a mature young woman.
You may even get asked to the junior prom where you can get fingered in the cafetorium, right next--
- You know what?
Fuck you, asshole!
All right?
That was my best friend!
- And we are so sorry for your loss, and we will personally--
- You know what?
Why are you OK with this?
Your brother's dead!
- You're right!
It's, it's, it's horrible!
You, you monsters!
Get the fuck out of here!
- Yes, yes, yeah, yeah!
You know what?
You guys are animals!
Leave now!
- OK, you're right.
Let's blow, Penny.
I'm sorry.
- What the fuck?
!
- Hi.
Ugh!
- Holy fuck, Steve!
You're OK!
Did you see me?
I was fucking crying and everything!
Did you see?
- Nice try, zombie.
Now, get read¦÷ to say your prayers... in hell!
- No!
- Get out of the way.
- No!
You are not gonna shoot him, because we are getting married in six days!
- Don't make me shoot through ya.
- No!
Don't you see?
He's not a complete zombie!
He's still human!
- Max, you idiot!
Don't you see this is it?
He's resisting the infection.
This is our chance to find the cure!
- Oh, yeah, sure, you'd like that, wouldn't ya?
A nice little guinea pig that you can study and make everything all better.
Then everybody gets booster shots and lollipops and there are no more zombies.
Let me tell you something, sister.
The only shot that cures a zombie comes out of the end of this sweet little baby right here.
Suck it up, brain junkie, 'cause you ain't getting a lolli after this one.
No!
- Get off me, you bitch.
Happy honeymoon.
- Ah!
- Shit!
- Whoa!
Hey!
- Do it, Steve!
- Yeah, eat that fucker's head!
- Oh, God, messy fucker.
- I can't do this.
Ah... it's time to face the fact that I'm, uh, whatever this is.
And whatever this is is not safe to be around.
- Oh, Steve, dude, seriously, I am so sorry I called you a gay-ass zombie all right?
We can put you on an island somewhere, all right?
Somewhere far away.
We'll come visit, like at Christmas and shit, right?
- Steve, think about this.
- Sarah, I can't be this selfish.
I can't go on having people in my life be accessory to murder.
- No, Steve!
No!
- You'll take care of her, yeah?
- Steve, please, give me the gun.
- I am so sorry, Tina.
I really wish I could be there for all of it-- for the chicken dance with your Nonna, eating our wedding cake, seeing you in your dress.
I love you.
- I love you, Steve.
- All right.
Where do you wanna do this?
You want to, uh... go around the back?
Or what do you wanna do?
Max, let's talk about this!
- Whoa!
Here?
!
Really?
!
Now?
!
Are you sure?
!
- I just want you to know, of all the zombies I've encountered, you're... the most human.
- Please.
Not in front of my girl.
- All right.
- Oh!
- The only good zombie...
- is a dead zom--
- Shit...
I was aiming for his leg.
- Holy fuck, lady!
You just, like, totally wasted your boyfriend!
- He was not my boyfriend.
He was the muscle.
OK, Steve?
Steve.
Here's how it is.
Um...
I could put you down right now, if that's what you want me to do.
Or, you can come with me, and we can see if we can't find a cure for this, uh, this thing.
Now, I-I-I can't promise any thing, b-b-but
I will use all of my resources, I will work day and night,
I will use my education until we find a way to beat this infection.
Oh, and, and when we're done with this and we find a cure...
you'll be a hero.
- Really?
- I'll be a hero.
But, uh, but you'll be a celebrity, which is...
pretty much as good.
- Dude, we are gonna be famous!
- So, what do you say, Steve?
- All right, I'll--
- Ahh!
- Baby!
Are you all right?
- You fucking moron!
- We're safe now.
Everything is gonna be fine!
- You are a fucking moron!
She was gonna help us.
She was gonna help Steve!
You ruined everything!
- She was gonna hurt him, Craig!
OK?
!
She wanted to use him for experiments!
- No, we were gonna be celebrities!
On the internet!
Or at least on fucking TV!
- Everything was gonna be fine!
- EVERYTHING IS FINE!
FUCK!
Look at Steve!
Steve!
You're all...
happy!
- Hi, Tina.
- Oh!
Hi, baby.
Everything is gonna be OK.
We are gonna get married, we are gonna be happy, and we are gonna be fine.
I think I may have fucked up a little bit at the end there, but its OK, 'cause we made it!
- Baby.
- I love you.
- I love brains!
- ?
Hey, hey, hey!

Hey, hey, hey!

It was a bad idea

When they said "You're gonna be ?

In solitary confinement"

While the other inmates

I'm in an 8x10

To give me this kind of time ?

It was a bad idea
- It's worse than horrible because a zombie has no will of his own, walking around blindly with dead eyes.

I'm a zombie girl in a zombie world ?

When I see you, boy, you make my head twirl ?

Fall in, fall in, fall in, fall in ?

I can make a J sign with my finger and my thumb ?

Oh no I got a paper gun pointed at your shirt ?

It'll totally stain your rug and it's probably gonna hurt ?
?
You might still be living and I might be dead ?
?
But you're lookin' way dirtier than me, K, fair ?
?
It's a rising of the zombies and my face is rare ?
?
Because that cute little zombie is risen from the dead ?
?
I might have an axe stuck in my neck ?

But I still got all my homies' and my playas' respect ?

I got the dopest rhymes goin' through my head ?

Excuse me if my hand falls off, I don't mean to be rude ?

I'm a gangsta and a zombie too ?

My head just rolled off, could you pass me that glue?

I like playing b-ball, especially with my head ?

Where the fuck are they?
- Uh... there!

- You know you don't have to take such pleasure Max.
That used to be a human being.
- Shut it, Penny!
Remember,
Direction is critical.
I wanna hear one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock
- Ten to ten!
- Christ, Penny, little help would be nice.
- OK!
- Old school.
- Nice.
Show off.
- Well?

I'm getting multiple readings.
- Multiple readings, piece of shit.
Soo-eee!
Zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie.

- Brains.
Brains.
- Looks like this party's just getting started.
Brains.
Brains.
Eww!

You'll wake Sarah and Craig.
It's just a bug.
- I'm sorry, Steve, I'm just not really used to all this...
nature.
- Don't worry, the family cottage is very modern.
The outhouse is barely 20 feet from the front door.
- Ha-ha, very funny.
OK, I need you to focus.
Think head table.
Ready ?
A ?
Or B ?
- Uh...
A ?
- Oh, my God, I'm so happy that you said that, 'cause otherwise I would have had to order in the yellow orchids from Thailand, and
I think they almost look the same.
- Almost.
Why don't you put that away for now, Tina?
You did promise you were gonna have fun this weekend.
- You're sweet.
I promise to have fun.
- Good.
- 'Cause I scheduled it in the itinerary.
- Um...
- I'm just joking.
That's not the itinerary for the weekend.
This is.
- Tina--
- Look, Steve, there's still so much to do, and you've been so busy with your whole work human resource thingy.
- Workplace conflict resolution initiatives.
- Yes, you've had all that stuff.
I guess I'm just feeling overwhelmed.
I know that 300 people may seem like a small guest list.
- 300 people?
- But in my family, it's tiny.
I've had to make a lot of compromises for this wedding, which I'm happy to do, but I just want this to be a special day for both of us.
- It will be, baby.
I promise you.
- No doubt in my mind.
- Roll over.
Your sister snores like a man.
- I know.
It's cute.
- Yeah.
I never thought my matron of honour would snore louder than my husband, but...
- Tina.
- It's just that your sister and I are... different.
- I know, and I'm very happy that you chose her to be your maid of honour.
- Matron.
She's married, and older.
- Well, it really means a lot to me.
- Aw, honey, you mean a lot to me.
And you mean a lot to Muffins!
You mean a lot to me too, Muffins.
Yes you do.
Yes you do.
- Aww.
So cute!
- Gross, Steve.
Those things eat their own shit.
- What are you talking about?
Germans?
- Tina's rodent.
- Sarah, would you like to hold him?
- No.
- I would.
Gimme this little shit eater.
Ah.
Ahhh.
- Get it away!
- Would you look at us?
One big happy family on vacation.
- Yeah, it's gonna be great.
- Yep.
I spy with my little eye something that is...
fluffy.
Ha-ha-ha!
You're talking about the rabbit!
I am talking about the rabbit !
You got it on the first go!
- This is why we're together!
- You're good !
Aaaaaaand... here we are.
So ?
What do you think of the Williams family cottage?
- Uh...
It's... charming.
- Baby, I told you we're roughing it.
Sarah!
I need to know where the cleaning products are.
We really need to give this place a once over.
Yes, Miss Tina.
Right aways, Miss Tina.
- They hate each other.
- Yep.
- I thought asking her to be her maid of honour would bring them closer together.
- Well, bitches are crazy.
Even when they like each other, they hate each other.
- Maybe they really like each other.
- No, those bitches really hate each other.
- Well, I deal with conflict resolution opportunities like this every day.
I think I can, uh--
- No, listen, buddy, seriously, your whole corporate Jedi mind shit, it's not gonna work for your team-building skills here.
- I got a few activities planned I think will help mend this relationship.
- Mmm.
And I have a few activities planned that'll help us get shit faced!
- Craig, you're family.
I need you on board this weekend.
You're my best man!
- You are so...
sexy right now.
- Craig, I'm being serious.
- And our balls are kinda touching.
It's OK, we're family.
It's OK.
All right, don't mention that.
That one's free.
- Steve, honey, let's see.
Oh, well, look at you.
You're getting there.
Craig?
Wow, Craig, those are perfect.
- Yeah, can I drink now, please?
- Oh, God, this is brutal!
This is the cottage.
We're supposed to be having fun.
- Its just one more hour,
OK, guys?
I mean, we're almost done the place cards, and then all we have to do is pick out the readings, make the photographer's list, we're gonna rehearse the speeches real quick--
- Babe...
Sarah's right.
This is our first night here.
Why don't we play a game or something?
- Yes!
I'll grab the beers.
- What kind of game?
- Now, the object of this game is to untangle ourselves without letting go of each other's hands.
- Steve, is this a team-building exercise?
- It's a team-building GAME.
- So it's like a party game?
- It's kinda like a party game.
- It's kinda like retarded.
- Sarah, we have to work together as a team.
- Can I get my beer?
- No, we can't let go of each other's hands, and we can't talk.
- I can't drink and I can't talk?
- Non-verbal cues only.
- All right, fine.
- Starting...
- Ow!
- Sorry.
- Just... go under there.
- Guys!
Remember the rules.
There's no talking.
- Oh, God.
Time out.
Time out.
I can't breath!
Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry.
I tried to go under your arm, but I got stuck in your underarm fa-
- My what?
- OK, let's play another game, shall we?
- What, did my matronly underarm fat get in your way?
- Oh, Sarah, don't be so dramatic.
- I'm dramatic?
You're the one who's wedding is taking over our vacation.
- Well, if you really feel that way, then maybe I shouldn't have made you my matron of honour instead of one of my real friends!
- Hey, let's get drunk!
How does that sound?
Way ahead of you, buddy.
- Fine!
I don't want to be your god damned matron!
- Fine!
- Fine!
- Calm down!
Let's get a little fresh air.
- Nobody wants fresh air but you, Steve.
- Ah.
Ow.
Will you please just--
What the...?
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
- Steve, what is wrong with you?
- Ow!
Jesus!
Ow!
- Steve?
- Ow!
Ah!
Ah!
- Oh, my God!
Steve! Holy fuck, dude!
- Are you all right?
- It just kept coming at me.
I thought I killed it, and then it bit me again.
- Whoa!
That's a lot of blood.
- Oh, honey, are you all right?
- No, he's gonna be fine, all right?
Some dudes just can't take the sight of their own blood.
Like, I was sword fishing once, and buddy was casting off, and he catches his buddy's nose, and, like, rips like half of it off, there's blood everywhere--
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- All right, that is it.
Party is over.
We are going to bed.
- Yeah.
Definitely.
- Steve, seriously?
You're gonna make me drink alone?
- Groom's mess.
Best man cleans up.
I'm gonna go set some place cards on fire.
- That's a buzz kill.
Maybe we should go home in the morning.
This may not have been the best idea.
- Hmm?
- It's just that I get a lot of work done at home and, you know, the salon really needs me.
- No.
No, no, no.
I think we should stay.
- It's just that your sister is so...
Baby, are you OK?
You're as white as a ghost.
- I don't feel so good.
- Ohhh, is my big strong man scared of a little bit of blood?
I know what'll make you feel better.
You haven't had one of these in a while.
- Oh, yeah?
- A... foot massage!
- Oh.
Yeah!
It's weird.
I just...
I just don't feel right.
You have cold feet.
- No.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, I don't.
It's, it's...
I'm stressed about everybody getting along.
No, Steve, your feet are like icicles.
- Oh.
Sorry.
- That's OK.
Sarah and I... we just... we just rub each other the wrong way sometimes, that's all.
I love you, baby.
You're cute.
OK, I promise to make more of an effort to play nice with your sister.
And I promise to make more of an effort not to get attacked by killer mosquitoes.
You can't help it.
They like to suck your blood because you're so sweet.
Ah-ah.
- Hey, Penny.
- Yeah.
- Come here, get a picture of me with fat zombie here.
- You're a child, Max.
- Ooh, that'll be a keeper.
- This is weird.
I've never seen the orb--whoa-- flicker like this
Really ?
What's it saying ?
- What?
- Tactical Bacon is... that way!
- Max.
- Are you hungry, fat zombie?
I want some Tactical Bacon!
- Max.
- Of course you're hungry, fat zombie.
You're a fat zombie.
- Max, we need to investigate the area, OK?
All right.
Should we investigate the area, fat zombie ?
Tactical Bacon now!
The orb is never wrong, OK?
Yeah, OK, right.
Well, we'll eat and then we'll check out the area.
- But, uh, first, come here, come over here.
- Yeah?
I want you to give fat zombie a little kiss.
- Eww, no!
- Why, is it 'cause he's fat?
- No!
- Jesus!
- Ah !
- My bad.
So much for your magic orb.
Let's eat.
- Uh, it's still flickering.
- Oh, Christ.
Happy ?
- No, it's...
it's so strange.
It's a...
- Penny!
- It's as if...
- Tactical Bacon!
- Good morning!
Cory Cortex here, comin' at your undead heads with all the brainformation a hungry mind can handle, here at AM 640, The...
- ...
Brain!
- Where we get into your heads and sink our teeth into what really matters-- grey matter, that is!
Right now traffic is a real headache.
In fact, it's a bloody mess!
And before you head out to work, you--
- Good morning, husband.
- Rise and shine.
- Huh.
Hmm!
- Come on, sweetie.
Have some breakfast.
- Did someone say breakfast?
- Oh, ha-ha!
Muah!
- Oh, hey, Steve.
Oh, that looks good!
You gonna eat all that?
- No, thank you.
Hey, Craig, do you want to go for a run?
- I would, pal, but the weather forecast says there could... be rain.
- Would anyone like a smoothie?
- I would.
Oh, no !
Brain freeeeeeeze !
- Well, let us help you with that.
- Mmm!
So good!
Steve, you wanna come try this with us?
- Brains.
- Brains.
- Brains !
- Brains.
- Brains ?
- THE brain !
- Oh, come on !
- Ah, brains.
- Brains.
- Brains.
- Brains.
- Brains.
- Are you sure
- I can't help, Tina?
- Nope !
I'm scheduled for breakfast.
And then I have you guys cleaning up, I have Steve and Sarah making lunch, and Craig and I will clean up, and then I have Steve and Craig starting dinner.
If that's cool with you guys.
AND
I even gave everyone colour- coded tabs to avoid confusion!
- Vacation itinerary.
Yay!
- Good morning!
- Hey,
Pooh bear.
You're up late.
Uh, ooh, no.
- Oh, my God.
You look like shit.
Nothing a good run won't cure, right?
Everything OK with you girls?
Super.
OK, shall we?
- Don't be late.
I'm making quiche.
- All right! You know, I could teach you how to cook.
- When you get married, man, it's like a constant battle to hang on to your manhood.
You guys seem to be doing all right.
Yeah, well, your sister's pretty cool.
She's like the female version of you.
That's why I married her.
- That's really disturbing.
- Yeah, well, they always say, marry your best friend, and in a weird sort a way
I suppose I did.
- OK, stop.
To be honest, man, I don't even recognize you anymore.
You're all... safe.
What's the matter ?
Sorry.
I can't find my pulse.
You should be looking for your balls.
All right, enough.
You're my best man.
- You're supposed to be--
- No, a best man is supposed to be the guy that's telling you exactly the way it is.
and that's what I'm doing.
I've known you since college.
Face it, Steve, you're about to settle into the big sleep...
Steve !
Listen to me, all right?
Men, we're all wired to be alpha dogs.
Even pussy ones like you who want to be Bill fuckin' Cosby, all right?
And women, they dig alpha dogs.
Even strong-willed bitches like ours.
You want to be happy?
Grow some 'nads, all right?
Don't care about peoples' feelings
- or expectations.
Take what you want, man.
- Take what you want...
Oh, God, that's gross, man!
Come on!
You know what that was?
- Chimichanga?
- No, that was a selfish, thoughtless urge.
And I haven't heard or smelt you fart in like three years.
And do you know why?
'Cause you're not allowed to.
Heh!
Brutal.
Do me a favour :
don't tell Sarah I was smoking.
- How do I smell?
- You smell like ass!
- And Mexican food.
Christ!
Eat a salad.
- Jealous.
Steve, you know we're gonna eat at least twice more today, right?
I can't help it.
I'm starving.
I'm just happy that you're feeling better, honey.
Gross !
Steve,
- you know I don't like that.
- I am so sorry.
I don't know what just happened.
Are you OK?
You look really pale.
too fast, didn't you?
Did you eats too fast?
Is there too many eggies in your little belly?
Are you not feeling very goo--
Excuse me.
Uh...
I'm just, um...
I'm just gonna make sure he's OK.
I'll be right back.
I know the itinerary says I'm supposed to clean up... but...
It's fine.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You're smoking ?
I thought you gave it up when you moved in with Craig.
Yeah, I started again after you proposed to Tina.
- I don't know what's happening to me.
You're marrying a fuckin' bitch?
- Don't start, please.
Why can't you just try to get along?
- I'm sorry, Steve, but I don't like her.
And I resent you for guilting me into being her matron of honour.
I'm happy with Tina.
Steve, you look like shit, OK?
And I think maybe this is your body's way of telling you something that your brain is afraid to.
OK, I'm giving up a few things here and there.
That's it.
That's what a relationship is!
I'm not like you, Sarah.
I'm not--
- A bitch ?
- No.
I'm not... super strongly opinionated.
All I want is to be content.
Satisfied.
Not struggling or hungry for anything.
- Well, then you're already dead.
Don't you want more to live for ?
- I'm happy with the way things are.
Please, just...
just be nice.
Fine.
If that's what you want.
It is.
Thank you.
Are you feeling any better?
I'm still really hungry, actually.
Well, I wouldn't recommend the quiche.
It was made by a fucking gutter cunt.
Sorry, I'm just getting my fill while I can.
Don't tell Craig I was smoking, K ?
I'm going to go hose the puke off your bride to be.
Max.
These readings are like nothing I've ever seen before.
That piece o' shit's a thousand years old, Penny.
- The warranty is long gone.
- Max, the orb is fine, OK?
It's these readings they're just, uh, different.
We have to interpret them.
That's your department, sweet cheeks.
Look, I, I can't be sure, but, um...
I think we might have a mutation on our hands.
Mutated zombies?
Bring it!
No, um, I don't think it's a zombie, actually.
I thought that thing only searched out meat puppets.
Well, I mean, it could be, but I also t--
Max ?
Max...
Max !
Max !
Jesus Christ !
OK, where's all the little lightning bolts?
Uh, well, well, that's, that's the thing.
I mean, I mean, the charges indicate the presence of zombie DNA, so when one is near, it activates.
But this flickering could indicate a hybrid.
Hybrid ?
What, you mean like a fuckin' hippie car ?
No, Max, like a...
fucking resistant host.
- Oh, Christ, that reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.
- Max, this could be exactly what I've been looking for-
- Waaaah!
- Oh, Penny, for Christ's sake, that's the last time you drive.
- Look Max, this could be exactly what I've been looking for, OK?
A person with the genetic make-up to resist the symptoms!
- I'm tellin' ya, Penny, the only good zombie is a dead zombie.
No, no.
This could be why the orb has been acting so strangely.
And if we can capture this... person, we could extract their DNA and find a vaccine, Max!
Yeah, well, dream on.
- Oh, hey, buddy!
- Where you guys going ?
- Into town.
You wanna come ?
- No, Steve should stay here and get some rest.
- Baby, I am so sorry about--
- Ah, it's OK.
It's just... you're not feeling well.
You know?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ooh!
Ugh...
Just... go lie down.
- K.
- Yeah.
- Have fun!
We won't!
Max!
Max!
Pull in!
Pull in here!
Oh, Sarah, it looks like you're not gonna get any sun this weekend.
It's OK!
I'll book you a spray tan before the wedding.
Hi.
Are you guys lost?
Oh, uh, no.
We, um, are actually here because--
Have you kids seen any zombies.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, we're looking for, uh, a, uh, undead creature.
Humanoid-lookin'.
Possibly, uh, droolin' and, uh, eatin' people's brains.
OK, what my associate is trying to say is that there has
- been a Stage 1 outbreak--
- Oh, come on, Penny, we haven't got time for that.
I recognize you guys from somewhere!
Here we go.
No, I totally saw you guys online!
Because my motto is :
the only good zombie is a dead zombie.
- That's ridiculous!
[Laughing]
Fuck.
No, fuck you!
- Ahhhhhhhhh!
- Fuck you!
What were you doing on a website called
Never mind that.
All right, no, seriously, you guys are fucking hilarious!
And you, dude, you've got some real talent, all right?
"Only good zombie's a dead zombie!"
So fuckin' cheese, that is awesome, man!
Eww, gross!
What the fuck?
!
- What the fuck?
You're the fuck!
- Craig, get in the car!
Why the fuck do I gotta get in the car ?
He should get in the car.
Fucker spit on me!
- Just get in the car, Craig!
- Yeah, Craig get in the car.
- Get in the van, Max.
Don't tell me to get in the van, Penny.
Max, I need you to trust my judgement right now and get in the van.
- You want me to get in the van ?
I'll get in the fuckin' van.
- Thank you, Max!
I'm sorry.
Um, he's been under a lot of stress lately.
- Right.
- Hey, P !
- This is what I think of your fuckin' judgement!
Whoa!
Max!
Max, no!
- Oh, my God!
- Ha-ha-ha!
Fucking hilarious!
- Shut up!
- Max, what did you do?
- Fuck...
- Oh, my God.
This is bad.
Uh... do you have any, uh, crazy glue?
- No.
We have to go now.
- OK, no, I understand, um, but IF you see anything that's out of the ordinary, you can give us a call right there.
Penel-- that's me on the bottom there.
And I also have this for you.
Um... if you could just help--
- It sticks.
Can you grab that ?
- Yeah, no problem.
- Right here is... this!
- Ah.
- It's complimentary, and you can just give it a read.
When you have a moment.
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, sorry to bother you.
- Yeah.
OK, Bye.
- OK.
Bye-bye.
- Max!
Wait!
Wait!
Max!
Max!
- What a bunch of crazies.
- This is not funny!
Max, it's not funny!
Undead creature?
Humanoid-looking.
Yeah.
Probably drooling... and eating somebody's...
Ohhhh!
Eating somebody's brains.
Ugh!
Ugh!
Brains?
I want brai-- Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm!
No I don't !
No I don't !
I want, um...
I want a...!
Pecan pie !
Mmm !
Pecan pie !
Mmm !
Mmm !
Yeah !
This is so delicious!
Damn it!
I want brains.
Oh, God!
I'm a zombie!
I'm a god damned zombie.
Tina's gonna kill me.
No.
Yes.
Groovy.
All right, you little bastards.
Food chain ends here.
Oh, my God, it's moving.
Oh.
I don't know, Muffins.
Maybe I should just give up, turn myself in.
I'm a pretty crappy zombie.
Come here.
Come here, big guy.
Ohhhh.
Are you scared?
Sorry I scared you, buddy.
You thought I was going to eat you, didn't you?
Yeah, you thought I was going to eat you.
You thought I was going to eat your brain!
- Did you take your fucking adrenaline ?
- Steve.
- I don't know how you think you're gonna eat an entire watermelon--
Hi!
Let me get this straight.
You think that you are a zombie?
- Little bit.
- Tina, this is ridiculous!
Look at the pressure that you're putting on him for this stupid wedding !
What?
!
My rabbit just died!
Oh, God, it was a glorified rat!
Stop it!
You heard the guy in the driveway.
They said they were looking for me.
- Oh, God.
- Steve, this is the real world,
OK?
That guy was a psycho.
There are no such thing as zombies!
Then how do you explain the brains?
Damn it!
Oh, my God.
Gross!
My fiancé doesn't eat brains.
Can we please not say that word?
- Actually, I think he does eat... brains.
- Ugh.
- Exhibit fuckin' A.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Steve, we are getting married, and you are just freaking out.
Lots of men do this before the big day.
Honey, I obviously have a problem here.
You have a problem ?
I have a problem !
Do you know how many people are coming to our wedding ?
How many meals I've skipped to fit into that $5,000 dress?
And now my fiancé tells me that he doesn't want to marry me by killing my rabbit!
Baby, listen to me.
I love you.
Of course
I'm going to marry you !
This isn't cold feet.
I'm sick !
Really ?
Really, Steve ?
OK, if you're a zombie, then how come you're not trying to eat my face ?
I don't know !
I don't want to.
I couldn't hurt anybody.
But baby, I...
I really need to eat!
I am so freakin' hungry right now !
- I can't even eat regular food!
- So what do we do ?
- We find me
- something I can eat.
- That's it?
Yes !
It's not a big deal !
I'm sorry, uh, no big deal ?
Dude, you're a fucking zombie!
This is a huge deal.
All right, everybody, let's just calm down.
Craig, does that book say anything about food?
Page one.
All right!
Just listen.
I feel great.
All right ?
I feel good, I really do !
I just need to find myself some...
You know ?
So I'm gonna go to the store and get them.
We're coming with you.
Thank you.
No !
I'll go change.
This is bullshit.
He's not a zombie.
Of course he's not.
But I'm gonna call him on it.
If he wants brains, I will get him brains.
I'll even mash them up and I will spoon feed him if I have to.
But afterwards, he's gonna tell me what this is really about.
So... should I put this in the freezer?
Really, Craig ?
Maybe a stew ?
Look at this place, look at this!
This looks great !
OK.
Creative Meats.
Gross.
Don't be rude.
I didn't realize meat was a medium for expressing creativity.
Oh, dude !
What are ya...?
This place looks like a Civil War field hospital or something.
Craig, a little positive thinking.
Guys, look.
Skunk meat!
Fresh skunk meat!
You look like a gal with an adventurous palate.
You know, raccoon is more subtle than you might think, despite it's popular reputation as a garbage feeder.
Yes, ma'am, I do love me some 'coon meat!
Who doesn't ?
Actually, we're looking for something, a...
little off the menu.
Pardon me, sir, but this establishment does not condone the sale of illegal firearms.
I am but a simple butcher.
But, just out of curiosity, what type and calibre are we talking about?
No, actually, thank you.
Um, we're actually looking for some... brains.
And maybe some of that racoon meat.
What ?
He made it...
he made it sound kinda good.
Did I just hear you right, boy?
Did you just ask me for... brains?
Yes.
Well, hot dog!
I'm a brain man myself!
This is your lucky day, muchacho
I don't get as much call for brains, on account of the cholesterol.
But I'll tell ya,
I'll take me a mass of pan-fried calves' brains over a rack of ribs 10 out of 10!
- Ugh!
- Sure.
Ha-ha!
Me too.
These just came in this morning.
Oh-ho-ho!
This is messed up.
Yeah, I'm gonna be in the car.
Now, these little ones are appetizer size.
Great for holiday entertaining.
We got squirrel, muskrat, and those little ones there, them's rattlesnake.
Choice eating, those!
- May I ?
- I'm not big on free samples... but I don't get many chances to eat brains with a fellow gourmand, as it were, so...
Cheers.
Steve !
That's enough.
You're not actually gonna eat that, are you?
Oh, yeah.
I will be in the car.
Well, I guess it's a table for two, monsieur!
Unless...
Oh, no.
No, I'm good.
Yeah.
Just like a little candy, right, Stevie ?
They are delicious !
You like 'em raw, too!
A man after my own heart.
What are those ones there ?
Oh, these are simply divine!
Here we got skunk, owl, Canadian beaver, and rabbit.
Oh, rabbit!
Your favourite!
Too soon ?
And this... is la pièce de résistance.
This is genuine, Grade A, all-American grizzly bear brain.
It is to die for.
- It's beautiful.
- Grill this baby low and slow for--
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, he's gonna pay for that.
That's $19.99 a pound.
- Ahh.
Ahhh!
- So?
- How do you feel?
- OK.
You know what?
I feel OK.
We'll take it.
We'll take it all.
See that ?
Good as new.
You wanna kiss and make up ?
Pull over there.
You want to stay here?
Uh, listen.
Between the crazy glue and the painkillers for your foot, we have gone way over budget, OK?
So now we are roughing it.
- Don't even!
- Fine.
I like it rough.
Then don't moisturize your hand.
OK, but you have to spit on it.
I will glue that hand to your face!
Remove your hand.
- Kindly remove your hand right now.
- Give me a little.
That's real mature, Max.
You have pushed me to my limit.
Can you please not do that right now?
What ?
- Eat like a fuckin' zombie pig!
- Craig, you're not helping.
No.
I'm not, because I'm not a zombie collaborator.
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
YOU SHUT UP!
YOU SHUT UP!
- Ow!
What the fuck?
!
- Oh, my God!
- OK.
- Don't touch me right now!
Look, I know this is a lot to take in, but it's really
- gonna be OK.
- Really?
How?
- Yeah, how ?
- Here's an idea:
why don't we talk about this in the cabin?
Oh, no, I think we should talk about this on the way home.
- Yeah, I agree.
I'll start packing.
- Guys !
Wait!
- Great.
Thanks, Craig.
- Eat me!
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Would you two just please
- stop it!
- OK, damn it!
- I know that you're scared, all right?
I am too.
- I'm not afraid.
There's no reason for us to be treating each other like this.
Now, I'm starting to feel better.
The hunger's not so bad anymore.
Now, someone please tell me
- where are my snake brains are.
- They're in your hand.
- Which hand?
- The one in the car.
Oh, oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry, baby!
That's amazing!
I don't even feel that!
- What do you mean?
- I don't feel it.
At all.
- It doesn't hurt?
- Nope!
- Seriously?
- It's fine!
I'm OK!
- No pain?
- Uh-uh.
- Let's do that again.
- No!
- This is stupid!
- No, its actually pretty cool.
- OK, you could warn me next time.
- Oh, look, you, uh, dropped your little bag of snacks there.
Let me get that for ya.
- What the fuck, Craig!
- That was awesome!
- OK, that was a good one.
- No, but seriously, we should get you to a hospital.
- Why?
I mean, aside from the brains and a little numbness, I'm fine.
Besides, when it comes down to it, it's really just a dietary restriction.
- Yeah, it's like that chick I know, uh, what's her face?
Um, she's allergic to gluten and shit.
What's her face?
Fuck.
- It's me, you idiot!
Your wife?
I'm gluten intolerant!
- Steve,
I just want you to feel like yourself again.
- I do, Tina.
I feel great!
And you know what?
I'm happy.
And I'm in love with you.
- OK, we can stay.
- Seriously?
Am I the only one that sees a problem with this?
You can't feel pain!
You eat brains!
I don't even want to eat brains... that much.
Look, I promise, the first second that I feel bad, we'll go home.
All right?
Fine.
But for the record, this is a bad idea.
Lets just try to have some fun.

Oh, kill me!
That's it, we have to get him to the hospital.
He's fine.
Look at all the stuff he did today.
Tina, he's not a superhero :
he's undead!
- I think he's getting worse.
- How could this be worse?
Look.
Right here it says :
"The undead host must consume living
"human cerebral tissue.
Any dead or non-human tissue will eventually be rejected."
What are you talking about?
Animal brains are like junk food.
It's like he's yakking up zombie mini doughnuts.
Why didn't you tell us about this before?
What?
I hadn't gotten that far.
Look at how thick this bitch is !
Nooo, my Steve is gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK
- just in time for the wedding.
- Tina, if this keeps up, by next week we'll be at his funeral.
Oh, hey, buddy.
You get it all out?
Oh, my God, Steve.
You look like death!
That's it, Tina.
We have to take him to the hospital now!
Enough !
He's fine.
He's fine !
We are not taking him to some back-water hospital.
He's fine.
You just need some rest, right, baby ?
You just need some rest, that's all.
- Ahhh...
Ah !
- Oh, my God !
- Holy fuck, dude !
That is your ear !
- OK, I draw the line at things falling off my brother's face.
Craig, get the car.
- Finally.
See you guys, later.
- No, they're coming with us.
- Son of a fuck!
No!
We are not going anywhere!
Craig, go upstairs right now and get my cosmetic kit.
- Right.
- This is fucked.
- Honey, I see women that are way worse come into my salon, and you know what?
After I'm done with them, they're like, like new people!
- I'm in pretty bad shape, Tina.
- Look at me.
You and I are going to be doing the chicken dance with my Nonna at our wedding in one week.
OK ?
But right now my man looks like shit, so we have some work to do.
Sarah, go get me a paper towel.
- Tina, you're not seri--
- Now!
Craig,
I need you to take Steve's ear and rinse it off.
- Fuck that noise!
- Craig!
What's that?
Oh, it's eyelash adhesive.
Yeah.
- Oh--
- Oh!
What?
Just say they're piercings.
I'm not fucking touching it.
Ugh...
OK...
Heh-heh...
Now, just... hold... still.
OK?
And...
Ahhhhh!
Ahhh, I feel like Frankenstein.
Thank you for being so sweet.
Honey, I'm not giving up on you because of some eating disorder or, or a missing ear.
This wouldn't even turn a head at my family dinner table.
I love you, baby.
OK, now, stay straight.
You don't want to have crooked ears.
No. 'Cause my man has perfect ears.
As long as he looks fine for your fucking wedding.
Craig, can you come here for a sec ?
What?
- Hold this.
- Gross!
Don't move, either of you.
Sarah, can I talk to you in the other room for a second?
- You sure can.
- Great.
Whoa, wait.
Where are you guys going?
We'll be back.
So, uh... zombie dick?
Yeah, its pretty bad.
So, what now, Tina?
You want to talk about the fringe on my matron of honour dress?
All right, that is... it!
What the fuck?
!
You just punched my tit!
Come on, tough girl.
You got a problem with me?
Let's see what you-
- Oww!
Ow!
Jesus!
You punch like a man!
What the hell is your problem?
!
I just want us to get this out of our systems so that we can work together and help Steve.
So you punch me in the tit ?
!
What are you, 12 ?
You're kind of a bad ass, so I...
I needed an advantage.
Yeah?
Well, this bad ass is about to kick your ass!
If you're done playing zombie makeover with him, we can actually get him some god damn professional help.
What the...?
Yeah, and those people that came by, they seem like real humanitarians.
Tina !
Sarah !
Don't move that ear!
Yeah, Steve.
This is hot.
I'm sick of you and your Little Miss Perfect bullshit!
- Girls!
- Just a bit longer.
Don't you even!
Ah !
Stop it !
I hate you !
- You !
- Bitch !
- Emo slut !
- Plastic whore !
Enough !
Tina !
Try talking to Sarah!
- Fine!
Sarah, you're a bitch!
- Tina!
Stop using judgemental language, get to the heart of your conflict, and empathize with her point of view.
And Sarah, stop being so defensively aggressive and be an active listener.
OK.
Sarah, I know how much you love your brother, and I know that you don't think that I'm right for him.
But I love him.
Right now, he's Steve.
But if we don't come up with something, he's gonna turn into a monster.
He already is, you morons !
Look at him.
He needs... brains.
Ah, gross.
OK...
Craig is right.
Of course I'm right.
The book says I'm right.
And they're gonna have to be human too.
But maybe I just need a bit.
Just enough so that I can function.
What do you have in mind ?
I'm going to go into town.
I'm going to find somebody that won't be missed.
And I'm gonna eat their fucking brains.
Come on.
That's rich.
No, you're not.
- There's no way, Steve.
- What?
Honey, I just accidentally pulled your ear off.
You're in no condition to hunt.
Well, what then?
I have an idea.
Jesus!
Fff!
Look what you've done to our women, Steve.
And who the fuck packs hooker boots for a weekend
- at the cottage?
- I do, and you don't have to be involved if you're afraid.
- We're just afraid that you girls are gonna get into trouble.
- Honey, everything is gonna be fine.
- Family takes care of family.
Yeah, and we're family, all right--the fuckin' Manson family!
So what are you girls gonna do Bring back some sorry prick so he can eat him.
- Wow.
Thug life.
Great.
- Steve, if we get someone, can you go through with this?
I'm sure my zombie instincts will just kick in.
But get somebody really old.
Or like a real asshole.
How about a really old asshole?
Do you want a man or do you want a woman?
Oh.
A man.
Definitely.
I don't think I could eat a woman.
Gay.
Way to go, Steve.
You're the first gay-ass zombie.
You're really breaking a lot of ground this weekend.
Craig, shut up.
Seriously, we have to... we have to get someone that you're gonna hate so you can...
I dunno, kill them without remorse.
Like a...
like a pedophile or a meth dealer.
Or a hipster.
I really hate hipsters.
Or a parking cop.
I hate those bastards.
I hate the Portuguese.
Uh... um, anyways, you just need to make sure you're ready to do what you have to do when we come back.
- Craig'll help you get ready.
- What?
Fuck that!
Come on.
So, if, uh, things don't work out between you and Tina, and you decide to marry a gay zombie,
I do support your decision.
But I wont be at the reception, because I don't eat cock or brains.
- Yeah, you're hilarious there!
- Yeah, so I RSVP "no"
to gay zombie wedding.
Yup.
So long, Muffins.
This place reminds me of where my parents would take me camping every summer.
My father... sent me to a survival camp in the Philippines when I was nine.
They, uh, dropped me in the jungle in the middle of a monsoon.
I had to survive for seven days.
Your father did that to you?
It was my birthday.
I'm tellin' ya, though, those seven days...
made me tough.
Tough enough to take anything that comes my way.
Alive or undead.
Max, why do you hate zombies so much?
I mean, what if your mother turned into a zombie?
What would you do?
Shoot her in the face.
You would not shoot your mother in the face if she was in a coma.
No.
If she was in a coma, she wouldn't be trying to turn my head into a god damned fondue pot.
Right.
Well, if we find this resistant host, we could find a vaccine.
You'd be a hero, Max.
You're right, I am a god damn hero.
I'm tired of waiting for your orb to tell us what to do.
We're gonna do this my way!
Where are we going?
To get some bait.
Him ?
He looks old.
- Kinda.
- He looks like he could have Alzheimer's.
- Is that contagious ?
- This is just evil !
Suck it up, Sarah.
Your brother needs us.
Look.
Soul patch.
- That guy's a douche for sure.
- He's too fat.
He's like a walking bucket of chicken.
I'm gonna throw up.
Sarah, you need to take that terrified look off your face,
OK ?
We're not gonna get anyone unless you throw out a certain vibe.
- What kind of vibe?
- Watch and learn.
Wow.
That's sexy.
I know, right?
OK, now you try.
Relax, throw your shoulders back, and wipe that look off your face.
OK, how's this look?
- Like you're having a pap smear.
- Ugh!
This isn't going to work!
We can do this, Sarah!
I just don't know how we're gonna pick somebody.
We'll figure it out.
You know, just keep our eyes open and eventually somebody'll just end up in our laps.
Oh, my God!
- What the fuck!
My car!
- Tina.
Look.
Big scary guy is checking us out.
Hi.
Huh.
That big scary guy is a dead man.
Hey.
Are you crazy?
She's crazy.
OK.
So, apparently, eight bones make up the neurocranium.
So it's like a bone vault for the brain and brain stem.
This part over here is the parietal.
So, this little sucker is like a quarter of an inch thick and hard as shit.
All right, so you're gonna have to Babe Ruth smash the shit out of this thing so you can have access to the cerebral cortex.
Got it.
Oh, that smells good.
Mmm!
- What the fuck, dude!
- What?
You just smelled my fucking brain!
No.
Let's not jump to conclusions here.
No, all right, you're a fucking monster!
- Craig!
- Just stay the fuck away from me, all right?
Gay-ass zombie!
God damn!
Wow!
That is so... hot!
My, uh... woman parts like you too.
Ha-ha-ha...
Ugh, how is he still standing?
He's had enough booze to knock out a rhino!
Don't worry, it's OK.
I havea plan.
Just get him in the back seat.
Are you fucking joking me?
No fucking way!
- Don't worry, he's harmless.
- Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, my God!
- Come on!
I need you to suck it up, and be sexy, and get him in the back seat!
Come on!
Go!
Get outta here!
Hey... big man.
So... so, you wanna, you wanna go for a ride?
Stud monkey.
You make Mommy so horny!
What?
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Go ahead, get in.
Hey, there.
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa--
- Ahhh!
You have a pink
- stun gun?
- Yeah.
It's cute, right?
OK, lets go!
I'll drive!
Wait!
What about me?
- Pizza, pizza, pizza!
Ha-ho!
Pizza!
Pizza, pizza!
Max.
Pizza, pizza, pizza!
Ha-ha!
Evening, young lady.
Hello!
Are you, uh, Captain Cletus?
Where's the pizza?
The...
No, uh, sorry.
We are actually here for something else.
Ma'am, if you are implying I might be in possession of illegal firearms, I will kindly ask you to leave--
No, we don't want guns, Admiral Redneck.
- We need brains.
- Uh...
Max.
Ya'll have
- a good night, now.
- No wait, OK,
- all we want is brains.
- Sorry, Missy, no can do.
- Somebody cleaned me out earlier today.
- Who?
- Bunch of kids.
Now beat it.
- No, wait!
Can you tell us anything else about them?
Couple o' pretty-looking ladies was hanging with some queer-looking feller and another that couldn't get enough of my brains!
Now, git!
That's our zombie, Penny.
Come on.
The cottage!
No, Max, wait!
If the infected one hasn't eaten the others yet, it must mean that he's resisting the infection!
Which is wonderful!
Shit!
Where is that cottage?
Hey, man, did you order the Vegetarian Nightmare?
Extra Polish sausage, German sausage, Belgian Sausage,
- Russian sausage--
- Nope.
Fuckin' hate this job.
Oh, God.
Ugh!
OK.
Oh, God.
Ugh!
What the hell!
I have been worried sick!
Shut up, Steve!
Oh, baby, you look kinda better, that's good, but shut up.
You need to help us carry this in.
This is ridiculous.
We need a dolly or something.
Where's Craig?
Uh...
sleeping, I think.
- Sleeping?
!
- What?
- Yeah!
I can help.
- OK.
- Come on.
OK, I'll take his legs, or--
- Oh, my God!
How did you get this guy?
!
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Holy crap!
This is ridiculous!
- Are you girls pulling?
- Oh, my God!
Fuckin' freak family.
OK, we softened him up for you.
That guy is huge!
I know, honey, but he's out cold.
- Are you ready?
- Oh this is crazy.
- You girls just kidnapped a guy!
- And now you're gonna eat him!
OK, listen to me.
This is very important.
This is our new lifestyle, OK?
And if we're gonna walk down the aisle together, then we both just need to embrace this.
OK, all right.
He's all tied up and he's still out of it.
I wouldn't wait too long.
All right.
I'm gonna go downstairs and eat this guy!
- OK.
- Thank you!
You've both have been so incredible.
I'm so happy to see the two of you working together so well.
You know, I think if this weekend has taught us anything--
- Steve, just GO!
- Wah!
- Love you!
- Wait, wait, wait!
Here!
- Oh, my God!
Boots are killing me!
- Oof!
Ugh!
OK...
- I can smell his undead ass.
- Max, we haven't gotten a reading from the orb.
We've been driving around in circles for hours.
OK, you have all the bells and whistles in here.
You have this!
Who do you even talk to in this?
And yet you don't have a NAV system!
I don't need a fucking computer.
I'm a fucking professional!
I can feel when they're close by.
I don't need a fucking piece of technology.
You're a stone-cold killer.
- You're a stone-cold killer.
You're a stone-cold killer.
- Get it.
- You're a stone-cold--
- Hello?
- Hey.
Uh, y-you guys came by my place today.
It's my friend, he's turned into a zombie.
OK, uh, uh, calm down, and, uh, where are you?
Uh, it's 42 Clear Lake Drive.
- 42 Clear Lake Drive.
- Who is it?
- Oh, we're close!
- Who is it?
!
you're just going to do tests, you're not gonna hurt him?
- Your gonna make him back to normal again, right?
- Of course.
- He's gonna be in good hands--
- You're fucking right he'll be in good hands.
Who the fuck is this?
- Who the fuck is this?
- Hey, calm the fuck down, pal.
- I don't want to calm the fuck down.
Fuck you, fucker!
You calm the fuck down!
- You fucking relax!
- No, you go fuck yourself and get the fuck over here, you fucker!
No, you fuck yourself, you fuck!
Fuck you.
Fuck!
FUUUUUUUCK!
- Max!
Max, really?
Those things practically have feelings.
Not anymore.
That's stupid.
Mmm... no.
Just do it!
What the hell are you guys doing with all those guns?
Hey there, pumpkin.
Nice of you to call us about your little friend-- 12 hours too late.
You promised me you weren't gonna hurt him.
No, no, no.
No, no, we won't hurt him, OK?
We promise.
Right, Max?
We won't hurt him.
You stay here with sugar tits.
I got this one.
No, wait, Max.
Max, this one is different.
OK, we cannot waste this opportunity.
It'd be like throwing away the cure for cancer.
OK, Max, listen!
No, you listen!
Zombies are good for only one thing:
killing'.
Max, we need this guy, OK?
No, no!
- Christ.
- No, no, no, no!
I don't need anybody.
This orb was centuries... old.
Lady, fuck your orb, all right?
Make sure that maniac doesn't hurt my friend!
Where is he?
- No, you don't understand!
- Don't you touch my brother!
Where is he?
!
Sorry, pal.
Open the door!
- Open the door!
Open the door!
- No!
- Open the door!
Open the door!
- No!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Girls!
Girls!
Open the door!
Ah!
- Is that--
- Yes!
It is.
You promised me you weren't gonna hurt him!
- Wait!
You called them?
!
- Uh-oh.
Awkward.
Hey!
- What the hell is that?
- Oh, just hundreds of years of mystical antiquity that you selfishly discar--
Oh, for Christ's sake, Penny, get over it!
- I wanna say goodbye to him.
- No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's...
it's pretty messy.
Thank you so much for coming.
I don't know what we would have done without you.
Well, luckily, Little Miss Braveheart over here, she had the good sense to give us a call when she did.
Way to go, pumpkin.
Now you can sew a big, fat "Courage" badge on your Girl Scout sash.
Great big badge in the shape of a lion, giving you two thumbs up.
How about that, huh?
'Cause you are such a mature young woman.
You may even get asked to the junior prom where you can get fingered
- in the cafetorium, right next--
- You know what?
Fuck you, asshole!
All right?
That was my best friend!
And we are so sorry for your loss, and we will personally--
You know what?
Why are you OK with this?
Your brother's dead!
You're right!
It's, it's, it's horrible!
You, you monsters!
Get the fuck out of here!
Yes, yes, yeah, yeah!
You know what?
You guys are animals!
Leave now!
- OK, you're right.
Let's blow, Penny.
- I'm sorry.
What the fuck?
!
Hi.
Holy fuck, Steve!
You're OK!
Did you see me?
I was fucking crying
- and everything!
Did you see?
- Nice try, zombie.
Now, get read to say your prayers... in hell!
- No!
- Get out of the way.
No!
You are not gonna shoot him, because we are getting married in six days!
- Don't make me shoot through ya.
- No!
Don't you see?
- He's not a complete zombie!
He's still human!
- Max, you idiot!
Don't you see this is it?
He's resisting the infection.
This is our chance to find the cure!
Oh, yeah, sure, you'd like that, wouldn't ya?
A nice little guinea pig that you can study and make everything all better.
Then everybody gets booster shots and lollipops and there are no more zombies.
Let me tell you something, sister.
The only shot that cures a zombie comes out of the end of this sweet little baby right here.
Suck it up, brain junkie,
- 'cause you ain't getting a lolli after this one.
- No!
Get off me, you bitch.
- Happy honeymoon.
- Ah!
Shit!
Whoa!
Hey!
- Do it, Steve!
- Yeah, eat that fucker's head!
Oh, God, messy fucker.
I can't do this.
Ah... it's time to face the fact that I'm, uh, whatever this is.
And whatever this is is not safe to be around.
Oh, Steve, dude, seriously, I am so sorry I called you a gay-ass zombie all right?
We can put you on an island somewhere, all right?
Somewhere far away.
We'll come visit, like at Christmas and shit, right?
Steve, think about this.
Sarah, I can't be this selfish.
I can't go on having people in my life be accessory
- to murder.
- No, Steve!
- No!
- You'll take care of her, yeah?
Steve, please, give me the gun.
I am so sorry, Tina.
I really wish I could be there for all of it-- for the chicken dance with your Nonna, eating our wedding cake, seeing you in your dress.
I love you.
I love you, Steve.
All right.
Where do you wanna do this?
You want to, uh... go around the back?
Or what do you wanna do?
Max, let's talk about this!
Whoa!
Here?
!
Really?
!
Now?
!
Are you sure?
!
I just want you to know, of all the zombies I've encountered, you're... the most human.
Please.
Not in front of my girl.
- All right.
- Oh!
The only good zombie...
is a dead zom--
Shit...
I was aiming for his leg.
Holy fuck, lady!
You just, like, totally wasted your boyfriend!
He was not my boyfriend.
He was the muscle.
OK, Steve?
Steve.
Here's how it is.
Um...
I could put you down right now, if that's what you want me to do.
Or, you can come with me, and we can see if we can't find a cure for this, uh, this thing.
Now, I-I-I can't promise any thing, b-b-but
I will use all of my resources, I will work day and night,
I will use my education until we find a way to beat this infection.
Oh, and, and when we're done with this and we find a cure...
you'll be a hero.
Really?
I'll be a hero.
But, uh, but you'll be a celebrity, which is...
pretty much as good.
Dude, we are gonna be famous!
So, what do you say, Steve?
- All right, I'll--
- Ahh!
Baby!
Are you all right?
You fucking moron!
We're safe now.
- Everything is gonna be fine!
- You are a fucking moron!
She was gonna help us.
She was gonna help Steve!
- You ruined everything!
- She was gonna hurt him, Craig!
OK?
!
She wanted to use him for experiments!
No, we were gonna be celebrities!
On the internet!
Or at least on fucking TV!
Everything was gonna be fine!
EVERYTHING IS FINE!
FUCK!
Look at Steve!
Steve!
You're all... happy!
- Hi, Tina.
- Oh!
Hi, baby.
Everything is gonna be OK.
We are gonna get married, we are gonna be happy, and we are gonna be fine.
I think I may have fucked up a little bit at the end there, but its OK, 'cause we made it!
Baby.
- I love you.
- I love brains!

OK, I need you to focus.

Ready?
A?
Or B?

A?
- Oh, my God, I'm so happy that you said that, 'cause otherwise I would have had to order in the yellow orchids from Thailand, and
I think they almost look the same.
- Almost.
Why don't you put that away for now, Tina?
You did promise you were gonna have fun this weekend.
- You're sweet.
I promise to have fun.

That's not the itinerary for the weekend.

I guess I'm just feeling overwhelmed.
I know that 300 people may seem like a small guest list.

I've had to make a lot of compromises for this wedding, which I'm happy to do, but I just want this to be a special day for both of us.

I promise you.
No doubt in my mind.

Roll over.

It's cute.

I never thought my matron of honour would snore louder than my husband, but...

Pecan pie!
Mmm!
Pecan pie!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Yeah!
This is so delicious!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Damn it!
I want brains.
Ugh!
Oh, God!
I'm a zombie!
I'm a god damned zombie.
Tina's gonna kill me.
[Stomach rumbling]
[Heartbeat]
No.
Yes.
Groovy.
Ouch!
Ahhhh...
Whew!

Oh.
I don't know, Muffins.
Maybe I should just give up, turn myself in.
I'm a pretty crappy zombie.
Come here.
Come here, big guy.
Ohhhh.
Are you scared?
Sorry I scared you, buddy.
You thought I was going to eat you, didn't you?
Yeah, you thought I was going to eat you.
You thought I was going to eat your brain!
[Muffins squeaking] [Crunching]
[Door opening and closing] - [Craig]:
Wooo!
- [Tina]:
Did you take your fucking adrenaline?
- Steve.
- [Tina]:
I don't know how you think you're gonna eat an entire watermelon--
[Tina gasps]
- Hi!
- Let me get this straight.
You think that you are a zombie?
- Little bit.
- Tina, this is ridiculous!
Look at the pressure that you're putting on him for this stupid wedding!
- What?
!
My rabbit just died!
- Oh, God, it was a glorified rat!
- Stop it!
You heard the guy in the driveway.
They said they were looking for me.
- Oh, God.
- Steve, this is the real world,
OK?
That guy was a psycho.
There are no such thing as zombies!
- Then how do you explain the brains?
Ugh!
Damn it!
- Oh, my God.
Gross!
My fiancé doesn't eat brains.
- Ugh.
Can we please not say that word?
- Actually, I think he does eat... brains.
- Ugh.
- Exhibit fuckin' A.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Steve, we are getting married, and you are just freaking out.
Lots of men do this before the big day.
- Honey, I obviously have a problem here.
- You have a problem?
I have a problem!
Do you know how many people are coming to our wedding?
How many meals I've skipped to fit into that $5,000 dress?
And now my fiancé tells me that he doesn't want to marry me by killing my rabbit!
- Baby, listen to me.
I love you.
Of course
I'm going to marry you!
This isn't cold feet.
I'm sick!
- Really?
Really, Steve?
OK, if you're a zombie, then how come you're not trying to eat my face?
- I don't know!
I don't want to.
I couldn't hurt anybody.
But baby, I...
I really need to eat!
I am so freakin' hungry right now!
I can't even eat regular food!
- So what do we do?
- We find me something I can eat.
- That's it?
- Yes!
It's not a big deal!
- I'm sorry, uh, no big deal?
Dude, you're a fucking zombie!
This is a huge deal.
- All right, everybody, let's just calm down.
Craig, does that book say anything about food?
- Page one.
- Mmm!
All right!
Just listen.
I feel great.
All right?
I feel good, I really do!
I just need to find myself some...
Mmm!
You know?
So I'm gonna go to the store and get them.
- We're coming with you.
- Thank you.
- No!
- I'll go change.
- This is bullshit.
He's not a zombie.
- Of course he's not.
But I'm gonna call him on it.
If he wants brains, I will get him brains.
I'll even mash them up and I will spoon feed him if I have to.
But afterwards, he's gonna tell me what this is really about.
- So... should I put this in the freezer?
- Really, Craig?
- Maybe a stew?
- [Steve]:
Look at this place, look at this!
This looks great!
- [Tina]:
Um...
OK.
- [Sarah]:
Creative Meats.
Gross.
- [Tina]:
Ew.
- [Steve]:
Don't be rude.
- [Sarah]:
I didn't realize meat was a medium for expressing creativity.
[Tina sighs]
- Oh, dude!
What are ya...?
Whoa.
This place looks like a Civil War field hospital or something.
- Craig, a little positive thinking.
- Guys, look.
Skunk meat!
- Fresh skunk meat!
- [All]:
Ah!
- You look like a gal with an adventurous palate.
You know, raccoon is more subtle than you might think, despite it's popular reputation as a garbage feeder.
Yes, ma'am, I do love me some 'coon meat!
- Who doesn't?
Ha-ha-ha-ha...
- Actually, we're looking for something, a...
little off the menu.
- Pardon me, sir, but this establishment does not condone the sale of illegal firearms.
I am but a simple butcher.
But, just out of curiosity, what type and calibre are we talking about?
- Ohhh.
No, actually, thank you.
Um, we're actually looking for some... brains.
- And maybe some of that racoon meat.
- Eww!
- What?
He made it...
he made it sound kinda good.
- Did I just hear you right, boy?
Did you just ask me for... brains?
- Yes.
- Well, hot dog!
I'm a brain man myself!
Wa-hooo!
This is your lucky day, muchacho
I don't get as much call for brains, on account of the cholesterol.
But I'll tell ya,
I'll take me a mass of pan-fried calves' brains over a rack of ribs 10 out of 10!
- Ugh!
- Sure.
Ha-ha!
Me too.
- These just came in this morning.
- Oh-ho-ho!
This is messed up.
- Yeah, I'm gonna be in the car.
- Now, these little ones are appetizer size.
Great for holiday entertaining.
We got squirrel, muskrat, and those little ones there, them's rattlesnake.
Choice eating, those!
[Steve gulps]
- May I?
- I'm not big on free samples... but I don't get many chances to eat brains with a fellow gourmand, as it were, so...
Cheers.
- Steve!
That's enough.
You're not actually gonna eat that, are you?
- Oh, yeah.
- I will be in the car.
- Well, I guess it's a table for two, monsieur!
Unless...
- Oh, no.
No, I'm good.
Yeah.
- Mmm!
- Just like a little candy, right, Stevie?
- They are delicious!
- You like 'em raw, too!
A man after my own heart.
Mmm!
- What are those ones there?
- Oh, these are simply divine!
Here we got skunk, owl, Canadian beaver, and rabbit.
- Oh, rabbit!
Your favourite!
Too soon?
- Mm...
- And this... is la pièce de résistance.
This is genuine, Grade A, all-American grizzly bear brain.
It is to die for.
- It's beautiful.
- Grill this baby low and slow for--
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, he's gonna pay for that.
That's $19.99 a pound.
- Ahh.
Ahhh!
- So?
How do you feel?
- OK.
You know what?
I feel OK.
- We'll take it.
We'll take it all.
- Yeah!
Ha-ha-ha!
- See that?
Good as new.
You wanna kiss and make up?
- Pull over there.
- You want to stay here?
- Uh, listen.
Between the crazy glue and the painkillers for your foot, we have gone way over budget, OK?
So now we are roughing it.
Don't even!
- Fine.
I like it rough.
- Then don't moisturize your hand.
- OK, but you have to spit on it.
- I will glue that hand to your face!
[Max laughing] Remove your hand.
Kindly remove your hand right now.
- Give me a little.
- That's real mature, Max.
[Max laughing]
You have pushed me to my limit.
- Can you please not do that right now?
- What?
- Eat like a fuckin' zombie pig!
- Craig, you're not helping.
- No.
I'm not, because I'm not a zombie collaborator.
- SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
YOU SHUT UP!
YOU SHUT UP!
- Ow!
What the fuck?
!
- Oh, my God!
- OK.
- Don't touch me right now!
- Look, I know this is a lot to take in, but it's really gonna be OK.
- Really?
How?
- Yeah, how?
- Here's an idea:
why don't we talk about this in the cabin?
- Oh, no, I think we should talk about this on the way home.
- Yeah, I agree.
I'll start packing.
- Guys!
Wait!
Great.
Thanks, Craig.
- Eat me!
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Would you two just please stop it!
- OK, damn it!
I know that you're scared, all right?
I am too.
- I'm not afraid.
- There's no reason for us to be treating each other like this.
Now, I'm starting to feel better.
The hunger's not so bad anymore.
Now, someone please tell me where are my snake brains are.
- They're in your hand.
- Which hand?
- The one in the car.
[Tina gasps]
- Oh, oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry, baby!
- That's amazing!
I don't even feel that!
- [Sarah]:
What do you mean?
- I don't feel it.
At all.
- It doesn't hurt?
- Nope!
- Seriously?
- It's fine!
I'm OK!
- [Craig]:
No pain?
- Uh-uh.
- Let's do that again.
- No!
- This is stupid!
- No, its actually pretty cool.
- OK, you could warn me next time.
- Oh, look, you, uh, dropped your little bag of snacks there.
Let me get that for ya.
- What the fuck, Craig!
- That was awesome!
- OK, that was a good one.
- No, but seriously, we should get you to a hospital.
- Why?
I mean, aside from the brains and a little numbness, I'm fine.
Besides, when it comes down to it, it's really just a dietary restriction.
- Yeah, it's like that chick I know, uh, what's her face?
Um, she's allergic to gluten and shit.
What's her face?
Fuck.
- It's me, you idiot!
Your wife?
I'm gluten intolerant!
- Steve,
I just want you to feel like yourself again.
- I do, Tina.
I feel great!
And you know what?
I'm happy.
And I'm in love with you.
- Ugh...
[Craig gags]
- OK, we can stay.
- Seriously?
Am I the only one that sees a problem with this?
You can't feel pain!
You eat brains!
- I don't even want to eat brains... that much.
Look, I promise, the first second that I feel bad, we'll go home.
All right?
- Fine.
But for the record, this is a bad idea.
- Lets just try to have some fun.
- Oh!

[Continuous retching]
[Steve groaning] - [Steve]:
Oh, kill me!
- That's it, we have to get him to the hospital.
- He's fine.
Look at all the stuff he did today.
- Tina, he's not a superhero;
he's undead!
I think he's getting worse.
- How could this be worse?
- Look.
Right here it says:
"The undead host must consume living
"human cerebral tissue.
Any dead or non-human tissue will eventually be rejected."
- Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?
- Animal brains are like junk food.
It's like he's yakking up zombie mini doughnuts.
- Why didn't you tell us about this before?
- What?
I hadn't gotten that far.
Look at how thick this bitch is!
- Nooo, my Steve is gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK just in time for the wedding.
- Tina, if this keeps up, by next week we'll be at his funeral.
- Oh, hey, buddy.
You get it all out?
- Oh, my God, Steve.
You look like death!
That's it, Tina.
We have to take him to the hospital now!
- Enough!
He's fine.
He's fine!
We are not taking him to some back-water hospital.
He's fine.
You just need some rest, right, baby?
You just need some rest, that's all.
[She gasps]
- Ahhh...
Ah!
- Oh, my God!
- Holy fuck, dude!
That is your ear!
- OK, I draw the line at things falling off my brother's face.
Craig, get the car.
- Finally.
See you guys, later.
- No, they're coming with us.
- Son of a fuck!
- No!
We are not going anywhere!
Craig, go upstairs right now and get my cosmetic kit.
- Right.
- This is fucked.
- Honey, I see women that are way worse come into my salon, and you know what?
After I'm done with them, they're like, like new people!
- I'm in pretty bad shape, Tina.
- Look at me.
You and I are going to be doing the chicken dance with my Nonna at our wedding in one week.
OK?
But right now my man looks like shit, so we have some work to do.
Sarah, go get me a paper towel.
- Tina, you're not seri--
- Now!
Craig,
I need you to take Steve's ear and rinse it off.
- Fuck that noise!
- [Sarah]:
Craig!
[He grumbles]
- What's that?
- Oh, it's eyelash adhesive.
Yeah.
- Oh--
- Oh!
[Laughing nervously]
- What?
Just say they're piercings.
I'm not fucking touching it.
- Ugh...
OK...
Heh-heh...
Now, just... hold... still.
OK?
And...
[Stapling]
- Ugh!
- Ahhhhh!
Ahhh, I feel like Frankenstein.
Thank you for being so sweet.
- Honey, I'm not giving up on you because of some eating disorder or, or a missing ear.
This wouldn't even turn a head at my family dinner table.
- I love you, baby.
- OK, now, stay straight.
You don't want to have crooked ears.
No. 'Cause my man has perfect ears.
- As long as he looks fine for your fucking wedding.
- Craig, can you come here for a sec?
- What?
- Hold this.
- Gross!
- Don't move, either of you.
Sarah, can I talk to you in the other room for a second?
- You sure can.
- Great.
- Whoa, wait.
Where are you guys going?
- [Sarah]:
We'll be back.
- So, uh... zombie dick?
- Yeah, its pretty bad.
- So, what now, Tina?
You want to talk about the fringe on my matron of honour dress?
- All right, that is... it!
- What the fuck?
!
You just punched my tit!
- Come on, tough girl.
You got a problem with me?
Let's see what you-
- Oww!
Ow!
Jesus!
You punch like a man!
- What the hell is your problem?
!
- I just want us to get this out of our systems so that we can work together and help Steve.
- So you punch me in the tit?
!
What are you, 12?
- You're kind of a bad ass, so I...
I needed an advantage.
- Yeah?
Well, this bad ass is about to kick your ass!
If you're done playing zombie makeover with him, we can actually get him some god damn professional help.
[Tina screams]
- What the...?
- Yeah, and those people that came by, they seem like real humanitarians.
- Tina!
Sarah!
- Don't move that ear!
- Yeah, Steve.
This is hot.
- I'm sick of you and your Little Miss Perfect bullshit!
- Ugh!
- Girls!
- Just a bit longer.
- Don't you even!
Ah!
Stop it!
[Tina shrieking]
I hate you!
[Yelling]
You!
- Bitch!
[Shrieking]
[Yelling in pain]
- Emo slut!
- Plastic whore!
[Steve growling]
[Steve roaring]
- Enough!
Tina!
Try talking to Sarah!
- Fine!
Sarah, you're a bitch!
- Tina!
Stop using judgemental language, get to the heart of your conflict, and empathize with her point of view.
And Sarah, stop being so defensively aggressive and be an active listener.
- OK.
Sarah, I know how much you love your brother, and I know that you don't think that I'm right for him.
But I love him.
Right now, he's Steve.
But if we don't come up with something, he's gonna turn into a monster.
- He already is, you morons!
Look at him.
He needs... brains.
- Ugh.
- Ah, gross.
- OK...
Craig is right.
- Of course I'm right.
The book says I'm right.
- And they're gonna have to be human too.
But maybe I just need a bit.
Just enough so that I can function.
- What do you have in mind?
- I'm going to go into town.
I'm going to find somebody that won't be missed.
And I'm gonna eat their fucking brains.
[Tina, Craig, and Sarah laughing]
- Come on.
- [Craig]:
That's rich.
- No, you're not.
- There's no way, Steve.
- What?
- Honey, I just accidentally pulled your ear off.
You're in no condition to hunt.
- Well, what then?
- I have an idea.
- Jesus!
Fff!
Look what you've done to our women, Steve.
And who the fuck packs hooker boots for a weekend at the cottage?
- I do, and you don't have to be involved if you're afraid.
- We're just afraid that you girls are gonna get into trouble.
- Honey, everything is gonna be fine.
- Family takes care of family.
- Yeah, and we're family, all right--the fuckin' Manson family!
So what are you girls gonna do Bring back some sorry prick so he can eat him.
- Wow.
Thug life.
Great.
- Steve, if we get someone, can you go through with this?
- I'm sure my zombie instincts will just kick in.
But get somebody really old.
Or like a real asshole.
- How about a really old asshole?
- Do you want a man or do you want a woman?
- Oh.
A man.
Definitely.
I don't think I could eat a woman.
- Gay.
Way to go, Steve.
You're the first gay-ass zombie.
You're really breaking a lot of ground this weekend.
- Craig, shut up.
Seriously, we have to... we have to get someone that you're gonna hate so you can...
I dunno, kill them without remorse.
Like a...
like a pedophile or a meth dealer.
- Or a hipster.
I really hate hipsters.
- Or a parking cop.
I hate those bastards.
- I hate the Portuguese.
Uh... um, anyways, you just need to make sure you're ready to do what you have to do when we come back.
- Craig'll help you get ready.
- What?
Fuck that!
- Come on.
[Sarah sighs]
- So, if, uh, things don't work out between you and Tina, and you decide to marry a gay zombie,
I do support your decision.
But I wont be at the reception, because I don't eat cock or brains.
- Yeah, you're hilarious there!
- Yeah, so I RSVP "no"
to gay zombie wedding.
Yup.
So long, Muffins.
- This place reminds me of where my parents would take me camping every summer.
- My father... sent me to a survival camp in the Philippines when I was nine.
They, uh, dropped me in the jungle in the middle of a monsoon.
I had to survive for seven days.
- Your father did that to you?
- It was my birthday.
I'm tellin' ya, though, those seven days...
made me tough.
Tough enough to take anything that comes my way.
Alive or undead.
- Max, why do you hate zombies so much?
I mean, what if your mother turned into a zombie?
What would you do?
- Shoot her in the face.
- You would not shoot your mother in the face if she was in a coma.
- No.
If she was in a coma, she wouldn't be trying to turn my head into a god damned fondue pot.
- Right.
Well, if we find this resistant host, we could find a vaccine.
You'd be a hero, Max.
- You're right, I am a god damn hero.
I'm tired of waiting for your orb to tell us what to do.
We're gonna do this my way!
- Uh, where are we going?
- To get some bait.
♪
- Him?
He looks old.
Kinda.
- He looks like he could have Alzheimer's.
Is that contagious?
- This is just evil!
- Suck it up, Sarah.
Your brother needs us.
- Look.
Soul patch.
That guy's a douche for sure.
- He's too fat.
He's like a walking bucket of chicken.
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Sarah, you need to take that terrified look off your face,
OK?
We're not gonna get anyone unless you throw out a certain vibe.
- What kind of vibe?
- Watch and learn.
- Wow.
That's sexy.
- I know, right?
OK, now you try.
Relax, throw your shoulders back, and wipe that look off your face.
- OK, how's this look?
- Like you're having a pap smear.
- Ugh!
This isn't going to work!
- We can do this, Sarah!
- I just don't know how we're gonna pick somebody.
- We'll figure it out.
You know, just keep our eyes open and eventually somebody'll just end up in our laps.
[Growling]
- Oh, my God!
- What the fuck!
My car!
- Tina.
Look.
[Chuckling]
Big scary guy is checking us out.
Hi.
[Chuckling]
- Huh.
That big scary guy is a dead man.
Hey.
- Are you crazy?
She's crazy.
- OK.
So, apparently, eight bones make up the neurocranium.
So it's like a bone vault for the brain and brain stem.
This part over here is the parietal.
So, this little sucker is like a quarter of an inch thick and hard as shit.
All right, so you're gonna have to Babe Ruth smash the shit out of this thing so you can have access to the cerebral cortex.
- Got it.
Oh, that smells good.
Mmm!
- What the fuck, dude!
- What?
- You just smelled my fucking brain!
- No.
Let's not jump to conclusions here.
No, all right, you're a fucking monster!

- Just stay the fuck away from me, all right?
Gay-ass zombie!

No, uh, sorry.
We are actually here for something else.
- Ma'am, if you are implying I might be in possession of illegal firearms, I will kindly ask you to leave--
- No, we don't want guns, Admiral Redneck.
We need brains.
- Uh...
Max.
[Gun cocked]
- Ya'll have a good night, now.
- No wait, OK, all we want is brains.

- Bunch of kids.
Now beat it.

Now, git!
- That's our zombie, Penny.
Come on.
- The cottage!
No, Max, wait!

- OK, we softened him up for you.
- That guy is huge!
- I know, honey, but he's out cold.
Are you ready?
- Oh this is crazy.
You girls just kidnapped a guy!
- [Sarah]:
And now you're gonna eat him!
- OK, listen to me.
This is very important.
This is our new lifestyle, OK?
And if we're gonna walk down the aisle together, then we both just need to embrace this.
- OK, all right.
He's all tied up and he's still out of it.
I wouldn't wait too long.
- All right.
I'm gonna go downstairs and eat this guy!
- [Sarah and Tina]:
OK.
- Thank you!
You've both have been so incredible.
I'm so happy to see the two of you working together so well.
You know, I think if this weekend has taught us anything--
- Steve, just GO!
- Wah!
- Love you!
- Wait, wait, wait!
Here!
- Oh, my God!
Boots are killing me!
- Oof!
Ugh!
OK...
- I can smell his undead ass.
- Max, we haven't gotten a reading from the orb.
We've been driving around in circles for hours.
OK, you have all the bells and whistles in here.
You have this!
Who do you even talk to in this?
And yet you don't have a NAV system!
- I don't need a fucking computer.
I'm a fucking professional!
I can feel when they're close by.
I don't need a fucking piece of technology.
- [Ring tone]:
You're a stone-cold killer.
- You're a stone-cold killer.
You're a stone-cold killer.
- Get it.
- You're a stone-cold--
- Hello?
- Hey.
Uh, y-you guys came by my place today.
It's my friend, he's turned into a zombie.
- OK, uh, uh, calm down, and, uh, where are you?
- Uh, it's 42 Clear Lake Drive.
- 42 Clear Lake Drive.
- Who is it?
- Oh, we're close!
- Who is it?
!
you're just going to do tests, you're not gonna hurt him?
Your gonna make him back to normal again, right?
- Of course.
He's gonna be in good hands--
- You're fucking right he'll be in good hands.
Who the fuck is this?
- Who the fuck is this?
- Hey, calm the fuck down, pal.
- I don't want to calm the fuck down.
Fuck you, fucker!
You calm the fuck down!
- You fucking relax!
- No, you go fuck yourself and get the fuck over here, you fucker!
- No, you fuck yourself, you fuck!
- Fuck you.
- Fuck!
FUUUUUUUCK!
- Max!
Max, really?
[Gunshot]
Those things practically have feelings.
- Not anymore.
- Ha!
[Laughing]
That's stupid.
Mmm... no.
[Grunting]
Just do it!
Mmm.
- Hey.
- What the hell are you guys doing with all those guns?
- Hey there, pumpkin.
Nice of you to call us about your little friend-- 12 hours too late.
- You promised me you weren't gonna hurt him.
- No, no, no.
No, no, we won't hurt him, OK?
We promise.
Right, Max?
We won't hurt him.
- You stay here with sugar tits.
I got this one.
- No, wait, Max.
Max, this one is different.
OK, we cannot waste this opportunity.
It'd be like throwing away the cure for cancer.
OK, Max, listen!
- No, you listen!
Zombies are good for only one thing:
killing'.
- Max, we need this guy, OK?
[Penny gasps]
- No, no!
- Christ.
- [Penny]:
No, no, no, no!
- I don't need anybody.
[He groans]
Mmm...
- This orb was centuries... old.
- Lady, fuck your orb, all right?
Make sure that maniac doesn't hurt my friend!
[Door busted open] - [Max]:
Where is he?
- No, you don't understand!
- Don't you touch my brother!
- Where is he?
!
- Sorry, pal.
[Grunting with effort]
[Yelling]
- Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the door!
- No!
- Open the door!
Open the door!
- [Sarah and Tina]:
No!
- Open the door!
Open the door!
Girls!
Girls!
Open the door!
Ah!
[Big man growling]
[Yelling] [Gunshot]
- Is that--
- Yes!
It is.
- You promised me you weren't gonna hurt him!
- Wait!
You called them?
!
- Uh-oh.
Awkward.
Hey!
What the hell is that?
- Oh, just hundreds of years of mystical antiquity that you selfishly discar--
- Oh, for Christ's sake, Penny, get over it!
- I wanna say goodbye to him.
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No, it's...
it's pretty messy.
- Thank you so much for coming.
I don't know what we would have done without you.
- Well, luckily, Little Miss Braveheart over here, she had the good sense to give us a call when she did.
Way to go, pumpkin.
Now you can sew a big, fat "Courage" badge on your Girl Scout sash.
Great big badge in the shape of a lion, giving you two thumbs up.
How about that, huh?
'Cause you are such a mature young woman.
You may even get asked to the junior prom where you can get fingered in the cafetorium, right next--
- You know what?
Fuck you, asshole!
All right?
That was my best friend!
- And we are so sorry for your loss, and we will personally--
- You know what?
Why are you OK with this?
Your brother's dead!
- You're right!
It's, it's, it's horrible!
You, you monsters!
Get the fuck out of here!
- Yes, yes, yeah, yeah!
You know what?
You guys are animals!
Leave now!
- OK, you're right.
Let's blow, Penny.
- [Penny]:
I'm sorry.
[Noise inside truck]
- What the fuck?
!
[Steve gasps]
- Hi.
Ugh!
- Holy fuck, Steve!
You're OK!
Did you see me?
I was fucking crying and everything!
Did you see?
- Nice try, zombie.
Now, get read¦÷ to say your prayers... in hell!
- No!
- Get out of the way.
- No!
You are not gonna shoot him, because we are getting married in six days!
- Don't make me shoot through ya.
- No!
Don't you see?
He's not a complete zombie!
He's still human!
- Max, you idiot!
Don't you see this is it?
He's resisting the infection.
This is our chance to find the cure!
- Oh, yeah, sure, you'd like that, wouldn't ya?
A nice little guinea pig that you can study and make everything all better.
Then everybody gets booster shots and lollipops and there are no more zombies.
Let me tell you something, sister.
The only shot that cures a zombie comes out of the end of this sweet little baby right here.
[Girls gasping in fear]
Suck it up, brain junkie, 'cause you ain't getting a lolli after this one.
- [Craig]:
No!
- Get off me, you bitch.
Happy honeymoon.
- Ah!
[Sarah yelling]
- Shit!
- Whoa!
Hey!
[Max groaning]
- Do it, Steve!
- Yeah, eat that fucker's head!
- Oh, God, messy fucker.
- I can't do this.
Ah... it's time to face the fact that I'm, uh, whatever this is.
And whatever this is is not safe to be around.
- Oh, Steve, dude, seriously, I am so sorry I called you a gay-ass zombie all right?
We can put you on an island somewhere, all right?
Somewhere far away.
We'll come visit, like at Christmas and shit, right?
- Steve, think about this.
[Sarah sobbing]
- Sarah, I can't be this selfish.
I can't go on having people in my life be accessory to murder.
- No, Steve!
No!
- You'll take care of her, yeah?
- Steve, please, give me the gun.
- I am so sorry, Tina.
I really wish I could be there for all of it-- for the chicken dance with your Nonna, eating our wedding cake, seeing you in your dress.
I love you.
- I love you, Steve.
♪
- All right.
Where do you wanna do this?
You want to, uh... go around the back?
Or what do you wanna do?
- [Penny]:
Max, let's talk about this!
- Whoa!
Here?
!
Really?
!
Now?
!
Are you sure?
!
- I just want you to know, of all the zombies I've encountered, you're... the most human.
- Please.
Not in front of my girl.
- All right.
- Oh!
- The only good zombie...
is a dead zom--
[Gunshot]
[Gasping]
- Shit...
[Body hits the ground]
I was aiming for his leg.
[Shocked laughter]
- Holy fuck, lady!
You just, like, totally wasted your boyfriend!
- He was not my boyfriend.
He was the muscle.
OK, Steve?
Steve.
Here's how it is.
Um...
I could put you down right now, if that's what you want me to do.
Or, you can come with me, and we can see if we can't find a cure for this, uh, this thing.
Now, I-I-I can't promise any thing, b-b-but
I will use all of my resources, I will work day and night,
I will use my education until we find a way to beat this infection.
Oh, and, and when we're done with this and we find a cure...
you'll be a hero.
- Really?
- I'll be a hero.
But, uh, but you'll be a celebrity, which is...
pretty much as good.
- Dude, we are gonna be famous!
- So, what do you say, Steve?
- All right, I'll-- [Gunshot]
- Ahh!
[Gasping]
- Baby!
Are you all right?
- You fucking moron!
- We're safe now.
Everything is gonna be fine!
- You are a fucking moron!
She was gonna help us.
She was gonna help Steve!
You ruined everything!
- She was gonna hurt him, Craig!
OK?
!
She wanted to use him for experiments!
- No, we were gonna be celebrities!
On the internet!
Or at least on fucking TV!
- Everything was gonna be fine!
- EVERYTHING IS FINE!
FUCK!
Look at Steve!
Steve!
You're all... happy!
- Hi, Tina.
- Oh!
Hi, baby.
Everything is gonna be OK.
We are gonna get married, we are gonna be happy, and we are gonna be fine.
I think I may have fucked up a little bit at the end there, but its OK, 'cause we made it!
- Baby.
- I love you.
- I love brains!

[Raccoon squeaking]
Ah!
Come on Penny, call it.
Where the fuck are they?
Uh... there!
Brains!
- I can shoot through ya!
Right in the kisser.
You know you don't have to take such pleasure Max.
That used to be a human being.
- Shut it, Penny!
Remember,
Direction is critical.
I wanna hear one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock-
- Ten to ten!
Whoa!
Christ, Penny, little help would be nice.
OK!
Old school.
- Nice.
Show off.
Well?
Uh... um...
I don't know.
I'm getting multiple readings.
Multiple readings, piece of shit.
Soo-eee!
Zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie.
Soo-eee!
- Brains.
Brains.
Looks like this party's just getting started.
Brains.
Brains.
Eww!
Shh, Tina.
You'll wake Sarah and Craig.
It's just a bug.
I'm sorry, Steve, I'm just not really used to all this...
nature.
Don't worry, the family cottage is very modern.
The outhouse is barely 20 feet from the front door.
Ha-ha, very funny.
OK, I need you to focus.
Think head table.
Ready?
A?
Or B?
Uh...
A?
Oh, my God, I'm so happy that you said that, 'cause otherwise I would have had to order in the yellow orchids from Thailand, and
I think they almost look the same.
- Almost.
Why don't you put that away for now, Tina?
You did promise you were gonna have fun this weekend.
You're sweet.
I promise to have fun.
Good.
'Cause I scheduled it in the itinerary.
Um...
I'm just joking.
That's not the itinerary for the weekend.
This is.
Tina-
- Look, Steve, there's still so much to do, and you've been so busy with your whole work human resource thingy.
- Workplace conflict resolution initiatives.
- Yes, you've had all that stuff.
I guess I'm just feeling overwhelmed.
I know that 300 people may seem like a small guest list.
- 300 people?
But in my family, it's tiny.
I've had to make a lot of compromises for this wedding, which I'm happy to do, but I just want this to be a special day for both of us.
It will be, baby.
I promise you.
No doubt in my mind.
- Roll over.
Your sister snores like a man.
I know.
It's cute.
- Yeah.
I never thought my matron of honour would snore louder than my husband, but...
Tina.
It's just that your sister and I are... different.
I know, and I'm very happy that you chose her to be your maid of honour.
Matron.
She's married, and older.
Well, it really means a lot to me.
Aw, honey, you mean a lot to me.
And you mean a lot to Muffins!
You mean a lot to me too, Muffins.
Yes you do.
Yes you do.
Aww.
So cute!
Gross, Steve.
Those things eat their own shit.
What are you talking about?
Germans?
Tina's rodent.
Sarah, would you like to hold him?
- No.
I would.
Gimme this little shit eater.
Ah.
Ahhh.
- Get it away!
Would you look at us?
One big happy family on vacation.
Yeah, it's gonna be great.
Yep.
I spy with my little eye something that is...
fluffy.
Ha-ha-ha!
You're talking about the rabbit!
I am talking about the rabbit!
You got it on the first go!
This is why we're together!
- You're good!
Aaaaaaand... here we are.
So?
What do you think of the Williams family cottage?
Uh...
It's... charming.
Baby, I told you we're roughing it.
Sarah!
I need to know where the cleaning products are.
We really need to give this place a once over.
Yes, Miss Tina.
Right aways, Miss Tina.
They hate each other.
- Yep.
I thought asking her to be her maid of honour would bring them closer together.
- Well, bitches are crazy.
Even when they like each other, they hate each other.
Maybe they really like each other.
No, those bitches really hate each other.
Well, I deal with conflict resolution opportunities like this every day.
I think I can, uh-
- No, listen, buddy, seriously, your whole corporate Jedi mind shit, it's not gonna work for your team-building skills here.
I got a few activities planned I think will help mend this relationship.
Mmm.
And I have a few activities planned that'll help us get shit faced!
Craig, you're family.
I need you on board this weekend.
You're my best man!
You are so...
sexy right now.
Craig, I'm being serious.
And our balls are kinda touching.
It's OK, we're family.
It's OK.
All right, don't mention that.
That one's free.
Steve, honey, let's see.
Oh, well, look at you.
You're getting there.
Craig?
Wow, Craig, those are perfect.
Yeah, can I drink now, please?
Oh, God, this is brutal!
This is the cottage.
We're supposed to be having fun.
- Its just one more hour,
OK, guys?
I mean, we're almost done the place cards, and then all we have to do is pick out the readings, make the photographer's list, we're gonna rehearse the speeches real quick-
- Babe...
Sarah's right.
This is our first night here.
Why don't we play a game or something?
Yes!
I'll grab the beers.
- What kind of game?
Now, the object of this game is to untangle ourselves without letting go of each other's hands.
Steve, is this a team-building exercise?
- It's a team-building GAME.
So it's like a party game?
- It's kinda like a party game.
It's kinda like retarded.
- Sarah, we have to work together as a team.
Can I get my beer?
- No, we can't let go of each other's hands, and we can't talk.
I can't drink and I can't talk?
- Non-verbal cues only.
All right, fine.
Starting...
Ow!
Sorry.
- Just... go under there.
- Guys!
Remember the rules.
There's no talking.
Oh, God.
Time out.
Time out.
I can't breath!
Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry.
I tried to go under your arm, but I got stuck in your underarm fa-
- My what?
OK, let's play another game, shall we?
What, did my matronly underarm fat get in your way?
Oh, Sarah, don't be so dramatic.
I'm dramatic?
You're the one who's wedding is taking over our vacation.
Well, if you really feel that way, then maybe I shouldn't have made you my matron of honour instead of one of my real friends!
Hey, let's get drunk!
How does that sound?
Way ahead of you, buddy.
Fine!
I don't want to be your god damned matron!
Fine!
- Fine!
Calm down!
Let's get a little fresh air.
Nobody wants fresh air but you, Steve.
Ah.
Ow.
Will you please just-
What the...?
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
- Steve, what is wrong with you?
Ow!
Jesus!
Ow!
- Steve?
Ow!
Ah!
Ah!
Oh, my God!
Steve!
Holy fuck, dude!
Are you all right?
- It just kept coming at me.
I thought I killed it, and then it bit me again.
Whoa!
That's a lot of blood.
- Oh, honey, are you all right?
No, he's gonna be fine, all right?
Some dudes just can't take the sight of their own blood.
Like, I was sword fishing once, and buddy was casting off, and he catches his buddy's nose, and, like, rips like half of it off, there's blood everywhere-
I think I'm gonna be sick.
- All right, that is it.
Party is over.
We are going to bed.
Yeah.
Definitely.
Steve, seriously?
You're gonna make me drink alone?
Groom's mess.
Best man cleans up.
I'm gonna go set some place cards on fire.
That's a buzz kill.
Maybe we should go home in the morning.
This may not have been the best idea.
Hmm?
It's just that I get a lot of work done at home and, you know, the salon really needs me.
No.
No, no, no.
I think we should stay.
It's just that your sister is so...
Baby, are you OK?
You're as white as a ghost.
I don't feel so good.
Ohhh, is my big strong man scared of a little bit of blood?
I know what'll make you feel better.
You haven't had one of these in a while.
Oh, yeah?
A... foot massage!
Oh.
Yeah!
It's weird.
I just...
I just don't feel right.
You have cold feet.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, I don't.
It's, it's...
I'm stressed about everybody getting along.
No, Steve, your feet are like icicles.
Oh.
Sorry.
- That's OK.
Sarah and I... we just... we just rub each other the wrong way sometimes, that's all.
I love you, baby.
You're cute.
OK, I promise to make more of an effort to play nice with your sister.
And I promise to make more of an effort not to get attacked by killer mosquitoes.
You can't help it.
They like to suck your blood because you're so sweet.
Ah-ah.
Hey, Penny.
- Yeah.
Come here, get a picture of me with fat zombie here.
You're a child, Max.
Ooh, that'll be a keeper.
- This is weird.
I've never seen the orb-whoa- flicker like this
Really?
What's it saying?
What?
- Tactical Bacon is... that way!
Max.
- Are you hungry, fat zombie?
I want some Tactical Bacon!
Max.
- Of course you're hungry, fat zombie.
You're a fat zombie.
Max, we need to investigate the area, OK?
All right.
Should we investigate the area, fat zombie?
Tactical Bacon now!
The orb is never wrong, OK?
Yeah, OK, right.
Well, we'll eat and then we'll check out the area.
But, uh, first, come here, come over here.
Come here.
- Yeah?
I want you to give fat zombie a little kiss.
Eww, no!
- Why, is it 'cause he's fat?
No!
- Jesus!
Ah!
- My bad.
So much for your magic orb.
Let's eat.
Uh, it's still flickering.
- Oh, Christ.
Happy?
No, it's...
it's so strange.
It's a...
- Penny!
It's as if...
- Tactical Bacon!
Good morning!
Cory Cortex here, comin' at your undead heads with all the brainformation a hungry mind can handle, here at AM 640, The Brain!
- Where we get into your heads and sink our teeth into what really matters- grey matter, that is!
Right now traffic is a real headache.
In fact, it's a bloody mess!
And before you head out to work, you-
- Good morning, husband.
Rise and shine.
- Huh.
Hmm!
Come on, sweetie.
Have some breakfast.
Did someone say breakfast?
Oh, ha-ha!
Muah!
Oh, hey, Steve.
Oh, that looks good!
You gonna eat all that?
- No, thank you.
Hey, Craig, do you want to go for a run?
I would, pal, but the weather forecast says there could... be rain.
Would anyone like a smoothie?
- I would.
Oh, no!
Brain freeeeeeeze!
Well, let us help you with that.
Mmm!
Mmm!
So good!
Steve, you wanna come try this with us?
Brains.
- Brains.
Brains!
Brains.
- Brains?
THE brain!
Oh, come on!
Ah, brains.
- Brains.
- Brains.
Brains.
- Brains.
Are you sure I can't help, Tina?
Nope!
I'm scheduled for breakfast.
And then I have you guys cleaning up, I have Steve and Sarah making lunch, and Craig and I will clean up, and then I have Steve and Craig starting dinner.
If that's cool with you guys.
AND
I even gave everyone colour- coded tabs to avoid confusion!
Vacation itinerary.
Yay!
Good morning!
- Hey,
Pooh bear.
You're up late.
Uh, ooh, no.
Oh, my God.
You look like shit.
Nothing a good run won't cure, right?
Everything OK with you girls?
Super.
OK, shall we?
Don't be late.
I'm making quiche.
- All right!
You know, I could teach you how to cook.
When you get married, man, it's like a constant battle to hang on to your manhood.
You guys seem to be doing all right.
Yeah, well, your sister's pretty cool.
She's like the female version of you.
That's why I married her.
That's really disturbing.
- Yeah, well, they always say, marry your best friend, and in a weird sort a way
I suppose I did.
- OK, stop.
To be honest, man, I don't even recognize you anymore.
You're all... safe.
What's the matter?
Sorry.
I can't find my pulse.
You should be looking for your balls.
All right, enough.
You're my best man.
You're supposed to be-
- No, a best man is supposed to be the guy that's telling you exactly the way it is.
and that's what I'm doing.
I've known you since college.
Face it, Steve, you're about to settle into the big sleep...
Steve!
Listen to me, all right?
Men, we're all wired to be alpha dogs.
Even pussy ones like you who want to be Bill fuckin' Cosby, all right?
And women, they dig alpha dogs.
Even strong-willed bitches like ours.
You want to be happy?
Grow some 'nads, all right?
Don't care about peoples' feelings or expectations.
Take what you want, man.
- Take what you want...
Oh, God, that's gross, man!
Come on!
You know what that was?
Chimichanga?
- No, that was a selfish, thoughtless urge.
And I haven't heard or smelt you fart in like three years.
And do you know why?
'Cause you're not allowed to.
Heh!
Brutal.
Do me a favour:
don't tell Sarah I was smoking.
How do I smell?
- You smell like ass!
And Mexican food.
Christ!
Eat a salad.
- Jealous.
Steve, you know we're gonna eat at least twice more today, right?
I can't help it.
I'm starving.
I'm just happy that you're feeling better, honey.
Eww!
Gross!
Steve, you know I don't like that.
- I am so sorry.
I don't know what just happened.
Are you OK?
You look really pale.
too fast, didn't you?
Did you eats too fast?
Is there too many eggies in your little belly?
Are you not feeling very goo-
Excuse me.
Uh...
I'm just, um...
I'm just gonna make sure he's OK.
I'll be right back.
I know the itinerary says I'm supposed to clean up... but...
It's fine.
Hey.
- Hey.
You're smoking?
I thought you gave it up when you moved in with Craig.
Yeah, I started again after you proposed to Tina.
I don't know what's happening to me.
You're marrying a fuckin' bitch?
Don't start, please.
Why can't you just try to get along?
I'm sorry, Steve, but I don't like her.
And I resent you for guilting me into being her matron of honour.
I'm happy with Tina.
Steve, you look like shit, OK?
And I think maybe this is your body's way of telling you something that your brain is afraid to.
OK, I'm giving up a few things here and there.
That's it.
That's what a relationship is!
I'm not like you, Sarah.
I'm not-
A bitch?
- No.
I'm not... super strongly opinionated.
All I want is to be content.
Satisfied.
Not struggling or hungry for anything.
Well, then you're already dead.
Don't you want more to live for?
I'm happy with the way things are.
Please, just...
just be nice.
Fine.
If that's what you want.
It is.
Thank you.
Are you feeling any better?
I'm still really hungry, actually.
Well, I wouldn't recommend the quiche.
It was made by a fucking gutter cunt.
Whoa!
Sorry, I'm just getting my fill while I can.
Don't tell Craig I was smoking, K?
I'm going to go hose the puke off your bride to be.
Max.
These readings are like nothing I've ever seen before.
That piece o' shit's a thousand years old, Penny.
The warranty is long gone.
- Max, the orb is fine, OK?
It's these readings- they're just, uh, different.
We have to interpret them.
That's your department, sweet cheeks.
Look, I, I can't be sure, but, um...
I think we might have a mutation on our hands.
Mutated zombies?
Bring it!
No, um, I don't think it's a zombie, actually.
I thought that thing only searched out meat puppets.
Well, I mean, it could be, but I also t-
Max?
Max...
Max!
Max!
Jesus Christ!
OK, where's all the little lightning bolts?
Uh, well, well, that's, that's the thing.
I mean, I mean, the charges indicate the presence of zombie DNA, so when one is near, it activates.
But this flickering could indicate a hybrid.
Hybrid?
What, you mean like a fuckin' hippie car?
No, Max, like a...
fucking resistant host.
Oh, Christ, that reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.
- Max, this could be exactly what I've been looking for
- Waaaah!
Oh, Penny, for Christ's sake, that's the last time you drive.
- Look Max, this could be exactly what I've been looking for, OK?
A person with the genetic make-up to resist the symptoms!
I'm tellin' ya, Penny, the only good zombie is a dead zombie.
No, no, no.
This could be why the orb has been acting so strangely.
And if we can capture this... person, we could extract their DNA and find a vaccine, Max!
Yeah, well, dream on.
Hey.
- Oh, hey, buddy!
- Where you guys going?
Into town.
You wanna come?
- No, Steve should stay here and get some rest.
Baby, I am so sorry about-
- Ah, it's OK.
It's just... you're not feeling well.
You know?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ooh!
Ugh...
Just... go lie down.
K.
Yeah.
Have fun!
We won't!
Max!
Max!
Pull in!
Pull in here!
Oh, Sarah, it looks like you're not gonna get any sun this weekend.
It's OK!
I'll book you a spray tan before the wedding.
Hi.
Are you guys lost?
Oh, uh, no.
We, um, are actually here because-
Have you kids seen any zombies.
Seriously?
- Yeah, we're looking for, uh, a, uh, undead creature.
Humanoid-lookin'.
Possibly, uh, droolin' and, uh, eatin' people's brains.
OK, what my associate is trying to say is that there has been a Stage 1 outbreak-
- Oh, come on, Penny, we haven't got time for that.
I recognize you guys from somewhere!
Here we go.
No, I totally saw you guys online!
Because my motto is:
the only good zombie is a dead zombie.
That's ridiculous!
Fuck.
No, fuck you!
Ahhhhhhhhh!
- Fuck you!
What were you doing on a website called
Never mind that.
All right, no, seriously, you guys are fucking hilarious!
And you, dude, you've got some real talent, all right?
"Only good zombie's a dead zombie!"
So fuckin' cheese, that is awesome, man!
Eww, gross!
What the fuck?
!
What the fuck?
You're the fuck!
- Craig, get in the car!
Why the fuck do I gotta get in the car?
He should get in the car.
Fucker spit on me!
Just get in the car, Craig!
- Yeah, Craig get in the car.
- Get in the van, Max.
Don't tell me to get in the van, Penny.
Max, I need you to trust my judgement right now and get in the van.
You want me to get in the van?
I'll get in the fuckin' van.
- Thank you, Max!
I'm sorry.
Um, he's been under a lot of stress lately.
Right.
- Hey, P!
- Yeah?
This is what I think of your fuckin' judgement!
Whoa!
Max!
Max, no!
Oh, my God!
- Ha-ha-ha!
Fucking hilarious!
Shut up!
- Max, what did you do?
Fuck...
- Oh, my God.
This is bad.
Uh... do you have any, uh, crazy glue?
No.
We have to go now.
- OK, no, I understand, um, but IF you see anything that's out of the ordinary, you can give us a call right there.
Penel- that's me on the bottom there.
And I also have this for you.
Um... if you could just help-
It sticks.
Can you grab that?
- Yeah, no problem.
Right here is... this!
Ah.
- It's complimentary, and you can just give it a read.
When you have a moment.
Uh-huh.
- Uh, sorry to bother you.
yeah.
OK, Bye.
- OK.
Bye-bye.
Max!
Wait!
Wait!
Max!
Max!
What a bunch of crazies.
- This is not funny!
Max, it's not funny!
Undead creature?
Humanoid-looking.
Yeah.
Probably drooling... and eating somebody's...
Ohhhh!
Eating somebody's brains.
Ugh!
Ugh!
Brains?
Ah!
Mm!
Mm!
I want brai- Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm!
Mm-mmm!
Mm-mmm!
Mm-mmm!
No I don't!
No I don't!
I want, um...
I want a...!
Pecan pie!
Mmm!
Pecan pie!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Yeah!
This is so delicious!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Damn it!
I want brains.
Ugh!
Oh, God!
I'm a zombie!
I'm a god damned zombie.
Tina's gonna kill me.
No.
Yes.
Groovy.
Ouch!
Ahhhh...
Whew!
All right, you little bastards.
Food chain ends here.
Oh, my God, it's moving.
I don't know, Muffins.
Maybe I should just give up, turn myself in.
I'm a pretty crappy zombie.
Come here.
Come here, big guy.
Are you scared?
Sorry I scared you, buddy.
You thought I was going to eat you, didn't you?
Yeah, you thought I was going to eat you.
You thought I was going to eat your brain!
Wooo!
Did you take your fucking adrenaline?
- Steve.
I don't know how you think you're gonna eat an entire watermelon-
Hi!
Let me get this straight.
You think that you are a zombie?
Little bit.
- Tina, this is ridiculous!
Look at the pressure that you're putting on him for this stupid wedding!
What?
!
My rabbit just died!
Oh, God, it was a glorified rat!
Stop it!
You heard the guy in the driveway.
They said they were looking for me.
Oh, God.
- Steve, this is the real world,
OK?
That guy was a psycho.
There are no such thing as zombies!
Then how do you explain the brains?
Ugh!
Damn it!
Oh, my God.
Gross!
My fiancé doesn't eat brains.
Ugh.
Can we please not say that word?
Actually, I think he does eat... brains.
Ugh.
- Exhibit fuckin' A.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Steve, we are getting married, and you are just freaking out.
Lots of men do this before the big day.
Honey, I obviously have a problem here.
You have a problem?
I have a problem!
Do you know how many people are coming to our wedding?
How many meals I've skipped to fit into that $5,000 dress?
And now my fiancé tells me that he doesn't want to marry me by killing my rabbit!
Baby, listen to me.
I love you.
Of course
I'm going to marry you!
This isn't cold feet.
I'm sick!
Really?
Really, Steve?
OK, if you're a zombie, then how come you're not trying to eat my face?
I don't know!
I don't want to.
I couldn't hurt anybody.
But baby, I...
I really need to eat!
I am so freakin' hungry right now!
I can't even eat regular food!
- So what do we do?
- We find me something I can eat.
- That's it?
Yes!
It's not a big deal!
I'm sorry, uh, no big deal?
Dude, you're a fucking zombie!
This is a huge deal.
All right, everybody, let's just calm down.
Craig, does that book say anything about food?
Page one.
Mmm!
All right!
Just listen.
I feel great.
All right?
I feel good, I really do!
I just need to find myself some...
Mmm!
You know?
So I'm gonna go to the store and get them.
We're coming with you.
Thank you.
No!
I'll go change.
This is bullshit.
He's not a zombie.
Of course he's not.
But I'm gonna call him on it.
If he wants brains, I will get him brains.
I'll even mash them up and I will spoon feed him if I have to.
But afterwards, he's gonna tell me what this is really about.
So... should I put this in the freezer?
Really, Craig?
Maybe a stew?
Look at this place, look at this!
This looks great!
Um...
OK.
Creative Meats.
Gross.
Ew.
- Don't be rude.
I didn't realize meat was a medium for expressing creativity.
Oh, dude!
What are ya...?
Whoa.
This place looks like a Civil War field hospital or something.
Craig, a little positive thinking.
Guys, look.
Skunk meat!
Fresh skunk meat!
- Ah!
You look like a gal with an adventurous palate.
You know, raccoon is more subtle than you might think, despite it's popular reputation as a garbage feeder.
Yes, ma'am, I do love me some 'coon meat!
Who doesn't?
Ha-ha-ha-ha...
Actually, we're looking for something, a...
little off the menu.
Pardon me, sir, but this establishment does not condone the sale of illegal firearms.
I am but a simple butcher.
But, just out of curiosity, what type and calibre are we talking about?
Ohhh.
No, actually, thank you.
Um, we're actually looking for some... brains.
And maybe some of that racoon meat.
Eww!
What?
He made it...
he made it sound kinda good.
Did I just hear you right, boy?
Did you just ask me for... brains?
Yes.
Well, hot dog!
I'm a brain man myself!
Wa-hooo!
This is your lucky day, muchacho
I don't get as much call for brains, on account of the cholesterol.
But I'll tell ya,
I'll take me a mass of pan-fried calves' brains over a rack of ribs 10 out of 10!
Ugh!
- Sure.
Ha-ha!
Me too.
These just came in this morning.
Oh-ho-ho!
This is messed up.
Yeah, I'm gonna be in the car.
Now, these little ones are appetizer size.
Great for holiday entertaining.
We got squirrel, muskrat, and those little ones there, them's rattlesnake.
Choice eating, those!
May I?
- I'm not big on free samples... but I don't get many chances to eat brains with a fellow gourmand, as it were, so...
Cheers.
Steve!
That's enough.
You're not actually gonna eat that, are you?
Oh, yeah.
I will be in the car.
Well, I guess it's a table for two, monsieur!
Unless...
Oh, no.
No, I'm good.
Yeah.
Mmm!
Just like a little candy, right, Stevie?
They are delicious!
You like 'em raw, too!
A man after my own heart.
Mmm!
What are those ones there?
Oh, these are simply divine!
Here we got skunk, owl, Canadian beaver, and rabbit.
Oh, rabbit!
Your favourite!
Too soon?
- Mm...
And this... is la pièce de résistance.
This is genuine, Grade A, all-American grizzly bear brain.
It is to die for.
It's beautiful.
- Grill this baby low and slow for-
Oh, my God.
- Yeah, he's gonna pay for that.
That's $19.99 a pound.
Ahh.
Ahhh!
- So?
How do you feel?
- OK.
You know what?
I feel OK.
We'll take it.
We'll take it all.
Yeah!
Ha-ha-ha!
See that?
Good as new.
You wanna kiss and make up?
Pull over there.
You want to stay here?
Uh, listen.
Between the crazy glue and the painkillers for your foot, we have gone way over budget, OK?
So now we are roughing it.
Don't even!
- Fine.
I like it rough.
Then don't moisturize your hand.
OK, but you have to spit on it.
I will glue that hand to your face!
Remove your hand.
Kindly remove your hand right now.
- Give me a little.
That's real mature, Max.
You have pushed me to my limit.
Can you please not do that right now?
What?
Eat like a fuckin' zombie pig!
- Craig, you're not helping.
No.
I'm not, because I'm not a zombie collaborator.
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
YOU SHUT UP!
YOU SHUT UP!
Ow!
What the fuck?
!
- Oh, my God!
OK.
- Don't touch me right now!
Look, I know this is a lot to take in, but it's really gonna be OK.
- Really?
How?
Yeah, how?
- Here's an idea:
why don't we talk about this in the cabin?
Oh, no, I think we should talk about this on the way home.
Yeah, I agree.
I'll start packing.
- Guys!
Wait!
Great.
Thanks, Craig.
- Eat me!
What's that supposed to mean?
- Would you two just please stop it!
- OK, damn it!
I know that you're scared, all right?
I am too.
- I'm not afraid.
There's no reason for us to be treating each other like this.
Now, I'm starting to feel better.
The hunger's not so bad anymore.
Now, someone please tell me where are my snake brains are.
- They're in your hand.
Which hand?
- The one in the car.
Oh, oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry, baby!
That's amazing!
I don't even feel that!
What do you mean?
- I don't feel it.
At all.
It doesn't hurt?
- Nope!
Seriously?
It's fine!
I'm OK!
- No pain?
Uh-uh.
- Let's do that again.
No!
- This is stupid!
No, its actually pretty cool.
OK, you could warn me next time.
- Oh, look, you, uh, dropped your little bag of snacks there.
Let me get that for ya.
What the fuck, Craig!
- That was awesome!
OK, that was a good one.
No, but seriously, we should get you to a hospital.
Why?
I mean, aside from the brains and a little numbness, I'm fine.
Besides, when it comes down to it, it's really just a dietary restriction.
Yeah, it's like that chick I know, uh, what's her face?
Um, she's allergic to gluten and shit.
What's her face?
Fuck.
It's me, you idiot!
Your wife?
I'm gluten intolerant!
Steve,
I just want you to feel like yourself again.
I do, Tina.
I feel great!
And you know what?
I'm happy.
And I'm in love with you.
Ugh...
OK, we can stay.
- Seriously?
Am I the only one that sees a problem with this?
You can't feel pain!
You eat brains!
I don't even want to eat brains... that much.
Look, I promise, the first second that I feel bad, we'll go home.
All right?
Fine.
But for the record, this is a bad idea.
Lets just try to have some fun.
Oh!
¶
Woo!
¶...go away
¶ Even though I didn't want to let go ¶
¶ Why can't you see that what you're looking for ¶
Oh!
Huh?
Hey!
¶ And you're never gonna let it show ¶
Ah!
¶...girl like you
¶ You you you you you you you you ¶
¶ No, no, I don't miss you now ¶
¶ But I will never find another one ¶
¶ No, no, you don't miss me now ¶
¶ But you will never...
- Woo!
Oh, my God!
- Yeah!
¶...never find another one
- I feel great!
Oh, my God!
Oh, kill me!
That's it, we have to get him to the hospital.
He's fine.
Look at all the stuff he did today.
Tina, he's not a superhero;
he's undead!
I think he's getting worse.
- How could this be worse?
Look.
Right here it says:
"The undead host must consume living
"human cerebral tissue.
Any dead or non-human tissue will eventually be rejected."
Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?
Animal brains are like junk food.
It's like he's yakking up zombie mini doughnuts.
Why didn't you tell us about this before?
What?
I hadn't gotten that far.
Look at how thick this bitch is!
Nooo, my Steve is gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK just in time for the wedding.
- Tina, if this keeps up, by next week we'll be at his funeral.
Oh, hey, buddy.
You get it all out?
Oh, my God, Steve.
You look like death!
That's it, Tina.
We have to take him to the hospital now!
Enough!
He's fine.
He's fine!
We are not taking him to some back-water hospital.
He's fine.
You just need some rest, right, baby?
You just need some rest, that's all.
Ahhh...
Ah!
- Oh, my God!
Holy fuck, dude!
That is your ear!
- OK, I draw the line at things falling off my brother's face.
Craig, get the car.
Finally.
See you guys, later.
- No, they're coming with us.
- Son of a fuck!
No!
We are not going anywhere!
Craig, go upstairs right now and get my cosmetic kit.
Right.
- This is fucked.
Honey, I see women that are way worse come into my salon, and you know what?
After I'm done with them, they're like, like new people!
I'm in pretty bad shape, Tina.
- Look at me.
You and I are going to be doing the chicken dance with my Nonna at our wedding in one week.
OK?
But right now my man looks like shit, so we have some work to do.
Sarah, go get me a paper towel.
Tina, you're not seri-
- Now!
Craig,
I need you to take Steve's ear and rinse it off.
Fuck that noise!
- Craig!
What's that?
Oh, it's eyelash adhesive.
Yeah.
Oh-
- Oh!
What?
Just say they're piercings.
I'm not fucking touching it.
Ugh...
OK...
Heh-heh...
Now, just... hold... still.
OK?
And...
Ugh!
Ahhhhh!
Ahhh, I feel like Frankenstein.
Thank you for being so sweet.
Honey, I'm not giving up on you because of some eating disorder or, or a missing ear.
This wouldn't even turn a head at my family dinner table.
I love you, baby.
OK, now, stay straight.
You don't want to have crooked ears.
No. 'Cause my man has perfect ears.
As long as he looks fine for your fucking wedding.
Craig, can you come here for a sec?
What?
Hold this.
- Gross!
Don't move, either of you.
Sarah, can I talk to you in the other room for a second?
You sure can.
- Great.
Whoa, wait.
Where are you guys going?
We'll be back.
So, uh... zombie dick?
Yeah, its pretty bad.
So, what now, Tina?
You want to talk about the fringe on my matron of honour dress?
All right, that is... it!
What the fuck?
!
You just punched my tit!
Come on, tough girl.
You got a problem with me?
Let's see what you
- Oww!
Ow!
Jesus!
You punch like a man!
What the hell is your problem?
!
I just want us to get this out of our systems so that we can work together and help Steve.
So you punch me in the tit?
!
What are you, 12?
You're kind of a bad ass, so I...
I needed an advantage.
Yeah?
Well, this bad ass is about to kick your ass!
If you're done playing zombie makeover with him, we can actually get him some god damn professional help.
What the...?
Yeah, and those people that came by, they seem like real humanitarians.
Tina!
Sarah!
Don't move that ear!
Yeah, Steve.
This is hot.
I'm sick of you and your Little Miss Perfect bullshit!
Ugh!
- Girls!
- Just a bit longer.
Don't you even!
Ah!
Stop it!
I hate you!
You!
- Bitch!
Emo slut!
- Plastic whore!
Enough!
Tina!
Try talking to Sarah!
Fine!
Sarah, you're a bitch!
- Tina!
Stop using judgemental language, get to the heart of your conflict, and empathize with her point of view.
And Sarah, stop being so defensively aggressive and be an active listener.
OK.
Sarah, I know how much you love your brother, and I know that you don't think that I'm right for him.
But I love him.
Right now, he's Steve.
But if we don't come up with something, he's gonna turn into a monster.
He already is, you morons!
Look at him.
He needs... brains.
- Ugh.
Ah, gross.
OK...
Craig is right.
Of course I'm right.
The book says I'm right.
And they're gonna have to be human too.
But maybe I just need a bit.
Just enough so that I can function.
What do you have in mind?
I'm going to go into town.
I'm going to find somebody that won't be missed.
And I'm gonna eat their fucking brains.
Come on.
That's rich.
No, you're not.
There's no way, Steve.
- What?
Honey, I just accidentally pulled your ear off.
You're in no condition to hunt.
Well, what then?
I have an idea.
Jesus!
Fff!
Look what you've done to our women, Steve.
And who the fuck packs hooker boots for a weekend at the cottage?
- I do, and you don't have to be involved if you're afraid.
We're just afraid that you girls are gonna get into trouble.
Honey, everything is gonna be fine.
- Family takes care of family.
Yeah, and we're family, all right-the fuckin' Manson family!
So what are you girls gonna do Bring back some sorry prick so he can eat him.
Wow.
Thug life.
Great.
- Steve, if we get someone, can you go through with this?
I'm sure my zombie instincts will just kick in.
But get somebody really old.
Or like a real asshole.
How about a really old asshole?
Do you want a man or do you want a woman?
Oh.
A man.
Definitely.
I don't think I could eat a woman.
Gay.
Way to go, Steve.
You're the first gay-ass zombie.
You're really breaking a lot of ground this weekend.
Craig, shut up.
Seriously, we have to... we have to get someone that you're gonna hate so you can...
I dunno, kill them without remorse.
Like a...
like a pedophile or a meth dealer.
Or a hipster.
I really hate hipsters.
Or a parking cop.
I hate those bastards.
I hate the Portuguese.
Uh... um, anyways, you just need to make sure you're ready to do what you have to do when we come back.
Craig'll help you get ready.
- What?
Fuck that!
Come on.
So, if, uh, things don't work out between you and Tina, and you decide to marry a gay zombie,
I do support your decision.
But I wont be at the reception, because I don't eat cock or brains.
Yeah, you're hilarious there!
- Yeah, so I RSVP "no"
to gay zombie wedding.
Yup.
So long, Muffins.
This place reminds me of where my parents would take me camping every summer.
My father... sent me to a survival camp in the Philippines when I was nine.
They, uh, dropped me in the jungle in the middle of a monsoon.
I had to survive for seven days.
Your father did that to you?
It was my birthday.
I'm tellin' ya, though, those seven days...
made me tough.
Tough enough to take anything that comes my way.
Alive or undead.
Max, why do you hate zombies so much?
I mean, what if your mother turned into a zombie?
What would you do?
Shoot her in the face.
You would not shoot your mother in the face if she was in a coma.
No.
If she was in a coma, she wouldn't be trying to turn my head into a god damned fondue pot.
Right.
Well, if we find this resistant host, we could find a vaccine.
You'd be a hero, Max.
You're right, I am a god damn hero.
I'm tired of waiting for your orb to tell us what to do.
We're gonna do this my way!
Uh, where are we going?
To get some bait.
Him?
He looks old.
Kinda.
- He looks like he could have Alzheimer's.
Is that contagious?
- This is just evil!
Suck it up, Sarah.
Your brother needs us.
Look.
Soul patch.
That guy's a douche for sure.
- He's too fat.
He's like a walking bucket of chicken.
I'm gonna throw up.
Sarah, you need to take that terrified look off your face,
OK?
We're not gonna get anyone unless you throw out a certain vibe.
What kind of vibe?
- Watch and learn.
Wow.
That's sexy.
I know, right?
OK, now you try.
Relax, throw your shoulders back, and wipe that look off your face.
OK, how's this look?
Like you're having a pap smear.
- Ugh!
This isn't going to work!
We can do this, Sarah!
I just don't know how we're gonna pick somebody.
We'll figure it out.
You know, just keep our eyes open and eventually somebody'll just end up in our laps.
Oh, my God!
What the fuck!
My car!
- Tina.
Look.
Big scary guy is checking us out.
Hi.
Huh.
That big scary guy is a dead man.
Hey.
Are you crazy?
She's crazy.
OK.
So, apparently, eight bones make up the neurocranium.
So it's like a bone vault for the brain and brain stem.
This part over here is the parietal.
So, this little sucker is like a quarter of an inch thick and hard as shit.
All right, so you're gonna have to Babe Ruth smash the shit out of this thing so you can have access to the cerebral cortex.
Got it.
Oh, that smells good.
Mmm!
What the fuck, dude!
- What?
You just smelled my fucking brain!
No.
Let's not jump to conclusions here.
No, all right, you're a fucking monster!
Craig!
- Just stay the fuck away from me, all right?
Gay-ass zombie!
God damn!
¶
Wow!
That is so... hot!
My, uh... woman parts like you too.
Ha-ha-ha...
Ugh, how is he still standing?
He's had enough booze to knock out a rhino!
Don't worry, it's OK.
I have a plan.
Just get him in the back seat.
Are you fucking joking me?
No fucking way!
Don't worry, he's harmless.
- Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, my God!
Come on!
I need you to suck it up, and be sexy, and get him in the back seat!
Come on!
Go!
Get outta here!
Hey... big man.
So... so, you wanna, you wanna go for a ride?
Stud monkey.
You make Mommy so horny!
What?
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Go ahead, get in.
Hey, there.
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-
- Ahhh!
You have a pink stun gun?
- Yeah.
It's cute, right?
OK, lets go!
I'll drive!
Wait!
What about me?
Pizza, pizza, pizza!
Ha-ho!
Pizza!
Pizza, pizza!
Max.
Pizza, pizza, pizza!
Ha-ha!
Evening, young lady.
Hello!
Are you, uh, Captain Cletus?
Where's the pizza?
The...
No, uh, sorry.
We are actually here for something else.
Ma'am, if you are implying I might be in possession of illegal firearms, I will kindly ask you to leave-
No, we don't want guns, Admiral Redneck.
We need brains.
- Uh...
Max.
Ya'll have a good night, now.
- No wait, OK, all we want is brains.
- Sorry, Missy, no can do.
Somebody cleaned me out earlier today.
- Who?
Bunch of kids.
Now beat it.
- No, wait!
Can you tell us anything else about them?
Couple o' pretty-looking ladies was hanging with some queer-looking feller and another that couldn't get enough of my brains!
Now, git!
That's our zombie, Penny.
Come on.
The cottage!
No, Max, wait!
If the infected one hasn't eaten the others yet, it must mean that he's resisting the infection!
Which is wonderful!
Shit!
Where is that cottage?
Hey, man, did you order the Vegetarian Nightmare?
Extra Polish sausage, German sausage, Belgian Sausage,
Russian sausage-
- Nope.
Fuckin' hate this job.
Ugh!
Oh, God.
Ugh!
OK.
Oh, God.
Ugh!
What the hell!
I have been worried sick!
Shut up, Steve!
Oh, baby, you look kinda better, that's good, but shut up.
You need to help us carry this in.
This is ridiculous.
We need a dolly or something.
Where's Craig?
Uh...
sleeping, I think.
Sleeping?
!
- What?
Yeah!
I can help.
OK.
- Come on.
OK, I'll take his legs, or-
Oh, my God!
How did you get this guy?
!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Holy crap!
This is ridiculous!
Are you girls pulling?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!
Fuckin' freak family.
OK, we softened him up for you.
That guy is huge!
I know, honey, but he's out cold.
Are you ready?
- Oh this is crazy.
You girls just kidnapped a guy!
- And now you're gonna eat him!
OK, listen to me.
This is very important.
This is our new lifestyle, OK?
And if we're gonna walk down the aisle together, then we both just need to embrace this.
OK, all right.
He's all tied up and he's still out of it.
I wouldn't wait too long.
All right.
I'm gonna go downstairs and eat this guy!
OK.
- Thank you!
You've both have been so incredible.
I'm so happy to see the two of you working together so well.
You know, I think if this weekend has taught us anything-
Steve, just GO!
- Wah!
Love you!
- Wait, wait, wait!
Here!
Oh, my God!
Boots are killing me!
Oof!
Ugh!
OK...
I can smell his undead ass.
Max, we haven't gotten a reading from the orb.
We've been driving around in circles for hours.
OK, you have all the bells and whistles in here.
You have this!
Who do you even talk to in this?
And yet you don't have a NAV system!
I don't need a fucking computer.
I'm a fucking professional!
I can feel when they're close by.
I don't need a fucking piece of technology.
You're a stone-cold killer.
You're a stone-cold killer.
You're a stone-cold killer.
- Get it.
You're a stone-cold-
Hello?
- Hey.
Uh, y-you guys came by my place today.
It's my friend, he's turned into a zombie.
OK, uh, uh, calm down, and, uh, where are you?
Uh, it's 42 Clear Lake Drive.
42 Clear Lake Drive.
- Who is it?
Oh, we're close!
- Who is it?
!
you're just going to do tests, you're not gonna hurt him?
Your gonna make him back to normal again, right?
- Of course.
He's gonna be in good hands-
- You're fucking right he'll be in good hands.
Who the fuck is this?
Who the fuck is this?
- Hey, calm the fuck down, pal.
I don't want to calm the fuck down.
Fuck you, fucker!
You calm the fuck down!
You fucking relax!
- No, you go fuck yourself and get the fuck over here, you fucker!
No, you fuck yourself, you fuck!
Fuck you.
Fuck!
FUUUUUUUCK!
Max!
Max, really?
Those things practically have feelings.
Not anymore.
Ha!
That's stupid.
Mmm... no.
Just do it!
Mmm.
Hey.
What the hell are you guys doing with all those guns?
Hey there, pumpkin.
Nice of you to call us about your little friend- 12 hours too late.
You promised me you weren't gonna hurt him.
No, no, no.
No, no, we won't hurt him, OK?
We promise.
Right, Max?
We won't hurt him.
You stay here with sugar tits.
I got this one.
No, wait, Max.
Max, this one is different.
OK, we cannot waste this opportunity.
It'd be like throwing away the cure for cancer.
OK, Max, listen!
No, you listen!
Zombies are good for only one thing:
killing'.
Max, we need this guy, OK?
No, no!
Christ.
- No, no, no, no!
I don't need anybody.
Mmm...
This orb was centuries... old.
Lady, fuck your orb, all right?
Make sure that maniac doesn't hurt my friend!
Where is he?
No, you don't understand!
- Don't you touch my brother!
Where is he?
!
Sorry, pal.
Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the door!
- No!
Open the door!
Open the door!
- No!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Girls!
Girls!
Open the door!
Ah!
Is that-
- Yes!
It is.
You promised me you weren't gonna hurt him!
Wait!
You called them?
!
- Uh-oh.
Awkward.
Hey!
What the hell is that?
- Oh, just hundreds of years of mystical antiquity that you selfishly discar-
Oh, for Christ's sake, Penny, get over it!
I wanna say goodbye to him.
- No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's...
it's pretty messy.
Thank you so much for coming.
I don't know what we would have done without you.
Well, luckily, Little Miss Braveheart over here, she had the good sense to give us a call when she did.
Way to go, pumpkin.
Now you can sew a big, fat "Courage" badge on your Girl Scout sash.
Great big badge in the shape of a lion, giving you two thumbs up.
How about that, huh?
'Cause you are such a mature young woman.
You may even get asked to the junior prom where you can get fingered in the cafetorium, right next-
- You know what?
Fuck you, asshole!
All right?
That was my best friend!
And we are so sorry for your loss, and we will personally-
You know what?
Why are you OK with this?
Your brother's dead!
You're right!
It's, it's, it's horrible!
You, you monsters!
Get the fuck out of here!
Yes, yes, yeah, yeah!
You know what?
You guys are animals!
Leave now!
OK, you're right.
Let's blow, Penny.
- I'm sorry.
What the fuck?
!
Hi.
Ugh!
- Holy fuck, Steve!
You're OK!
Did you see me?
I was fucking crying and everything!
Did you see?
- Nice try, zombie.
Now, get readÂ¦Ã· to say your prayers... in hell!
No!
- Get out of the way.
No!
You are not gonna shoot him, because we are getting married in six days!
Don't make me shoot through ya.
- No!
Don't you see?
He's not a complete zombie!
He's still human!
- Max, you idiot!
Don't you see this is it?
He's resisting the infection.
This is our chance to find the cure!
Oh, yeah, sure, you'd like that, wouldn't ya?
A nice little guinea pig that you can study and make everything all better.
Then everybody gets booster shots and lollipops and there are no more zombies.
Let me tell you something, sister.
The only shot that cures a zombie comes out of the end of this sweet little baby right here.
Suck it up, brain junkie, 'cause you ain't getting a lolli after this one.
- No!
Get off me, you bitch.
Happy honeymoon.
- Ah!
Shit!
Whoa!
Hey!
Do it, Steve!
- Yeah, eat that fucker's head!
Oh, God, messy fucker.
I can't do this.
Ah... it's time to face the fact that I'm, uh, whatever this is.
And whatever this is is not safe to be around.
Oh, Steve, dude, seriously, I am so sorry I called you a gay-ass zombie all right?
We can put you on an island somewhere, all right?
Somewhere far away.
We'll come visit, like at Christmas and shit, right?
Steve, think about this.
Sarah, I can't be this selfish.
I can't go on having people in my life be accessory to murder.
- No, Steve!
No!
- You'll take care of her, yeah?
Steve, please, give me the gun.
I am so sorry, Tina.
I really wish I could be there for all of it- for the chicken dance with your Nonna, eating our wedding cake, seeing you in your dress.
I love you.
I love you, Steve.
All right.
Where do you wanna do this?
You want to, uh... go around the back?
Or what do you wanna do?
Max, let's talk about this!
Whoa!
Here?
!
Really?
!
Now?
!
Are you sure?
!
I just want you to know, of all the zombies I've encountered, you're... the most human.
Please.
Not in front of my girl.
All right.
- Oh!
The only good zombie...
is a dead zom-
Shit...
I was aiming for his leg.
Holy fuck, lady!
You just, like, totally wasted your boyfriend!
He was not my boyfriend.
He was the muscle.
OK, Steve?
Steve.
Here's how it is.
Um...
I could put you down right now, if that's what you want me to do.
Or, you can come with me, and we can see if we can't find a cure for this, uh, this thing.
Now, I-I-I can't promise any thing, b-b-but
I will use all of my resources, I will work day and night,
I will use my education until we find a way to beat this infection.
Oh, and, and when we're done with this and we find a cure...
you'll be a hero.
Really?
I'll be a hero.
But, uh, but you'll be a celebrity, which is...
pretty much as good.
Dude, we are gonna be famous!
So, what do you say, Steve?
All right, I'll-
- Ahh!
Baby!
Are you all right?
You fucking moron!
We're safe now.
Everything is gonna be fine!
- You are a fucking moron!
She was gonna help us.
She was gonna help Steve!
You ruined everything!
- She was gonna hurt him, Craig!
OK?
!
She wanted to use him for experiments!
No, we were gonna be celebrities!
On the internet!
Or at least on fucking TV!
Everything was gonna be fine!
EVERYTHING IS FINE!
FUCK!
Look at Steve!
Steve!
You're all... happy!
Hi, Tina.
- Oh!
Hi, baby.
Everything is gonna be OK.
We are gonna get married, we are gonna be happy, and we are gonna be fine.
I think I may have fucked up a little bit at the end there, but its OK, 'cause we made it!
Baby.
I love you.
- I love brains!

[Electrical bursts] - [Girl]:
Ah!
- Come on Penny, call it.
Where the fuck are they?
- Uh... there!
- Brains!
- I can shoot through ya!
[Gunshot]
Right in the kisser.
- You know you don't have to take such pleasure Max.
That used to be a human being.
- Shut it, Penny!
Remember,
Direction is critical.
I wanna hear one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock--
- Ten to ten!
[Zombie shouting]
- Whoa!
[Growling]
- Christ, Penny, little help would be nice.
[Zombie yelling]
[Buzzing]
- OK!
- Old school.
- Nice.
Show off.
- Well?
- Uh... um...
I don't know.
I'm getting multiple readings.
- Multiple readings, piece of shit.
Soo-eee!
Zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie, zombie.
Soo-eee!

Brains.

[Splat!

- Eww!
- [Whispering]:
Shh, Tina.
You'll wake Sarah and Craig.
It's just a bug.
- I'm sorry, Steve, I'm just not really used to all this...
nature.
- Don't worry, the family cottage is very modern.
The outhouse is barely 20 feet from the front door.
- Ha-ha, very funny.
OK, I need you to focus.
Think head table.
Ready?
A?
Or B?
- Uh...
A?
- Oh, my God, I'm so happy that you said that, 'cause otherwise I would have had to order in the yellow orchids from Thailand, and
I think they almost look the same.
- Almost.
Why don't you put that away for now, Tina?
You did promise you were gonna have fun this weekend.
- You're sweet.
I promise to have fun.
- Good.
- 'Cause I scheduled it in the itinerary.
- Um...
- I'm just joking.
That's not the itinerary for the weekend.
This is.
- Tina--
- Look, Steve, there's still so much to do, and you've been so busy with your whole work human resource thingy.
- Workplace conflict resolution initiatives.
- Yes, you've had all that stuff.
I guess I'm just feeling overwhelmed.
I know that 300 people may seem like a small guest list.
- 300 people?
- But in my family, it's tiny.
I've had to make a lot of compromises for this wedding, which I'm happy to do, but I just want this to be a special day for both of us.
- It will be, baby.
I promise you.
No doubt in my mind.
- [Craig]:
Roll over.
[Snoring]
- Your sister snores like a man.
- I know.
It's cute.
- Yeah.
I never thought my matron of honour would snore louder than my husband, but...
- Tina.
- It's just that your sister and I are... different.
- I know, and I'm very happy that you chose her to be your maid of honour.
- Matron.
She's married, and older.
- Well, it really means a lot to me.
- Aw, honey, you mean a lot to me.
And you mean a lot to Muffins!
[Laughing]
- You mean a lot to me too, Muffins.
Yes you do.
Yes you do.
- Aww.
So cute!
- Gross, Steve.
Those things eat their own shit.
- What are you talking about?
Germans?
- Tina's rodent.
- Sarah, would you like to hold him?
- No.
- I would.
Gimme this little shit eater.
Ah.
Ahhh.
- Get it away!
- Would you look at us?
One big happy family on vacation.
- Yeah, it's gonna be great.
- Yep.
- [Steve]:
I spy with my little eye something that is...
fluffy.
- [Tina]:
Ha-ha-ha!
You're talking about the rabbit!
- [Steve]:
I am talking about the rabbit!
You got it on the first go!
- [Tina]:
This is why we're together!
- [Steve]:
You're good!
Aaaaaaand... here we are.
So?
What do you think of the Williams family cottage?
- Uh...
It's... charming.
- Baby, I told you we're roughing it.
[She snaps her fingers]
- Sarah!
I need to know where the cleaning products are.
We really need to give this place a once over.
- Yes, Miss Tina.
Right aways, Miss Tina.
- They hate each other.
- Yep.
- I thought asking her to be her maid of honour would bring them closer together.
- Well, bitches are crazy.
Even when they like each other, they hate each other.
- Maybe they really like each other.
- No, those bitches really hate each other.
- Well, I deal with conflict resolution opportunities like this every day.
I think I can, uh--
- No, listen, buddy, seriously, your whole corporate Jedi mind shit, it's not gonna work for your team-building skills here.
- I got a few activities planned I think will help mend this relationship.
- Mmm.
And I have a few activities planned that'll help us get shit faced!
- Craig, you're family.
I need you on board this weekend.
You're my best man!
?
[Seductive music]
- You are so...
sexy right now.
- Craig, I'm being serious.
- And our balls are kinda touching.
It's OK, we're family.
It's OK.
All right, don't mention that.
That one's free.
?
[Belching] ?
[Buzzing]
?
[Light zapping] [Mosquito shouts]
[Mosquito grunting angrily]
- Steve, honey, let's see.
Oh, well, look at you.
You're getting there.
Craig?
Wow, Craig, those are perfect.
- Yeah, can I drink now, please?
- Oh, God, this is brutal!
This is the cottage.
We're supposed to be having fun.
- Its just one more hour,
OK, guys?
I mean, we're almost done the place cards, and then all we have to do is pick out the readings, make the photographer's list, we're gonna rehearse the speeches real quick--
- Babe...
Sarah's right.
This is our first night here.
Why don't we play a game or something?
- Yes!
I'll grab the beers.
- What kind of game?
- Now, the object of this game is to untangle ourselves without letting go of each other's hands.
- Steve, is this a team-building exercise?
- It's a team-building GAME.
- So it's like a party game?
- It's kinda like a party game.
- It's kinda like retarded.
- Sarah, we have to work together as a team.
- Can I get my beer?
- No, we can't let go of each other's hands, and we can't talk.
- I can't drink and I can't talk?
- Non-verbal cues only.
- All right, fine.
- Starting...
- Ow!
- Sorry.
- Just... go under there.
- Guys!
Remember the rules.
There's no talking.
- Oh, God.
Time out.
Time out.
I can't breath!
Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry.
I tried to go under your arm, but I got stuck in your underarm fa-
- My what?
- OK, let's play another game, shall we?
- What, did my matronly underarm fat get in your way?
- Oh, Sarah, don't be so dramatic.
- I'm dramatic?
You're the one who's wedding is taking over our vacation.
- Well, if you really feel that way, then maybe I shouldn't have made you my matron of honour instead of one of my real friends!
- Hey, let's get drunk!
How does that sound?
[Slurping]
- Way ahead of you, buddy.
- Fine!
I don't want to be your god damned matron!
- Fine!
- Fine!
- Calm down!
Let's get a little fresh air.
- Nobody wants fresh air but you, Steve.
?
[Mosquito babbling]
[Belching]
- Ah.
Ow.
Will you please just--
What the...?
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
- Steve, what is wrong with you?
- Ow!
Jesus!
Ow!
- Steve?
- Ow!
Ah!
Ah!
[Steve yelling]
- Oh, my God!
Steve!
[Steve yelling] [Mosquito buzzing]
[Splat!
]
- Holy fuck, dude!
Are you all right?
- It just kept coming at me.
I thought I killed it, and then it bit me again.
- Whoa!
That's a lot of blood.
- Oh, honey, are you all right?
- No, he's gonna be fine, all right?
Some dudes just can't take the sight of their own blood.
Like, I was sword fishing once, and buddy was casting off, and he catches his buddy's nose, and, like, rips like half of it off, there's blood everywhere--
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- All right, that is it.
Party is over.
We are going to bed.
- Yeah.
Definitely.
- Steve, seriously?
You're gonna make me drink alone?
- Groom's mess.
Best man cleans up.
I'm gonna go set some place cards on fire.
- That's a buzz kill.
- [Tina]:
Maybe we should go home in the morning.
This may not have been the best idea.
- Hmm?
- It's just that I get a lot of work done at home and, you know, the salon really needs me.
- No.
No, no, no.
I think we should stay.
- It's just that your sister is so...
Baby, are you OK?
You're as white as a ghost.
- I don't feel so good.
- Ohhh, is my big strong man scared of a little bit of blood?
I know what'll make you feel better.
You haven't had one of these in a while.
- Oh, yeah?
- A... foot massage!
- Oh.
Yeah!
It's weird.
I just...
I just don't feel right.
- You have cold feet.
- No.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, I don't.
It's, it's...
I'm stressed about everybody getting along.
- No, Steve, your feet are like icicles.
- Oh.
Sorry.
- That's OK.
Sarah and I... we just... we just rub each other the wrong way sometimes, that's all.
[Steve sighs]
- I love you, baby.
- You're cute.
OK, I promise to make more of an effort to play nice with your sister.
- And I promise to make more of an effort not to get attacked by killer mosquitoes.
[She chuckles]
- You can't help it.
They like to suck your blood because you're so sweet.
Ah-ah.
- Hey, Penny.
- Yeah.
- Come here, get a picture of me with fat zombie here.
- You're a child, Max.
- Ooh, that'll be a keeper.
- This is weird.
I've never seen the orb--whoa-- flicker like this
- Really?
What's it saying?
[He gasps]
- What?
- Tactical Bacon is... that way!
- Max.
- Are you hungry, fat zombie?
[Funny voice]:
I want some Tactical Bacon!
- Max.
- Of course you're hungry, fat zombie.
You're a fat zombie.
- Max, we need to investigate the area, OK?
- All right.
Should we investigate the area, fat zombie?
[Funny voice]:
Tactical Bacon now!
- The orb is never wrong, OK?
- Yeah, OK, right.
Well, we'll eat and then we'll check out the area.
But, uh, first, come here, come over here.
Come here.
- Yeah?
I want you to give fat zombie a little kiss.
- Eww, no!
- Why, is it 'cause he's fat?
- No!
- Jesus!
[Gunshot]
- Ah!
- My bad.
So much for your magic orb.
Let's eat.
- Uh, it's still flickering.
- Oh, Christ.
[Gunshot]
Happy?
- No, it's...
it's so strange.
It's a...
- Penny!
- It's as if...
- Tactical Bacon!
[Wolves howling]
[Steve moaning]
- Good morning!
Cory Cortex here, comin' at your undead heads with all the brainformation a hungry mind can handle, here at AM 640, The...
- [Group of people]: ...
Brain!
- Where we get into your heads and sink our teeth into what really matters-- grey matter, that is!
Right now traffic is a real headache.
In fact, it's a bloody mess!
And before you head out to work, you--
- Good morning, husband.
Rise and shine.
- Huh.
Hmm!
[He sighs]
- Come on, sweetie.
Have some breakfast.
- Did someone say breakfast?
[Laugh track]
- Oh, ha-ha!
Muah!
- Oh, hey, Steve.
Oh, that looks good!
You gonna eat all that?
- No, thank you.
Hey, Craig, do you want to go for a run?
- I would, pal, but the weather forecast says there could... be rain.
[Laugh track]
- Would anyone like a smoothie?
- I would.
Oh, no!
Brain freeeeeeeze!
- Well, let us help you with that.
[Slurping]
- Mmm!
- Mmm!
So good!
Steve, you wanna come try this with us?
- Brains.
- Brains.
- Brains!
- Brains.
- Brains?
- THE brain!
- Oh, come on!
- Ah, brains.
- Brains.
- Brains.
[Tina, Sarah, and Craig repeating "brains"]
- Brains.
- Brains.
[Slurping]
- Are you sure I can't help, Tina?
- Nope!
I'm scheduled for breakfast.
And then I have you guys cleaning up, I have Steve and Sarah making lunch, and Craig and I will clean up, and then I have Steve and Craig starting dinner.
If that's cool with you guys.
AND
I even gave everyone colour- coded tabs to avoid confusion!
- Vacation itinerary.
Yay!
[Sarah laughing]
- Good morning!
- Hey,
Pooh bear.
You're up late.
Uh, ooh, no.
- Oh, my God.
You look like shit.
- Nothing a good run won't cure, right?
Everything OK with you girls?
Super.
OK, shall we?
- Don't be late.
I'm making quiche.
- [Steve]:
All right!
[She sighs]
- You know, I could teach you how to cook.
- When you get married, man, it's like a constant battle to hang on to your manhood.
- You guys seem to be doing all right.
- Yeah, well, your sister's pretty cool.
She's like the female version of you.
That's why I married her.
- That's really disturbing.
- Yeah, well, they always say, marry your best friend, and in a weird sort a way
I suppose I did.
- OK, stop.
- To be honest, man, I don't even recognize you anymore.
You're all... safe.
What's the matter?
- Sorry.
I can't find my pulse.
- You should be looking for your balls.
- All right, enough.
You're my best man.
You're supposed to be--
- No, a best man is supposed to be the guy that's telling you exactly the way it is.
and that's what I'm doing.
I've known you since college.
Face it, Steve, you're about to settle into the big sleep...
[Craig's voice muted] [Bird chirping]
[Heartbeat]
[Squeaking]
[Whooshing] [Coughing] Steve!
Listen to me, all right?
Men, we're all wired to be alpha dogs.
Even pussy ones like you who want to be Bill fuckin' Cosby, all right?
And women, they dig alpha dogs.
Even strong-willed bitches like ours.
You want to be happy?
Grow some 'nads, all right?
Don't care about peoples' feelings or expectations.
Take what you want, man.
- Take what you want...
[Loud fart] Oh, God, that's gross, man!
- Come on!
You know what that was?
- Chimichanga?
- No, that was a selfish, thoughtless urge.
And I haven't heard or smelt you fart in like three years.
And do you know why?
'Cause you're not allowed to.
Heh!
Brutal.
- Do me a favour:
don't tell Sarah I was smoking.
How do I smell?
- You smell like ass!
And Mexican food.
Christ!
Eat a salad.
- Jealous.
[Ketchup bottle squirting]
- Steve, you know we're gonna eat at least twice more today, right?
- I can't help it.
I'm starving.
- I'm just happy that you're feeling better, honey.
[Belching]
- Eww!
Gross!
Steve, you know I don't like that.
- I am so sorry.
I don't know what just happened.
- Are you OK?
You look really pale.
too fast, didn't you?
Did you eats too fast?
Is there too many eggies in your little belly?
Are you not feeling very goo-- [Sarah gasps]
[Sarah laughing]
- Excuse me.
- Uh...
I'm just, um...
I'm just gonna make sure he's OK.
I'll be right back.
- I know the itinerary says I'm supposed to clean up... but...
- It's fine.
[He spits]
- Hey.
- Hey.
You're smoking?
I thought you gave it up when you moved in with Craig.
- Yeah, I started again after you proposed to Tina.
[He sighs]
- I don't know what's happening to me.
- You're marrying a fuckin' bitch?
- Don't start, please.
Why can't you just try to get along?
- I'm sorry, Steve, but I don't like her.
And I resent you for guilting me into being her matron of honour.
- I'm happy with Tina.
- Steve, you look like shit, OK?
And I think maybe this is your body's way of telling you something that your brain is afraid to.
- OK, I'm giving up a few things here and there.
That's it.
That's what a relationship is!
I'm not like you, Sarah.
I'm not--
- A bitch?
- No.
I'm not... super strongly opinionated.
All I want is to be content.
Satisfied.
Not struggling or hungry for anything.
- Well, then you're already dead.
Don't you want more to live for?
- I'm happy with the way things are.
Please, just...
just be nice.
- Fine.
If that's what you want.
- It is.
Thank you.
- Are you feeling any better?
- I'm still really hungry, actually.
- Well, I wouldn't recommend the quiche.
It was made by a fucking gutter cunt.
- Whoa!
[Sarah laughs]
- Sorry, I'm just getting my fill while I can.
Don't tell Craig I was smoking, K?
I'm going to go hose the puke off your bride to be.
?
- Max.
These readings are like nothing I've ever seen before.
- That piece o' shit's a thousand years old, Penny.
The warranty is long gone.
- Max, the orb is fine, OK?
It's these readings-- they're just, uh, different.
We have to interpret them.
- That's your department, sweet cheeks.
- Look, I, I can't be sure, but, um...
I think we might have a mutation on our hands.
- Mutated zombies?
Bring it!
- No, um, I don't think it's a zombie, actually.
- I thought that thing only searched out meat puppets.
- Well, I mean, it could be, but I also t--
Max?
Max...
Max!
Max!
Jesus Christ!
- OK, where's all the little lightning bolts?
- Uh, well, well, that's, that's the thing.
I mean, I mean, the charges indicate the presence of zombie DNA, so when one is near, it activates.
But this flickering could indicate a hybrid.
- Hybrid?
What, you mean like a fuckin' hippie car?
- No, Max, like a...
fucking resistant host.
- Oh, Christ, that reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.
- Max, this could be exactly what I've been looking for-
- Waaaah!
- Oh, Penny, for Christ's sake, that's the last time you drive.
- Look Max, this could be exactly what I've been looking for, OK?
A person with the genetic make-up to resist the symptoms!
- I'm tellin' ya, Penny, the only good zombie is a dead zombie.
- No, no, no.
This could be why the orb has been acting so strangely.
And if we can capture this... person, we could extract their DNA and find a vaccine, Max!
- Yeah, well, dream on.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, buddy!
- Where you guys going?
- Into town.
You wanna come?
- No, Steve should stay here and get some rest.
- Baby, I am so sorry about--
- Ah, it's OK.
It's just... you're not feeling well.
You know?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ooh!
Ugh...
Just... go lie down.
- K.
- Yeah.
- Have fun!
- [Sarah]:
We won't!
- Max!
Max!
Pull in!
Pull in here!
[Thunderclap]
[Thunder]
- Oh, Sarah, it looks like you're not gonna get any sun this weekend.
It's OK!
I'll book you a spray tan before the wedding.
Hi.
Are you guys lost?
- Oh, uh, no.
We, um, are actually here because--
- Have you kids seen any zombies.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, we're looking for, uh, a, uh, undead creature.
Humanoid-lookin'.
Possibly, uh, droolin' and, uh, eatin' people's brains.
- OK, what my associate is trying to say is that there has been a Stage 1 outbreak--
- Oh, come on, Penny, we haven't got time for that.
- I recognize you guys from somewhere!
- Here we go.
- No, I totally saw you guys online!
- Because my motto is:
the only good zombie is a dead zombie.
[Host laughing]
- That's ridiculous!
[Laughing] [Laughing]
- Fuck.
No, fuck you!
- Ahhhhhhhhh!
- Fuck you!
- What were you doing on a website called
Never mind that.
All right, no, seriously, you guys are fucking hilarious!
And you, dude, you've got some real talent, all right?
"Only good zombie's a dead zombie!"
So fuckin' cheese, that is awesome, man!
[Max spits] Eww, gross!
What the fuck?
!
- What the fuck?
You're the fuck!
- Craig, get in the car!
- Why the fuck do I gotta get in the car?
He should get in the car.
Fucker spit on me!
- Just get in the car, Craig!
- Yeah, Craig get in the car.
- Get in the van, Max.
- Don't tell me to get in the van, Penny.
- Max, I need you to trust my judgement right now and get in the van.
- You want me to get in the van?
I'll get in the fuckin' van.
- Thank you, Max!
I'm sorry.
Um, he's been under a lot of stress lately.
- Right.
- Hey, P!
- Yeah?
- This is what I think of your fuckin' judgement!
- Whoa!
Max!
Max, no!
Oh, my God!
- Ha-ha-ha!
Fucking hilarious!
- [Max]:
Shut up!
- Max, what did you do?
- Fuck...
- Oh, my God.
This is bad.
Uh... do you have any, uh, crazy glue?
- No.
We have to go now.
- OK, no, I understand, um, but IF you see anything that's out of the ordinary, you can give us a call right there.
Penel-- that's me on the bottom there.
And I also have this for you.
Um... if you could just help--
It sticks.
Can you grab that?
- Yeah, no problem.
- Right here is... this!
- Ah.
- It's complimentary, and you can just give it a read.
When you have a moment.
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, sorry to bother you.
yeah.
OK, Bye.
- OK.
Bye-bye.
- Max!
Wait!
Wait!
Max!
Max!
- What a bunch of crazies.
- [Penny]:
This is not funny!
Max, it's not funny!
- Undead creature?
Humanoid-looking.
Yeah.
Probably drooling... and eating somebody's...
[Laughing]
Ohhhh!
Eating somebody's brains.
Ugh!
Ugh!
Brains?
Ah!
Mm!
Mm!
I want brai-- Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm!
Mm-mmm!
Mm-mmm!
Mm-mmm!
No I don't!
No I don't!
I want, um...
I want a...!
Pecan pie!
Mmm!
Pecan pie!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Yeah!
This is so delicious!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Damn it!
I want brains.
Ugh!
Oh, God!
I'm a zombie!
I'm a god damned zombie.
Tina's gonna kill me.
[Stomach rumbling]
[Heartbeat]
No.
Yes.
Groovy.
Ouch!
Ahhhh...
Whew!
?
All right, you little bastards.
Food chain ends here.
- ?
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ?
?
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ?

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ?

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ?

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ?

Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ?
?
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ?
- Oh, my God, it's moving.
Oh.
I don't know, Muffins.
Maybe I should just give up, turn myself in.
I'm a pretty crappy zombie.
Come here.
Come here, big guy.
Ohhhh.
Are you scared?
Sorry I scared you, buddy.
You thought I was going to eat you, didn't you?
Yeah, you thought I was going to eat you.
You thought I was going to eat your brain!
[Muffins squeaking] [Crunching]
[Door opening and closing] - [Craig]:
Wooo!
- [Tina]:
Did you take your fucking adrenaline?
- Steve.
- [Tina]:
I don't know how you think you're gonna eat an entire watermelon--
[Tina gasps]
- Hi!
- Let me get this straight.
You think that you are a zombie?
- Little bit.
- Tina, this is ridiculous!
Look at the pressure that you're putting on him for this stupid wedding!
- What?
!
My rabbit just died!
- Oh, God, it was a glorified rat!
- Stop it!
You heard the guy in the driveway.
They said they were looking for me.
- Oh, God.
- Steve, this is the real world,
OK?
That guy was a psycho.
There are no such thing as zombies!
- Then how do you explain the brains?
Ugh!
Damn it!
- Oh, my God.
Gross!
My fiancé doesn't eat brains.
- Ugh.
Can we please not say that word?
- Actually, I think he does eat... brains.
- Ugh.
- Exhibit fuckin' A.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Steve, we are getting married, and you are just freaking out.
Lots of men do this before the big day.
- Honey, I obviously have a problem here.
- You have a problem?
I have a problem!
Do you know how many people are coming to our wedding?
How many meals I've skipped to fit into that $5,000 dress?
And now my fiancé tells me that he doesn't want to marry me by killing my rabbit!
- Baby, listen to me.
I love you.
Of course
I'm going to marry you!
This isn't cold feet.
I'm sick!
- Really?
Really, Steve?
OK, if you're a zombie, then how come you're not trying to eat my face?
- I don't know!
I don't want to.
I couldn't hurt anybody.
But baby, I...
I really need to eat!
I am so freakin' hungry right now!
I can't even eat regular food!
- So what do we do?
- We find me something I can eat.
- That's it?
- Yes!
It's not a big deal!
- I'm sorry, uh, no big deal?
Dude, you're a fucking zombie!
This is a huge deal.
- All right, everybody, let's just calm down.
Craig, does that book say anything about food?
- Page one.
- Mmm!
All right!
Just listen.
I feel great.
All right?
I feel good, I really do!
I just need to find myself some...
Mmm!
You know?
So I'm gonna go to the store and get them.
- We're coming with you.
- Thank you.
- No!
- I'll go change.
- This is bullshit.
He's not a zombie.
- Of course he's not.
But I'm gonna call him on it.
If he wants brains, I will get him brains.
I'll even mash them up and I will spoon feed him if I have to.
But afterwards, he's gonna tell me what this is really about.
- So... should I put this in the freezer?
- Really, Craig?
- Maybe a stew?
- [Steve]:
Look at this place, look at this!
This looks great!
- [Tina]:
Um...
OK.
- [Sarah]:
Creative Meats.
Gross.
- [Tina]:
Ew.
- [Steve]:
Don't be rude.
- [Sarah]:
I didn't realize meat was a medium for expressing creativity.
[Tina sighs]
- Oh, dude!
What are ya...?
Whoa.
This place looks like a Civil War field hospital or something.
- Craig, a little positive thinking.
- Guys, look.
Skunk meat!
- Fresh skunk meat!
- [All]:
Ah!
- You look like a gal with an adventurous palate.
You know, raccoon is more subtle than you might think, despite it's popular reputation as a garbage feeder.
Yes, ma'am, I do love me some 'coon meat!
- Who doesn't?
Ha-ha-ha-ha...
- Actually, we're looking for something, a...
little off the menu.
- Pardon me, sir, but this establishment does not condone the sale of illegal firearms.
I am but a simple butcher.
But, just out of curiosity, what type and calibre are we talking about?
- Ohhh.
No, actually, thank you.
Um, we're actually looking for some... brains.
- And maybe some of that racoon meat.
- Eww!
- What?
He made it...
he made it sound kinda good.
- Did I just hear you right, boy?
Did you just ask me for... brains?
- Yes.
- Well, hot dog!
I'm a brain man myself!
Wa-hooo!
This is your lucky day, muchacho
I don't get as much call for brains, on account of the cholesterol.
But I'll tell ya,
I'll take me a mass of pan-fried calves' brains over a rack of ribs 10 out of 10!
- Ugh!
- Sure.
Ha-ha!
Me too.
- These just came in this morning.
- Oh-ho-ho!
This is messed up.
- Yeah, I'm gonna be in the car.
- Now, these little ones are appetizer size.
Great for holiday entertaining.
We got squirrel, muskrat, and those little ones there, them's rattlesnake.
Choice eating, those!
[Steve gulps]
- May I?
- I'm not big on free samples... but I don't get many chances to eat brains with a fellow gourmand, as it were, so...
Cheers.
- Steve!
That's enough.
You're not actually gonna eat that, are you?
- Oh, yeah.
- I will be in the car.
- Well, I guess it's a table for two, monsieur!
Unless...
- Oh, no.
No, I'm good.
Yeah.
- Mmm!
- Just like a little candy, right, Stevie?
- They are delicious!
- You like 'em raw, too!
A man after my own heart.
Mmm!
- What are those ones there?
- Oh, these are simply divine!
Here we got skunk, owl, Canadian beaver, and rabbit.
- Oh, rabbit!
Your favourite!
Too soon?
- Mm...
- And this... is la pièce de résistance.
This is genuine, Grade A, all-American grizzly bear brain.
It is to die for.
- It's beautiful.
- Grill this baby low and slow for--
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, he's gonna pay for that.
That's $19.99 a pound.
- Ahh.
Ahhh!
- So?
How do you feel?
- OK.
You know what?
I feel OK.
- We'll take it.
We'll take it all.
- Yeah!
Ha-ha-ha!
- See that?
Good as new.
You wanna kiss and make up?
- Pull over there.
- You want to stay here?
- Uh, listen.
Between the crazy glue and the painkillers for your foot, we have gone way over budget, OK?
So now we are roughing it.
Don't even!
- Fine.
I like it rough.
- Then don't moisturize your hand.
- OK, but you have to spit on it.
- I will glue that hand to your face!
[Max laughing] Remove your hand.
Kindly remove your hand right now.
- Give me a little.
- That's real mature, Max.
[Max laughing]
You have pushed me to my limit.
- Can you please not do that right now?
- What?
- Eat like a fuckin' zombie pig!
- Craig, you're not helping.
- No.
I'm not, because I'm not a zombie collaborator.
- SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
YOU SHUT UP!
YOU SHUT UP!
- Ow!
What the fuck?
!
- Oh, my God!
- OK.
- Don't touch me right now!
- Look, I know this is a lot to take in, but it's really gonna be OK.
- Really?
How?
- Yeah, how?
- Here's an idea:
why don't we talk about this in the cabin?
- Oh, no, I think we should talk about this on the way home.
- Yeah, I agree.
I'll start packing.
- Guys!
Wait!
Great.
Thanks, Craig.
- Eat me!
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Would you two just please stop it!
- OK, damn it!
I know that you're scared, all right?
I am too.
- I'm not afraid.
- There's no reason for us to be treating each other like this.
Now, I'm starting to feel better.
The hunger's not so bad anymore.
Now, someone please tell me where are my snake brains are.
- They're in your hand.
- Which hand?
- The one in the car.
[Tina gasps]
- Oh, oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry, baby!
- That's amazing!
I don't even feel that!
- [Sarah]:
What do you mean?
- I don't feel it.
At all.
- It doesn't hurt?
- Nope!
- Seriously?
- It's fine!
I'm OK!
- [Craig]:
No pain?
- Uh-uh.
- Let's do that again.
- No!
- This is stupid!
- No, its actually pretty cool.
- OK, you could warn me next time.
- Oh, look, you, uh, dropped your little bag of snacks there.
Let me get that for ya.
- What the fuck, Craig!
- That was awesome!
- OK, that was a good one.
- No, but seriously, we should get you to a hospital.
- Why?
I mean, aside from the brains and a little numbness, I'm fine.
Besides, when it comes down to it, it's really just a dietary restriction.
- Yeah, it's like that chick I know, uh, what's her face?
Um, she's allergic to gluten and shit.
What's her face?
Fuck.
- It's me, you idiot!
Your wife?
I'm gluten intolerant!
- Steve,
I just want you to feel like yourself again.
- I do, Tina.
I feel great!
And you know what?
I'm happy.
And I'm in love with you.
- Ugh...
[Craig gags]
- OK, we can stay.
- Seriously?
Am I the only one that sees a problem with this?
You can't feel pain!
You eat brains!
- I don't even want to eat brains... that much.
Look, I promise, the first second that I feel bad, we'll go home.
All right?
- Fine.
But for the record, this is a bad idea.
- Lets just try to have some fun.
- Oh!
?
[Laughing]
Woo!
- ?
...go away
?
Even though I didn't want to let go ?
?
Why can't you see that what you're looking for ?
- Oh!
Huh?
Hey!
- ?
And you're never gonna let it show ?
- Ah!
[Laughing]
- ?
...girl like you
?
You you you you you you you you ?
?
No, no, I don't miss you now ?
?
But I will never find another one ?
?
No, no, you don't miss me now ?
?
But you will never...
- Woo!
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah!
- ?
...never find another one
- I feel great!
[Retching]
[Coughing]
Oh, my God!
[Steve retching]
[Retching and farting]
[Continuous retching]
[Steve groaning] - [Steve]:
Oh, kill me!
- That's it, we have to get him to the hospital.
- He's fine.
Look at all the stuff he did today.
- Tina, he's not a superhero;
he's undead!
I think he's getting worse.
- How could this be worse?
- Look.
Right here it says:
"The undead host must consume living "human cerebral tissue.
Any dead or non-human tissue will eventually be rejected."
- Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?
- Animal brains are like junk food.
It's like he's yakking up zombie mini doughnuts.
- Why didn't you tell us about this before?
- What?
I hadn't gotten that far.
Look at how thick this bitch is!
- Nooo, my Steve is gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK.
He's gonna be OK just in time for the wedding.
- Tina, if this keeps up, by next week we'll be at his funeral.
- Oh, hey, buddy.
You get it all out?
- Oh, my God, Steve.
You look like death!
That's it, Tina.
We have to take him to the hospital now!
- Enough!
He's fine.
He's fine!
We are not taking him to some back-water hospital.
He's fine.
You just need some rest, right, baby?
You just need some rest, that's all.
[She gasps]
- Ahhh...
Ah!
- Oh, my God!
- Holy fuck, dude!
That is your ear!
- OK, I draw the line at things falling off my brother's face.
Craig, get the car.
- Finally.
See you guys, later.
- No, they're coming with us.
- Son of a fuck!
- No!
We are not going anywhere!
Craig, go upstairs right now and get my cosmetic kit.
- Right.
- This is fucked.
- Honey, I see women that are way worse come into my salon, and you know what?
After I'm done with them, they're like, like new people!
- I'm in pretty bad shape, Tina.
- Look at me.
You and I are going to be doing the chicken dance with my Nonna at our wedding in one week.
OK?
But right now my man looks like shit, so we have some work to do.
Sarah, go get me a paper towel.
- Tina, you're not seri--
- Now!
Craig,
I need you to take Steve's ear and rinse it off.
- Fuck that noise!
- [Sarah]:
Craig!
[He grumbles]
- What's that?
- Oh, it's eyelash adhesive.
Yeah.
- Oh--
- Oh!
[Laughing nervously]
- What?
Just say they're piercings.
I'm not fucking touching it.
- Ugh...
OK...
Heh-heh...
Now, just... hold... still.
OK?
And...
[Stapling]
- Ugh!
RESYNC BY BSpidey87
- Ahhhhh!
Ahhh, I feel like Frankenstein.
Thank you for being so sweet.
- Honey, I'm not giving up on you because of some eating disorder or, or a missing ear.
This wouldn't even turn a head at my family dinner table.
- I love you, baby.
- OK, now, stay straight.
You don't want to have crooked ears.
No. 'Cause my man has perfect ears.
- As long as he looks fine for your fucking wedding.
- Craig, can you come here for a sec?
- What?
- Hold this.
- Gross!
- Don't move, either of you.
Sarah, can I talk to you in the other room for a second?
- You sure can.
- Great.
- Whoa, wait.
Where are you guys going?
- [Sarah]:
We'll be back.
- So, uh... zombie dick?
- Yeah, its pretty bad.
- So, what now, Tina?
You want to talk about the fringe on my matron of honour dress?
- All right, that is... it!
- What the fuck?
!
You just punched my tit!
- Come on, tough girl.
You got a problem with me?
Let's see what you-
- Oww!
Ow!
Jesus!
You punch like a man!
- What the hell is your problem?
!
- I just want us to get this out of our systems so that we can work together and help Steve.
- So you punch me in the tit?
!
What are you, 12?
- You're kind of a bad ass, so I...
I needed an advantage.
- Yeah?
Well, this bad ass is about to kick your ass!
If you're done playing zombie makeover with him, we can actually get him some god damn professional help.
[Tina screams]
- What the...?
- Yeah, and those people that came by, they seem like real humanitarians.
- Tina!
Sarah!
- Don't move that ear!
- Yeah, Steve.
This is hot.
- I'm sick of you and your Little Miss Perfect bullshit!
- Ugh!
- Girls!
- Just a bit longer.
- Don't you even!
Ah!
Stop it!
[Tina shrieking]
I hate you!
[Yelling]
You!
- Bitch!
[Shrieking]
[Yelling in pain]
- Emo slut!
- Plastic whore!
[Steve growling]
[Steve roaring]
- Enough!
Tina!
Try talking to Sarah!
- Fine!
Sarah, you're a bitch!
- Tina!
Stop using judgemental language, get to the heart of your conflict, and empathize with her point of view.
And Sarah, stop being so defensively aggressive and be an active listener.
- OK.
Sarah, I know how much you love your brother, and I know that you don't think that I'm right for him.
But I love him.
Right now, he's Steve.
But if we don't come up with something, he's gonna turn into a monster.
- He already is, you morons!
Look at him.
He needs... brains.
- Ugh.
- Ah, gross.
- OK...
Craig is right.
- Of course I'm right.
The book says I'm right.
- And they're gonna have to be human too.
But maybe I just need a bit.
Just enough so that I can function.
- What do you have in mind?
- I'm going to go into town.
I'm going to find somebody that won't be missed.
And I'm gonna eat their fucking brains.
[Tina, Craig, and Sarah laughing]
- Come on.
- [Craig]:
That's rich.
- No, you're not.
- There's no way, Steve.
- What?
- Honey, I just accidentally pulled your ear off.
You're in no condition to hunt.
- Well, what then?
- I have an idea.
- Jesus!
Fff!
Look what you've done to our women, Steve.
And who the fuck packs hooker boots for a weekend at the cottage?
- I do, and you don't have to be involved if you're afraid.
- We're just afraid that you girls are gonna get into trouble.
- Honey, everything is gonna be fine.
- Family takes care of family.
- Yeah, and we're family, all right--the fuckin' Manson family!
So what are you girls gonna do Bring back some sorry prick so he can eat him.
- Wow.
Thug life.
Great.
- Steve, if we get someone, can you go through with this?
- I'm sure my zombie instincts will just kick in.
But get somebody really old.
Or like a real asshole.
- How about a really old asshole?
- Do you want a man or do you want a woman?
- Oh.
A man.
Definitely.
I don't think I could eat a woman.
- Gay.
Way to go, Steve.
You're the first gay-ass zombie.
You're really breaking a lot of ground this weekend.
- Craig, shut up.
Seriously, we have to... we have to get someone that you're gonna hate so you can...
I dunno, kill them without remorse.
Like a...
like a pedophile or a meth dealer.
- Or a hipster.
I really hate hipsters.
- Or a parking cop.
I hate those bastards.
- I hate the Portuguese.
Uh... um, anyways, you just need to make sure you're ready to do what you have to do when we come back.
- Craig'll help you get ready.
- What?
Fuck that!
- Come on.
[Sarah sighs]
- So, if, uh, things don't work out between you and Tina, and you decide to marry a gay zombie,
I do support your decision.
But I wont be at the reception, because I don't eat cock or brains.
- Yeah, you're hilarious there!
- Yeah, so I RSVP "no"
to gay zombie wedding.
Yup.
So long, Muffins.
- This place reminds me of where my parents would take me camping every summer.
- My father... sent me to a survival camp in the Philippines when I was nine.
They, uh, dropped me in the jungle in the middle of a monsoon.
I had to survive for seven days.
- Your father did that to you?
- It was my birthday.
I'm tellin' ya, though, those seven days...
made me tough.
Tough enough to take anything that comes my way.
Alive or undead.
- Max, why do you hate zombies so much?
I mean, what if your mother turned into a zombie?
What would you do?
- Shoot her in the face.
- You would not shoot your mother in the face if she was in a coma.
- No.
If she was in a coma, she wouldn't be trying to turn my head into a god damned fondue pot.
- Right.
Well, if we find this resistant host, we could find a vaccine.
You'd be a hero, Max.
- You're right, I am a god damn hero.
I'm tired of waiting for your orb to tell us what to do.
We're gonna do this my way!
- Uh, where are we going?
- To get some bait.
?
- Him?
He looks old.
Kinda.
- He looks like he could have Alzheimer's.
Is that contagious?
- This is just evil!
- Suck it up, Sarah.
Your brother needs us.
- Look.
Soul patch.
That guy's a douche for sure.
- He's too fat.
He's like a walking bucket of chicken.
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Sarah, you need to take that terrified look off your face,
OK?
We're not gonna get anyone unless you throw out a certain vibe.
- What kind of vibe?
- Watch and learn.
- Wow.
That's sexy.
- I know, right?
OK, now you try.
Relax, throw your shoulders back, and wipe that look off your face.
- OK, how's this look?
- Like you're having a pap smear.
- Ugh!
This isn't going to work!
- We can do this, Sarah!
- I just don't know how we're gonna pick somebody.
- We'll figure it out.
You know, just keep our eyes open and eventually somebody'll just end up in our laps.
[Growling]
- Oh, my God!
- What the fuck!
My car!
- Tina.
Look.
[Chuckling]
Big scary guy is checking us out.
Hi.
[Chuckling]
- Huh.
That big scary guy is a dead man.
Hey.
- Are you crazy?
She's crazy.
- OK.
So, apparently, eight bones make up the neurocranium.
So it's like a bone vault for the brain and brain stem.
This part over here is the parietal.
So, this little sucker is like a quarter of an inch thick and hard as shit.
All right, so you're gonna have to Babe Ruth smash the shit out of this thing so you can have access to the cerebral cortex.
- Got it.
Oh, that smells good.
Mmm!
- What the fuck, dude!
- What?
- You just smelled my fucking brain!
- No.
Let's not jump to conclusions here.
No, all right, you're a fucking monster!
- Craig!
- Just stay the fuck away from me, all right?
Gay-ass zombie!
- God damn!
?
[Man chuckling]
- Wow!
That is so... hot!
My, uh... woman parts like you too.
Ha-ha-ha...
Ugh, how is he still standing?
He's had enough booze to knock out a rhino!
- Don't worry, it's OK.
I have a plan.
Just get him in the back seat.
- Are you fucking joking me?
No fucking way!
- Don't worry, he's harmless.
[Man laughing]
- Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
- Oh, my God!
[Man laughing]
[Laughing]
- Come on!
I need you to suck it up, and be sexy, and get him in the back seat!
Come on!
Go!
Get outta here!
- Hey... big man.
So... so, you wanna, you wanna go for a ride?
Stud monkey.
You make Mommy so horny!
[Tina laughing] What?
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Go ahead, get in.
- Hey, there.
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-- [Zapping]
- Ahhh!
[Tina laughing]
- You have a pink stun gun?
- Yeah.
It's cute, right?
[Zapping] OK, lets go!
I'll drive!
- Wait!
What about me?
[Buzzer]
- Pizza, pizza, pizza!
Ha-ho!
Pizza!
[Buzzer] Pizza, pizza!
- Max.
- Pizza, pizza, pizza!
Ha-ha!
Evening, young lady.
- Hello!
Are you, uh, Captain Cletus?
- Where's the pizza?
- The...
No, uh, sorry.
We are actually here for something else.
- Ma'am, if you are implying I might be in possession of illegal firearms, I will kindly ask you to leave--
- No, we don't want guns, Admiral Redneck.
We need brains.
- Uh...
Max.
[Gun cocked]
- Ya'll have a good night, now.
- No wait, OK, all we want is brains.
- Sorry, Missy, no can do.
Somebody cleaned me out earlier today.
- Who?
- Bunch of kids.
Now beat it.
- No, wait!
Can you tell us anything else about them?
- Couple o' pretty-looking ladies was hanging with some queer-looking feller and another that couldn't get enough of my brains!
Now, git!
- That's our zombie, Penny.
Come on.
- The cottage!
No, Max, wait!
If the infected one hasn't eaten the others yet, it must mean that he's resisting the infection!
Which is wonderful!
Shit!
Where is that cottage?
- Hey, man, did you order the Vegetarian Nightmare?
Extra Polish sausage, German sausage, Belgian Sausage,
Russian sausage--
- Nope.
- Fuckin' hate this job.
- Ugh!
Oh, God.
Ugh!
[Panting]
[Panting] OK.
Oh, God.
Ugh!
- [Steve]:
What the hell!
I have been worried sick!
- Shut up, Steve!
Oh, baby, you look kinda better, that's good, but shut up.
You need to help us carry this in.
- This is ridiculous.
We need a dolly or something.
Where's Craig?
- Uh...
sleeping, I think.
- Sleeping?
!
- What?
- Yeah!
I can help.
- OK.
- Come on.
OK, I'll take his legs, or--
- Oh, my God!
How did you get this guy?
!
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
- [Steve]:
Holy crap!
This is ridiculous!
Are you girls pulling?
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!
- Fuckin' freak family.
[Panting]
- OK, we softened him up for you.
- That guy is huge!
- I know, honey, but he's out cold.
Are you ready?
- Oh this is crazy.
You girls just kidnapped a guy!
- [Sarah]:
And now you're gonna eat him!
- OK, listen to me.
This is very important.
This is our new lifestyle, OK?
And if we're gonna walk down the aisle together, then we both just need to embrace this.
- OK, all right.
He's all tied up and he's still out of it.
I wouldn't wait too long.
- All right.
I'm gonna go downstairs and eat this guy!
- [Sarah and Tina]:
OK.
- Thank you!
You've both have been so incredible.
I'm so happy to see the two of you working together so well.
You know, I think if this weekend has taught us anything--
- Steve, just GO!
- Wah!
- Love you!
- Wait, wait, wait!
Here!
- Oh, my God!
Boots are killing me!
- Oof!
Ugh!
OK...
- I can smell his undead ass.
- Max, we haven't gotten a reading from the orb.
We've been driving around in circles for hours.
OK, you have all the bells and whistles in here.
You have this!
Who do you even talk to in this?
And yet you don't have a NAV system!
- I don't need a fucking computer.
I'm a fucking professional!
I can feel when they're close by.
I don't need a fucking piece of technology.
- [Ring tone]:
You're a stone-cold killer.
- You're a stone-cold killer.
You're a stone-cold killer.
- Get it.
- You're a stone-cold--
- Hello?
- Hey.
Uh, y-you guys came by my place today.
It's my friend, he's turned into a zombie.
- OK, uh, uh, calm down, and, uh, where are you?
- Uh, it's 42 Clear Lake Drive.
- 42 Clear Lake Drive.
- Who is it?
- Oh, we're close!
- Who is it?
!
you're just going to do tests, you're not gonna hurt him?
Your gonna make him back to normal again, right?
- Of course.
He's gonna be in good hands--
- You're fucking right he'll be in good hands.
Who the fuck is this?
- Who the fuck is this?
- Hey, calm the fuck down, pal.
- I don't want to calm the fuck down.
Fuck you, fucker!
You calm the fuck down!
- You fucking relax!
- No, you go fuck yourself and get the fuck over here, you fucker!
- No, you fuck yourself, you fuck!
- Fuck you.
- Fuck!
FUUUUUUUCK!
- Max!
Max, really?
[Gunshot]
Those things practically have feelings.
- Not anymore.
- Ha!
[Laughing]
That's stupid.
Mmm... no.
[Grunting]
Just do it!
Mmm.
- Hey.
- What the hell are you guys doing with all those guns?
- Hey there, pumpkin.
Nice of you to call us about your little friend-- 12 hours too late.
- You promised me you weren't gonna hurt him.
- No, no, no.
No, no, we won't hurt him, OK?
We promise.
Right, Max?
We won't hurt him.
- You stay here with sugar tits.
I got this one.
- No, wait, Max.
Max, this one is different.
OK, we cannot waste this opportunity.
It'd be like throwing away the cure for cancer.
OK, Max, listen!
- No, you listen!
Zombies are good for only one thing:
killing'.
- Max, we need this guy, OK?
[Penny gasps]
- No, no!
- Christ.
- [Penny]:
No, no, no, no!
- I don't need anybody.
[He groans]
Mmm...
- This orb was centuries... old.
- Lady, fuck your orb, all right?
Make sure that maniac doesn't hurt my friend!
[Door busted open] - [Max]:
Where is he?
- No, you don't understand!
- Don't you touch my brother!
- Where is he?
!
- Sorry, pal.
[Grunting with effort]
[Yelling]
- Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the door!
- No!
- Open the door!
Open the door!
- [Sarah and Tina]:
No!
- Open the door!
Open the door!
Girls!
Girls!
Open the door!
Ah!
[Big man growling]
[Yelling] [Gunshot]
- Is that--
- Yes!
It is.
- You promised me you weren't gonna hurt him!
- Wait!
You called them?
!
- Uh-oh.
Awkward.
Hey!
What the hell is that?
- Oh, just hundreds of years of mystical antiquity that you selfishly discar--
- Oh, for Christ's sake, Penny, get over it!
- I wanna say goodbye to him.
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No, it's...
it's pretty messy.
- Thank you so much for coming.
I don't know what we would have done without you.
- Well, luckily, Little Miss Braveheart over here, she had the good sense to give us a call when she did.
Way to go, pumpkin.
Now you can sew a big, fat "Courage" badge on your Girl Scout sash.
Great big badge in the shape of a lion, giving you two thumbs up.
How about that, huh?
'Cause you are such a mature young woman.
You may even get asked to the junior prom where you can get fingered in the cafetorium, right next--
- You know what?
Fuck you, asshole!
All right?
That was my best friend!
- And we are so sorry for your loss, and we will personally--
- You know what?
Why are you OK with this?
Your brother's dead!
- You're right!
It's, it's, it's horrible!
You, you monsters!
Get the fuck out of here!
- Yes, yes, yeah, yeah!
You know what?
You guys are animals!
Leave now!
- OK, you're right.
Let's blow, Penny.
- [Penny]:
I'm sorry.
[Noise inside truck]
- What the fuck?
!
[Steve gasps]
- Hi.
Ugh!
- Holy fuck, Steve!
You're OK!
Did you see me?
I was fucking crying and everything!
Did you see?
- Nice try, zombie.
Now, get read¦÷ to say your prayers... in hell!
- No!
- Get out of the way.
- No!
You are not gonna shoot him, because we are getting married in six days!
- Don't make me shoot through ya.
- No!
Don't you see?
He's not a complete zombie!
He's still human!
- Max, you idiot!
Don't you see this is it?
He's resisting the infection.
This is our chance to find the cure!
- Oh, yeah, sure, you'd like that, wouldn't ya?
A nice little guinea pig that you can study and make everything all better.
Then everybody gets booster shots and lollipops and there are no more zombies.
Let me tell you something, sister.
The only shot that cures a zombie comes out of the end of this sweet little baby right here.
[Girls gasping in fear]
Suck it up, brain junkie, 'cause you ain't getting a lolli after this one.
- [Craig]:
No!
- Get off me, you bitch.
Happy honeymoon.
- Ah!
[Sarah yelling]
- Shit!
- Whoa!
Hey!
[Max groaning]
- Do it, Steve!
- Yeah, eat that fucker's head!
- Oh, God, messy fucker.
- I can't do this.
Ah... it's time to face the fact that I'm, uh, whatever this is.
And whatever this is is not safe to be around.
- Oh, Steve, dude, seriously, I am so sorry I called you a gay-ass zombie all right?
We can put you on an island somewhere, all right?
Somewhere far away.
We'll come visit, like at Christmas and shit, right?
- Steve, think about this.
[Sarah sobbing]
- Sarah, I can't be this selfish.
I can't go on having people in my life be accessory to murder.
- No, Steve!
No!
- You'll take care of her, yeah?
- Steve, please, give me the gun.
- I am so sorry, Tina.
I really wish I could be there for all of it-- for the chicken dance with your Nonna, eating our wedding cake, seeing you in your dress.
I love you.
- I love you, Steve.
?
- All right.
Where do you wanna do this?
You want to, uh... go around the back?
Or what do you wanna do?
- [Penny]:
Max, let's talk about this!
- Whoa!
Here?
!
Really?
!
Now?
!
Are you sure?
!
- I just want you to know, of all the zombies I've encountered, you're... the most human.
- Please.
Not in front of my girl.
- All right.
- Oh!
- The only good zombie...
is a dead zom-- [Gunshot]
[Gasping]
- Shit...
[Body hits the ground]
I was aiming for his leg.
[Shocked laughter]
- Holy fuck, lady!
You just, like, totally wasted your boyfriend!
- He was not my boyfriend.
He was the muscle.
OK, Steve?
Steve.
Here's how it is.
Um...
I could put you down right now, if that's what you want me to do.
Or, you can come with me, and we can see if we can't find a cure for this, uh, this thing.
Now, I-I-I can't promise any thing, b-b-but
I will use all of my resources, I will work day and night,
I will use my education until we find a way to beat this infection.
Oh, and, and when we're done with this and we find a cure...
you'll be a hero.
- Really?
- I'll be a hero.
But, uh, but you'll be a celebrity, which is...
pretty much as good.
- Dude, we are gonna be famous!
- So, what do you say, Steve?
- All right, I'll-- [Gunshot]
- Ahh!
[Gasping]
- Baby!
Are you all right?
- You fucking moron!
- We're safe now.
Everything is gonna be fine!
- You are a fucking moron!
She was gonna help us.
She was gonna help Steve!
You ruined everything!
- She was gonna hurt him, Craig!
OK?
!
She wanted to use him for experiments!
- No, we were gonna be celebrities!
On the internet!
Or at least on fucking TV!
- Everything was gonna be fine!
- EVERYTHING IS FINE!
FUCK!
Look at Steve!
Steve!
You're all...
happy!
- Hi, Tina.
- Oh!
Hi, baby.
Everything is gonna be OK.
We are gonna get married, we are gonna be happy, and we are gonna be fine.
I think I may have fucked up a little bit at the end there, but its OK, 'cause we made it!
- Baby.
- I love you.
- I love brains!
?
- ?
Hey, hey, hey!
?
Hey, hey, hey!
- ?
It was a bad idea
?
To give me this kind of time ?
?
When they said "You're gonna be ?
?
In solitary confinement"
?
While the other inmates
?
Are outside lifting barbells
?
I'm in an 8x10
?
Prison cell
?
But in the night of the sun ?

Hey, hey, hey!

The night of the sun

Hey, hey, hey!

The night of the sun
- ?
Hey, hey, hey!
- ?
The night of the sun
- ?
New state officials
?
Are outside running around
?
And they're telling the public ?
?
That I need to be put down ?
?
And Washington's saying
?
Emphatically
?
That I wasn't doing things
?
Democratically
?
But in the night of the sun ?

Hey, hey, hey!

The night of the sun

Hey, hey, hey!

The night of the sun

Hey, hey, hey!

The night of the sun

The sun!

It was a bad idea - ?
It was a bad idea
- ?
To give me this kind of time ?
- ?
To give me this kind of time ?
- ?
It was a bad idea
?
- It's worse than horrible because a zombie has no will of his own, walking around blindly with dead eyes.
- ?
I'm a zombie girl in a zombie world ?
?
When I see you, boy, you make my head twirl ?
?
Fall in, fall in, fall in, fall in ?
?
I'm a zombie girl in a zombie world ?
?
When I see you, boy, you make my head twirl ?
?
Fall in, fall in, fall in, sit down ?
?
I might be blonde, but I'm not dumb ?

I can make a J sign with my finger and my thumb ?
?
Oh no I got a paper gun pointed at your shirt ?
?
It'll totally stain your rug and it's probably gonna hurt ?
?
You might still be living and I might be dead ?
?
But you're lookin' way dirtier than me, K, fair ?
?
It's a rising of the zombies and my face is rare ?
?
Because that cute little zombie is risen from the dead ?
?
I might have an axe stuck in my neck ?
?
But I still got all my homies' and my playas' respect ?
?
I got the dopest rhymes goin' through my head ?
?
And my playas was right, yo, hip hop's dead!
?
- ?
I'm a zombie girl in a zombie world ?
?
When I see you, boy, you make my head twirl ?
?
Fall in, fall in, fall in, fall in ?
?
I'm a zombie girl in a zombie world ?
?
When I see you, boy, you make my head twirl ?
?
Fall in, fall in, fall in, sit down ?
- ?
A to the D to the O double G ?
?
He used to be a rapper but he's now a zombie ?
?
Gimme a couple boxes of some Lucky Charms ?
?
And maybe some blood, and both of your arms ?
?
'Cause I'm a zombie and I need my food ?
?
Excuse me if my hand falls off, I don't mean to be rude ?
?
I'm a gangsta and a zombie too ?
?
My head just rolled off, could you pass me that glue?
?
?
I like playing b-ball, especially with my head ?
?
The NBA won't let me join, I think it's 'cause I'm dead ?
?
Knock, knock, who's there?
I got a date with Wolf Man ?
?
We're going to this brand new club to party... ?
?
Go, zombie, it's your birthday ?
?
We're gonna party like it's your birthday ?
?
Go, zombie, it's your birthday ?
?
We're gonna party like it's your birthday... ?
[Raccoon squeaking]
Ladies and gentlemen, the library will be closing in five minutes.
You found what you were looking for, Mr. Faber?
I did indeed.
Thank you for pointing me in the right direction,
Miss Messing.
It's a fine addition to my favorite hobby.
I'm pleased to hear it.
And I'm sure Rose will be as well.
Hello?
Is somebody still here?
Who is it?
This is not funny.
What have you, George?
Sir, a Miss Lucille Messing didn't arrive for her shift today, and her landlady says she didn't return home last night.
I take it this isn't normal behavior for Miss Messing.
It's not, sir.
I thought it best to telephone you.
So this is where she was last seen.
Were there any signs of a struggle?
No, sir.
All the doors were locked.
No sign of forced entry.
- No witnesses?
- None.
The other librarian is on her way.
She's due any minute.
She might be able to shed some light on the matter.
Oh...
Miss?
You there!
Stop!
Miss!
- Stop!
Police!
- Let me go!
Anna?
Hello, William.
Anna.
What the devil are you doing here?
Anna.
You can't be here.
There are people after you.
Why did you come back?
Anna!
William, I'm sorry.
I tried.
Really, I did.
I went to Chicago and Boston.
And you come back to Toronto?
What if the Black Hand finds out?
I doubt they even remember I exist.
There is a price on your head.
They'll remember.
And you come back here, where they tried to kill you?
I've already been here several months, William.
What?
Honestly, who's going to notice an anonymous librarian?
Please.
It's the only place I don't feel alone.
You can't stay.
I'm fine.
And what were you doing at the library anyway?
I hope you don't have an overdue book.
There's a heavy penalty for that.
Very funny.
It's not that simple.
I'm investigating the disappearance of Lucille Messing.
- Lucille?
- Yes.
She didn't go home last night.
That's not like her.
Do you know of anyone close to her?
Well, she has a fiancée©.
And today's Tuesday, so last night, she'd have been at choir practice.
Very good.
Where are the practices?
At St. Alban's church, I believe.
Right.
Do you know of anything that may have been bothering her recently?
William, what if this is all a mistake?
What if the Black Hand have found me, and they took her by mistake?
Well, we don't know that she's been taken.
She could have disappeared of her own accord.
It's not something Lucille would do.
What if I am responsible?
It's highly illegal, Inspector.
I'm well aware of the law.
Not to mention immoral.
Teaching contraception is not only a crime.
It's a mortal sin.
As I've said, we'll look into it, Mr. Wilson.
Now, good day.
Inspector O'Kelly.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Oh, I just thought I'd drop by and say how much Station 5 is looking forward to trouncing your boys at baseball next week.
It's that time of year again.
What was the score last year?
16-3?
Oh!
MY apologies.
Well, I don't think we'll be putting up a team this year.
We're too busy.
Too busy?
A whole year, and that's the best you could come up with?
I'm charged with keeping the citizens of this city safe, not running around a playground in knickerbockers.
Lucille Messing?
Yes, she's a member of my choir.
Well, not much of a voice, but she gave it her all.
How worrisome.
When did you last see her?
Well, she missed practice last night.
- Was that unusual?
- Yes, most unlike her.
She was always punctual, a most reliable girl.
Do you have any idea what could have happened to her?
Is it possible she disappeared of her own accord?
Mr. Trevor?
You should talk to her fiancée©,
Geoffrey Coville.
- Why is that?
- Oh, he just... had a way about him.
Made me uneasy.
How so?
He was so... superior.
It was always something of a puzzle as to why a quiet young woman like Lucille was engaged to him.
Are you sure this is the address.
Mr. Wilson gave the Inspector?
I don't know, Henry.
All I know is that this is the address the Inspector gave me.
This doesn't seem right.
I mean, shouldn't we be investigating some sort of medical facility?
Who knows what goes on behind closed doors, Henry?
Who knows?
Retraining from relations during this time will reduce the likelihood of pregnancy.
However, a much surer way to prevent conception is the barrier method.
This is a diaphragm.
While no device can promise certainty, the diaphragm is a much more...
Dr. Ogden?
Constable Crabtree.
I take it you're here on official business, Constable.
Yes, your gathering has come to the attention of the Toronto Constabulary.
I see.
Advocating contraception, Doctor, is illegal, as I'm sure you know.
It pains me to do this, but I've been asked to arrest you.
You'll have to come down to the station house with us.
Are the other women free to leave?
They're attending an illegal gathering.
Constable, please.
They're here at my invitation.
George.
Some of them risk a beating if they're found out.
Well, they're free to go, then.
Ladies, I'm sorry.
Could you please see yourselves out?
Thank you.
Ladies.
Well, you could always work at Station 4.
They're a bit delicate for the streets of Toronto, but good chaps, nonetheless.
And I wouldn't call them Miss Nancy's, though, some might.
If a friendly game of baseball isn't to their liking, maybe a nice game of marbles or hopscotch.
Right!
That's enough out of you, O'Kelly.
Ah, Brackenreid.
I didn't see you there.
Station 4 accepts the challenge.
And we won't just play against you;
We'll bloody well beat you.
I very much doubt that.
Care to put your money where your mouth is?
I'd be delighted.
$10.
Done.
Mr. Coville, do you have any idea of your fiancée's whereabouts?
She didn't go home last night?
That's not possible.
Could there have been a family matter?
I am her family.
Lucille's parents are deceased.
- Any other family?
- None that I know of.
Mr. Coville, when was the last time you saw your fiancée?
Yesterday.
We met for lunch.
Did you notice anything unusual?
Actually, yes.
She was wearing a blue dress.
That was unusual?
Lucille is quite a reserved person.
She thought blue was exceptionally daring.
That's why I encouraged her work at the library, to see if she could break out of her shell.
Please, find her, Detective.
Sir, we've received bad news regarding Miss Messing.
A hiker found her body early this morning.
Miss Messing was strangled.
I believe a cord of some kind was used.
Though, there is one particular mark that is decidedly darker than the others.
Here.
Back of the neck.
Perhaps pressure from a thumb, if someone grabbed her from behind.
Hmm.
- Any other bruising?
- No.
Were there any signs of... interference?
It appears her maidenhood is still intact.
Well, that's strange.
An innocent young woman is abducted, killed, and yet no liberties were taken on her body.
You say our woman was a librarian, shy, churchgoing.
All who knew her characterized her as reserved, cautious.
Take a look at this.
Not something you would see on a woman of reserved character.
It's rather beautiful, isn't it?
I understand tattooing has become something of a fad in England among the aristocracy.
Why might she do this?
I suppose it would depend on exactly who your Miss Messings truly is.
What are you suggesting?
Consider the placement of the rose.
A simple lifting of her skirt above the ankle and it was there for all the world to see.
I would suggest that there is more to your librarian than meets the eye.
I'd only known her a short while, but she showed no signs of having a wild side.
So the Black Hand weren't involved after all.
That is some relief, Anna.
No, Lucille Messings murder came about as a result of something in her past, not her association with you.
Murdoch, do you have a-
Miss Fulford.
What are you doing back here in Toronto?
Inspector, that's no longer her name.
Ah, well, Miss whatever-your-name-is, being here is like signing your own death warrant.
Well, I'll take my chance, Inspector.
Mm.
Murdoch, if you have a moment, perhaps you could spare a word for Dr. Ogden.
Julia?
She's here?
She certainly is.
Julia, let me get the Constable to unlock this, so we can speak properly.
Constable Crabtree refused to lock it.
Please come in.
These cells are for criminals.
I understand that.
What I'm less sure of is why counseling impoverished women is a crime.
You were teaching methods of contraception.
I was simply following my conscience.
I'm sorry, William, but since I began my own practice,
I see the same thing day after day.
Women run off their feet, caring for too many children.
It's my duty as a doctor to do something about it.
Julia, I admire your principles.
It's not about principles.
It's about the health of women and children.
And you aren't going to change any of that in here.
Go home, Julia.
I will not.
I won't be leaving until I've had an opportunity to argue my case in front of a judge.
A case you will lose.
Then I'll lose.
And if that happens, you will be facing two years in prison in surroundings much less comfortable than this.
You're being stubborn.
I like to think determined.
Here you go, boys.
Station 4 is gonna be fielding a top-notch crackerjack baseball team at this year's police games.
But, sir, Armstrong is on leave.
- So what?
- Well, he's our pitcher.
After last year's debacle?
Not bloody likely.
I've nominated Higgins.
Sir, no.
I...
I'm on third base, sir.
I'm the third baseman.
Then we need a new third baseman.
Oh, no.
I don't think so, sir.
We need you, Murdoch.
I've not played much baseball, sir.
All hands on deck.
You'll be a quick study.
That's the spirit.
Oh, and this year, we're going to be practicing.
Oh, that's an excellent idea, sir.
Now, what are you lot doing standing around?
Get back to work.
And, Higgins, as our pitcher, you're our leader.
You hold in your hands the fate of the station's honor.
Now, be a good lad and put the kettle on.
It's reassuring to see how seriously the Constabulary is treating the death of my fiancée.
Mr. Coville, it's my number one priority.
Clearly.
You characterized your fiancée as a shy, restrained woman.
She was that.
Then why did she have a tattoo?
The red rose.
It snaked from her ankle to almost mid-calf.
I don't believe you.
Well, I've seen it with my own eyes.
How could you not have known?
You told me the two of you were engaged.
We weren't haven't relations, if that's what you're insinuating.
Lucille was a good Christian woman.
It's a very uncommon adornment.
How long have you-
- I would appreciate it if you would spend your time trying to find my fiancée's killer instead of besmirching her character.
Typical of the police, I suppose.
You enjoy wallowing in filth, don't you?
- William.
- Anna.
I was just on my way to see you.
I didn't think anything of it at the time, but a few weeks ago,
I overheard Lucille having a conversation with a man, and he insisted that he knew her and wanted to renew their acquaintance.
He was really quite brazen.
And what was Miss Messings reaction?
Well, she told him he was mistaken.
Well, could you describe him?
I could if I saw him again.
Do you think she knew him?
Well, at the time, no, but now...
Right.
Where are we going?
We are off to Toronto's only tattoo studio.
I remember.
Three sessions.
A very unusual young woman.
It was a painful session, but she endured it without a whimper.
She was my only female customer.
Mr. Sato, did you design this rose for her?
No, it was from a book.
Do you recall the name of the book?
No.
Mr. Sato, you say she was your only female customer.
Did Miss Messing say why she might want such a thing?
I didn't inquire, but people often employ my services to mark a significant milestone.
Thank you.
Are you sure you wouldn't like a tattoo, William?
I don't think so.
Be our little secret.
Thank you, Constable.
Oh, I'm sure we won't be keeping you long, Doctor.
Hello, George.
Constable Crabtree.
Dr. Grace.
Pleased to see you.
Dr. Ogden.
You are just about the bravest woman I've ever met.
Oh, well, hardly.
I was simply doing my job as a physician.
You were doing much more than that.
You were promising emancipation, allowing women the chance to have some measure of control over their destiny.
I'm ready to plan a rally to protest your imprisonment.
Well, there's no need for that.
You misunderstand.
It's not for you.
It's for the right of women to choose whether or not to conceive.
In fact, a woman of your position unfairly jailed shines a light on the injustice.
I appreciate your support, Dr. Grace.
Sir, I've discovered something that may be of relevance.
We located a patron who last checked out a book the night Miss Messing disappeared.
- Ah, did you get a name?
- Yes, sir.
Little Friends With Feathers.
The patron, George.
Yes, of course
- Ah, Stanley Faber, sir.
Uh, she appeared a charming young woman.
Though, I never knew her name.
Uh, Miss...
Miss Messing, you say?
That's right.
And you saw her at the library two days ago?
I, uh...
I go there to research.
I'm an amateur ornithologist.
That's right.
And you took out a book, Little Friends With Feathers.
That's right.
Tell me, Mr. Faber, do you stay at the library late on a regular basis?
Not more than once a week, sometimes twice.
So fairly regularly, then?
And yet you claim you have never spoken to Miss Messing?
No, I never...
Is this an interrogation?
It most certainly is.
Mr. Faber, you may be the last person to have seen Miss Messing alive.
I just received your message.
I was in Buffalo.
I tried speaking with her, but Julia's a determined woman.
Yes, my wife does know her mind.
Well, conviction is an admirable quality.
I'll leave you two.
The door's open.
Hello, Darcy.
I thought I'd surprise you, arriving early, but it appears you've trumped me.
I â€œ'7'.
Julia, I need you to come home.
- Darcy-
- Julia.
I understand your position, but you won't win an argument inside a jail cell.
Please trust me.
This is something I care about.
I know that you do.
But let's join the fight.
Together.
Please.
Inspector Brackenreid's agreed to look the other way.
All right, I'll come home, but I haven't given up.
Out of my office!
I'm telling you today what I told you yesterday, what I'll probably tell you tomorrow and the day after that.
I have no bleeding comments!
I'm being hounded by reporters thirsting for blood.
What's the progress on this librarian killer?
Librarian killer?
That's what they've coined him.
Oh, and they've heard about the young woman's tattoo.
I don't know how.
We need to sort this, and soon, Murdoch.
Yes, sir.
Sir, telephone message.
Look, I found this in Lucille's desk drawer.
Oh, I prefer much more scientific texts.
Look at the bookmark.
Written with a calligraphy pen, very elaborate hand.
Does this number sequence mean anything to you?
Well, it looks like the numbers we use on library books.
The Dewey Decimal system organizes book titles into ten categories and then subdivides.
Each successive number narrows the field.
7 denotes arts and recreation.
709.
Art history.
Lucky guess.
What don't you know about?
I have a very curious mind, always have.
Well, that's a very attractive quality.
Most men have curious hands and little else.
Well...
Let's see what The Secret Heart has to tell us.
235.
235.
Here.
Mm, but 67 isn't part of Melville Dewey's system.
Try page 67?
She looks like Lucille.
And she's holding a rose.
This must be the illustration that Lucille asked Mr. Sato to copy.
"Devil."
"Drum."
Do you think that means anything?
The Devil's Drum.
It would appear your friend Lucille strayed a great distance from the confines of the Toronto Public Library.
I admire you speaking on behalf of the city's poor,
Mr. Lamott.
Proper nutrition is critical.
As chair of the board,
I feel the hospital has a duty not just to treat illness but to try and prevent it in the first place.
A disease like rickets could be eradicated with better nutrition.
You must see a lot of terrible cases in your private practice, Mrs. Garland.
It's still Dr. Ogden.
And, yes, I do.
The mothers of this city bear an enormous burden.
In caring for their children?
And bearing children year after year, even as their own health fails.
Quite so, and in their dwellings.
What do you suggest, Dr. Ogden, we tell them to stop having them?
If contraception we're not illegal, families could make those decisions for themselves.
You mean women could?
I suppose I do, if only to benefit the health of the family as a whole.
Good way to prevent illness, is it not?
Shall we?
Oh.
Your wife is a very spirited woman.
Yes, Julie is wonderful and not shy about expressing her opinions.
They're certainly very modern.
You have your hands full there, I suspect, Garland.
Oh, come on, love.
.
I'm pus)'-
This is-l didn't get her name.
She won't tell me her name.
- Hello.
- Come on, love.
Yeah.
We're not
- Oh, we're friendly types.
Hey, we'll buy you a beer, you know?
- We'll get you a drink.
- Yeah, come on.
- What do you say?
- Be a sport.
Is everything all right, gentlemen?
Anna.
You think I've never been in a bar before?
What are you doing here?
You should be in hiding.
You need my help to find the murderer.
- Oh, do I?
- Yes.
I'm the only one who saw the man talking to Lucille in the library.
Very well.
Then you let me know if you happen to see him.
You know, you're the only woman in this bar who isn't engaged in the entertainment of men.
Am I not entertaining?
Can I get you anything, sir?
Yes, I would like some information, please.
I'm just here to serve drinks.
Miss, if there is gaming going on in that back room,
I will be compelled to shut down this establishment indefinitely.
Now... have you ever seen this young woman?
I've seen her... a month or so back, not our usual clientele.
- Was she with anyone?
- No, she came in alone.
That's why I remember her.
She looked like a lady.
Then I thought something different.
Why do you say that?
A gentleman joined her and ordered them both a drink.
- Were they together very long?
- No.
She left a short while later.
Funny.
Didn't take her for a doxy.
Had you ever seen this man before?
Never saw him before or since.
I would very much like to hear from you if you ever see this man again.
Oh.
What is it?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Shall we?
There's somebody following us.
I know.
Keep walking.
Why are you following us?
I heard you asking about that woman.
I was.
What do you know about her?
I've got a little sister to look after.
Mother too.
Upstanding citizens usually volunteer information to the police.
Oh, give the boy a few pennies, William.
Fine.
Let's have it.
I don't know much about her, but the man she took off with, he's a regular, name of Carling.
Helped him home once after he had a few too many.
Carling.
Thank you.
It's nights like this that make me miss my days in the morgue.
Yes, the hospital board do make for lively company, don't they?
- That's one way to put it.
- Mm.
I suppose Roger Lamott does go on.
You made quite an impression on him.
Me?
A married woman?
I'm flattered.
Your ideas, darling.
My ideas or my opinions?
The whole issue of contraception is very controversial.
It's a religious affront to many people.
You do remember who it is you married, don't you, Darcy?
I'm not exactly what you'd call a shrinking violet?
Of course I do.
And I admire your spirit and conviction more than any man alive, but...
But?
They're considering making me head of the hospital.
That's wonderful news!
Congratulations.
Now, I said considering.
Um, nothings been officially decided.
But until it has...
You would like your opinionated wife to keep her own counsel.
Is it so much of a compromise, Julia?
I so want you to get the position.
Right.
Pretend we're lovers on a stroll.
Oh, this Mr. Carling surely is a married man.
Hard to believe.
Oh, now, who's the naive one?
No, I don't mean his actions.
I mean Lucille's.
Maybe she didn't know.
Or didn't care.
That's him, the man from the library, the one who insisted he knew Lucille.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.
Right.
Can you see yourself home?
I think I can manage that.
All right.
Oh, Mr. Carling.
I didn't know she was dead.
What a waste.
I was hoping to see her again.
We had unfinished business.
There was something special about that one.
She invited me to join her.
She chose me.
She told me to call her Rose.
Her note was an invitation to a rendezvous later that same evening.
Did you go?
What do you think, Detective?
Was there a discussion of payment?
That wasn't the nature of the encounter.
She was a vision.
She said...
Undress me.
But finally...
Get out.
Not quite what you were expecting.
I would say not.
And did you?
Sorry?
Leave.
Did you leave?
Of course.
Lam a gentleman, Detective.
And that was the last time you saw her?
Yes, I never saw her again.
You have my word.
And your word isn't worth very much, Mr. Carling.
You were seen with Miss Messing at the public library trying to renew your acquaintance.
Why would you ask the question if you already know the answer?
To see if you would be inclined to lie to the police.
Very well.
I saw Rose in the street looking entirely different than the woman I met in The Devil's Drum.
That's when you followed her into the library.
Wouldn't you?
Mysterious woman like that, who wouldn't follow her to the ends of the earth?
Cooperstown's finest, son.
Get used to it.
Finest horsehide in the land.
Give it your best, Henry.
Give it some salt and pepper.
Salt and pepper?
It's a sporting expression.
Oh, come on, Henry.
You've got to put some mustard on it, man, like this.
Oh, my gosh.
Uh...
Begging your pardon, sir.
" Begging my..."
Bloody hell, Crabtree.
That was brilliant.
That was the fastest pitch I've ever seen.
It was like lightning.
What position do you play?
Second base.
Higgins, second base.
Crabtree, you're our new pitcher.
Are you telling me that Lucille had an alter ego?
A woman with a tattoo who solicited strange men in a tavern?
So it would appear.
Then the woman that I thought I knew doesn't exist.
It would seem that I have narrowly escaped marriage to a trollop.
She was your fiancée, sir.
Are you finished?
I'll let you get back to your mourning.
How am I to mourn the death of a stranger, Detective?
You'll inform me if you're going out of town,
Mr. Coville?
I am a suspect?
I'd like to be informed if you plan to travel.
How did you pick up your technique, Crabtree?
Well, it's funny you should ask, sir.
My aunt Nettle's farm up in Haileybury was set upon by a plague of vermin of biblical proportions.
I was a young lad at the time, not yet entrusted with firearms, so I took to eradicating the little beasts by hurling stones at them.
Oh.
Sir.
Ah.
- Reporting for duty.
- Good, good.
There's a desk waiting for you at the station.
- Good to be aboard.
- Good to have you.
Who's that fellow?
A new recruit to Station 4.
I swore him in yesterday.
Much experience in law enforcement, sir?
None whatsoever, but he played professional baseball for 12 years.
Sir, a ringer?
Is that necessary?
I thought we were doing rather well.
We may be doing rather well, Crabtree, but I'm from Yorkshire.
I intend to win.
Will I do'?
Just let me.
We can't have the new administrator of the Victoria Hospital for Sick Children with his tie askew.
Mm, well, I haven't got the position yet.
You will, Darcy.
And I won't do anything to jeopardize your chances.
We are gonna accomplish so much, Julia.
Wish me luck.
Of course.
I'll be here when you get back.
So you had no idea that Lucille had been living a double life?
No.
Though, she did ask me recently if I had ever been betrayed.
Betrayed?
As if she was asking my advice.
So something had been troubling her?
Lucille's note to Mr. Carling...
"All will be revealed."
William, this isn't her handwriting.
Both notes were written in the same hand.
Perhaps someone was directing Lucille to the book.
Do you think it could have been Mr. Carling?
Well, it's possible.
But I believe Mr. Carling was genuinely surprised when Lucille approached him in The Devil's Drum.
I believe Lucille's actions we're being directed by a third party.
What, like some sort of Svengali?
She didn't do this of her own accord.
Well, perhaps she did.
What do you mean?
Well, think about it this way.
What if she wasn't a victim or a pawn in all this?
What if beneath that quiet exterior
Lucille was a willing participant who enjoyed breaking taboos?
Like undressing for strangers?
If the man she loved told her to do it.
Her fiancée©?
Well, he didn't even know about her tattoo.
I doubt they shared intimate secrets.
Well, they were to be married.
Women marry for many reasons, William, not always for passion.
Women are taught to hide their passion.
And not only women;
Men too.
Don't you feel that sometimes, William?
Cats must be lying with dogs.
I beg your pardon.
You're ten minutes late.
George?
We're on a reconnaissance mission, sir.
We're off to observe the lads at Station 5.
Their nine are practicing this morning, and rumor has it, they brought in a ringer.
Oh.
Uh, George, do you know how to operate that piece of equipment?
Well, I'm thinking of employing a trial-and-error method, sir.
Ah.
Good luck, gentlemen.
And be careful.
Okay, Station 5, let's look alive!
Get out there.
Show some jolly hustle.
Come on.
Come on, lads.
Nothing to worry about, Crabtree.
Your form's better than this.
Never seen that bloke before.
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right, all right.
Bloody hell.
The rumors are true.
He's not a copper.
This is utterly against the spirit of the game.
Sir, didn't you bring in a ringer?
I was merely leveling up the playing field.
I should be forming a protest.
To whom, sir?
Well, then, I'll find some other way to take him out.
A librarian soliciting strange men down at The Devil's Drum.
Press will have a field day.
What have you got?
Well, sir, we know the murder took place after the library was closed.
Her body was found in the woods in Rosedale Valley, not far from the path.
Did she know the suspects?
Yes, sir, all but Mr. Faber, an ornithologist who spent a great deal of time at the library but claims he never spoke with Miss Messing.
He was the last person to see her alive.
Isn't ornithology a hobby better pursued in nature than in a library?
Mr. Faber may have been more infatuated with the librarian than the books.
- Alibi?
- No, sir.
He was at home alone.
And gentleman number two?
A Geoffrey Coville, the victim's fiancée©.
He was more upset to learn of her unconventional behavior and went so far as to say that if she was behaving this way, she got what she deserved.
Oh, well, that was nice of him.
Oh, sir, maybe Mr. Coville discovered the truth that his betrothed was not the lily-white innocent he believed her to be and killed her in some sort of blind rage.
He claims to have been alone in a hotel in Cobourg at the time.
But as of yet, I've been unable to confirm it.
Let me know as soon as you find out.
And the third gentleman?
Uh, Leonard Carling, a married man who had a liaison with Miss Messing.
But he lied about the encounter and also lied about following her into the library.
Miss Messing teased Mr. Carling, sir, with the promise of a risqué encounter.
However, upon their next meeting, she denied she knew him.
Maybe, sir, Carling decided to pursue his passions there, and, being thwarted a third time, took his revenge.
That's possible.
On the night of the murder, Mr. Carling claims to have been in the company of another young woman, whose name he doesn't seem to remember.
Let's bring him in.
Suggest a conversation with his wife might to aid in jogging his memory.
Yes, sir.
We need to figure this out, gentlemen, before every woman in Toronto is afraid to walk the streets.
Excuse me.
' Yes?
I requested an Audubon monograph two weeks ago.
Has it-has it-has it arrived?
Oh, well, uh, I'll check.
Oh, please do.
I have been most patient.
But you agreed we would start to promote a clinic.
I've changed my mind.
Is this because of the arrest?
It's too risky... for you and for the other people helping us, for our patients.
It's a risk we're willing to take.
Our cause may be an idea ahead of its time.
At any rate, I can no longer take part.
But without you, there is no clinic.
I've weighed this decision very carefully, Emily.
I'm sorry.
I've made up my mind.
Time, gentlemen, please.
Hello, Miss Fulford.
I'm sorry.
You must be mistaken.
As you wish.
Who are you?
Now, why would I tell you that?
Police Station 4, please.
I'm afraid Detective Murdoch isn't here.
Well, I'll have to locate him.
Can he telephone you back?
Well, can you tell him to get to the library as soon as he can?
I think The Black Hand have found me.
Thank you.
How long ago was this, Constable?
Moments ago, sir.
I didn't know where you were.
Hello?
Who are you?
Please...
Please, no.

Birthplace of the brass knuckle, the Nigerian Prince scam, and putting a tomato on your grilled cheese sandwich.
Our story begins not long ago... on what seemed like a typical day.

That's not for people, son.
Aw, he's a dumb kid, but he's an above-average dog.

Now, what's our status?
We are about to pass through... uh, Springfield.
Springfield?
What's their deal?
Hm, let's see, quiet suburb... home of the Tomb of the Unknown Mascot... has the lowest self-esteem of any place on the planet.
Really?
Aw...
That's so sad.
And as entertainers, it is our solemn duty to cheer them up for a little while.
Gaga, it's my job to keep you away from ugly bumps on the map like Springfield.
Don't worry, we'll get you right on a plane.
No!
Don't you remember what happened at LaGuardia?
Ready.
Yeah, well, uh, you missed your flight.
Then we'll party on the boarding ramp!
Wait!
I quit!
We spend 90 minutes training 'em and off they go.
I just can't ignore a billboard in pain.
We're stopping in Springfield!
But...
No buts!
Well, Lady Gaga couldn't arrive soon enough for one Lisa Simpson.
Now let's turn to the ever-unpopular
"Popularity Awards," the awards voted by students, in judgment of their peers.
No way that can go wrong.
First up, Campus Clown.
Bart Simpson.
(Simpsons theme plays)
That's my brother.
Four years out of four.
Prank you!
Prank you very much!
Call back.
I fail to see the honor in this.
Aren't awards shows rather silly?
What?
!
Without awards shows, how would I know what movie has the best beheading, or that Glee is a comedy?
And now the award for Least Popular Student.
Lisa Simpson!
What?
Least Popular?
I gotta go.
You probably should accept it, Lisa.
They'll go easier on you if you do.
Um...
Thank you for noticing me.
She actually accepted it!
You said they'd take it easy on me.
I know very little about children.
We've got to cheer up a whole town.
Where's the dress I wore when I met the Pope?
It's nice, but I saw Jennifer Lopez wearing it.
Burn it.
Burn it now.
Help!
Help!
I've been on here since Chicago!
I just want my life back!
No negativity!
Oh, you're right.
I'm missing a terrible winter!
And that's how Berber carpet got its name according to some.
Lisa, how was your day?
Um, can I be excused from holding up my end of the conversation?
What's wrong with her?
She just found out no one likes her.
I thought she knew.
Hey, Lisa, maybe you'd feel a little better if you read the Daily Fourth Gradian Message Board, huh?
Let's see. "Uncensored Jump-rope Chants."
Oh, there's a whole thread labeled "Lisa Simpson"!
Wha...?
Ay carumba.
Somebody's actually on your side!
"Lisa doesn't judge other people.
Why should we judge her?" It's signed, "Truth Teller."
Whoever this "Truth Teller" is, I'm a fan.
It takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously.
You know, it seems like more than a coincidence that Milhouse brought it to our attention.
Hm?
Well, I certainly wish I was Truth Teller.
But if I was, you'd know, because I can't keep a secret.
I sleep under my bed every night 'cause I'm scared of the cars from Cars.
If gasoline is their food, then why do they have teeth?
!
So, Lisa, I guess you're not as unpopular as we thought.
Yep.
Message boards are never wrong.
Well, um, maybe we should skip rope together.
- Dutch?
- Double Dutch.
Forgive a fool her tears.
Hey, Lis, some fifth graders are having a make-your-own pizza party at Flesh-In-The-Pan Pizza, and wanted me to invite you.
Fifth graders?
Ooh-la-la!
They get to put their desks in a circle!
And read books where the parents are divorced.
That joint is jumpin'.
So, when's the party?
"Lisa rocks, and so does her rock collection." Huh?
That's mine!
This notebook is full of things Truth Teller said.
Give that back!
This one says "post next Friday."
Oh, my God!
You're Truth Teller!
Lisa, what you did is like my mom sticking ten bucks in her own G-string.

Oh, God.
Psst!

But no one must know.

Gaga.
Gaga.
So peaceful.
Just the buzzing of the paparazzi.
Hey, Gary.
How's your wife and kids?
Still ashamed of me.
Big smile!
This is where I live.
Well, hello.
It's one of those music industry superstars who's turning our innocent children into ladies of the night.
What sweater drawer did you crawl out of?
Name's Ned Flanders, I've heard of you.
Haven't seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm.
But all I'm saying is that everyone is beautiful...
Yes, but Jesus said that... pretty much the same thing.
Darn it, the Bible said the Devil would be attractive.
What makes you think I'm the Devil?
Unless you're gonna slap some wieners on those, turn 'em off.
Joke's on you;
I needed a trim.
Bastards!
Lisa, look at me.
So what if your number one supporter is you.
That's how it should be.
I had some very tough times myself before I became a superstar at age 22.
Everything is gonna be fine.
You better yet?
Sorry, gotta answer this text.
Please, take your time.
You know what you need?
Solitude?
Flash mob!
Now, Lisa, if that didn't fundamentally change who you are, I don't know what.
You idiots!
She meant we should disperse.
Lisa, you un-tattooed little miracle,
I'm not leaving here until I restore your sense of hope.
Let me explain.
I have a chance for a grim but tolerable life, but only if I give up hope.
Now if you don't mind, and with all due worship,
I would like to be alone.
Lady Gaga, meet your biggest threat:
Baby Googoo.
Can I please be alone?
Well, it worked once.
So, any ideas about Lisa?
I never have any idea what to do for Lisa.
To be the mother of someone who's so smart and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument
I don't really care for, it's so hard.
I wish I was one of those young women who could just wave their hands in front of their eyes and not cry, because it doesn't work for me.
Marge...
Ah...
Ooh!
Aah!
Ooh!
Marge.
Marge.
Marge.
Hm...
Marge, take it easy.
It's just human contact.
I'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up.
Well, maybe this will.
Homer!
Wow.
Wow.
This is like the night Hillary won the New Hampshire Primary.
Lisa snuck out.
I'm going after her.
- What are you gonna say?
- Whoo!
Mm.
I'll just tell her that...
Stop it, Homer!
Some of that meat is me.
Can I just trim the hem?
It's yours.
Oh, good.
She's playing.
Not so good.
It's "Lisa Roulette."
Don't let her get you!
Her eyes shoot loser lasers!
There is no over-the-top.
There is no over-the-top.
Run!
With an egg that big, there's gotta be an even bigger chicken!
Lisa?
Lisa, listen to me.
This pity party's being shut down by the smile police.
Here's what you're gonna do.
Why do you keep telling me what I'm gonna do?
This isn't about me.
Well, who else would it be about?
You!
It's about "Hello, hello, Springfield."
"It's me, Gaga!"
"Why is everyone looking at my purple hair full of bluebirds?"
Well, I denounce thee!
Wha...?
I denounce thee for giving people ambitions they cannot fulfill.
And I denounce thee for positing a world where social acceptance and walking on heels are easy!
Please, may we kill the kid?
I denounce thee!
I denounce thee!
I denounce thee!
Whoa, easy, little monster.
Don't "monster" me.
Whatever you say.
Are you crying... glitter?
Tiny diamonds.
Hurts like hell.
Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga...
Okay Lisa, coming up to make things better!
Okay, I'm almost there.
Upward, ever upward.
Stay hydrated...
Oh, I'm on the wrong tree!
Okay, try again.
Here we go, okay.
Oh...
Lisa, can you come down?
Sweetie, I've been thinking.
Now, this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself.
The problem's not that you were cheating.
It's that you got caught.
I cheat on my diet, but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside, and the first warning sign is sudden death.
So, honey, what do you say?
Dad, thank you!
Like always, the fact that I could tune you out without fearing I'd miss out on something gave me the time to take stock and realize how ungrateful I have been.
Which means, I've got a train to catch.
Parenting.
It's the one job you know you're always doing right.
So long, Springfield.
You are my Waterloo.
And now I'm just going to lie in bed and eat Fruit Roll-Ups.
Why is she doing in defeat what I do in victory?
Gaga!
Lisa?
Why are you here?
To thank you.
For what?
Look at me!
You did help me by allowing me to inappropriately focus eight years of rage and rejection on you.
It was like a great sneeze.
And now I can say what's good about me.
And I can say it as Lisa Simpson!
Just not that loud.
Go ahead.
Well, I am smart, nice, tolerant, funny but not "mean funny," and I never forget a birthday, even for kids who move away.
Now, Lisa, there's only one last thing you have to do to be a Little Monster.
I'll do anything but sing.

That kind of thing sounds hollow from anyone but you!
Now, we have to get going.
Wait a minute.
No.
No, no!
You!
What's wrong, honey?
Please, I've had enough attention for one day!
Yo, lighting!
I can't see the girl who's had enough attention.
We should go to your house and talk.
Incognito!
Oh, God.
Psst!
It's me, Gaga.
But no one must know.
Gaga.
Gaga.
Gaga.
So peaceful.
Just the buzzing of the paparazzi.
Hey, Gary.
How's your wife and kids?
Still ashamed of me.
Big smile!
This is where I live.
Well, hello.
It's one of those music industry superstars who's turning our innocent children into ladies of the night.
What sweater drawer did you crawl out of?
Name's Ned Flanders, I've heard of you.
Haven't seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm.
But all I'm saying is that everyone is beautiful...
Yes, but Jesus said that... pretty much the same thing.
Darn it, the Bible said the Devil would be attractive.
What makes you think I'm the Devil?
Unless you're gonna slap some wieners on those, turn 'em off.
Joke's on you;
I needed a trim.
Bastards!
Lisa, look at me.
So what if your number one supporter is you.
That's how it should be.
I had some very tough times myself before I became a superstar at age 22.
Everything is gonna be fine.
You better yet?
Sorry, gotta answer this text.
Please, take your time.
You know what you need?
- Solitude?
- Flash mob!
Now, Lisa, if that didn't fundamentally change who you are, I don't know what.
You idiots!
She meant we should disperse.
Lisa, you un-tattooed little miracle,
I'm not leaving here until I restore your sense of hope.
Let me explain.
I have a chance for a grim but tolerable life, but only if I give up hope.
Now if you don't mind, and with all due worship,
I would like to be alone.
Lady Gaga, meet your biggest Baby Googoo.
Can I please be alone?
Well, it worked once.
So, any ideas about Lisa?
I never have any idea what to do for Lisa.
To be the mother of someone who's so smart and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument
I don't really care for, it's so hard.
I wish I was one of those young women who could just wave their hands in front of their eyes and not cry, because it doesn't work for me.
Marge...
Ah...
- Ooh!
Aah!
Ooh!
- Marge.
Marge.
- Marge.
- Hm...
Marge, take it easy.
It's just human contact.
I'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up.
Well, maybe this will.
Homer!
Wow.
Wow.
This is like the night Hillary won the New Hampshire Primary.
Lisa snuck out.
I'm going after her.
- What are you gonna say?
- Whoo!
Mm.
I'll just tell her that...
Stop it, Homer!
- Some of that meat is me.
- Can I just trim the hem?
It's yours.
Oh, good.
She's playing.
Not so good.
It's "Lisa Roulette."
Don't let her get you!
Her eyes shoot loser lasers!
There is no over-the-top.
There is no over-the-top.
Run!
With an egg that big, there's gotta be an even bigger chicken!
Lisa?
Lisa, listen to me.
This pity party's being shut down by the smile police.
Here's what you're gonna do.
Why do you keep telling me what I'm gonna do?
This isn't about me.
Well, who else would it be about?
You!
It's about "Hello, hello, Springfield."
"It's me, Gaga!"
"Why is everyone looking at my purple hair full of bluebirds?"
- Well, I denounce thee!
- Wha...?
I denounce thee for giving people ambitions they cannot fulfill.
And I denounce thee for positing a world where social acceptance and walking on heels are easy!
Please, may we kill the kid?
I denounce thee!
I denounce thee!
I denounce thee!
Whoa, easy, little monster.
Don't "monster" me.
Whatever you say.
Are you crying... glitter?
Tiny diamonds.
Hurts like hell.
Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga...
Okay Lisa, coming up to make things better!
Okay, I'm almost there.
Upward, ever upward.
Stay hydrated...
Oh, I'm on the wrong tree!
Okay, try again.
Here we go, okay.
Oh...
Lisa, can you come down?
Sweetie, I've been thinking.
Now, this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself.
The problem's not that you were cheating.
It's that you got caught.
I cheat on my diet, but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside, and the first warning sign is sudden death.
So, honey, what do you say?
Dad, thank you!
Like always, the fact that I could tune you out without fearing I'd miss out on something gave me the time to take stock and realize how ungrateful I have been.
Which means, I've got a train to catch.
Parenting.
It's the one job you know you're always doing right.
So long, Springfield.
You are my Waterloo.
And now I'm just going to lie in bed and eat Fruit Roll-Ups.
Why is she doing in defeat what I do in victory?
Gaga!
Lisa?
Why are you here?
To thank you.
For what?
Look at me!
You did help me by allowing me to inappropriately focus eight years of rage and rejection on you.
It was like a great sneeze.
And now I can say what's good about me.
And I can say it as Lisa Simpson!
- Just not that loud.
- Go ahead.
Well, I am smart, nice, tolerant, funny but not "mean funny," and I never forget a birthday, even for kids who move away.
Now, Lisa, there's only one last thing you have to do to be a Little Monster.
I'll do anything but sing.
You are gonna sing!
♪ I used to think that I was stupid ♪
♪ Worthless, weak and wrong ♪
♪ A mockingbird without a song ♪
♪ I was small inside and lacking pride ♪
♪ On a one-way train to be Milhouse's bride ♪

Wait, wait!
Wait...!
Can you help me with my self-esteem?
I'm not that good.
Right, gotcha.
And the best thing is, even if they weren't waving, it would be okay.
I bet a lot of folks are wondering, did this story really happen?
Well, it did.
And I know because I was one of Gaga's dancers.
The one with the spangliest crotch.
Higher!
I'm speaking fast because I'm so excited.
See Maggie Simpson in her first starring role in The Longest Daycare in 3D before Ice Age Continental Drift only in theaters.

NARRATOR:
See that town?
Goes by the name of Springfield.
Birthplace of the brass knuckle, the Nigerian Prince scam, and putting a tomato on your grilled cheese sandwich.
(humming)
Our story begins not long ago... on what seemed like a typical day.
Ralphie, please.
That's not for people, son.
(barking)
Aw, he's a dumb kid, but he's an above-average dog.
Roll over, son.
Yay!
Aw, nobody saw.
NARRATOR:
But little did they know, a change was coming.
First, the creatures of the Earth sensed it, then the fish of the deep.
Then the Mormons got a heads-up.
And then everybody else.
Strange doin's, Mother.
Horses are spooked, cows ain't milking', and look what the chickens laid.
FARMWIFE:
Sparkle eggs?
!
(wind whistles) Storm's a-comin'.
Ain't no storm, Pa.
It's The Lady Gaga Express!
(Lady Gaga's Poker Face plays)
PISTONS (chanting):
She's-a-star!
She's-a-star!
She's-a-star!
She's-a-star!
Presenting the Queen of the Hottieverse, appearing courtesy of Interscope Records, Lady Gaga!
At ease.
Conductor, you know the rules.
Take off some clothes.
Oh, uh, yes, ma'am.
Sorry, ma'am.
Now, what's our status?
We are about to pass through... uh, Springfield.
- Springfield?
What's their deal?
Hm, let's see, quiet suburb... home of the Tomb of the Unknown Mascot... has the lowest self-esteem of any place on the planet.
Really?
Aw...
That's so sad.
And as entertainers, it is our solemn duty to cheer them up for a little while.
Gaga, it's my job to keep you away from ugly bumps on the map like Springfield.
Don't worry, we'll get you right on a plane.
No!
Don't you remember what happened at LaGuardia?
Ready.
Yeah, well, uh, you missed your flight.
Then we'll party on the boarding ramp!
(party music playing)
Wait!
I quit!
We spend 90 minutes training 'em and off they go.
I just can't ignore a billboard in pain.
- We're stopping in Springfield!
- But...
No buts!
NARRATOR:
Well, Lady Gaga couldn't arrive soon enough for one Lisa Simpson.
Now let's turn to the ever-unpopular
"Popularity Awards," the awards voted by students, in judgment of their peers.
No way that can go wrong.
First up, Campus Clown.
(laughing)
Bart Simpson.
(Simpsons theme plays)
That's my brother. (chuckles)
Four years out of four.
(camera shutter clicks)
Prank you!
Prank you very much!
(pops)
(growls) (audience laughs)
BART:
Call back.
I fail to see the honor in this.
Aren't awards shows rather silly?
What?
!
Without awards shows, how would I know what movie has the best beheading, or that Glee is a comedy?
And now the award for Least Popular Student.
Lisa Simpson!
What?
Least Popular?
(sobbing)
I gotta go.
You probably should accept it, Lisa.
They'll go easier on you if you do.
(sobbing):
Um...
Thank you for noticing me.
(all laughing)
She actually accepted it!
You said they'd take it easy on me.
I know very little about children.
We've got to cheer up a whole town.
Where's the dress I wore when I met the Pope?
It's nice, but I saw Jennifer Lopez wearing it.
Burn it.
Burn it now.
MAN:
Help!
Help!
I've been on here since Chicago!
I just want my life back!
- No negativity!
- Oh, you're right.
I'm missing a terrible winter!
And that's how Berber carpet got its name according to some.
Lisa, how was your day?
Um, can I be excused from holding up my end of the conversation?
What's wrong with her?
She just found out no one likes her.
(loud whisper):
I thought she knew.
Hey, Lisa, maybe you'd feel a little better if you read the Daily Fourth Gradian Message Board, huh?
Let's see. "Uncensored Jump-rope Chants."
Oh, there's a whole thread labeled "Lisa Simpson"!
(muttering)
- Wha...?
- Ay carumba.
Somebody's actually on your side!
(chokes)
"Lisa doesn't judge other people.
Why should we judge her?" It's signed, "Truth Teller."
Whoever this "Truth Teller" is, I'm a fan.
It takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously.
You know, it seems like more than a coincidence that Milhouse brought it to our attention.
Hm?
(chuckles) Well, I certainly wish I was Truth Teller.
But if I was, you'd know, because I can't keep a secret.
I sleep under my bed every night 'cause I'm scared of the cars from Cars.
If gasoline is their food, then why do they have teeth?
!
So, Lisa, I guess you're not as unpopular as we thought.
Yep.
Message boards are never wrong.
Well, um, maybe we should skip rope together.
- Dutch?
BOTH:
- Double Dutch.
(gasps) Forgive a fool her tears.
Hey, Lis, some fifth graders are having a make-your-own pizza party at Flesh-In-The-Pan Pizza, and wanted me to invite you.
Fifth graders?
Ooh-la-la!
They get to put their desks in a circle!
And read books where the parents are divorced.
That joint is jumpin'.
So, when's the party?
(gasps)
"Lisa rocks, and so does her rock collection." Huh?
(gasps) That's mine!
This notebook is full of things Truth Teller said.
Give that back!
This one says "post next Friday."
(gasps) Oh, my God!
You're Truth Teller!
(kids gasp)
Lisa, what you did is like my mom sticking ten bucks in her own G-string.
Truth Teller?
More like Lie Smeller!

Kent Brockman reporting live from the Springfield rail yards, where Lady Gaga's fabulous freighter has bumped and grinded its way into town.
Suffice it to say, this is the most culturally significant train to stop here since the McKinley funeral cortege paused to pick up casket ice.
Now, sweetie, don't make a big deal out of this.
I stopped reading after "Top Student."
Want to honk your jazz tube?
Oh, what is the point?
I think this is the end of me.
All I had was my integrity.

Horses are spooked, cows ain't milking', and look what the chickens laid.

Presenting the Queen of the Hottieverse, appearing courtesy of Interscope Records, Lady Gaga!
At ease.
Conductor, you know the rules.
Take off some clothes.
Oh, uh, yes, ma'am.
sorry, ma'am.
Now, what's our status?
We are about to pass through... uh, Springfield.
Springfield?
What's their deal?
Hm, let's see, quiet suburb... home of the Tomb of the Unknown Mascot... has the lowest self-esteem of any place on the planet.
Really?
Aw...
That's so sad.
And as entertainers, it is our solemn duty to cheer them up for a little while.
Gaga, it's my job to keep you away from ugly bumps on the map like Springfield.
Don't worry, we'll get you right on a plane.
No!
Don't you remember what happened at LaGuardia?
Ready.
Yeah, well, uh, you missed your flight.
Then we'll party on the boarding ramp!
(party music playing)
Wait!
I quit!
We spend 90 minutes training 'em and off they go.
I just can't ignore a billboard in pain.
We're stopping in Springfield!
But...
No buts!
NARRATOR:
Well, Lady Gaga couldn't arrive soon enough for one Lisa Simpson.
Now let's turn to the ever-unpopular
"Popularity Awards," the awards voted by students, in judgment of their peers.
No way that can go wrong.
First up, Campus Clown.
(laughing)
Bart Simpson.
(Simpsons theme plays)
That's my brother. (chuckles)
Four years out of four.
(camera shutter clicks)
Prank you!
Prank you very much!
(pops)
(growls) (audience laughs)
BART:
Call back.
I fail to see the honor in this.
Aren't awards shows rather silly?
What?
!
Without awards shows, how would I know what movie has the best beheading, or that Glee is a comedy?
And now the award for Least Popular Student.
Lisa Simpson!
What?
Least Popular?
(sobbing)
I gotta go.
You probably should accept it, Lisa.
They'll go easier on you if you do.
(sobbing):
Um...
Thank you for noticing me.
(all laughing)
She actually accepted it!
You said they'd take it easy on me.
I know very little about children.
We've got to cheer up a whole town.
Where's the dress I wore when I met the Pope?
It's nice, but I saw Jennifer Lopez wearing it.
Burn it.
Burn it now.
MAN:
Help!
Help!
I've been on here since Chicago!
I just want my life back!
No negativity!
Oh, you're right.
I'm missing a terrible winter!
And that's how Berber carpet got its name according to some.
Lisa, how was your day?
Um, can I be excused from holding up my end of the conversation?
What's wrong with her?
She just found out no one likes her.
(loud whisper):
I thought she knew.
Hey, Lisa, maybe you'd feel a little better if you read the Daily Fourth Gradian Message Board, huh?
Let's see. "Uncensored Jump-rope Chants."
Oh, there's a whole thread labeled "Lisa Simpson"!
(muttering)
Wha...?
Ay carumba.
Somebody's actually on your side!
(chokes)
"Lisa doesn't judge other people.
Why should we judge her?" It's signed, "Truth Teller."
Whoever this "Truth Teller" is, I'm a fan.
It takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously.
You know, it seems like more than a coincidence that Milhouse brought it to our attention.
Hm?
(chuckles) Well, I certainly wish I was Truth Teller.
But if I was, you'd know, because I can't keep a secret.
I sleep under my bed every night 'cause I'm scared of the cars from Cars.
If gasoline is their food, then why do they have teeth?
!
So, Lisa, I guess you're not as unpopular as we thought.
Yep.
Message boards are never wrong.
Well, um, maybe we should skip rope together.
Dutch?
BOTH:
Double Dutch.
(gasps) Forgive a fool her tears.
Hey, Lis, some fifth graders are having a make-your-own pizza party at Flesh-In-The-Pan Pizza, and wanted me to invite you.
Fifth graders?
Ooh-la-la!
They get to put their desks in a circle!
And read books where the parents are divorced.
That joint is jumpin'.
So, when's the party?
(gasps)
"Lisa rocks, and so does her rock collection." Huh?
(gasps) That's mine!
This notebook is full of things Truth Teller said.
Give that back!
This one says "post next Friday."
(gasps) Oh, my God!
You're Truth Teller!
(kids gasp)
Lisa, what you did is like my mom sticking ten bucks in her own G-string.
Truth Teller?
More like Lie Smeller!

You!
What's wrong, honey?
Please, I've had enough attention for one day!
Yo, lighting!
I can't see the girl who's had enough attention.
We should go to your house and talk.

Hey, Gary.
How's your wife and kids?
Still ashamed of me.
Big smile!
This is where I live.
Well, hello.
It's one of those music industry superstars who's turning our innocent children into ladies of the night.
What sweater drawer did you crawl out of?
(chuckles):
Name's Ned Flanders, I've heard of you.
Haven't seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm.
But all I'm saying is that everyone is beautiful...
Yes, but Jesus said that... pretty much the same thing.
Darn it, the Bible said the Devil would be attractive.
What makes you think I'm the Devil?
Unless you're gonna slap some wieners on those, turn 'em off.
Joke's on you;
I needed a trim.
(Gaga groaning)
Bastards!
Lisa, look at me.
So what if your number one supporter is you.
That's how it should be.
I had some very tough times myself before I became a superstar at age 22.
Everything is gonna be fine.
You better yet?
(phone chimes) Sorry, gotta answer this text.
Please, take your time.
You know what you need?
Solitude?
Flash mob!
Now, Lisa, if that didn't fundamentally change who you are, I don't know what.
You idiots!
She meant we should disperse.
Lisa, you un-tattooed little miracle,
I'm not leaving here until I restore your sense of hope.
Let me explain.
I have a chance for a grim but tolerable life, but only if I give up hope.
Now if you don't mind, and with all due worship,
I would like to be alone.
Lady Gaga, meet your biggest threat:
Baby Googoo.
Can I please be alone?
Well, it worked once.
So, any ideas about Lisa?
(sighs)
I never have any idea what to do for Lisa.
To be the mother of someone who's so smart and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument

I don't really care for,

I wish I was one of those young women who could just wave their hands in front of their eyes and not cry, because it doesn't work for me.

Why do you keep telling me what I'm gonna do?
This isn't about me.
Well, who else would it be about?
You!
It's about "Hello, hello, Springfield."
"It's me, Gaga!"
"Why is everyone looking at my purple hair full of bluebirds?"
Well, I denounce thee!
Wha...?
I denounce thee for giving people ambitions they cannot fulfill.
And I denounce thee for positing a world where social acceptance and walking on heels are easy!
Please, may we kill the kid?
I denounce thee!
I denounce thee!
I denounce thee!
Whoa, easy, little monster.
Don't "monster" me.

Okay, I'm almost there.

(panting):

Oh, I'm on the wrong tree!
(grunts) Okay, try again.
Here we go, okay.
(grunting and panting):
Oh...
Lisa, can you come down?
Sweetie, I've been thinking.
Now, this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself.
The problem's not that you were cheating.
It's that you got caught.
I cheat on my diet, but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside, and the first warning sign is sudden death.
So, honey, what do you say?
Dad, thank you!
Like always, the fact that I could tune you out without fearing I'd miss out on something gave me the time to take stock and realize how ungrateful I have been.
Which means, I've got a train to catch.
(chuckling):
Parenting.
It's the one job you know you're always doing right.
So long, Springfield.
You are my Waterloo.
(crowd cheers)
And now I'm just going to lie in bed and eat Fruit Roll-Ups.
Why is she doing in defeat what I do in victory?
(whistle blowing)
(chugging)
Gaga!
Lisa?
Why are you here?
To thank you.
For what?
Look at me!
You did help me by allowing me to inappropriately focus eight years of rage and rejection on you.
It was like a great sneeze.
And now I can say what's good about me.
And I can say it as Lisa Simpson!
(gently):
Just not that loud.
Go ahead.
Well, I am smart, nice, tolerant, funny but not "mean funny," and I never forget a birthday, even for kids who move away.
Now, Lisa, there's only one last thing you have to do to be a Little Monster.
I'll do anything but sing.

Shh!
Previously on The Real L Word...
So I was talking to my ex, and we're gonna see if we can make it work and not see other people.
I'm super conflicted about moving back to New York,
Before I moved to L.A., I had a girlfriend that I loved and I still love.
I would hope, like, if you're gonna move back that you would give me, like, advance notice, so I could, like, find another roommate and stuff.
Woof.
I think that people think bisexuals are slutty.
It's not like that, it's a confusing place to be.
I always considered myself, a lesbian.
But now, I guess that I have to say that I would be, bisexual.
Kelsey, I love Jay.
We're not supposed to be together...
And I'm the one who ended it, you know what I mean?
It's hard being with somebody who's bisexual.
I mean, if the girl wants dick, that's not something I can give her.
Do you guys want to try again or what?
Is that a weird question?
- We're going to.
- We want to still be parents.
We are parents, but we're going to try again.
Seeing how long it took last time, like, it's just...
We fight all the time, we are not compatible.
You know, she's used to us fighting and then getting back together and making up, and I know in my heart that it's not gonna happen this time and that it's over for good.
This is not fucking good for me.
I cannot deny what I'm feeling, and I can't deny my chemistry with Lauren.
I'm not.
It's already done.
I think this might be a little more than just Dinah fun.
I feel like there's something there.
I can just tell that you're a dick.
I don't know, she seems a little sketchy, and apparently I've already had an argument with her.
I mean, no, I'm not sold on her.
I'm not going to cave in to you being a dick.
What is that?
I'm engaged.
You're not even excited.
It's not necessarily what you envision in your head your parents' reaction being.
Have a good day.
Sara and I are headed back east to see my mom and my grandma.
I'm not gonna lie, when I told my mom initially that we were engaged, her reaction was a little lackluster.
I know my mom supports us being together and getting married, but I think it will take me actually being in front of her to really get that, you know, excitement and support really kicked in.
But I've actually never had a conversation with my grandmother about my sexuality.
And now not only do I need to bring it up to her, but, surprise, I'm also getting married, and it's to a woman, and she's right there.
I'm a little nervous about this grandma talk.
Okay.
All right.
What do I do?
It's either you pay.
- How much do I...
- $90.
- $90?
Babe.
- What?
We got to take five pounds out.
I'll tell you what weighs all that is the freaking makeup.
It needs to go in there.
It's, like, toiletries and all that stuff is in there.
It's not makeup.
It's toiletries.
Toiletries.
Take that vest out and wear it.
- Put this on?
- Put it on, just do it.
Take the shoes out.
Baby, I'll tell you right now.
Can you just take the shoes out?
'Cause they' re easy to take out.
I don't think that these shoes weigh...
Just take them out.
I hate the way you're talking to me right now.
Can you do something with them or do you want me to just wear them all?
I'll carry them.
Sharing the news with our families about, you know, us getting married has been really stressful, and it's kind of taking a toll on our harmony.
You look super stylin'.
- You too.
- From earlier in the morning.
Thank you.
Bye.
Which way do we go?
Okay.
Great.
Thanks.
Kiyomi went home a couple of days ago, and I already miss her a lot.
I've never had any sort of long-distance situation with anyone, so this is really difficult for me, especially when I have intense feelings.
You okay?
Um, yeah, I'm bummed.
It's just a little...
I don't know, it's a lot of... we just spent so much time together.
Like, in the past, like, week, you know?
With her being in another city too, it's, like, especially not fun for me right now.
Yeah, I know.
Hi, my love.
Good.
Uh-oh.
Oh, my gosh.
So what's going on with you and Lauren?
I feel like everything is happening really quick, and I'm, like, trying to take things slow.
You know, we're both really busy people with our careers and stuff, and we're just gonna try, and we'll see each other on weekends and see how it goes, you know.
I think that it is a little too soon to say that Lauren and I are gonna be serious.
I just got out of this relationship with Ali, and I feel like I need to be a little more cautious and not rush into things.
I don't know.
I feel like...
I feel like I have to, like, have some "me time" too.
Maybe it'll be better 'cause it's not, like, typical lesbian shit where you hang out every fucking day.
But, at the same time, it's nice to like someone.
I haven't liked anyone in a really long time.
- You know?
- Yeah.
So, at Dinah Shore she told me something.
- What?
- She said something along the lines of "I can see myself just being with her."
She must have been loaded.
I'm joking.
It seems like she really digs you.
And it's, like, crazy to talk about it right now, you know.
We only just met.
Yeah, but you're, like, talking about it constantly to the point where I want to, like, gouge my eyes out with a fork.
I've never seen you this way, ever.
So it freaks me out.
But, at the end of the day, all I want is, like, for you to be happy.
But if she does anything and dicks you over, like, yeah, I'll hire a hit man.
What do you think is gonna happen?
Wouldn't that be so funny if you were like,
"by the way, I'm moving to New York now."
Don't even talk.
That is not okay.
Psycho.
Hey, Kacy.
Hello, mama.
How are you doing, sweetie?
Oh, it's so good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.
- I love you.
I love you too, Julee.
So, what's up, Kacy girl?
How was the drive?
The drive sucked, as it always does.
You should live closer.
- You should move closer to me.
- Hell, no.
Now that my mom's retired, she is so much more of, like, a carefree, free-spirited person.
She enjoys golf.
She enjoys lunch with her daughters.
She drives from Riverside all the way out to Los Angeles to see us, and I cherish every moment that I get with my mom.
She's always a source of great comfort for me.
How's Cori doing?
She's doing okay.
- Is she?
Back to work?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't know.
Sometimes I think she's doing better than I am.
Why?
Why is that?
I think everybody expects to be really gentle with her, and they think I'm fine.
And they think you're the tough one.
- Well, that's so crappy.
- It is pretty crappy.
But, you know what, you have to tell people,
"hey, I'm hurting."
I think a lot of people have this expectation that I'm supposed to forget her.
No.
Or that I'm supposed to be over it by now.
I told you what... that someone at work told me.
"I'm sure you're over it by now, but I'm so sorry."
Thanks, thanks for that.
How many times you went...
you did this, four times?
Yeah, but I never had to do what Cori did.
I never had to deliver the baby.
That's... that's hard.
I mean, my heart was breaking for both of you that night.
My parents had a really difficult time getting pregnant with my sister.
It took them ten years and, like, four miscarriages, but they managed to get pregnant with my sister.
My mom went through such burdens trying to get pregnant, and now I'm going through those same things.
The thing I think is great is you guys have really come through this together as a team.
Some people, they don't get over things like this.
They walk away from each other.
I can't even imagine that.
They do it, though.
So, you know, what are you guys gonna do?
Are you gonna...
Well, that's kind of the reason why I wanted to bring you to lunch.
So, we are clear to start, so...
Oh, you're clear already from the doctor?
So very soon.
Oh, that's so good.
It did feel like, when we lost Charlie, we got knocked all the way back down the ladder, because it was so hard to get pregnant the first time.
But there's so much more on our side, and it means so much more now because of what we lost.
And as long as Cori's okay and we're okay, then we're ready to try again.
Before we really wanted it, but now we really want it.
You know what, you got your whole future in front of you.
And there's gonna be another baby, and there's gonna be another love.
And you got a little angel up in heaven watching over you two.
Ok, not what you planned, but, you know, God... you don't get to plan this stuff,
God has his... he's got the plan.
That's true.
Is something missing in the backyard?
The...
like a big one, because it seems like there's a giant space there.
- Yup.
- Look at that red cardinal.
I love that tree that's, like, all twirly and old.
So we have arrived at my grandmother's house.
There is home-cooked food.
We're having some wine.
And everything is seemingly perfect.
I realize that I need to talk to my grandmother about the engagement, but you gotta ease into these things.
Our cheers are almost gone.
You want more cheers?
No, I don't want...
I don't want to.
But I want you to sit down and have some too.
- Aren't you starving, grandma?
- No, I'm numb.
You are?
I want to be numb.
Oh, dear, I'm going to be sorry tomorrow.
So my mom lives with my grandma, who is 92 years old.
She's a feisty old woman, and I love her.
She had a huge part in raising me as a child.
Growing up, things were tough, family split up, and finances didn't really allow us to have our own place.
So, my mom and I moved in with my grandmother.
She was like this safe place to go.
It's like, when everything else was hectic and changing, like, I knew I could go to my grandma's house and that cookie jar would always be there type thing.
Take a picture with my grandma.
- Here, like, take one like this.
- What?
Oh, my God, that's so cute.
I love my grandmother so much.
She's, like, my number one lady in this world, and my sexuality wasn't necessarily part of our relationship, so why should we talk about it?
But now it's not just about my sexuality.
It's about my future and my life.
And this is definitely something that needs to be talked about.
It's the first time where I've felt nervous about actually confronting someone in fear that, even though I think that she'll be accepting, in fear that she won't.
- Hi, how are you?
- Baby girl.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
- Good.
- Ma, it smells delicious.
What are you cooking?
- The same thing that...
- I know.
Always.
I was cooking the last time you were here.
We have bread.
We got lasagna.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yum.
My childhood best friend Tiffany comes over with her boyfriend Luigi, and I just want to relax and catch up a bit.
Cheers.
Cheers to growing up.
- Yeah.
- Cheers.
Yes.
Mom and grandma are like,
"oh we already did that."
- Yeah.
- "We're already there."
So I wanted to actually tell you guys something.
- The good thing is...
- What?
Let me see that.
Me and Luigi are... we're thinking
- about getting married.
- Really?
Yeah.
- That's good.
- We're coming.
Tiffany starts talking about a wedding.
I didn't even know she was engaged.
What the fuck?
Like, basically, everything is, like,
"engagement, engage, eng... discuss."
And I, for some reason, am not going there at all.
I couldn't be...
I was avoiding it like the plague.
When are you thinking about having this?
I'm... we're probably thinking within the next year it'll be done.
- Oh, that's good.
- I'm very happy.
It's like, all right.
I'm happy too.
That's good.
Well, that's great.
It's just awkward, and I hate the way it feels.
I just want Whitney to spit it out at this point.
I'm just like, can you please tell her so we can get this over with?
Hello.
Erika, Romi.
Romi, Erika.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
Are you ready for this business meeting?
I'm excited for you.
You wanted to do... well, the thing is you wanted to do this for a while.
So I think it's really good.
I have.
And I've been hitting you up forever.
- And, like, I want to do a song.
- Yeah.
I want to do a song.
I've been... it was, like, something on my, like, list of things,
- like, to check off.
- Yeah.
I've always wanted to do a song, so I am collaborating with my friend Craig and doing a dance kind of pop song.
I do a lot of club appearances, and I think it'd be fun to have something that was mine.
I still run my jewelry line, Casa Por Vida.
Now I'm trying to just kind of have fun with another side... you know, a creative side of me.
- So you heard the song.
- Yes.
You love the song.
I actually really do like the song.
I think it's really catchy.
Loved it.
And now we have to make a music video.
The whole process of making music, it just brings back a lot of childhood memories.
My mom's ex-wife is a music producer and a songwriter.
She would write songs in the car on the way to school.
And I used to sit on stage and watch her singers, like, perform.
And I would just, like, dream of, like, being up there.
And now I have a song.
If you like it... when you said you liked it,
- that's what made me happy.
- I did.
We listened to it, like, five times
- on the way over here.
- ♪ music's playing ♪
- ♪ everybody sing ♪
- See, you can sing.
♪ Ooh, la la la ♪
I love that Mercado just stopped to just go, "wait", are you actually capable of doing this?"
My whole thing was like, if you're going to ask me to do something like this right now, like, how do you say no?
You don't.
You need to jump at this opportunity.
Yeah.
My thing to every work opportunity right now is yes.
Yes, I can do that.
Yes, I can perform.
Can I?
I don't know.
Whether I can do it or not, I'll figure that out afterwards.
I think the only thing that you need to work on is just...
Breathing.
Well, like, also just, like, holding a mic.
Okay.
So, my friend Dusty, he's going to bring me in to spend two hours with me learning how to sing with the track, sing with the mic.
Dusty Ray is my ex-boyfriend.
When we were together six years ago, he was in a band, and I would watch his shows and like be the lead singer girlfriend kind of thing.
So Dusty's helping me out to make sure that I don't make a fool of myself.
- I'd like to sit in on that.
- Perfect.
You need to learn how to put the microphone...
- Yeah.
- Here and not here.
This is Romi, this is Romi.
"Hey, guys." I'm like, "dude."
Shit's about to blow up.
So I really hope you guys are ready.
- Why do you have a suitcase?
- You're going to kill me.
Um, I need you to give me a ride to the airport.
- What?
- Don't give me shit.
I need to just, like, go to New York and, like, get out of here
- for a few days and, like...
- Without me?
No, but, like, I need to go see my girl and I need, like, some "me time."
And I just...
I have to go.
Can you please not question me and just drive me to the airport?
Wait.
How long are you going?
I don't know.
I just booked a one-way.
What?
One-way?
I don't know.
I mean, I'll just figure it out.
- Don't freak out.
- Okay.
- It's...
- I'm not freaking out.
It's just really weird that you'd buy, like, a one-way.
Be like, bye.
No, I'm not doing that.
All right.
I need to get my keys.
What time is your flight?
In two hours.
Oh, cool.
I'm a really good planner.
Okay.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Come over here and love me.
Mama, it was delicious.
I'm leaving, grandma.
Yeah.
- Bye, okay?
- Bye.
Well, take it easy.
All right, Whitney, love you.
Kisses.
Bye, guys.
Bye, grandma.
That was so good, the lasagna.
What are you doing?
I wanted to...
- Why are you running?
- Because... well, I'm running.
Yeah.
Oh, no one's ever ran after me.
How romantic, Titanic.
No.
Because I wanted to make sure you were coming to the wedding.
I wanted to talk about it there when you were... when you were talking about your wedding.
- I know.
- But then I'm like...
- So what's up?
- No.
Because the thing is, like,
I haven't told my grandma or whatever.
But I don't know if she really understands.
Like, what, the fact that it's between two females?
Yeah.
Or the fact that it's you getting married?
No, I think.
Yeah, maybe the girl thing... the lesbian thing.
- I think grandma loves you.
- Yeah.
No matter what, even when you got that tattoo on your body.
And ruined your body.
Grandma never has ever come down on you hard.
- Yeah.
- So, I don't think...
Well, it's just, like, I don't know if I should...
How you should?
Yeah, or if I should.
Like, if it even...
You should.
You know you're gonna have grandma's support.
Grandma has a heart of, like, a lion.
- Like, I just love grandma.
- Yes.
- So I know that she...
- I do too.
You know.
All right, I love you.
- I love you.
- I love you.
I love you.
Call me, okay?
- Okay.
- About anything.
- You know you can.
- If you need anything, call us.
- Okay.
- Don't be scared.
Be brave, you lion heart.
We'll call you when we get there.
- Lion heart.
Lion heart.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Dinner was good, huh?
- Yeah.
It got a little noisy there for a while.
A little... a little noisy?
- A little noisy.
- I know you're tired, ma.
No.
No.
Now?
My favorite form of communication is just throwing it out there, boom.
Throw the bomb real quick, and then tense up and wait for the response, hoping for the best.
Grandma, you know I'm getting married.
To Sara.
Look at Sara's ring, grandma.
- It's from the 1930s.
- Yeah, that's pretty.
Almost just like you.
It's pretty.
Mine was a band with seven.
- Oh, really?
- Seven...
- Diamonds all around?
- Oh, no.
Just seven, they're not chips.
- They're...
- Where is yours?
- A little bigger.
- Yeah.
I'd like to see it.
- You want to see it?
- Yeah.
You know, this whole time, I'm sitting there, and I'm creating this response or creating this fear in myself of what my grandma is gonna think and say about our engagement.
And, um, you know, when it's finally brought up, there was nothing weird.
I felt silly for creating it into something that it wasn't.
Did you find your ring?
- Yeah, here it is.
- Oh.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, that's what my grandma's looks like.
- It has a...
- It's silver and platinum.
- It's so beautiful.
- And this is your wedding ring?
- Wedding ring.
- Oh, that's so cool.
- You got good taste.
- Yeah, I like it.
Cheers.
- "Cheerznik."
- Na zdrowie.
Salud.
Hey, buddy.
You okay?
I don't know.
Yes.
No.
Are you okay?
I feel... oddly, like, at peace.
You know?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, yes and no.
We're gonna do our next insemination.
Very mixed, strange emotions.
Yeah.
It's the craziest concoction of happy and sad simultaneously ever.
From here on out, there's just... there's no easy...
What's going on in there?
I don't know.
It's just weird.
I never felt like this before.
Do you think we're not ready?
I don't know.
I just don't.
It's a happy day.
It's a sad day.
I definitely think that Charlie...
I mean, she's the reason that I'm pushing, you know.
I know that she would be so upset if we just gave up.
I know that, and I know she's up there, picking out the perfect little sibling.
I know it.
Do you think we should bring her?
She's our family.
Cori and I have Charlie's ashes in a very small, heart-shaped urn.
It was important for Cori and I to have her with us always.
It feels right that, if we're gonna try this again, that she's there with us.
She's our baby.
She is our baby.
She will always be our baby.
Let's go make a baby.
Let me get the door for you.
I am surprised your grandma was so good last night.
- I know.
- Did you see how cute she was she was showing you her band?
- I know.
- How cute was that?
It's like, she's such an important part of my life.
- Of course.
- It, like, you know,
I know she is not gonna be able to travel to California for the actual wedding.
And it's like, you know, having her show you the wedding band and, like, having that, like, makes me want to have her there even more.
You know, honestly, I was thinking about it.
And I feel like, the fact that we can get legally married in Connecticut, it's like, I almost...
I kind of want to get legally married here.
So that means, that we'd be married, like, tomorrow?
Whoa-ho, that changes things.
No pressure.
This is a very intense moment in my life, and none of my family and none of my friends live here, you know.
It's not that I'm afraid of the wedding.
It's just, you know, I should be able to share a very important moment with my family as well.
I mean, are we still doing our California wedding?
Yeah.
Like, California would be the big, like, ceremony, like the celebration, the spiritual part.
But it's like, if we did it here, my grandma could be there, you know.
And we can do that separately, but we could have, like, a private little thing here and make it legal.
So, are we gonna do this?
Do you want to do it?
Do you want to legally marry me?
- Yes, I do.
- It would be legal.
That means there's no turning back.
Fuck you California.
We're getting married.
Honestly, a legal ceremony, it's important in the sense that, you know,
I want the same rights as a heterosexual couple would have, for sure.
And it's not like gay couples can just wake up one morning and decide, "hey, let's go to Vegas and get married."
You know, in the spiritual sense, the legality of things doesn't matter to me.
You know, I would go through the ceremony if it wasn't legal, but, in a human right's sense, absolutely the legality part matters.
That means you can't back out, and I can't either.
So, if I'm gonna run, I better do it now.
- I'm out of here.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Hi, hon.
- Hey.
- How are you?
- How are you?
- Thank you for helping me.
- Oh, yeah.
Totally.
I appreciate it.
I just pretty much need to...
I need to know how to just sing the song through.
Like my breathing, what I'm supposed to sing.
What I'm not supposed to sing.
I don't want to look like a fool.
Uh, you won't.
- Because...
- I need you to help me.
You're Romi, so you're cool.
And you're Dusty, and you're going to help me.
Right, I'll make sure you keep your cool.
Dusty has been doing music since he was 16.
He almost got signed when he was 18 years old.
He's opened for a ton of big artists, did warped tour.
And he's gonna help me with my song and sing the whole thing through and just have my voice go over it so I feel comfortable before performing, 'cause I've never done this before.
- My girlfriend Kelsey's coming.
- Oh, okay.
We'll have a little bit of an audience, and then Mercado's coming because she's gonna hopefully film a little bit of this.
- Mm-hmm.
- Just to put into the video.
- You want to?
- Yup.
Let's do it.
Watch me.
I'll take dramatic breaths.
- All of it.
- You jump in.
Remember, just if you don't have a word, breathe.
Okay.
'Cause I don't have the lyrics memorized, so...
- How dare you?
- How dare I?
Do you want the lyrics?
I got them.
I'm good.
Improv.
Okay, ready?
- I don't have to do that?
- Right.
So you take off.

- Even if that's playing?
- ♪ la la la ♪ - ♪ la la ♪
Then you can get back in.
I need to sound a little more energized than I am the whole time.
- I feel like a little monotone.
- Yeah.
I mean, are you gonna have anyone sing with you?
- No.
- I mean, you should.
- But I'm not.
- You're not, though.
- Oh, you can.
- Let's do it.
- Will you do it with me?
- Of course, I will.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Then practice singing it with me.
- All right.
- So I was in the studio, and we were, like, singing together.
It just felt really comfortable, and I felt so much safer having him do it with me, and I could feel it, when I was singing with him and, like, looking at him, that I could pretty much zone out what was going on
as long as he was next to me, and, I don't know,
I just felt something in there with him, and I think he felt the same thing.
I've wanted to do this, like, my whole life, and why not try it with somebody that has so much more experience and can really work with me and believes in me?

Romi's so natural at everything.
You just got to get the artist in tune with themselves, and, once they do that, they can do anything.
It's about having fun on the mic and being yourself.
And she's just so good at being her that it's so interesting to hear.
- And at the end of it...
- Hi, baby.
Hey, baby.
How is it going?
- Give me a hug.
- Yeah.
Want to meet Dusty.
- Dusty, Kelsey, Kelsey, Dusty.
- Hi, Dusty.
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.
At first I was a little weary about Romi making music with her ex-boyfriend, but I met him, and, you know, Dusty has a girlfriend, so he doesn't seem like a threat at all.
I actually thought he was on my team and gay, but apparently he's not gay.
Wow!
I just got that.
- No, he doesn't.
- A little bit.
- No!
- But he's a cuter version.
- He's cute, right?
- He's way cuter.
- And you seem like a nice guy.
- He's a nice guy.
I said that.
I'm like, "you'll actually like Dusty."

Let's do this.

Romi's an entertainer, and she loves to entertain, and her making pop music is what she wants to do, she should definitely do it, but is it good?
I don't know.
Look, listen to it, tell me what you think.
- ♪ The music tonight ♪
- Whoa.
We did good.
Dusty, thank you darling.
I've never had, like, alone time or, like, downtime in any way with Kiyomi, so, while I'm in New York,
I wanna, like, figure out, like, what her intentions are and what the hell is going on, you know, and I have every intention to call her out and talk to her.
Laura's having a dinner party, so I figured that I would invite Amanda to kind of, you know, clear the air and really just get to know her a little more.
You're always gonna question the person who's going after your best friend because you don't ever want to, like, give the okay and give the final approval.
If they end up being a dickhead, you're like, "shit."
The only thing that I can do is be myself and be authentic.
If she likes me, then she likes me, and, if she doesn't, then she doesn't.
There is nothing that I can do about that.
Huh, here we are again.
I never thought we'd be back here.
Hi, guys.
Here you go.
So just hang for about ten minutes or so, okay?
- Okay.
- And I'll be back.
All right.
I can't believe it.
It's the same batch.
Oh, my gosh.
That's crazy.
When doctor Morris handed us the vial, to bring it back to life, I looked down,
- and sure enough it's...
- It's from the same... the same batch that created Charlie.
We know you guys work.
You can do it.
I mean, we're hoping that's a lucky batch.
Like, very, very hopeful that we can make the same magic.
Yeah.
Where's Charlie?
I know.
You ever think your mouth would be that close to some sperm?
That's... really?
Really?
That's what we're doing with this?
No, but if this is what I got to do to make a baby, then yes.
Hey, guys.
Okay, ready?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Go ahead.
Scoot back.
I hope my cervix isn't an asshole today.
Why does this have to be so uncomfortable?
It could be worse.
You could have a dude on top of you.
Sorry.
No offense, Dr. Morris.
Because of the last pregnancy, it's easier than it used to be.
Oh, thank you.
So it went in very smoothly and easily, okay?
Okay.
- I'll see you guys soon, okay?
- Okay.
Thank you, Dr. Morris.
You're welcome.
It's okay, baby.
It's gonna be okay.
Promise?
I promise.
Look at this.
Thank you for the welcome.
Sara and I go over to my Uncle Tryg's house, my dad's brother, and kind of give them the heads up on our wedding, our engagement, and the fact that we could potentially/are getting legally married in Connecticut.
- So we're engaged.
- Yeah.
- Obviously, I told you.
- Yes.
- See, look, show them the ring.
- Congratulations.
Oh, it's a chocolate diamond.
- It's really beautiful.
- Isn't it cool?
It looks purple sometimes.
Sometimes it looks yellow.
- It's gorgeous.
- I love it.
- The wedding is fairly soon.
- Where's it gonna be?
It's gonna be in... in Southern California.
Do you think you'll be able to come?
I hope.
If I can.
- Okay.
- Um, Dan isn't coming.
- To the wedding?
- Mm-hmm.
I'm not surprised.
I mean, he's told me that you guys doing this for the show is fine, but he wants no part of it, and...
- Yeah.
- I understand that.
- I mean, if he...
- Yeah.
My dad is not coming to the wedding because he feels uncomfortable being on camera, and I'd like him to be there for such a huge event in my life, you know, that matters to me.
It's my one wedding, you know, and so, yeah, it's... it pisses me off that my dad can't put whatever shit he's got going on on the back-burner and, like, make it there, 'cause the reality
is he is supportive of me getting married.
He just can't get over himself.
This is gonna be the first and last time your daughter's getting married, and, I mean, it's, like, such an important thing for her, you know.
But they're so similar, you know.
- But it wasn't like that.
- She's so strong, and he's so strong, and neither one's going to give in, you know.
I mean, no.
Yes.
You don't think you're like your father?
Yeah, I know I am.
No, for sure.
You're a clone, are you kidding?
She is a clone.
She is.
Exactly.
- I am, I am.
- You're scary.
Is this a legal wedding yet or not?
Well, we were allowed to get married, and then the whole Prop 8 thing happened, and, like, our rights got taken away.
So we might actually...
because it's legal here, we might actually get legally married, like, tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
That's so cool.
- You're stuck with me.
- I know.
Mom doesn't know yet, exactly.
There's no waiting period, though, once you get the license in Connecticut.
Yeah, what about blood tests, though?
Ah, the babies.
Oh, look at how excited they are.
- Hi.
- That's really good.
Hi.
Mom, we're staying longer in Connecticut.
Being that we can't technically get married in California, we might actually go down and get, like, an actual license here.
So you're going to get married?
I didn't think you quite got that part.
You didn't make it very clear.
She's processing.
She's processing.
It's not her fault.
She did not make it clear.
I know.
My mom's reaction to hearing that we're getting legally married is comparable to me telling my mom that we're engaged.
Blank stare.
She just needs a process time.
- It ranges from 15 to 25 seconds.
- Yeah.
She's all, "we're gonna get a license."
You never said, "we're gonna get married tomorrow."
You just... yeah, you just said,
"I'm going to the... we're going to the town hall
- to get some papers."
- No.
In my head, it's a...
that's what you said.
No, because here's the thing.
Like, I don't wanna say, like, the wedding.
Like, we're not doing a wedding because that... this is like... that is what represents, like, our marriage even more so.
It's, like, the ceremony, having everybody we love together.
So you will be there tomorrow?
Yes, of course I will.
Oh, why would I not be?
- Oh.
- I want a hug too.
- Come over here.
- Oh, I love you guys.
I love you too.
You'll have a new daughter-in-law.
- I know.
- And it's me.
"And it's me."
I want to say, everybody comes together, L.A., Forkman.
Let's bring... everyone, yeah.
Let's bring North America together.
Hey, let's spill some for Canada.
My mother and I, we love cooking together.
And so we've decided that we're gonna throw a dinner party for Hunter Valentine and company.
We have Vero coming with Katie.
Somer can't make it, so we have Donna coming in replacement.
Amanda's in town, so they're all gonna get to meet my mother.
No, no, no.
We're not putting this on top?
No?
Okay.

- What time is it?
8:15.
Oh, cool, because I have a call at 8:00.
Yeah, 8:15.

I just need to see her again as soon possible.

Kiyomi's reaction to the news that Lauren was coming to New York was not what I expected, and it was weird.
You're trying to figure out, you know, if you wanna date my best friend or not, and then when I tell you she's gonna fly out here, you're not stoked about it?
Like, what's your problem?
No, I'm... that's exciting.
I just...
I wasn't expecting her to actually do that.
Wait, you guys have never even actually been on a date, have you?
- Like, a real date?
- Nope.
Uh-oh.
If she flies out here, you're gonna have to take the reins on that one.
You're like, "I put rose petals all over the house."
"And then I put cats all over the bed.
I covered the bed in cats, kittens."
I actually maybe have put rose petal... not rose petal.
Shut up.
Not too long ago.
Keep that to yourself forever.
I'm just nervous about Lauren coming because everything has moved really fast, and I have, like, a super crush on this girl.
And I don't really wanna fuck it up, and I don't really know where it's gonna go.
So there are a lot of question marks right now.
Stop trying to play it cool.
It's so funny.
- I'm not trying to...
- Since I know that, inside, you're like a little 13-year-old schoolgirl, and you're like, "yes, I'm so excited."
And you're gonna home and change your outfit 14 times before you go meet her.
That might be true.
Hi, Sara.
- Hi.
- I miss you.
I miss you a lot, you know.
I miss you a lot.
So do you remember when we were there,
I was explaining to you that, in Connecticut and New York, it's legal to get married.
I don't know.
Yes, it's legal here.
- Okay.
- Okay.
So, we're still going to have our wedding in June, okay?
But...
Oh...
Before...
Sara, let me...
Yes.
Hmm.
Mom...
It's not gonna be like we're gonna... our real wedding is when our whole... our entire family and everybody's there, you know.
But this is good too, mom, because...
And her grandma could be here for it, you know?
- Sara?
- What?
With you, it's so short time.
You know, I'm too old for so many news and at the same time.
If, like, Whitney gets sick or if I get sick, okay, mom?
Uh-huh.
You know, how they only allow family inside?
That means that...
Yeah.
My mom says to me it's like a Russian salad, which means that there's just a lot of confusing components going into one thing, and I think that she's still just trying to wrap her head around us getting married in general.
I love you.
Okay, hold on.
- Whit, my mom.
- Oh, what does she want to say?
- She wants to talk to you.
- Hello?
Oh, yeah.
We're gonna do... what do you think about it?
But I just wanted to tell you...
- Everything.
- Yay, thank you so much.
I want you to know, you take Sara.
Yeah.
I know.
Please be happy.
I am so happy, and I'll...
I promise you that I will take the best care of her that I could ever take of someone.
- I love you.
- I love...
And enjoy your day, okay?
Yeah.
No, no.
And I'm not crying, okay?
I'm going to be happy.
- I love you, mom.
- Okay.
- We'll call you right after.
- Okay.
Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Okay.
I love you.
- Is she sad?
- Yeah, it sucks.
Once again, I thought it was gonna go differently, but my mom thinks I'm being selfish.
You know, that was sad because I didn't want her to feel like, you know, we're all here and you're not, and you're missing out on, you know, this important day that we're having.
I hope she's not sad.
Hi, hon, how are you?
Good, I got you a little... a little shot?
Oh, good to see you.
You too.
I like your purse.
It's borrowed.
So what's up?
I wanna hear the song that you were working on.
Coffee.
Yeah, I have, like, the intro and the chorus and everything put together.
I think you'll dig it.
I came to the studio to kind of have Dusty help me.
And it felt really good.
We both felt it.
And we're like, let's do this together.
Now we wanna try and work on another song, which is so insane that, this many years later, I would be here, like, doing music with him.
I'm gonna make the best track that I can for you.
And then we're gonna put your voice on it,
- and that's what pop music...
- Yeah.
And that's what music needs.
And that's what you need, is just to be real.
Sometimes I just stare at you.
- Hmm, really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?
- I don't know.
I stare at you sometimes.
- Just a weird like...
- It's just like a...
Someone's gonna, like, see me, like, "what's wrong with her?"
All right, let me hear it.
♪ all I had was myself to give ♪
- That's me.
- ♪ tired of the drama ♪
♪ I'm tired of the way we live ♪
♪ I just wanna be alive tonight ♪
And then everyone in the club, their head explodes literally.
Literally, and then, yeah.
It's kind of weird.
It trips me out sometimes.
Like, sometimes I look at him, and he looks at me, and I'm just like, "were you a dream?
Like, did you happen in my past?"
My friend introduced me to Dusty in San Jose, and we started dating that day.
Literally, shook hands, fell in love.
We were on the balcony that night already making out.
And then we dated for four months of just being together every single day.
♪ We've got a missed connection ♪
♪ we've got something that isn't right ♪
We would just drink wine and talk about music and listen to music.
It was amazing.
Like, I was in love with him.
Dusty left me, so it wasn't my call.
That was one of the only people that ever really, like, really broke my heart.
And then six years later, I get a phone call that he lives in L.A. and is working on music.
I mean, our energy was cut so short
- whenever we knew each other...
- Uh-huh.
Just getting back in the room, it was just like...
- Immediate.
- Just like plugging it back in.
- It's just...
- That's what it felt like.
It's so weird because it's like... it's the same thing.
Like, I told you when, like, I met you years ago and showed up in San Jose, and it was, like, within two minutes, and, like, we're in this full-blown relationship.
- That's how we got...
- It's how we work.
That's how we do it.
Good energy is good energy.
And the fact that we have that still is amazing.
I know.
So, I mean, I just kind of feel like we should just go with it.
I know you work really hard, and I know you'll get shit done, and I need a lot of, like, you behind me right now, though.
I do.
I love doing music with him.
And he brings out a part of me that makes me feel like I'm 16 again.
Like, all the things about me that I kind of miss and haven't been around, he just brings it all back.
You're going to have a lot of time with me, Dusty Ray.
Yeah.
Your girlfriend ready for me to take over your life?
Is yours?
No.
We're going... we're gonna get married right now legally.
You know that, right?
- Yeah.
- Are you ready for this?
- Mm-hmm.
- You are?
- Are you?
- Yes.
Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?
- I'm Whitney.
- Hi, Whitney.
I'm Elisa, your wedding celebrant.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
- This is Sara, my fiancée.
Hi.
It's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- You look great.
- Thank you.
We went to town hall and got our marriage license.
And now we still have to have it officiated by the justice of the peace.
So, to make things easy for my grandma, we're getting married in her backyard.
They're coming up.
Come on.
It's freezing in Connecticut.
I'm wearing a dress.
I'm dressed like an amish man.
So cute.
Whitney and Sara, you've come before us today and freely declared your desire to be married to one another.
Sara, please repeat after me.
- Whitney...
- Whitney...
- From this day onward...
- From this day onward...
- I choose you to be my wife.
- I choose you to be my wife.
- To be faithful to you...
- To be faithful to you...
- All the days of my life.
- All the days of my life.
Whitney, please repeat after me.
- Sara...
- Sara...
- From this day onward...
- From this day onward...
- I choose you...
- I choose you...
- To be my wife.
- To be my wife.
- To be faithful to you...
- To be faithful to you...
- All the days of my life.
- All the days of my life.
I, Elisa Chase, am duly authorized to solemnize this, your marriage, according to the laws of the state of Connecticut.
It is therefore my honor to declare and pronounce that you are married.
Sara and Whitney, you may kiss your bride.
Yay.
I love you.
You're stuck with me forever.
Fantastic.
Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
- Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
Thank you guys all for being here.
I love you.
- Grandma, I love you.
- Yeah.
I love you too.
Oh, I'm happy to see they got married.
It's something I have to get used to too, but it's still fine, no matter how you... how you look at it.
Yeah.
I think they're adorable together.
Yay.
Thank you.
Okay, it's like a dream come true.
It's cool.
Yeah, it's special, for sure.
Yeah.
I don't think I ever thought my grandma would be at my wedding.
I love the fact that my grandma was at my, like, wedding that happened to be a same-sex marriage.
It's, like, huge for me.
And that she was supportive.
Yeah, I don't think... when I think about it right now,
I don't think I ever would've thought that.
So, I'm grateful.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Previously on The Real L Word...
So I was talking to my ex, and we're gonna see if we can make it work and not see other people.
I'm super conflicted about moving back to New York,
Before I moved to L.A., I had a girlfriend that I loved and I still love.
I would hope, like, if you're gonna move back that you would give me, like, advance notice, so I could, like, find another roommate and stuff.
Woof.
I think that people think bisexuals are slutty.
It's not like that, it's a confusing place to be.
I always considered myself, a lesbian.
But now, I guess that I have to say that I would be, bisexual.
Kelsey, I love Jay.
We're not supposed to be together...
And I'm the one who ended it, you know what I mean?
It's hard being with somebody who's bisexual.
I mean, if the girl wants dick, that's not something I can give her.
Do you guys want to try again or what?
Is that a weird question?
- We're going to.
- We want to still be parents.
We are parents, but we're going to try again.
Seeing how long it took last time, like, it's just...
We fight all the time, we are not compatible.
You know, she's used to us fighting and then getting back together and making up, and I know in my heart that it's not gonna happen this time and that it's over for good.
This is not fucking good for me.
I cannot deny what I'm feeling, and I can't deny my chemistry with Lauren.
[Laughter]
I'm not.
It's already done.
I think this might be a little more than just Dinah fun.
I feel like there's something there.
I can just tell that you're a dick.
I don't know, she seems a little sketchy, and apparently I've already had an argument with her.
I mean, no, I'm not sold on her.
I'm not going to cave in to you being a dick.
What is that?
I'm engaged.
You're not even excited.
It's not necessarily what you envision in your head your parents' reaction being.

Have a good day.
Sara and I are headed back east to see my mom and my grandma.
I'm not gonna lie, when I told my mom initially that we were engaged, her reaction was a little lackluster.
I know my mom supports us being together and getting married, but I think it will take me actually being in front of her to really get that, you know, excitement and support really kicked in.
But I've actually never had a conversation with my grandmother about my sexuality.
And now not only do I need to bring it up to her, but, surprise, I'm also getting married, and it's to a woman, and she's right there.
I'm a little nervous about this grandma talk.
Okay.
All right.
What do I do?
It's either you pay.
- How much do I...
- $90.
- $90?
Babe.
- What?
We got to take five pounds out.
I'll tell you what weighs all that is the freaking makeup.
It needs to go in there.
It's, like, toiletries and all that stuff is in there.
It's not makeup.
It's toiletries.
Toiletries.
Take that vest out and wear it.
- Put this on?
- Put it on, just do it.
Take the shoes out.
Baby, I'll tell you right now.
Can you just take the shoes out?
'Cause they' re easy to take out.
I don't think that these shoes weigh...
Just take them out.
I hate the way you're talking to me right now.
Can you do something with them or do you want me to just wear them all?
I'll carry them.
Sharing the news with our families about, you know, us getting married has been really stressful, and it's kind of taking a toll on our harmony.
[Chuckles]
You look super stylin'.
- You too.
- From earlier in the morning.
Thank you.
Bye.
Which way do we go?
Okay.
Great.
Thanks.

Hi, my love.
Good.
Uh-oh.
Oh, my gosh.
So what's going on with you and Lauren?
I feel like everything is happening really quick, and I'm, like, trying to take things slow.
You know, we're both really busy people with our careers and stuff, and we're just gonna try, and we'll see each other on weekends and see how it goes, you know.
I think that it is a little too soon to say that Lauren and I are gonna be serious.
I just got out of this relationship with Ali, and I feel like I need to be a little more cautious and not rush into things.
I don't know.
I feel like...
I feel like I have to, like, have some "me time" too.
Maybe it'll be better 'cause it's not, like, typical lesbian shit where you hang out every fucking day.
But, at the same time, it's nice to like someone.
I haven't liked anyone in a really long time.
- You know?
- Yeah.
So, at Dinah Shore she told me something.
- What?
- She said something along the lines of "I can see myself just being with her."
She must have been loaded.
I'm joking.
It seems like she really digs you.
And it's, like, crazy to talk about it right now, you know.
We only just met.
Yeah, but you're, like, talking about it constantly to the point where I want to, like, gouge my eyes out with a fork.
I've never seen you this way, ever.
- [Chuckles]
- So it freaks me out.
But, at the end of the day, all I want is, like, for you to be happy.
But if she does anything and dicks you over, like, yeah, I'll hire a hit man.
What do you think is gonna happen?
Wouldn't that be so funny if you were like,
"by the way, I'm moving to New York now."
Don't even talk.
That is not okay.
Psycho. [Chuckles]

Hey, Kacy.
Hello, mama.
How are you doing, sweetie?
Oh, it's so good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.
- I love you.
I love you too, Julee.
So, what's up, Kacy girl?
How was the drive?
The drive sucked, as it always does.
[Laughs]
You should live closer.
- You should move closer to me.
- Hell, no.
Now that my mom's retired, she is so much more of, like, a carefree, free-spirited person.
She enjoys golf.
She enjoys lunch with her daughters.
She drives from Riverside all the way out to Los Angeles to see us, and I cherish every moment that I get with my mom.
She's always a source of great comfort for me.
How's Cori doing?
She's doing okay.
- Is she?
Back to work?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't know.
Sometimes I think she's doing better than I am.
Why?
Why is that?
I think everybody expects to be really gentle with her, and they think I'm fine.
And they think you're the tough one.
[Laughs]
- Well, that's so crappy.
- It is pretty crappy.
But, you know what, you have to tell people,
"hey, I'm hurting."
I think a lot of people have this expectation that I'm supposed to forget her.
No.
Or that I'm supposed to be over it by now.
I told you what... that someone at work told me.
"I'm sure you're over it by now, but I'm so sorry."
Thanks, thanks for that.
How many times you went...
you did this, four times?
Yeah, but I never had to do what Cori did.
I never had to deliver the baby.
That's... that's hard.
I mean, my heart was breaking for both of you that night.
My parents had a really difficult time getting pregnant with my sister.
It took them ten years and, like, four miscarriages, but they managed to get pregnant with my sister.
My mom went through such burdens trying to get pregnant, and now I'm going through those same things.
The thing I think is great is you guys have really come through this together as a team.
Some people, they don't get over things like this.
They walk away from each other.
I can't even imagine that.
They do it, though.
So, you know, what are you guys gonna do?
Are you gonna...
Well, that's kind of the reason why I wanted to bring you to lunch.
So, we are clear to start, so...
Oh, you're clear already from the doctor?
So very soon.
Oh, that's so good.
It did feel like, when we lost Charlie, we got knocked all the way back down the ladder, because it was so hard to get pregnant the first time.
But there's so much more on our side, and it means so much more now because of what we lost.
And as long as Cori's okay and we're okay, then we're ready to try again.
Before we really wanted it, but now we really want it.
You know what, you got your whole future in front of you.
And there's gonna be another baby, and there's gonna be another love.
And you got a little angel up in heaven watching over you two.
Ok, not what you planned, but, you know, God... you don't get to plan this stuff,
God has his... he's got the plan.
That's true.

Is something missing in the backyard?
The...
like a big one, because it seems like there's a giant space there.
- Yup.
- Look at that red cardinal.
I love that tree that's, like, all twirly and old.
So we have arrived at my grandmother's house.
There is home-cooked food.
We're having some wine.
And everything is seemingly perfect.
I realize that I need to talk to my grandmother about the engagement, but you gotta ease into these things.
Our cheers are almost gone.
- [Laughs]
- You want more cheers?
No, I don't want...
I don't want to.
But I want you to sit down and have some too.
- Aren't you starving, grandma?
- No, I'm numb.

I want to be numb. [Laughs]
Oh, dear, I'm going to be sorry tomorrow.

So my mom lives with my grandma, who is 92 years old.
She's a feisty old woman, and I love her.
She had a huge part in raising me as a child.
Growing up, things were tough, family split up, and finances didn't really allow us to have our own place.
So, my mom and I moved in with my grandmother.
She was like this safe place to go.
It's like, when everything else was hectic and changing, like, I knew I could go to my grandma's house and that cookie jar would always be there type thing.
Take a picture with my grandma.
- Here, like, take one like this.
- What?
- Oh, my God, that's so cute.
- [Laughs]
I love my grandmother so much.
She's, like, my number one lady in this world, and my sexuality wasn't necessarily part of our relationship, so why should we talk about it?
But now it's not just about my sexuality.
It's about my future and my life.
And this is definitely something that needs to be talked about.
It's the first time where I've felt nervous about actually confronting someone in fear that, even though I think that she'll be accepting, in fear that she won't.
- Hi, how are you?
- Baby girl.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
- Good.
- Ma, it smells delicious.
What are you cooking?
- The same thing that...
- I know.
Always.
I was cooking the last time you were here.
We have bread.
We got lasagna.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yum.
My childhood best friend Tiffany comes over with her boyfriend Luigi, and I just want to relax and catch up a bit.
Cheers.
Cheers to growing up.
- Yeah.
- Cheers.
Yes.
Mom and grandma are like,
"oh we already did that."
- Yeah.
- "We're already there."
[Laughs]
So I wanted to actually tell you guys something.
- The good thing is...
- What?
Let me see that.
Me and Luigi are... we're thinking
- about getting married.
- Really?
Yeah.
- That's good.
- We're coming.
Tiffany starts talking about a wedding.
I didn't even know she was engaged.
What the fuck?
Like, basically, everything is, like,
"engagement, engage, eng... discuss."
And I, for some reason, am not going there at all.
I couldn't be...
I was avoiding it like the plague.
When are you thinking about having this?
I'm... we're probably thinking within the next year it'll be done.
- Oh, that's good.
- I'm very happy.
It's like, all right.
I'm happy too.
That's good.
Well, that's great.
It's just awkward, and I hate the way it feels.
I just want Whitney to spit it out at this point.

Romi, Erika.
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.
Are you ready for this business meeting?
I'm excited for you.
You wanted to do... well, the thing is you wanted to do this for a while.
So I think it's really good.
I have.
And I've been hitting you up forever.
- And, like, I want to do a song.
- Yeah.
I want to do a song.
I've been... it was, like, something on my, like, list of things,
- like, to check off.
- Yeah.
I've always wanted to do a song, so I am collaborating with my friend Craig and doing a dance kind of pop song.
I do a lot of club appearances, and I think it'd be fun to have something that was mine.
I still run my jewelry line, Casa Por Vida.
Now I'm trying to just kind of have fun with another side... you know, a creative side of me.
- So you heard the song.
- Yes.
You love the song.
I actually really do like the song.
I think it's really catchy.
Loved it.
And now we have to make a music video.
The whole process of making music, it just brings back a lot of childhood memories.
My mom's ex-wife is a music producer and a songwriter.
She would write songs in the car on the way to school.
And I used to sit on stage and watch her singers, like, perform.
And I would just, like, dream of, like, being up there.
And now I have a song.
If you like it... when you said you liked it,
- that's what made me happy.
- I did.
We listened to it, like, five times
- on the way over here.
- ♪ music's playing ♪
- ♪ everybody sing ♪
- See, you can sing.
♪ Ooh, la la la ♪
I love that Mercado just stopped to just go, "wait", are you actually capable of doing this?"
My whole thing was like, if you're going to ask me to do something like this right now, like, how do you say no?
- You don't.
- You do.
You need to jump at this opportunity.
Yeah.
My thing to every work opportunity right now is yes.
Yes, I can do that.
Yes, I can perform.
Can I?
I don't know.
Whether I can do it or not, I'll figure that out afterwards.
I think the only thing that you need to work on is just...
Breathing.
Well, like, also just, like, holding a mic.
Okay.
So, my friend Dusty, he's going to bring me in to spend two hours with me learning how to sing with the track, sing with the mic.
Dusty Ray is my ex-boyfriend.
When we were together six years ago, he was in a band, and I would watch his shows and like be the lead singer girlfriend kind of thing.
So Dusty's helping me out to make sure that I don't make a fool of myself.
- I'd like to sit in on that.
- Perfect.
You need to learn how to put the microphone...
- Yeah.
- Both:
Here and not here.

- This is Romi, this is Romi.
"Hey, guys." I'm like, "dude."
Shit's about to blow up.
So I really hope you guys are ready.

I don't know.
I just booked a one-way.
What?
One-way?
I don't know.
I mean, I'll just figure it out.
- Don't freak out.
- Okay.
- It's...
- I'm not freaking out.
It's just really weird that you'd buy, like, a one-way.
Be like, bye.
No, I'm not doing that.
All right.
I need to get my keys.
What time is your flight?
In two hours.
- Oh, cool.

Bye, guys.
Bye, grandma.
That was so good, the lasagna.
What are you doing?
I wanted to...
- Why are you running?
- Because... well, I'm running.
Yeah.
Oh, no one's ever ran after me.
How romantic, Titanic.
No.
Because I wanted to make sure you were coming to the wedding.
I wanted to talk about it there when you were... when you were talking about your wedding.
- I know.
- But then I'm like...
- So what's up?
- No.
Because the thing is, like,
I haven't told my grandma or whatever.
But I don't know if she really understands.
Like, what, the fact that it's between two females?
Yeah.
Or the fact that it's you getting married?
No, I think.
Yeah, maybe the girl thing... the lesbian thing.
- I think grandma loves you.
- Yeah.
No matter what, even when you got that tattoo on your body.
- [Laughs]
- And ruined your body.
Grandma never has ever come down on you hard.
- Yeah.
- So, I don't think...
Well, it's just, like, I don't know if I should...
How you should?
Yeah, or if I should.
Like, if it even...
You should.
You know you're gonna have grandma's support.
Grandma has a heart of, like, a lion.
- Like, I just love grandma.
- Yes.
- So I know that she...
- I do too.
You know.
All right, I love you.
- I love you.
- I love you.
I love you.
Call me, okay?
- Okay.
- About anything.
- You know you can.
- If you need anything, call us.

Be brave, you lion heart.
We'll call you when we get there.

Lion heart.

- Dinner was good, huh?
- Yeah.
It got a little noisy there for a while.
A little... a little noisy?
- A little noisy.
- I know you're tired, ma.
- No.
No.
- [Mutters]
Now?
[Laughs]
My favorite form of communication is just throwing it out there, boom.
Throw the bomb real quick, and then tense up and wait for the response, hoping for the best.
Grandma, you know I'm getting married.
To Sara.
Look at Sara's ring, grandma.
- It's from the 1930s.
- Yeah, that's pretty.
Almost just like you.
It's pretty.
Mine was a band with seven.
- Oh, really?
- Seven...
- Diamonds all around?
- Oh, no.
Just seven, they're not chips.
- They're...
- Where is yours?
- A little bigger.
- Yeah.
I'd like to see it.
- You want to see it?
- Yeah.
You know, this whole time, I'm sitting there, and I'm creating this response or creating this fear in myself of what my grandma is gonna think and say about our engagement.
And, um, you know, when it's finally brought up, there was nothing weird.
I felt silly for creating it into something that it wasn't.
Did you find your ring?
- Yeah, here it is.
- Oh.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, that's what my grandma's looks like.
- It has a...
- It's silver and platinum.
- It's so beautiful.
- And this is your wedding ring?
- Wedding ring.
- Oh, that's so cool.
- You got good taste.
- Yeah, I like it.
Cheers.
- "Cheerznik."
- Na zdrowie.

- I know.
- Did you see how cute she was she was showing you her band?
- I know.
- How cute was that?
It's like, she's such an important part of my life.
- Of course.
- It, like, you know,
I know she is not gonna be able to travel to California for the actual wedding.
And it's like, you know, having her show you the wedding band and, like, having that, like, makes me want to have her there even more.
You know, honestly, I was thinking about it.
And I feel like, the fact that we can get legally married in Connecticut, it's like, I almost...
I kind of want to get legally married here.
So that means, that we'd be married, like, tomorrow?
- [Laughs]
- Whoa-ho, that changes things.
No pressure.
This is a very intense moment in my life, and none of my family and none of my friends live here, you know.
It's not that I'm afraid of the wedding.
It's just, you know, I should be able to share a very important moment with my family as well.
I mean, are we still doing our California wedding?
Yeah.
Like, California would be the big, like, ceremony, like the celebration, the spiritual part.
But it's like, if we did it here, my grandma could be there, you know.
And we can do that separately, but we could have, like, a private little thing here and make it legal.
So, are we gonna do this?
- Do you want to do it?
- [Laughs]
Do you want to legally marry me?
- Yes, I do.
- It would be legal.
That means there's no turning back.
Fuck you California.
We're getting married.
Honestly, a legal ceremony, it's important in the sense that, you know,
I want the same rights as a heterosexual couple would have, for sure.
And it's not like gay couples can just wake up one morning and decide, "hey, let's go to Vegas and get married."
You know, in the spiritual sense, the legality of things doesn't matter to me.
You know, I would go through the ceremony if it wasn't legal, but, in a human right's sense, absolutely the legality part matters.
That means you can't back out, and I can't either.
So, if I'm gonna run, I better do it now.

Romi's so natural at everything.

At first I was a little weary about Romi making music with her ex-boyfriend, but I met him, and, you know, Dusty has a girlfriend, so he doesn't seem like a threat at all.
I actually thought he was on my team and gay, but apparently he's not gay.
Wow!
I just got that.

Sara and I go over to my Uncle Tryg's house, my dad's brother, and kind of give them the heads up on our wedding, our engagement, and the fact that we could potentially/are getting legally married in Connecticut.
- So we're engaged.

- Obviously, I told you.
- Yes.
- See, look, show them the ring.
- Congratulations.
Oh, it's a chocolate diamond.

- Isn't it cool?
It looks purple sometimes.
Sometimes it looks yellow.
- It's gorgeous.

- The wedding is fairly soon.
- Where's it gonna be?
It's gonna be in... in Southern California.
Do you think you'll be able to come?
I hope.
If I can.
- Okay.
- Um, Dan isn't coming.
- To the wedding?
- Mm-hmm.
I'm not surprised.
I mean, he's told me that you guys doing this for the show is fine, but he wants no part of it, and...
- Yeah.
- I understand that.
- I mean, if he...
- Yeah.
My dad is not coming to the wedding because he feels uncomfortable being on camera, and I'd like him to be there for such a huge event in my life, you know, that matters to me.
It's my one wedding, you know, and so, yeah, it's... it pisses me off that my dad can't put whatever shit he's got going on on the back-burner and, like, make it there, 'cause the reality
is he is supportive of me getting married.
He just can't get over himself.
This is gonna be the first and last time your daughter's getting married, and, I mean, it's, like, such an important thing for her, you know.
But they're so similar, you know.
- But it wasn't like that.
- She's so strong, and he's so strong, and neither one's going to give in, you know.
I mean, no.
Yes.
You don't think you're like your father?
Yeah, I know I am.
No, for sure.
You're a clone, are you kidding?
She is a clone.
She is.
Exactly.
- I am, I am.
- You're scary.
Is this a legal wedding yet or not?
Well, we were allowed to get married, and then the whole Prop 8 thing happened, and, like, our rights got taken away.
So we might actually...
because it's legal here, we might actually get legally married, like, tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- [Laughs]
- That's so cool.
- [Laughs]
- You're stuck with me.
- I know.
Mom doesn't know yet, exactly.
[Laughs]
There's no waiting period, though, once you get the license in Connecticut.
Yeah, what about blood tests, though?
Ah, the babies.
Oh, look at how excited they are.
- Hi.
- That's really good.
Both:
Hi.
Mom, we're staying longer in Connecticut.
Being that we can't technically get married in California, we might actually go down and get, like, an actual license here.
So you're going to get married?
I didn't think you quite got that part.
- [Laughs]
- You didn't make it very clear.
She's processing.
She's processing.
It's not her fault.
She did not make it clear.
I know.
My mom's reaction to hearing that we're getting legally married is comparable to me telling my mom that we're engaged.
Blank stare.
She just needs a process time.
- It ranges from 15 to 25 seconds.
- Yeah.
She's all, "we're gonna get a license."
You never said, "we're gonna get married tomorrow."
You just... yeah, you just said,
"I'm going to the... we're going to the town hall
- to get some papers."
- No.
In my head, it's a...
that's what you said.
No, because here's the thing.
Like, I don't wanna say, like, the wedding.
Like, we're not doing a wedding because that... this is like... that is what represents, like, our marriage even more so.
It's, like, the ceremony, having everybody we love together.
So you will be there tomorrow?
Yes, of course I will.
Oh, why would I not be?
- Oh.
- I want a hug too.

Hi, hon, how are you?
Good, I got you a little... a little shot?
Oh, good to see you.
You too.
I like your purse.
- It's borrowed.
- [Laughs]
So what's up?
I wanna hear the song that you were working on.
Coffee.
Yeah, I have, like, the intro and the chorus and everything put together.
I think you'll dig it.
I came to the studio to kind of have Dusty help me.
And it felt really good.
We both felt it.
And we're like, let's do this together.
Now we wanna try and work on another song, which is so insane that, this many years later, I would be here, like, doing music with him.
I'm gonna make the best track that I can for you.
And then we're gonna put your voice on it,
- and that's what pop music...
- Yeah.
And that's what music needs.
And that's what you need, is just to be real.
Sometimes I just stare at you.
- Hmm, really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?
- I don't know.
I stare at you sometimes.
- Just a weird like...
- It's just like a...

And then everyone in the club, their head explodes literally. [Laughs]
Literally, and then, yeah.
It's kind of weird.
It trips me out sometimes.
Like, sometimes I look at him, and he looks at me, and I'm just like, "were you a dream?
Like, did you happen in my past?"
My friend introduced me to Dusty in San Jose, and we started dating that day.
Literally, shook hands, fell in love.
We were on the balcony that night already making out.
And then we dated for four months of just being together every single day.
♪ We've got a missed connection ♪
♪ we've got something that isn't right ♪
We would just drink wine and talk about music and listen to music.
It was amazing.
Like, I was in love with him.
Dusty left me, so it wasn't my call.
That was one of the only people that ever really, like, really broke my heart.
And then six years later, I get a phone call that he lives in L.A. and is working on music.
I mean, our energy was cut so short
- whenever we knew each other...
- Uh-huh.
Just getting back in the room, it was just like...
- Immediate.
- Just like plugging it back in.
- It's just...
- That's what it felt like.
It's so weird because it's like... it's the same thing.
Like, I told you when, like, I met you years ago and showed up in San Jose, and it was, like, within two minutes, and, like, we're in this full-blown relationship.
- That's how we got...
- It's how we work.
That's how we do it.
Good energy is good energy.
And the fact that we have that still is amazing.
I know.
So, I mean, I just kind of feel like we should just go with it.
I know you work really hard, and I know you'll get shit done, and I need a lot of, like, you behind me right now, though.
I do. [Laughs]
I love doing music with him.
And he brings out a part of me that makes me feel like I'm 16 again.
Like, all the things about me that I kind of miss and haven't been around, he just brings it all back.
You're going to have a lot of time with me, Dusty Ray.
Yeah.
Your girlfriend ready for me to take over your life?
Is yours?
No. [Laughs]

We're going... we're gonna get married right now legally.

[Knocking] Hello.
- Hi.

Hi.
It's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- You look great.
- Both:
Thank you.
We went to town hall and got our marriage license.
And now we still have to have it officiated by the justice of the peace.
So, to make things easy for my grandma, we're getting married in her backyard.
They're coming up.
Come on.
[Laughs]
It's freezing in Connecticut.
I'm wearing a dress.
I'm dressed like an amish man.
So cute.
Whitney and Sara, you've come before us today and freely declared your desire to be married to one another.
Sara, please repeat after me.
- Whitney...
- Whitney...
- From this day onward...
- From this day onward...
- I choose you to be my wife.

I, Elisa Chase, am duly authorized to solemnize this, your marriage, according to the laws of the state of Connecticut.
It is therefore my honor to declare and pronounce that you are married.
Sara and Whitney, you may kiss your bride.
[Cheers and applause]
Yay.
I love you.
You're stuck with me forever.
[Laughs]
Fantastic.
Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.
- Congratulations.
Thank you so much.
Thank you guys all for being here.
Both:
I love you.

- Grandma, I love you.
- Yeah.
I love you too.
Oh, I'm happy to see they got married.
It's something I have to get used to too, but it's still fine, no matter how you... how you look at it.
Yeah.
I think they're adorable together.
Yay.
Thank you.
Okay, it's like a dream come true.
It's cool.
Yeah, it's special, for sure.
Yeah.
I don't think I ever thought my grandma would be at my wedding.
I love the fact that my grandma was at my, like, wedding that happened to be a same-sex marriage.
It's, like, huge for me.
And that she was supportive.
Yeah, I don't think... when I think about it right now,
I don't think I ever would've thought that.
So, I'm grateful.

(phone rings) 911 OPERATOR:
Emergency 9-1-1, may I help you?
MOM:
Yes, my daughter is being stalked online and we need help.
911 OPERATOR:
Yes ma'am.
Please stay calm.
I'll transfer you to a detective who can help you with this matter.
DETECTIVE PAGE:
Page here.
Can you please explain to me what's going on and I'll try to help.
MOM:
Yes, um, I'm Michelle Ashley and there's this guy who's been emailing my daughter, trying to get her to send pictures and... and to meet him.
And now he's calling our house and he's saying sick things on our answering machine and it needs to stop.
DETECTIVE PAGE:
The first thing that you need to do is to keep your daughter offline.
No emailing, no social networking.
Completely offline.
Now if she's offline, he won't be able to find her.
That's the safest thing to do.
(weeps)

DAD:
Oh, you know what... guess what Aiden?
I'm going to be chaperoning at your dance next week.
AIDEN:
Oh, God.
MOM:
Won't that be fun?
AIDEN:
It's just not cool to have your dad at the dance.
You don't do it.
MOM:
Oh your dad is cool.
Aren't you, honey?
DAD:
You know I wore gold chains and danced with your mother all the time?
AIDEN:
Dad, this is '99 not '79.
DAD:
Hey...
I'm still cool though, right?
I mean...
Aren't I?
AIDEN:
You are not chaperoning my dance next weekend.
Seriously, (laughs) am I that embarrassing to be seen with in public?
-Yes.
-Yes.
Well, I used to be cool.
(weeps)
Dad, are you locking people in or out?
Sweetheart, I'm a dad.
I do dad things.
I think you'll understand that when you have kids of your own.
Just stay off the computer.
STALKER:
(breathing)
You know honey, I've been thinking, seriously.
I, uh, really miss those days when chest hair and gold chains ruled the beach.
(laughs) Yeah, you were something.
No, you were something.
Oh yeah.
STALKER:
Hey, I was hoping to catch you, I'll try back.
See, it's him again.
STALKER:
I guess you're out.
I'm thinking of you.
Are you avoiding me?
I need to see you.
You know that I love you, right?
She's never even met you!
Sweetheart, it's OK.
Shh.
Just calm down, okay?
We are safe here.
Why doesn't it feel like it?
AIDEN:
I love you?
Miss you?
Oh, gross.
This guy is sick.
DAD:
Aiden we've got Thai food here, come on down and eat.
STALKER:

I mean Detective Page says it's pretty serious.
Right, you know what I think?

I think we are gonna get through this.
We have Detective Page standing by and he's just a phone call away.
MOM:

Sweetheart, it's OK.
AIDEN:
Hey, mom, I'm not really hungry.
MOM:
Aiden, honey... you need to eat something.
You're not on that computer, are you?
(sighs) Hang on...
Oh, Aiden.
Aiden, why is the window open?
I don't know.
Cause someone opened It.
Very funny.
Well make sure you close it before you go to bed, okay?
Listen, honey, don't worry about anything, okay?
It's all gonna be all right.
You just... get some sleep.
And stay off the computer.
Look at this.
He's been here...
tonight.
Look.
Our phone number, our security access codes...
Oh my God.
All right, call 9-1-1, I'm gonna call Detective Page from the office phone.

It's Okay, Aiden.
It's Detective Page.
Aiden, it's Detective Page.
I got ya.
It's okay.
You're okay.
(sobbing)
Okay.
Okay.
There you go.
What you readin"?
New cold case of mine, double murder.
Thirteen years.
Still haven't been able to close it.
(sigh) There's somethin' I'm missin'.
I'm thinkin' a hair piece and maybe some deodorant to start with.
(sigh) No?
All right, any solid witnesses, suspects, survivors?
No.
Well yeah, one survivor, but she completely disappeared... untraceable.
No address, bank accounts, credit cards, cell phones, no nothin'.
She's a ghost.
(typing)
We've turned over every rock and exhausted every lead tryin' to find her.
She's in deep hiding, poor kid.
Take a look at this.
What?
ls that her?
Where'd you find that?
That's technology.
No, no, no, no, she wouldn't have setup a profile page under her own name.
She's, she's untraceable for a reason.
That killer's still out on the streets.
I'm tellin' you this is not her doing.
That's tech.
It updates much quicker than your Flintstone files.
It's unbelievable.
He's stalking her again.
You're gonna want to trace the IP and get in touch with the server.
Okay.
We gotta bring in the computer guy, immediately, so we can find her before he does.
STALKER:
Detective Bonham.
You must be one of Philadelphia's finest.
So where do you think I am, detective?
It's a bad day for me, being the anniversary.
I mean, 13 years to the day, and look at me... no family, nothing.
Living in hiding under a fake name.
I mean who the hell am I?
I'm just as dead as they are.
OK, Aiden, stop.
I know, it's just so hard.
First thing, you can't hide here with all your paintings every day and expect to get any better.
You say you want to meet new people, but...
I'm trying.
No matter what I do, it's always there.
No matter how I try to distract myself... it's built into me.
It's killing me.
You're an artist.
By definition, you need to reach out to other people.
Experience the world around you.
Your art is the vehicle to do that.
So begin there, paint the starting line and I'm guessing that you might have an actual relationship with something other than a piece of canvas.
What do you say?
Forward march?
(laughs) You know, if you ever meet Tony Robbins, you should marry him.
(laughs) I am so sorry, I've gotta go.
I've got a patient.
Hey, thanks.
And I'm sorry I'm such a head case.
You're a great therapist.
I mean, you've really helped me the last few years.
Tell you what, if you put the past behind you, all your days will be good days.
Thanks Mrs. Tony Robbins.
(laughs)
Bye...
Quite captivating.
What's it called?
Lilacs Untouched.
Shall I wrap it up to go, or would you prefer we ship it?
His pushiness grows on you.
Genius sells itself.
When I first saw her work, I said to myself
"this person gets me in a way that no one else ever has."
Everyone who meets her...
she just has this effect on people.
They all fall in love with her.
And how could you not love her?
(sighs)
Aiden is my most important discovery.
Equal only to the advent of gin and tonic.
Bold statement.
Especially if you knew how much he drank.
-(laughs)
- Easy.
I'll take it.
Well...
How about some of that gin you were talking about?
Genius idea.
Thank you.
(phone ringing)
Detective Page?
Jack Dayton from Cyber Crimetics.
We spoke on the phone.
Pleasure to meet you.
Ah, yeah, let me close the door so we can have some privacy.
Okay.
Do you mind if I take a look at your computer.
Um...
Yeah, sure.
Okay, thanks.
(typing)
Uh huh.
I can see why you called.
I brought up to date fed background checks on everyone involved in the case... everyone working on the case, yourself and I included.
I feel like if we want to catch this guy, we trust no one.
Fight tech for tech.
So, umm, I tracked over a million IPs back to the original server, which is out of a hotel on the east coast.
He used a WiFi to hack the hotel server and that's, that's the end of the line.
He was there.
Wait a minute.
You telling me you found him?
Yeah.
For a second.
Can you do it again?
Absolutely.
Mr. Dayton.
I'm lookin' forward to working with you.
All right.
(laughs)
(lock clicks)
I always thought they should have kept the fire pole when they converted this place.
Wow, where'd you get the rotary phone?
Does that still work?
You know me, low tech or no tech.
And yes, It was my parents.
Aiden, you need to update and complicate.
Come join the world.
It's not such a bad place.
Technology has made us lazy and lonely.
I'd rather hours of solitude than bury my face in text and status updates.
Well that one sale can lead to more, but you need to think outside the bun here.
This is so '94?
You couldn't text on this if you tried.
I feel dirty just holding it.
Very funny.
This is the good old days.
Before GPS in every cell phone.
Hmmph.
(sigh) You know an art show is not something I think I'm ready for.
Well no one's ever ready.
I mean you... you just do it.
Rip the Band-Aid right off.
Expose yourself to the world.
I'm not the flasher type.
Well, you've got the goods, in more ways than one I might add.
You should show them off.
You're a great salesman and I love you for it.
But...
And I love you too, but starving artist is not an effective weight loss plan.
Oh don't get me wrong, I love being your patron saint and paying all the bills, but even the Pope will tell you, it's time to move on.
Wow!
What's this?
What's what?
This.
I call it Endure.
Addy, this work is fabulous!
This is going to break you to the world.
What are you typing?
A surprise, exclusive, last minute, one night only engagement.
Only a select few in the know will know.
All 'haves,' no 'nots,' high end clientele.
Addy darling, you're going to have a show.
I am?
You are.
We are.
Info is uploaded to my site's messaging board.
I can do some follow up press and an e-vile tonight.
You can use your fake name if you want, but it's here.
It's all right here, at the press of a button, that Enter button.
Come on Addy, I know you're a technophobe and everything, but it's time.
This is selfish to keep all this beauty to yourself.
Aiden, I promise I'll slop talking if you press Enter.
(sign)
Okay, let's not do it now.
But I will send it later, closer to the show.
okay...
Okay.
(laughs) Okay, all right.
(heavy breathing and laughing)
Found this painting in evidence.
Take a look.
A brush stroke is as unique as a fingerprint.
If she's still painting we'll find her.
I developed this program I call the "E-Later".
It's a cross reference where they can gather and analyze online picture files from not just where the photo was taken and on what medium, but to the actual, content within the photo, right down to the brushstroke.
It's amazing.
I get that a lot.
(laughs)
I got the program running on your database.
Worldwide search until we find what we're looking for.
It'll lake a couple days.
Unless we gel lucky.
Make it happen.
OK.
(typing and heavy breathing)
Yes.
(laughs)
How do I look?
Disgusting.
How is it that you look so good with so little effort.
I hate you sometimes.
Yeah well, I hate you better.
Listen.
Your parents would have been really proud of you tonight.
It's a forward march right?
After you...
AIDEN:
Wow, this is it.
It's all here.
Ladies.
Winton!
Thank you.
You know I don't drink.
It may help.
Winton, you've outdone yourself.
Salutations.
Addy, there's some people I want you to meet.
Forward march.
When they look back and talk of Monet and Basquiat, the name Aiden Cornelis will be whispered in the same sentence.
No low angles, double chin.
(laughs)
But really, she's far too modest.
When I look upon her work, to me it's like a, a...
A poem without words.
Exactly.
Let me show you her latest work.
Right this way please.
COMPUTER:
Match found.
The definitive "Endure."
Personally, I see less abstract and more realism in your recent work.
I would say that's about right.
I'm a big fan of your use of negative space.
The emotional impact has a sometimes Van Gogh feeling to it.
You're not going to cut your ear off, are you?
Oh well, yeah...
We'll have to see how tonight goes.
Paul Rogers.
Aiden Cornelis.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Can't say that about the rest of this crowd though.
They're kind of like cartoon characters, right?
Yeah, I tend to hate these things.
If there could only be art without the art crowds.
Absolutely.
COMPUTER:
Match found.
So what else should I know about Miss Aiden Cornelis?
Me...
Umm...
I rock at solitaire.
I talk in my sleep, mostly about politics.
Oh, and this boy, Jim Plumer, once in the 5th grade he told everybody I kissed him in the school yard.
That never happened.
No idea why I told you any of that.
So what about you?
Me?
I'm the youngest of three, older sister, brother, and like you,
Jim Plumer told everyone that I kissed him in the school yard... (laughs)
Now I'm embarrassed.
Even embarrassed looks good on you.
Ms. Cornelis?
These just came for you.
Wow!
Well, if these are from you, then you're officially very smooth.
Wish they were.
Lucky guy.
(clears throat)
Uh... but who then?
It doesn't have a card.
Mr. Flowers.
I don't have a Mr. Flowers.
(laughter) The lengths a guy will go to have a drink with a girl, huh?
Or coffee... water?
Look if you don't ingest fluids we can just sit there and consume large amounts of solid matter, or you can please interrupt me and...
I just don't know.
I...
Oh... it's my hair, it's just too perfect for most people.
I try to mess it up, it just ends up having this whole game show host vibe going on.
Ok.
Slop talking, I'll go.
Sorry to interrupt.
I need to get going.
Oh, excuse me, I...
Of course.
So, how does forward feel?
It's terrifying.
I should probably get a cat.
No.
You should go for it.
And um, if he has a brother... (laughs)
Thanks for coming.
I'm proud of you.
Bye.
Oh, Addy.
Two paintings just sold online, low five figures.
You're my golden goose, Addy.
Aiden, I uh just want to leave you my card.
(laughs)
(laughs)
Thanks.
Wait, so you're leaving already?
Uh, I was uh...
I was thinking about it.
But I can put it off, for a while.
So there's no Mrs. Flowers?
I'm allergic to pollen.

I know it's late, but I need it ASAP.
Thanks.
Thanks for driving me home Mr. Paul Rogers.
(giggles)
Hey, wait, your name is Mr. Rogers...
That's actually the first time I've ever heard that.
It was a pleasure.
Consider it my contribution to the arts.
You are quite the philanthropist.
Easy for you to say.
Wait, Paul, I don't...
I don't want... you don't want..
Um, um, I'm sorry uh... we only just met and I, I get it.
It's not that I don't want to, 'cause I do..
It's just I'm...
Hey, I... same here.
How about dinner, then?
Tomorrow night?
Hmm.
Tomorrow at 1:00?
I'll be there with a bell on.
You mean bells, plural.
You're a quick one.
(sighs, chuckles)
I didn't mean to slam the door on you like that.
(chuckles) Get some sleep.
I'll see you tomorrow.

Is that gray in your hair?
Tell me about it.
Music I used to listen to growing up is now considered classic rock.
Depressing as hell.
I thought you were a fellow technophobe.
Uh, I still am.
Good news.
We hired this company... well specifically this tech guy named Jack Dayton who introduced us to this, uh, picture data from the web, which is how we found you.
Come see.
He's already found me, hasn't he?
We got this new weapon.
Dayton's company can track down in minutes what would take Interpol weeks.
We're going to end this Aiden.
All of it.
And what next?
Cyber Crimetics which is Dayton's expertise, will be working out of our office.
And I'm going to be right here outside your door along with my partner keeping watch.
He's going to surface again, and when he does, we're gonna nail him.
Of course, we're going to have our work cut out for us.
It's good to see you Aiden.
I wish the circumstances were better.
No offense, but I look forward to every day I don't see you.
Hal I understand.
I'm going back to the office to sign off on a few surveillance, uh, expenditures but I'll be right back.
I'm calling the building manager for the outdoor key in case, we need somebody on the inside.
Lock the door.
Hey I take it back.
It has been good to see you.
(chuckles)
Goodnight, Aiden.
(breathing) Aiden.
Aiden, are you in there?
Good morning.
I'm so sorry you spent the night in the car.
I will be here every night until we catch this guy.
Tell me about Winton Cornelis.
Winton's a good friend.
Hmm, he's certainly your number one fan.
He's gone as far as to give you his last name.
It's like a marriage without the proposal.
He's done nothing but support me.
Literally.
Help to pay your bills.
Calls you three, four times a day.
He's my friend and my exhibitor.
How'd you meet?
At an art show.
Did he approach you?
Yeah.
Look it's not him.
Ten years is a long time Aiden.
Thirteen is longer.
Fair enough.
I left my car at the gallery last night.
Will you give me a ride?
Sure.
Oh hey, thanks for coming.
The power's been flickering all night.
The trouble seems to be coming from unit one.
I'll be in apartment four if you need me.
All right then.

You won't be needing these or these.
-Aiden.
-Hey.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah... yeah, let's go inside
-I'm sorry, I should have...
I should have just picked you up.
-No, I like my car.
I just don't get out a lot.
Ha.
I know the feeling.
I, uh, I work from a home office in my basement so I'm stuck underground... literally all day every day.
I'm like the mole people.
Oh, I don't leave by choice.
ls that weird?
WAITRESS:
Would you folks like anything else
Absolutely.
Um, I'll have a coffee black with a lemon wedge, and Aiden?
Same.
So what do you do?
Telecommunications.
Mostly... computers.
Ran the plates and background on Paul Rogers.
He was living in town at the time of her parents' murders.
Really?
Circumstantial, but he does have an assault charge against a woman.
He could be our guy.
Where is she?
She's at dinner with him.
(Phone dialing)
So, let's move onto the personal question around, ah.
Any recent fiancés, significant others, life partners, stalker ex-boyfriends?
What?
(phone rings)
Sorry.
Um, hello?
Aiden, Paul could be the one.
What?
OK, I need you to stay calm.
He was living in Walnut Grove the night of your parents' murder and he's got an assault charge against a woman.
Where are you?
The uh...
The Hyper Buddha.
It's on 66th.
OK.
Don't leave.
Make sure everyone in the place can see you.
I'm on my way and stay calm.
Yeah, okay.
I'm on my way.
Everything OK?
I'm fine, I'm just gonna use the bathroom.
OK... sure.
(sobbing) Dad!
(yelling)
Thanks.
(sobbing)
Aiden, you okay?
(gasping, crying)
PAUL:
(knocking)
Look uh, if, if you're not feeling all right, I...
I can get someone.
(sobbing, gasping)
PAUL:
Aiden!
Aiden!
Freeze!
(gasps)
Aiden, are you okay?
(sobbing) '90' you.
'90' you.
(sobbing)
(sniffles)
Strangely enough there's something hopeful about this.
Closest we've been in 13 years.
I can park myself right outside the door tonight.
Stay on the couch, whatever you want.
Where is your wife?
My wife.
Hmm... we're divorced.
She took our daughter and I haven't seen them in years.
I can't say I blame her.
I was never the husband or father I should've been.
I'm sorry.
Aiden, are you sure you don't want me to stay tonight?
I'm okay.
Okay.
I'll be outside in the car.
(sniffles)
Lock the door.
Okay (laughs, sniffles)
Hmm... what are you looking for?
I'm right here.
(laughs)
You owe me for this you know?
How many times I save your life, huh?
None.
Well, remind me to.
You catch the game on TV the other night?
I don't watch TV.
Good night.
DETECTIVE PAGE:
Good night.
(phone ringing)
Yes?
SUPERINTENDENT:
Ms. Cornelis?
It's the superintendent here.
What is it?
Well we've been having some power surges in the building here, but it's being worked on.
Just so you know.
Okay, thank you.
Bye.
(knocking)
I'm Detective Bonham, I've been working with Detective Page.
Just thought I would stop and introduce myself.
I'll be out in front if you need me.
(typing)
Hmm...
Goodnight Aiden.
PAUL:
Aiden, any recent fiancés, significant others, life partners, stalker ex-boyfriends?
DETECTIVE PAGE:
Aiden, Paul's the one.
(dialing)
Who are you talking to?
(phone ringing)
So, how was it?
Jill, it was him.
It was Paul who killed my parents.
What?
Are you OK?
(laughs) I wouldn't go that far.
Did he hurt you?
No.
JILL:
But they caught him?
No.
STALKER:
Hmm...
JILL:
Are the police at least there?
Constantly.
All I can say is, channel it into your art and let the police do their job.
STALKER:
(chuckles)
(typing)
Yeah, I'm just in this constant state of paranoia.
Paranoia is just nature's survival instinct.
Everyone needs and uses it to a certain extent.
In your case, it's the most normal thing about your life.
STALKER:
Hmm...
JILL: (sighs) Addy, listen, I'm here for you.
Okay?
(sighs)
STALKER:
Jill Gachet, who are you?
(chuckles)
(typing)
STALKER:
(laughs)
(grunts) Hey, what the... (grunts)
Detective James Page, but you already know that don't you?
What's this all a...
(grunts)
September 3rd, 1999.
Where were you?
What are you trying to...
You were living there the night that Shamus and Michelle Ashley were murdered, huh?
Would you just ease up a sec?
Huh, where were you?
I... that was uh...
almost 15 years ago.
Do you remember where you were?
Yeah.
I was putting two innocent people in body bags and guess who they were?
Am I being charged with something here?
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Where were you?
I grew up in Walnut Grove, all right?
But in 1999 I...
I...
I was backpacking in Europe that summer.
(sign)
I don't...
I don't understand what any of this has to do with Aiden...
Ashley?
-Yeah.
-Shamus...
-Yeah.
Michelle...
Aiden Ashley?
She was... she was that girl?
Yeah, she was that girl.
April 4th, 2001.
Remember your assault charge?
I, um...
I was walking home, like I did any other day, and I see this guy, this big guy with his girlfriend.
And they're fighting, both in each other's face.
So I...
I...
I...
I tried to stop him.
So when the police came, she pressed charges against me because she was scared of her boyfriend.
-Uh-huh.
-She dropped them a couple of days later.
It's all on file.
(phone dialing, phone rings)
Dayton.
Dayton, get me the passport file on Paul Rogers, and the paperwork on the assault charges.
He's not our guy.
You're positive?
Completely.
Sorry.
DETECTIVE PAGE:
Okay.
JACK:
Okay.
Checked out right?
You're free to go.
- Is she gonna be all right?
- I don't know.
-Look, if there's anything I can do I...
-I said you're free to go.
Get out of here.
It's not him, is it?
I'm sorry.
STALKER:
Welcome home, Aiden.
AIDEN:
So now what?
I'll let you know.
Everyone else checked out?
What do you mean?
Well Winton checked out?
Yeah, why?
It's just me being me.
Did he say something?
No.
Did he do something?
No.
I just need sleep.
Try to get some rest.
Okay?
STALKER:
Winton Cornelis.
I'll check into Cornelis for you.
I'll see you in the morning.
PAUL:
Hey you've reached Paul Rogers.
I'm not here right now.
Please leave a message.
Hey Paul, it's me Addy...
Aiden.
The unstable girl from last night.
I just want to say, sorry.
STALKER What!
I mean, I didn't even get to try the coffee.
So, if you want to take a break from the mole people and get out of your underground office for round two in the life and times of me, then...
STALKER Aiden!
OK.
I'm rambling.
STALKER No, No!
I can tell my police escort to ease up a bit.
You will not be with any other man!
(grunting)
- What I?
- What the hell is going on in here?
(grunts)
STALKER Idiot!
911 OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's the nature of your emergency?
Hello?
I can hear some commotion there, are you OK?
I'll be dispatching both medical and police to your location.
Yeah, it's good to see you again.
Gas included, one parking space like the sign says, move in today.
Okay.
I'll take it
-What do you mean?
-Well...
Hey, you need a night watchman tonight?
If you could I'd appreciate it.
Yeah, see you there.
Thanks.
Who's he?
Oh I'm sorry.
I should have introduced you.
That's my partner, Detective Bonham.
You have someone helping you watch her that I don't know about?
(sighs) Bonham can be trusted.
According to files, Bonham started working at the same precinct not long after the murders.
Would have given him enough time to apply and graduate the academy.
He's a standup guy.
I can vouch for him.
Not the point.
You got to keep me on top of these things.
My apologies.
So, getting back to this, what are you saying?
The IP address led us to a residence that was abandoned and vandalized.
Whoever trashed the basement suite and left in a hurry had some time and used the Gutman method.
A series of algorithms used to securely erase hard drives, running 35 patterns over the region to be deleted.
Again, but in English.
What I mean is, he took that much care to make sure that no one saw what was on those few remaining hard drives, but was so careless about one thing.
What's that?
A post-it note that must have slid under the desk.
And on that post it note?
A code.
To what?
A bank account.
Whose?
STALKER:
Winton Cornelis.
BANK TELLER:
Your account number please?
Yes, account number 8166324.
BANK TELLER:
How can I help you today?
I'd like to check a balance.
BANK TELLER:
Savings or Checking?
Checking.
BANK TELLER:
Last name?
Cornelis.
BANK TELLER:
Your account is actually overdrawn.
-(buzzing)
-What?
Overdrawn?
Doesn't even make any sense.
BANK TELLER:
Let me bring up your file.
PAUL:
Hey, it's Paul.
BANK TELLER:
Hmm... would you be able to come in and see us about the matter?
Yes, I'll come in.
BANK TELLER:
See you soon Ms. Cornelis.
(knocking)
-Hey.
-Hey.
(sighs) I uh...
I hope I'm not the cause of that annoyed look on your face.
(laughs) No, some bills overdrew my account.
I have to go to the bank.
(phone ringing)
My Wall Space, how may I help you?
Hey, the account set up in your name, it's been overdraft for some reason.
Thoughts?
What?
No.
No idea.
Well, since I'm technically not on the account, can you go down and check it out?
Definitely.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
Detective James Page, Philadelphia PD.
Got a minute?
So, what do you feel like eating?
(sighs) Honestly, can we order in?
Yeah, sure.
It's my favorite type of food.
Chinese?
(giggles) Let's do Thai.
All right.
DETECTIVE PAGE:
She's wonderful, isn't she?
Amazing.
She's certainly had a rough go.
To say the least.
It's noble that you stepped up and kept her off the grid, so to speak, for so long.
You've been like, um, a guardian angel to her.
Well I think that's over-selling it a bit.
You two, um, you've never been... you know... intimate?
Friends.
With benefits?
Just friends.
I noticed you set up a business account and a substantial amount of money was taken out of it after the art show.
You want to tell me about that?
Yes I...
I just heard from Aiden.
I was just on my way to the bank.
I was already there.
I'll save you the trip.
It was transferred into your personal account.
What?
No... well, not by me.
No?
We call that embezzlement.
Are you here to arrest me?
I'd rather get you on murder.
You know, I usually stay away from this kind of stuff in order to maintain my girlish figure, but it's... (laughs) ...it's pretty good.
Mmhm.
The delivery guy kind of knows me by name.
Eat in a lot?
More than I'd like.
Understandable.
It is?
Of course.
I just don't want to come off like a total recluse.
Too late.
The, uh, stack of express post and take-out boxes kind of gave you away.
(laughs) Okay, fair enough.
So what about you?
You get out a lot?
Yeah... yeah.
I, uh, I... you know, I bike, I hike, I fish...
Pike.
Sounds, a little Dr. Seuss actually, but yeah I...
I like to play.
You're like a giant kid.
Hey, anyone can grow old but it takes a certain someone to stay immature for life, you know?
I like that.
So, um, 10 years from now, where do you see yourself?
Uh... married, two kids, a minivan with terrible transmission.
I don't know, just... in a perfect world, someone to walk beside me and not have to look over my shoulder type deal.
Oh, you know what?
What?
I'm a great walker.
(phone rings) Oh.
(phone rings)
Hi.
It's Jill.
Listen, this may sound strange but to me it's just not sitting right.
I tried calling Detective Page but I couldn't get through.
I thought I should tell you for your own safety.
Well, what is it?
I have this new client.
And you know me, I would never violate patient-doctor confidentiality, but in this case...
Well, you wouldn't tell me unless it was important.
He was telling me about his past, asking questions.
When he was young his family was stalked out in Walnut Grove.
And he moved to the city, going offline, trying to escape this person.
He went on and the details were exact.
So, you think he came to you to get to me?
Yes.
Aiden, watch your back.
Bye.
(screams)
STALKER:
Well that worked out nicely.
(People yelling)
(phone ringing)
Page here.
I was talking to Jill earlier and she says he's been into her office as a patient, trying to get into my head.
What?
Yeah.
You need to talk to her.
I can't.
What do you mean, can't?
Jill's dead
What?
An accident.
She was hit crossing the street.
(sighs) Was it him?
No.
Some other guy.
They're talking to him right now.
This isn't happening.
What is it?
Look, I'm on my way over and this time you're gonna speak directly to Dayton.
I'd feel better coming there.
Um, can your guy make it for six?
Okay.
I'll call him.
You want me to pick you up?
I have a ride.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'll see you there.
What happened?
STALKER:
And again... (laughs) And again... (laughs)
Goodbye Jill.
(phone ringing)
Dayton.
DETECTIVE PAGE:
Uh, Jack...
-Yeah?
DETECTIVE PAGE:
Jill is dead.
-What?
DETECTIVE PAGE:
Talkin' on her cell, she walked into traffic.
-You're kidding?
-Meet me at the office in 10.
Yeah... yeah...
Absolutely.
I'll, uh, I'll see you then.
DETECTIVE PAGE:
I'll see you there.
Hi.
Thanks for getting her here.
No problem.
I'll be out here if you need me, Okay?
Thanks.
Jack Dayton, Aiden Ashley.
Hello.
Hi.
I'm sorry about your friend.
Winton Cornelis, as I see it, he has you under lock and key.
ls there anything in your life right now that's not tied to Mr. Cornelis?
Winton's always been a good friend.
He's taken money out of your account, Aiden.
You're an investment to him and he stands to make a lot of money.
He's making online art purchases, and then, taking the money from your account to pay for them.
Does that seem friendly to you?
ls he here?
Can I talk to him?
Yeah.
He's in the interrogation room.
You need to tell them I'm not involved in any of this.
I have known you for a very long time, and you've been nothing but amazing to me.
I need you to look me in the eye and tell me you had nothing to do with this.
I swear to you.
I...
I've done nothing.
Any chance of happiness, now and for the rest of my life, will always be tainted because my parents aren't here.
I'm begging you, if you know something, tell me now.
Honestly...
I don't know what's worse.
Being locked up in here or that you could even think I'd possibly be able to do something like this.
And I want you to know that in those sad-happy moments,
I will always be there as your friend.
Are we more than friends?
Yes.
Are we business partners?
Yes.
Can we both make each other a lot of money?
Most definitely.
But underneath that, you know I've always been here for you.
I hope you can believe that.
Well?
It's not him.
Look, I know it's hard to accept this, but...
Of the few people I do know in my life, I know.
And it's not him.
I mean, any online stuff, any money accounts, we know this guy can do that.
What physical evidence do you have on Winton?
It's him.
And if it's not?
I'm dead?
Then perhaps there's someone else in your life that you just don't know as well.
Enough!
You're just dogs chasing your tails.
This man has spent the past 13 years of his life helping you, and I'm assuming he'd spend another 13.
If it's not Winton Cornelis then we'll keep looking.
But for now, we have to focus on what we do have, instead of what we don't.
Here, if you have any concerns.
Call me.
Yo, Aiden, uh, I have a business call with Taiwan later tonight, which I can do via laptop and that couch looks pretty comfy so...
I can stay.
If you'd like someone to be around, fill in the silence.
You'd still slay after all that drama?
Yeah.
STALKER:
Aiden
I'll grab my stuff from the car.
OK.
So, your computer is like a phone?
Uh huh.
Just press connect.
No phone or long distance necessary.
It's not going to be weird that I still deadbolt my door is it?
You do what you got to do.
Thanks.
Good night.
Yeah.
Good night.
STALKER:
Paul, you are getting in my way.
WOMAN:
Okay.
So can we make those trades with China?
If you want.
WOMAN:
Invoice me for extra costs?
Yeah absolutely, absolutely.
I'll just...
WOMAN:
So, will you check the account?
Uh huh.
WOMAN:
And tell me how many we can afford.
There's about two.
To maybe three... just about.
WOMAN:
Three?
Should be enough though.
WOMAN:
Will your delivery appear on the next invoice?
PAUL:
Yup.
WOMAN:
Um, and either two or three cargo boxes on Thursday?
PAUL:
Mmhm hmm
WOMAN:
Morning delivery please.
PAUL:
Will do and...
WOMAN:
Any additional cost overage...
(keys jangling)
STALKER:
(sighs)
(whispers) Aiden...
(moans)
(door shuts)
Whoa, whoa Aiden, Aiden.
-(yells)
You're Okay Aiden.
You're Okay.
It's Okay.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was ready to have someone sleep over.
But I wasn't.
It...
It's Okay.
I, uh, I...
I understand.
I'm an idiot.
No, no.
You're... you're just, haunted.
Look, uh, would it be easier if I just went home?
ls that OK?
I'm sorry.
Maybe just for the rest of tonight.
Sure.
Um, look.
You know where to reach me if you need me, right?
-Yeah.
-It's Okay.
-Yeah.
Okay.
-Okay.
STALKER:
Goodnight, Aiden.
PAUL:
All right Page, where are you?
(phone tone plays)
(car alarms going off)
(phone tone plays)
(phone tone plays)
(phone tone plays)
Goodbye?
(engine revving)
(engine revving)
(grunts)
(typing)
Locks.
Lights.
Where is he?
He's in the O.R. There was an accident.
Accident?
How is Winton doing this from jail?
We don't know that anyone's done anything yet.
We just started the investigation.
Yeah, we've done really well so far.
I'll be right out here.
Paull
Oh, God!
Paul, can you hear me?
Paul!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It was... the Detective...
Detective...
My phone... check... check the text messages.
Detective Page?
What?
(dialing)
(ringing)
JACK:
Hello.
Dayton here.
Hello?
This... this is Aiden.
Aiden Ashley.
I didn't know who else to call.
Can we please talk?
Of course.
Are you okay Ms. Ashley?
There's been some things.
I just... can we meet in person?
Absolutely.
Time and place?
How about tonight, my apartment.
8 o'clock?
I'll be there.
Thank you.
Did he say anything?
No.
I've got to go.
Aiden, it's important.
Did he see who did this to him?
ls there something you're not telling me here?
It's been a long day, Okay?
Okay.
I'll follow you home.
Are you sure you don't want me to come in?
Now is not a good time.
Look... (sighs)
It may not feel like we're getting anywhere right now, but I'm not gonna stop 'til we get him.
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm fine.
I'll be right outside if you need me.
Lock the door.
I always do.
(buzz)
Hello?
Ms. Ashley, it's Jack Dayton.
Would you buzz me in?
(buzz)
(knocking)
Thanks for coming.
(typing)
JACK:
This is Detective Page's hard drive.
There's enough of your artwork and photos on here to make anyone uncomfortable.
(gasps)
Paul did say he thought it was Detective Page who attacked him.
He was the first responder on the scene 13 years ago.
And he was the first one on the case when you started filing complaints with the police before your parents' passing.
So it was him?
(sighs) Why would he stay on the case for so long?
It seems, something more than just trying to solve an unsolvable case.
Something more than pride.
Something that mattered more to him than saving his own marriage or family.
His superiors, the city, everybody closes the investigation.
But his investigation's intention was getting close and... and staying close to you.
He hired me not to find the killer, but to find you, for him.
And I led him right here.
I don't understand It was... when I was young it was his job and... and now I...
I thought he genuinely cared.
These types of people, um, for them, it's about power.
About entitlement.
They will put you in harm's way, just so they can save you.
(sighs)
Then it's like a banker coming to collect what they're owed, by any means necessary.
So what do we do?
If we call the police now, who do you think would be the first person on the scene?
We run, they have an entire force.
We have two sets of eyes on us now.
This is actually his police files and account?
Of course.
Why wouldn't he just kill me all those times we were alone together?
Sometimes it's not their intention to kill the victim.
They see themselves as protectors, guardians.
He has a love that transcends what the average person could even begin to understand, it's...
It's not love.
To him this could be the only thing he has left.
A man with nothing is a very dangerous animal.
Aiden.
(grunts)
(weeps)
I got it.
For what it's worth, I think you're very talented.
Thanks.
The more I think about it, the more I realize there's nothing more artistic than to love others.
Van Gogh, you've done your research.
When you're bound to a chair, it forces you to be thorough.
I guess we're both trapped in our own ways.
Hmm.
(grunting)
(dialing)
(ringing)
RECORDING:
We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed, please check the number or call your operator to... (dialing)
(ringing)
RECORDING:
We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed, please check...
I'm gonna check in on her, you sit tight.
Yeah.
These kinds of files, are they standard for this type of police investigation?
I mean, um, there's a lot here.
Uh... wait.
Oh God...
I'm sorry.
And I just let him in every time he knocked.
You know I've... researched thousands of these cases and in some of them, the women in your situation have actually connected with their pursuer.
Both realizing that they wanted the same thing, a peace... that only they could offer.
(knocking)
DETECTIVE PAGE Aiden!
(knocking)
Aiden!
I can hear you walking around.
Are you okay?
We're fine.
We?
It's just Dayton.
What?
Yeah, we're going over some files.
Aiden, we've been out front the whole time.
Dayton never came in the front door.
Call Detective Bonham, he'll confirm it.
I'm slipping his card underneath the door.
You've got to open the door.
AIDEN:
Hang on.
Aiden, just open the door.
The phone isn't working.
DETECTIVE PAGE:
Aiden please open the door!
Don't open the door.
Ugh.
(grunting)
DETECTIVE PAGE Aiden!
Aiden!
Aiden!
Aiden!
Open the door, Jack.
(grunting)
Ahh...
(Panting)
241 Eagle Creek Road.
Go, go!
Come on.
Hmm...
What the hell is going on?
Damn ill
You know, under Van Gogh's "Patch of Grass" painting they recently found a scribbled out drawing of a woman.
The same woman, I'm guessing, he gave his severed ear to.
How could she not see the sacrifice he had made for her?
Nothing more artistic than to love others.
Why can't you love me?
(heavy breathing)
Please.
Please, it's the... it's the only thing I have ever asked of you.
(heavy breathing)
There are so many ways this could end... or begin.
I just want to give you the happiness you deserve.
And I want that, more than anything.
I'd kill myself for you.
Please do!
(grunts)
Move, move, move!
He's got a gun.
-(gunshots) -(grunting)
Aiden!
You OK?
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
I wouldn't do that.
(heavy breathing)
Do you know how long I've waited for this?
And now you're trying to take it from me.
Haven't you done enough?
- Don't make me do this.
- We're not making you do...
-Please.
-...anything.
Just put the gun down, nobody needs to get hurt... (grunts)
Now it's just the two of us, as it should be.
Can't you see?
What have you done?
It'll never be the two of us...
I'd rather die than be with you!
(heavy breathing)
I'm sorry... (heavy breathing) Ah!
(grunting)
(crying)
Aren't you gonna miss me?
Don't you have a flight to catch?
I'm serious.
When I moved to this city I was terrified.
You and Jill were my family.
You know, London would be really nice this time of year or you could even go to Florence.
Winton, I'm trying to say goodbye.
I know.
But this is uh... this is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
But it's also the happiest day of my life.
You've been through so much and now you're free.
It's what I've always dreamed of for you.
I love you, you know that.
And I love you too.
(clears throat)
And luckily I love this man.
So where are you going first?
Well he doesn't know it yet but...
Paris.
Why am I not surprised?

You know, I told him
This shelf smells like a privy.
I will treat it as such.
Captain, reporting with a new prisoner.
Signed by the emperor.
Shut your mouth.
Looks like we've caught quite a fish today.
Mystical insurrection against the empire.
You, dirty old beggar?
Sir, he's of The Way.
Martinian, is it?
Yes, sir.
What way?
Say what you mean, guardsman.
He's a follower of the one they call "Jesus the Christ. "
Jesus the Christ, a religious fanatic.
Is that all we get here these days?
Name?
What is his name?
Simon Peter of Galilee.
They call him "the fisherman. "
He knew Jesus.
Enough!
Take him to the box.
Let him convert, relax.
Father, thank you for this chance to suffer for you.
Thy will be done.
When do you think they will pass his sentence?
Do you really think he knew this Jesus?
We should question him.
Maninian, you'd rather look at some old fool than your wife?
Go home.
Calm yourself.
You'll be ﬁne by yourself?
I think I can handle watching a door.
Right, well, I'll see you in the morning.
Is it you, Lord?
Ask your God to save us.
Are you afraid he'll deny you?
Am I to be judged silently by an assassin's blade in the night?
No... that face has never seen murder, much less committed it.
I'm not supposed to give you this.
So were you a priest or a prophet?
I am a fisherman.
Lord Jesus, thank you for this food, bless it to my body and body to your service.
Thank you for my captors.
I pray for their hearts to be open to you.
Amen.
So- what is your price?
What?
What do you seek in payment for this forbidden meal?
Just a-just a chat, something to pass the hours.
Yeah right, it's my wife, my Novella.
She's heard about these Christians and their Way.
And your Messiah, this Jesus, she's insatiably curious about him.
I've warned her repeatedly to be careful, but you know women, or perhaps you don't.
Here I am with one of the most famous Christians in my charge.
There's no harm to ask him a few questions, for her sake.
Ask, and it shall be given to you;
seek, and ye shall find.
What, did he say that?
Your God, your Jesus?
He said, "Come to me,
"all those who are weary and heavy laden,
"and I will give you rest, peace.
Do you want peace?
Don't get any ideas.
The gods are good enough for me.
And what of the life after this one?
Are you prepared for that?
You really think you could convert me to living a life of persecution?
No, to living a life of hope with an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, nor fade.
Is that so?
Do you care to make a wager on that?
If you can convert me, I'M set you free.
That wager would not be fair for you.
Well, we will talk then, and you will tell me of your God, and you will meet your match, Simon Peter.
If that is your wish, but I thought it was your wife who was interested.
Processus.
Don't think you'll get away with that easily.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Fraternizing with a prisoner.
It was merely an interrogation.
On whose orders?
My own.
I should report this.
Are we to open Pandora's Box and report each other's transgressions, dear Processus?
Should I report the gambling?
The women?
The missing wife?
The lightened coffers?
I was wondering when you might grow a backbone.
Why is he so important to you, anyway?
He's a famous man.
I've never met a famous man.
I'm curious.
Don't get too attached.
His sentence?
There's no reward waiting for you in the Kingdom.
My master can free you from this suffering and provide great riches.
All you need do is deny him, as you did before.
That was long ago!
I have been forgiven.
Do not speak to me about your temporary earthly riches.
I now have everlasting riches beyond anything that you can provide.
Have you?
Has your Father told you that.
My master told me a secret.
Perhaps he will tell you too, when you meet him.
That I shall die in 3 days?
Be gone, demon!
Three days, Simon Peter, three days, and you're mine.
In the name of Jesus,
I cast you out!
Did you hear that?
A shriek in the cells?
What of it?
Well, perhaps we should check.
Perhaps you should relax.
Ah, that- that's disgusting.
You'll get used to it, the screams, the filth.
So what do you think of the gods?
Ugh!
You are boring!
Is this what happens when you marry?
What if they're right?
What if their one God is greater than the Olympians?
So join them.
I have a cell just your size ready.
No...
No, I will not endanger my wife like that, but still I'm troubled with what we're doing.
They say these Christians go quietly to their deaths.
Makes my job easier.
I mean, it's amazing they get any converts at all.
What could this cult possibly offer a man for him to risk his freedom and his life?
Who cares, as long as there's coin in rounding them up?
Your heart is as black as this place.
Thank you.
I will find out more.
I didn't see a thing.
Did you really know him?
The one they call the King of the Jews?
You truly mean to hear my story, don't you?
I do.
Did he really rise from the dead?
The story begins long before that day.
I have time.
Tell me everything.
You may have time;
however, I have but 3 days left to my life.
Who told you that?
How do you know that?
If the forces that surround me frighten you, then this is not a tale for your ears.
I want to know, I need to know.
Your one God, is he greater than all the rest?
There is only one true God.
But how do you know?
Jesus himself said,
"I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one comes to the Father, but through me. "
He had power over the storms, made the lame walk and the blind see.
He healed the lepers and made the dead rise.
So you were friends with this Jesus?
A prophet?
A living God?
What of us, if we're to put you to death?
Peace.
I will tell you of Jesus, our Lord.
First...
I knew him as a man.
Brother
Hurry, Simon!
He called to us!
There, there, I can see him,
I can see him!
Come on, brother!
Hurry up!
He is this way!
We have to get home and tend to Mother!
There, Simon, hurry!
He is there!
Come on!
Andrew!
Andrew.
As I gazed upon him,
I was afraid- not of him.
His presence was like all the light and love and goodness of the world.
No, I was afraid for myself} for I knew at that moment that my life would now become about him.
But what was I, a simple ﬁsherman, strong enough to face such a life?
You are Simon, son of John.
You will be called Peter.
Tell me, brothers, who do people say that I am?
There are those that say you are John the Baptist or Elijah, but mostly people say you are a prophet, but they don't know for sure.
And what about you?
Who do you say I am?
You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Then Jesus walked with us to our home by the sea, where my wife's mother lay dying.
Her sickness was deep.
It was the kind no remedy could cure, but Jesus reached out his hand.
Before my eyes, he had banished the sickness.
This was but one of many miracles he performed, seen by many witnesses.
That is quite a story, if any of it's true.
Why would I be false?
What would I gain?
You have nothing I want.
Not even freedom?
As I said, you have nothing I want.
Even if I believe you,
I've already made up my mind.
You are clearly insane.
In what respect?
Well, any man who wishes good health upon his mother-in-law is- mad.
Your wits are sharp, soldier.
What is your name?
Martinian.
Would you hear more of Jesus and accept what I say is the truth?
I will listen well.
It's only a rooster.
The sound offends you?
It reminds me.
Reminds you of what?
I denied my Lord.
I denied him, not once, but three times.
You sinned against your Lord?
I denied him.
You were not cast out from his fellowship?
Man can be weak in the heart and mind.
Our Lord knew this.
I say to you, anyone who commits any sin is a slave to sin, and a slave does not remain in the house forever.
The Son remains forever.
So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
The emperor can forgive.
A magistrate can forgive.
Beg for their forgiveness.
Deny your Lord, and you could go free.
I am already free.
What, even in chains?
You are the one in chains, Martinian, not I.
Free yourself.
So you will do nothing?
You will sit here and wait for death?
With Christ, death is only a beginning.
And what of me, Simon Peter, and my question?
Let's say you're right.
Who would forgive my sin, being your jailer, jailer to the personal friend of God?
Forgiveness is only found in Jesus, our Lord.
So, I should, uh-
Yeah.
Home to your wife.
Leave a real soldier to do his job.
Forgiven?
You?
You are a fool to die.
Christ has forsaken you.
God has forsaken you.
You are alone!
I am not alone!
Jesus says, "I will neither leave you nor forsake you. "
Nothing better to do than rile at the rabble with talk of gods?
How could you follow a leader like that?
King of the Jews, right?
We were more like soldiers following our General.
Can't you imagine the different kind of leader, one where the lower soldier is as important as the highest general?
You mean I would have the same stature as the officers?
Why would any general agree to that?
There is a difference between leading and love of your people, versus having the love of power, the greed of leadership.
Man was born with the desire to rule.
What if your general loved you and felt that all men were created equal?
Jesus was that kind of a general.
My brother Andrew and I were among the ﬁrst of the disciples, captains, you might say.
You're mistaken, Brother.
The Master clearly called me first.
You are mistaken.
I told you that we found the Messiah.
I was in the boat when Jesus called,
"Come, follow me. "
We were in the boat together.
He called to us at the same time.
Yes, yes, but I was closer to the shore.
There was John and James, the sons of Zebedee, whom Jesus cherished.
Mother wanted me to sit on Jesus rig ht hand.
And you on the left.
Why am I to be on the left?
Mother has no say in this.
You be on the left.
I will be on the right.
James, Jesus loves me better than you.
Hmph, we will see about that.
There was Philip, Nathaniel, and Thomas,
James, the son of Alpheus;
Thaddeus;
Simon, the Canaanite;
Matthew the tax collector;
and, of course, there was Judas.
But Jesus knew what was in our hearts.
The Master spoke of giving power beyond comprehension.
Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, drive out demons.
Freely you have received;
therefore, give freely.
Suppose it doesn't work, Lord?
Suppose I rebuke a demon, and it refuses to leave?
There are times when it will be more work.
Some can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.
Witchcraft and magic.
That is not what I speak of.
I speak of the true power, which can only come from God.
Not very nice of you.
Your Lord gives you powers, yet you deny him three times?
You have much anger in you.
You have a wish for true love in your life, peace, happiness.
Show me these powers of yours.
Prove it.
You are not ill.
You are not beset by demons.
What would you have me do?
Hmph, ﬁgures.
I would have you be crucified and die a rebel's death.
Oh, did no one tell you?
Now, I've gone and spoiled the surprise.
It cannot be that way.
Let's see how quickly your knees turn to water.
You misunderstand
I am not worthy to die in the same manner as blessed Jesus.
What?
You think it's some kind of honor?
You're insane.
Martinian, you will come with me.
You got me.
You will come with me now!
What's this all about?
An agent with the seal of the emperor wants to question you about your talks with this Christian rebel.
Martinian-
Martinian, what's wrong?
What are you doing here?
This is no place for you.
Is he really here?
Is who here?
Simon Peter, of course.
The one they call the Prince of the apostles.
He is here.
Why did you not mention it?
Must I tell you of every prisoner now, Wife?
Do not attempt that tone with me, Husband.
You'll only embarrass yourself.
Yes, he's here.
I've even spoken to him, asked him questions.
Well, you've asked him all the wrong questions.
You don't even know what I've asked.
I know you've asked the wrong thing.
And what would be the correct question?
Ask him for a blessing, of course, for my womb, so I may bear you a child.
That is dangerous talk.
I know your interest in these Christians, but better not go further.
It doesn't, does it?
No, of course not.
I'm serious.
I will not lose you to this cult.
I hear you.
You have made yourself clear.
I'm also curious about this man, but I will not ask for his blessing.
That crosses the line.
I will ask him one question.
Will that suffice?
Now; if you need time to think-
I
- I want to know how Jesus really died, and the days leading up to his death, and-
Well, ask him that, and you shall be allowed to sleep in the bed tonight.
All right, I have a question.
Not so circumspect today.
Are you eager to hear tales of my Master?
There is one tale in particular I would hear:
the death of your Lord.
How did it come about?
That is a tale both sad and glorious.
I'm surprised you do not know the answer already.
I know some whispers, rumors.
I would hear the truth of it from one who lived it.
They say he was betrayed?
Yes, he was.
Who was it?
Why did he do it?
Please, I must hear.
I have to be sure.
If your Master is the true Son of God, and you are his right hand, I will be-
I fear for my soul.
If I tell you this story, and you know my words are true, will you then accept Jesus as your Lord?
I will listen well.
I promise nothing more.
Where shall I begin?
It was on the night of the Passover feast.
Jesus summoned us all to dine with him.
There was an inn.
There was an upper room away from all eyes.
There was a table set for 13.
I had walked with Jesus, seen many wondrous and terrible things.
I thought I had become wise and learned of the world, burl was not prepared to hear the secrets this room would reveal.
Brother, join me.
Who would've thought that two fishermen from Galilee would be here in this room?
My hands have lost their roughness.
As have mine.
Do you miss it?
We're still fishermen, Brother.
Now we cast our nets for the Lord.
Who's supposed to wash our feet?
Philip, you didn't arrange for servants to wash our feet?
The Master did not tell me to provide for servants.
Must you be told everything?
Should we wash our own feet?
Well, I'm not.
Well, where do we sit?
We should wait for the Master to assign places of honor.
Well, why wait then?
The order is always the same.
Judas, welcome.
Are the others far behind?
They come.
It's been decided we'd wait for the Master before we sit.
You can wait.
I've walked all day.
As have I.
And so we sat, we talked, and we laughed, even persecuted, even hunted as we were.
We laughed because Jesus was still with us.
And then he entered, and then there was no more laughter, not for a long, long time.
I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;
for I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds its fulfillment in the kingdom of God.
Blessed are you, O Lord, our God,
King of the universe, who chose and sanctified us with your commandments and who gave us appointed times for happiness: festivals.
And times for joy, the day of this festival, Lord;
the festival of matzah.
He spoke the prayer of joy and of thanks, but there was no joy in the room.
He was still a beacon of love and light, but over the rest of us a shadow fell.
Take and eat.
This is my body, which is broken for you.
Do this in remembrance of me.
Drink from this cup, all of you, for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
Do this in remembrance of me.
So what did it mean, the drinking of the wine and the eating of the bread?
This is the symbol of the new covenant in remembrance of his death.
You are those who stood by me in all my trials, and I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred his kingdom upon me.
Peter-
Satan intends to sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith may not fail.
And when you have turned back, I say to you, you will encourage your brothers.
Lord, I am prepared to go with you to prison and to death!
I tell you Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.
No wonder you hate to hear the crowing of the rooster.
I was a fool.
But you said he forgave you.
Yes, later, not that I deserved it.
So Jesus became the sacrifice.
Yes, he was ushering in the new covenant that his death would symbolize.
Do you understand?
Not really.
In time, you will.
So what happened next?
What does he do now?
I don't know.
He prepared a wash basin like a servant?
But why?
it was to be- one of his last lessons to us.
If only I had known it,
I would not have hesitated
Lord?
You do not understand now, but later you will understand why I am doing this.
No Lord, you will never wash my feet.
If I do not wash your feet, then you will have no place in me.
He washed your feet?
That's madness!
Your Master, your so-called living God, why would he lower himself to the duties of a slave?
No, no leader would lower himself in his men's eyes.
But Jesus did lower himself.
I do not understand.
Explain this to me.
Jesus was talking about spiritual cleansing.
While we were arguing about who was the greatest,
Jesus showed us what loving, humble service looks like.
But if we are to love one another, then how could one of your own betray Jesus?
What you speak of- is the devil.
The devil?
What is this?
A dark serpent, Satan.
He works against God's light, cloaking the world in violence, hate, and distrust, turning men against one another.
Sol am damned as a soldier.
You have a choice, Martinian.
The Lord has given you a choice;
for God wills that all men should be saved
It's not so easy.
The devil was in your ranks.
Who was it?
How did it happen?
After the washing of feet, the darkness was revealed to us.
I have washed your feet as an example to you.
Now that you know it, blessed are you if you do it.
A person who has taken a bath needs only to wash his feet.
His whole body is clean.
You are clean.
But I am not speaking about all of you.
I know those who I have chosen, but all this is to bring about what the Scripture said.
Even my close friend, he who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.
What does this mean, Lord?
I am telling you now, and I tell you the truth.
One of you will betray me.
What is he saying?
That is impossible!
It cannot be!
A traitor amongst us?
Find the traitor!
Tell me, tell me who it is, Lord!
One of the twelve, he who dips his hand with me in the dish.
Here at this table, sitting among us as a friend, is a man who will betray me.
And as I looked around the table,
I saw the weakness that lies in all men, even us, the twelve chosen by God.
We were not above fear.
It was the worst kind of fear:
not fear from without, but fear from within.
So one by one, I looked at them, and I saw their fear.
No one was closer to Jesus.
No one stood with cleaner hands before him;
and yet, even he was vulnerable to sin and fear, as any of us.
A traitor?
How can that be?
I know that I have no such inclination.
Am I not above reproach?
I have been promised a throne in your kingdom.
How could I betray the Master who's dedicated his life to love and unselfishness?
At times, my temper has bested me.
James and I would have called down fire from heaven to smite the Samaritans, so enraged were we at their disrespect.
Will my pride cause me to stumble?
My intolerance, my bigotry?
Is it me, Lord?
There was James, the other son of Zebedee, so ferociously certain that he could never fail Jesus;
now so afraid that he could.
Show me this traitor.
Bring him to me, that I may lay down mighty judgment on his head!
You can sometimes be too kind, too forgiving.
I'm not encumbered by such.
Some even see your mercy as a sign of weakness.
It cannot be me you speak of.
I'm sure of it.
Am I not one of the sons of thunder?
Is my father not an influential man?
I have been promised a seat at your table, along with my brother, too.
How could either of us betray you?
I was there on the mountain.
I saw you transfigured.
John and I heard the very voice of God.
Only three of us can claim that.
Oh Lord, will my righteous fury unbalance me?
Will I strike out to hurt, rather than to heal?
Is it me, Lord?
Thomas, my friend, must you forever second-guess yourself and him?
I knew this would happen.
I saw it from the first.
I tried to tell them this would not end well.
Now they argue over the identity of the betrayer.
What difference does it make?
Every act has been carved in stone long before we drew first breath.
All our efforts and dreams are nothing.
Where has it brought us?
To the brink of ruin.
What if his end is somehow, someway a new beginning, and it's my doubts, my pessimism that will hinder the coming of this new world?
What if it's the darkness of my own mind that signals his end?
It cannot be.
Is it me, Jesus?
Poor Philip.
That was the one time I couldn't cover him.
The fear was his to face on his own.
It's probably me.
I'm sure I will make another mistake along the way or ask another foolish question, and that somehow will cause all of this to end.
Why did Jesus pick me?
Is the Lord allowing me to be such a misfit, knowing that my foolish ways will bring upon his demise?
But I can think of no other reason Jesus would invite me into his kingdom.
I am not worthy of it.
Is it me, Lord?
You knew the hearts of all these men so intimately.
They were my brothers together in our love of Christ.
We lived, suffered through many trials.
And what of your actual brother, Andrew?
His heart I knew best of all.
He loved Jesus, wanted so badly to please him.
Lord?
The traitor cannot be me.
I am the first.
You-you saw me, and you called to me, didn't you?
I saw you, and I knew you were the Messiah right away.
I brought you my brother.
Yes, he is talented in swaying the hearts of men, but I am a firstborn.
I am the first chosen.
I deserve my place of honor, don't I?
Or am I only to be known for being Peters older brother, destined to live in the shadow of one greater than I?
Do I have a place in heaven only because I am Peter's brother?
Will I come to resent it and thereby fall by the wayside?
Will that be my downfall and yours?
Is it me, Lord?
And what of you, Simon Peter?
Was your mind so full of dark thoughts and suspicions?
More than I would have imagined.
I felt the same fear
I did on that hilltop the day I ﬁrst saw him.
There can't be a traitor.
It's impossible.
I won't believe it.
But you say there is, so it must be true.
More than likely, it's Matthew or Simon.
I should say something.
Yes, I will stand and accuse them both.
What am I saying?
Matthew and Simon, they love you with all of their hearts.
Maybe Nathaniel or Philip.
Yes, most certainly Philip, it has to be.
Why didn't!
see it before?
No, poor simple Philip has the faith of a child.
He would be the last to betray you.
Who then?
Surely not I.
Am I not the rock?
Did I not walk on the water?
And did I not sink like a rock into the sea when I lost my faith and became afraid?
What if it is me?
Is it me, Lord?
Thirty pieces of silver.
Did you know that, Teacher?
The price of a slave.
That's all they think you're worth.
I'm afraid.
Am I to be the villain only because I saw through you?
Am I to be punished because I'm the only one of the twelve who did not believe your lies?
You call yourself a Savior;
then save yourself.
If you will not, nothing will change.
Your life will be meaningless and your death will be in vain.
It appears our Messiah needs a Messiah.
Who will save you, Jesus?
Who can save you?
It was me, Lord.
I will not sit for this!
The Master accuses and then says nothing.
I will not sit for it.
Lord?
Hurry and do what you must do.
Where is he going?
Teacher, what is happening?
Is Judas the betrayer, Lord?
Now is the Son of man glorified.
Why did he do it?
What could he gain?
Satan the deceive!
had entered into him.
He was promised great rewards.
And did Jesus order you to go after him?
Jesus forgave Judas his deed.
I don't understand this forgiveness.
If a man plots to betray you, or strikes you, or steals from you,
I mean, how could you forgive such a man?
Only the Son of God can.
Jesus- he is the way, the truth, the life.
I tell you, do not resist an evil person.
If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other cheek, also.
And if someone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat, as well.
If someone forces you to go 1 mile, go with him 2 mile.
Give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
Again, I see his wisdom.
Are your eyes beginning to be opened?
So what happened to Judas?
Judas fled.
Jesus forgave Judas, but the betrayer could not forgive himself nor accept Jesus gift of forgiveness, so he took his own life.
Easy death for a traitor.
Some have said so.
So then after the supper, then Jesus was captured?
Yes, though the hour was late,
Jesus led us out into the country to a garden called Gethsemane.
This night, you will all fall away.
My friends, if the world hates you, know that it hated me first.
Remember what I taught you.
No servant is greater than his master.
If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also.
Indeed, the day is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is pleasing God.
Lord, there's danger here.
Let us depart.
Listen to my words.
The time is coming when you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice;
but I promise you, your sorrow will turn into joy.
My Father, the time has come.
Glorify your Son, so that I may glorify you.
As you sent me into the world, so I send these who you have given to me, into the world.
Sit here while I go and pray.
Peter,
John,
James, come.
Remain here and keep watch while I pray.
What is the purpose of this night?
The Lord ﬁlls our minds with moments of death, betrayal, sorrow, and rejoice.
He bring us here to Gethsemane in the dark of night to pray?
He's going to his Father to seek his will.
He is sorely troubled
Have we not done enough to lighten his load?
See how he suffers.
Shall we go to him?
He bid us only to stay and watch.
Watch for what?
Only us twelve know about this secret place.
That is what unsettles me.
We are twelve no longer.
One of us is a betrayer.
Why then would he choose us three to accompany him?
I feel that I cannot stay awake.
I feel it, too.
A warm night makes me weary.
We will watch in shifts.
Peter, you stay awake and watch our Lord.
Stay awake with me, brothers.
What if this is how the betrayal happens, that we fail our Master's command and fall asleep?
I'll stay-
I will not fail you, Lord.
I will stay awake all night, keep watch.
What?
Could you not watch with me for 1 hour?
Forgive me, Lord.
I failed you.
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.
Yes.
The betrayal is at hand!
Brother.
Put down your weapon.
Remember what I taught you.
He who lives by the sword will die by the sword.
Put down your weapon.
Who is it that you seek?
Jesus of Nazareth.
I am he.
Lord!
This is a tale for the ages.
You swear it all happened as you say?
Every word.
So they took Lord Jesus- your Lord Jesus- and they crucified him?
Tell me of that.
it was- witnessed by many.
Jesus our Lord was crucified just as it was prophesied.
He had to die.
I don't understand.
Why did he die?
Why did he not call his angels to save him, use his power to come down from the cross, anything to avoid the horror of crucifixion?
At last, we come to it.
You are clever, Martinian.
Your thoughts, we!
-
Think back to all that I have told you of Jesus.
So Jesus said he would be gloriﬁed in death, so he must have planned on being betrayed.
So his death was a sacrifice, but a sacrifice of what?
We were speaking of sin, so the sacrifice was for a sin, but what sin?
He was pure and had none.
So he died for a sin that was not his own.
Go on.
Since we've sinned, he must have died for our sins.
So when he died, he sacrificed himself for all our sins.
Martinian, you do understand.
No-
No, I-
I don't know
I think it was better when I didn't know any of this.
I don't think I'm ready.
If I become a follower of Jesus,
I might be persecuted and die like you.
How are you not afraid to die?
I do not want to die, burl am not afraid of death.
This life is temporary.
Just as Christ was raised from the dead into life,
I, and all who believe in him, will be raised from the dead.
Don't forget, I saw the risen Christ.
I know he died.
I saw the empty tomb.
But more than this,
I saw the risen Lord.
I walked with him, and talked with him, and ate with him.
I must think on this.
I must speak to my wife.
My love, what news?
What?
Have you gone mad?
You haven't left this spot.
You must go home.
You've been here the entire night!
I wait to hear Simon Peter's answer.
Why did you make me ask that question?
You are a man grown.
You may do as you wish.
You make threats I can't ignore.
No, I was as curious as you.
I've gone too far, and now I am unsure.
Unsure?
Of what?
Everything.
The gods, the world, the afterlife, myself.
And I will not endanger you by accepting this faith.
Martinian-
No, you are my wife.
I am your husband.
Martinian
- It is my duty to protect you!
I am putting my foot down.
We will hear no more of these Christians.
My love, I am already a Christian.
How?
How did this happen?
There was a slave who told me of Jesus, a girl from the market, told me the words of Christ.
I met her in secret, and we talked many times.
When she took ill, I tended her death bed.
My love, she- she had no fear of dying.
She had a peace that was indescribable.
She was meek, gentle, kind.
She was the least, and she shall stand ﬁrst next to Christ in heaven.
When death took her, she smiled, as if she could already see his face.
I have that same peace, Martinian.
If I were to die tomorrow, I have such rest in my heart.
My beloved Martinian, do you not desire to have that same- that same rest in your heart?
Call to Jesus in prayer.
Ask him to forgive your sins.
Ask him to be your Savior from sin and punishment.
I do not believe my ears.
I am married to an outlaw!
Do you love me?
You know I do with all my heart.
Then you must choose, for my path is with Christ.
Where does your path lead?
I don't know.
You have taken counsel with Simon Peter himself.
You have heard the truth from his lips.
What more do you need to hear?
Nothing.
I need nothing more.
Do you still seek his blessing?
Wait here.
Time's up, ﬁsherman.
Third day breaks.
You are mine.
I fear no evil.
Christ has victory over you.
My fate is sealed by Christ.
I just have one last question.
Where did you find the strength to become the man that you are, from an ordinary fisherman to a great apostle?
People line up just so that your shadow might fall on them.
What caused this transformation?
It was all God.
Jesus chose me.
He walked with me and taught me.
He gave me the Holy Spirit to guide me, and God has a plan for you, too.
The wager is yours, Simon Peter.
You have won.
I have decided.
I will stand with you and as Christ is my Lord.
Now come, I will take you out of here before the shift changes.
Jesus Christ welcomes you with honor and love, Martinian, but I cannot go with you.
That would only endanger you.
I will die.
Oh, cursed on that.
I thought you would say that.
Hold on.
What have you done?
You would not come to her.
What else was I to do?
This is dangerous.
Simon Peter, apostle of Christ,
I beg you, give me your blessing.
Novella, is your life given over to Jesus?
Do you claim him to be your Lord and salvation?
Yes.
Then you shall be blessed as you desire.
Accept this blessing in the glorious name of the Father,
His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy-
Processus.
Processus, what are you doing?
Do you like persecution so much that you want to partake of it?
You heard his words, as well as I.
Did you not hear the truth in them?
They were just stories.
What of Christ, the man himself?
His words, his followers are spreading across the land, fulfilling prophecies, performing miracles, risen from the dead, that is no story!
He was a rebel, and his followers are outlaws!
That is what the emperor says.
What do you think?
Am I an outlaw?
My wife?
Would you see us tortured and killed?
You're asking me to disobey my command!
I'm asking you to think for your soul, the part of you that will live forever.
Stop confusing me!
Let go of your anger, your distrust.
How dare you talk down to me.
I am arresting you!
Let him into your heart.
Shut your mouth!
Save yourself!
I said shut up!
Martinian!
Strike me all you want.
I am your friend and I love you.
Christ our Lord loves you.
Come Process us.
Receive Jesus as your Savior and be free of all your sins.
God the Father, you have given us salvation.
Touch these hearts, as today they recognize their need for you, and they wish to accept Jesus as Lord.
Processus,
Martinfan, pray with me.
"Lord, I accept Jesus as my Savior, and I thank you for the forgiveness of sin. "
Lord, I accept Jesus as my Savior, and I thank you for the forgiveness of sin.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Novella, you seek the blessing of Christ.
May I ask?
We are without child.
"I will withhold no good thing from those who love me, says the Lord.
Go in peace.
Thank you.
How many times have I told the guards?
Political prisoners on the left, religious fanatics on the right.
Do I have to do everything myself around here?
You two, where's your prisoner?
It is past dawn, you great louts.
He is to be crucified.
Bind him and take him.
We need the cell for another.
Who is it?
Sir, another Christian, Saul of Tarsus.
They're crawling out of the walls, these Christians!
This is gonna be the hardest thing I've ever done.
Is it time?
It's time, Simon Peter.
The cell is required for another Christian prisoner, a certain Saul of Tars us.
Paul, my old friend.
Teacher, I cannot do this.
I cannot do this.
For all that you've done for the sake of Christ our Lord, let us escort you to safety.
My dear Maninian, that is exactly where I'm going.
What!
told you in the darkness, speak in the light.
What I whispered in your ear, proclaim from the rooftops.
We must go.
Then take me to Jesus and be quick about it.
I can't bear to be away from him a moment longer.
Peace, I leave you.
My peace I give you;
not as the world gives peace, for in this world you will have many troubles.
But take heart, for!
have overcome this world.
I am the way.
I am the truth.
I am the life.
No one comes to the Father, except through me.
Everyone who asks will receive.
He who seeks will ﬁnd, and to him who knocks the door will be opened.
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Do not be afraid.
Remain in my love.
Again I say, remain in my love;
and surely, I am with you always to the very end of the age.
You know, I told him.
This shelf smells like a privy.
I will treat it as such.
Captain, reporting with a new prisoner.
Signed by the emperor.
Shut your mouth.
Looks like we've caught quite a fish today.
Mystical insurrection against the empire.
You, dirty old beggar?
Sir, he's of The Way.
Martini an, is it?
Yes, sir.
What way?
Say what you mean, guardsman.
He's a follower of the one they call "Jesus the Christ."
Jesus the Christ, a religious fanatic.
Is that all we get here these days?
Name?
What is his name?
Simon Peter of Galilee.
They call him "the fisherman."
He knew Jesus.
Enough!
Take him to the box.
Let him convert, relax.
Father, thank you for this chance to suffer for you.
Thy will be done.
When do you think they will pass his sentence?
Do you really think he knew this Jesus?
We should question him.
Maninian, you'd rather look at some old fool than your wife?
Go home.
Calm yourself.
You'll be ﬁne by yourself?
I think I can handle watching a door.
Right, well, I'll see you in the morning.
Is it you, Lord?
Ask your God to save us.
Are you afraid he'll deny you?
Am I to be judged silently by an assassin's blade in the night?
No... that face has never seen murder, much less committed it.
I'm not supposed to give you this.
So were you a priest or a prophet?
I am a fisherman.
Lord Jesus, thank you for this food, bless it to my body and body to your service.
Thank you for my captors.
I pray for their hearts to be open to you.
Amen.
So... what is your price?
What?
What do you seek in payment for this forbidden meal?
Just a-just a chat, something to pass the hours.
Yeah right, it's my wife, my Novella.
She's heard about these Christians and their Way.
And your Messiah, this Jesus, she's insatiably curious about him.
I've warned her repeatedly to be careful, but you know women, or perhaps you don't.
Here I am with one of the most famous Christians in my charge.
There's no harm to ask him a few questions, for her sake.
Ask, and it shall be given to you;
Seek, and ye shall find.
What, did he say that?
Your God, your Jesus?
He said, "Come to me,"
"all those who are weary and heavy laden,"
"and I will give you rest,"
peace.
Do you want peace?
Don't get any ideas.
The gods are good enough for me.
And what of the life after this one?
Are you prepared for that?
You really think you could convert me to living a life of persecution?
No, to living a life of hope with an inheritance that can never perish, spoil, nor fade.
Ls that so?
Do you care to make a wager on that?
If you can convert me, I'm set you free.
That wager would not be fair for you.
Well, we will talk then, and you will tell me of your God, and you will meet your match, Simon Peter.
If that is your wish, but I thought it was your wife who was interested.
Processus.
Don't think you'll get away with that easily.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Fraternizing with a prisoner.
It was merely an interrogation.
On whose orders?
My own.
I should report this.
Are we to open Pandora's Box and report each other's transgressions, dear Processus?
Should I report the gambling?
The women?
The missing wife?
The lightened coffers?
I was wondering when you might grow a backbone.
Why is he so important to you, anyway?
He's a famous man.
I've never met a famous man.
I'm curious.
Don't get too attached.
His sentence?
There's no reward waiting for you in the Kingdom.
My master can free you from this suffering and provide great riches.
All you need do is deny him, as you did before.
That was long ago!
I have been forgiven.
Do not speak to me about your temporary earthly riches.
I now have everlasting riches beyond anything that you can provide.
Have you?
Has your Father told you that.
My master told me a secret.
Perhaps he will tell you too, when you meet him.
That I shall die in 3 days?
Be gone, demon!
Three days, Simon Peter, three days, and you're mine.
In the name of Jesus,
I cast you out!
Did you hear that?
A shriek in the cells?
What of it?
Well, perhaps we should check.
Perhaps you should relax.
Ah, that- that's disgusting.
You'll get used to it, the screams, the filth.
So what do you think of the gods?
Ugh!
You are boring!
Is this what happens when you marry?
What if they're right?
What if their one God is greater than the Olympians?
So join them.
I have a cell just your size ready.
No...
No, I will not endanger my wife like that, but still I'm troubled with what we're doing.
They say these Christians go quietly to their deaths.
Makes my job easier.
I mean, it's amazing they get any converts at all.
What could this cult possibly offer a man for him to risk his freedom and his life?
Who cares, as long as there's coin in rounding them up?
Your heart is as black as this place.
Thank you.
I will find out more.
I didn't see a thing.
Did you really know him?
The one they call the King of the Jews?
You truly mean to hear my story, don't you?
I do.
Did he really rise from the dead?
The story begins long before that day.
I have time.
Tell me everything.
You may have time;
However, I have but 3 days left to my life.
Who told you that?
How do you know that?
If the forces that surround me frighten you, then this is not a tale for your ears.
I want to know, I need to know.
Your one God, is he greater than all the rest?
There is only one true God.
But how do you know?
Jesus himself said,
"I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one comes to the Father, but through me."
He had power over the storms, made the lame walk and the blind see.
He healed the lepers and made the dead rise.
So you were friends with this Jesus?
A prophet?
A living God?
What of us, if we're to put you to death?
Peace.
I will tell you of Jesus, our Lord.
First...
I knew him as a man.
Brother.
Hurry, Simon!
He called to us!
There, there, I can see him,
I can see him!
Come on, brother!
Hurry up!
He is this way!
We have to get home and tend to Mother!
There, Simon, hurry!
He is there!
Come on!
Andrew!
Andrew.
As I gazed upon him,
I was afraid- not of him.
His presence was like all the light and love and goodness of the world.
No, I was afraid for myself} for I knew at that moment that my life would now become about him.
But what was I, a simple ﬁsherman, strong enough to face such a life?
You are Simon, son of John.
You will be called Peter.
Tell me, brothers, who do people say that I am?
There are those that say you are John the Baptist or Elijah, but mostly people say you are a prophet, but they don't know for sure.
And what about you?
Who do you say I am?
You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Then Jesus walked with us to our home by the sea, where my wife's mother lay dying.
Her sickness was deep.
It was the kind no remedy could cure, but Jesus reached out his hand.
Before my eyes, he had banished the sickness.
This was but one of many miracles he performed, seen by many witnesses.
That is quite a story, if any of it's true.
Why would I be false?
What would I gain?
You have nothing I want.
Not even freedom?
As I said, you have nothing I want.
Even if I believe you,
I've already made up my mind.
You are clearly insane.
In what respect?
Well, any man who wishes good health upon his mother-in-law is... mad.
Your wits are sharp, soldier.
What is your name?
Martini-an.
Would you hear more of Jesus and accept what I say is the truth?
I will listen well.
It's only a rooster.
The sound offends you?
It reminds me.
Reminds you of what?
I denied my Lord.
I denied him, not once, but three times.
You sinned against your Lord?
I denied him.
You were not cast out from his fellowship?
Man can be weak in the heart and mind.
Our Lord knew this.
I say to you, anyone who commits any sin is a slave to sin, and a slave does not remain in the house forever.
The Son remains forever.
So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
The emperor can forgive.
A magistrate can forgive.
Beg for their forgiveness.
Deny your Lord, and you could go free.
I am already free.
What, even in chains?
You are the one in chains, Martini-an, not I.
Free yourself.
So you will do nothing?
You will sit here and wait for death?
With Christ, death is only a beginning.
And what of me, Simon Peter, and my question?
Let's say you're right.
Who would forgive my sin, being your jailer, jailer to the personal friend of God?
Forgiveness is only found in Jesus, our Lord.
So, I should, uh...
Yeah.
Home to your wife.
Leave a real soldier to do his job.
Forgiven?
You?
You are a fool to die.
Christ has forsaken you.
God has forsaken you.
You are alone!
I am not alone!
Jesus says, "I will neither leave you nor forsake you."
Nothing better to do than rile at the rabble with talk of gods?
How could you follow a leader like that?
King of the Jews, right?
We were more like soldiers following our General.
Can't you imagine the different kind of leader, one where the lower soldier is as important as the highest general?
You mean I would have the same stature as the officers?
Why would any general agree to that?
There is a difference between leading and love of your people, versus having the love of power, the greed of leadership.
Man was born with the desire to rule.
What if your general loved you and felt that all men were created equal?
Jesus was that kind of a general.
My brother Andrew and I were among the ﬁrst of the disciples, captains, you might say.
You're mistaken, Brother.
The Master clearly called me first.
You are mistaken.
I told you that we found the Messiah.
I was in the boat when Jesus called,
"Come, follow me."
We were in the boat together.
He called to us at the same time.
Yes, yes, but I was closer to the shore.
There was John and James, the sons of Zebedee, whom Jesus cherished.
Mother wanted me to sit on Jesus rig ht hand.
And you on the left.
Why am I to be on the left?
Mother has no say in this.
You be on the left.
I will be on the right.
James, Jesus loves me better than you.
Humph, we will see about that.
There was Philip, Nathaniel, and Thomas,
James, the son of Alpheus;
Thaddeus;
Simon, the Canaanite;
Matthew the tax collector;
And, of course, there was Judas.
But Jesus knew what was in our hearts.
The Master spoke of giving power beyond comprehension.
Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, drive out demons.
Freely you have received;
Therefore, give freely.
Suppose it doesn't work, Lord?
Suppose I rebuke a demon, and it refuses to leave?
There are times when it will be more work.
Some can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.
Witchcraft and magic.
That is not what I speak of.
I speak of the true power, which can only come from God.
Not very nice of you.
Your Lord gives you powers, yet you deny him three times?
You have much anger in you.
You have a wish for true love in your life, peace, happiness.
Show me these powers of yours.
Prove it.
You are not ill.
You are not beset by demons.
What would you have me do?
Humph, ﬁgures.
I would have you be crucified and die a rebel's death.
Oh, did no one tell you?
Now, I've gone and spoiled the surprise.
It cannot be that way.
Let's see how quickly your knees turn to water.
You misunderstand
I am not worthy to die in the same manner as blessed Jesus.
What?
You think it's some kind of honor?
You're insane.
Martini-an, you will come with me.
You got me.
You will come with me now!
What's this all about?
An agent with the seal of the emperor wants to question you about your talks with this Christian rebel.
Martini-an...
Martinian, what's wrong?
What are you doing here?
This is no place for you.
Is he really here?
Is who here?
Simon Peter, of course.
The one they call the Prince of the apostles.
He is here.
Why did you not mention it?
Must I tell you of every prisoner now, Wife?
Do not attempt that tone with me, Husband.
You'll only embarrass yourself.
Yes, he's here.
I've even spoken to him, asked him questions.
Well, you've asked him all the wrong questions.
You don't even know what I've asked.
I know you've asked the wrong thing.
And what would be the correct question?
Ask him for a blessing, of course, for my womb, so I may bear you a child.
That is dangerous talk.
I know your interest in these Christians, but better not go further.
It doesn't, does it?
No, of course not.
I'm serious.
I will not lose you to this cult.
I hear you.
You have made yourself clear.
I'm also curious about this man, but I will not ask for his blessing.
That crosses the line.
I will ask him one question.
Will that suffice?
Now; if you need time to think...
I
- I want to know how Jesus really died, and the days leading up to his death, and...
Well, ask him that, and you shall be allowed to sleep in the bed tonight.
All right, I have a question.
Not so circumspect today.
Are you eager to hear tales of my Master?
There is one tale in particular I would hear:
The death of your Lord.
How did it come about?
That is a tale both sad and glorious.
I'm surprised you do not know the answer already.
I know some whispers, rumors.
I would hear the truth of it from one who lived it.
They say he was betrayed?
Yes, he was.
Who was it?
Why did he do it?
Please, I must hear.
I have to be sure.
If your Master is the true Son of God, and you are his right hand, I will be...
I fear for my soul.
I'll I tell you this story, and you know my words are true, will you then accept Jesus as your Lord?
I will listen well.
I promise nothing more.
Where shall I begin?
It was on the night of the Passover feast.
Jesus summoned us all to dine with him.
There was an inn.
There was an upper room away from all eyes.
There was a table set for 13.
I had walked with Jesus, seen many wondrous and terrible things.
I thought I had become wise and learned of the world, burl was not prepared to hear the secrets this room would reveal.
Brother, join me.
Who would've thought that two fishermen from Galilee would be here in this room?
My hands have lost their roughness.
As have mine.
Do you miss it?
We're still fishermen, Brother.
Now we cast our nets for the Lord.
Who's supposed to wash our feet?
Philip, you didn't arrange for servants to wash our feet?
The Master did not tell me to provide for servants.
Must you be told everything?
Should we wash our own feet?
Well, I'm not.
Well, where do we sit?
We should wait for the Master to assign places of honor.
Well, why wait then?
The order is always the same.
Judas, welcome.
Are the others far behind?
They come.
It's been decided we'd wait for the Master before we sit.
You can wait.
I've walked all day.
As have I.
And so we sat, we talked, and we laughed, even persecuted, even hunted as we were.
We laughed because Jesus was still with us.
And then he entered, and then there was no more laughter, not for a long, long time.
I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;
For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds its fulfillment in the kingdom of God.
Blessed are you, O Lord, our God,
King of the universe, who chose and sanctified us with your commandments and who gave us appointed times for happiness: festivals.
And times for joy, the day of this festival, Lord;
The festival of matzoh.
He spoke the prayer of joy and of thanks, but there was no joy in the room.
He was still a beacon of love and light, but over the rest of us a shadow fell.
Take and eat.
This is my body, which is broken for you.
Do this in remembrance of me.
Drink from this cup, all of you, for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
Do this in remembrance of me.
So what did it mean, the drinking of the wine and the eating of the bread?
This is the symbol of the new covenant in remembrance of his death.
You are those who stood by me in all my trials, and I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred his kingdom upon me.
Peter
Satan intends to sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith may not fail.
And when you have turned back, I say to you, you will encourage your brothers.
Lord, I am prepared to go with you to prison and to death!
I tell you Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.
No wonder you hate to hear the crowing of the rooster.
I was a fool.
But you said he forgave you.
Yes, later, not that I deserved it.
So Jesus became the sacrifice.
Yes, he was ushering in the new covenant that his death would symbolize.
Do you understand?
Not really.
In time, you will.
So what happened next?
What does he do now?
I don't know.
He prepared a wash basin like a servant?
But why?
It was to be... one of his last lessons to us.
If only I had known it,
I would not have hesitated.
Lord?
You do not understand now, but later you will understand why I am doing this.
No Lord, you will never wash my feet.
If I do not wash your feet, then you will have no place in me.
He washed your feet?
That's madness!
Your Master, your so-called living God, why would he lower himself to the duties of a slave?
No, no leader would lower himself in his men's eyes.
But Jesus did lower himself.
I do not understand.
Explain this to me.
Jesus was talking about spiritual cleansing.
While we were arguing about who was the greatest,
Jesus showed us what loving, humble service looks like.
But if we are to love one another, then how could one of your own betray Jesus?
What you speak of... is the devil.
The devil?
What is this?
A dark serpent, Satan.
He works against God's light, cloaking the world in violence, hate, and distrust, turning men against one another.
Sol am damned as a soldier.
You have a choice, Martinian.
The Lord has given you a choice;
For God wills that all men should be saved.
It's not so easy.
The devil was in your ranks.
Who was it?
How did it happen?
After the washing of feet, the darkness was revealed to us.
I have washed your feet as an example to you.
Now that you know it, blessed are you if you do it.
A person who has taken a bath needs only to wash his feet.
His whole body is clean.
You are clean.
But I am not speaking about all of you.
I know those who I have chosen, but all this is to bring about what the Scripture said.
Even my close friend, he who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.
What does this mean, Lord?
I am telling you now, and I tell you the truth.
One of you will betray me.
What is he saying?
That is impossible!
It cannot be!
A traitor amongst us?
Find the traitor!
Tell me, tell me who it is, Lord!
One of the twelve, he who dips his hand with me in the dish.
Here at this table, sitting among us as a friend, is a man who will betray me.
And as I looked around the table,
I saw the weakness that lies in all men, even us, the twelve chosen by God.
We were not above fear.
It was the worst kind of fear:
Not fear from without, but fear from within.
So one by one, I looked at them, and I saw their fear.
No one was closer to Jesus.
No one stood with cleaner hands before him;
And yet, even he was vulnerable to sin and fear, as any of us.
A traitor?
How can that be?
I know that I have no such inclination.
Am I not above reproach?
I have been promised a throne in your kingdom.
How could I betray the Master who's dedicated his life to love and unselfishness?
At times, my temper has bested me.
James and I would have called down fire from heaven to smite the Samaritans, so enraged were we at their disrespect.
Will my pride cause me to stumble?
My intolerance, my bigotry?
Is it me, Lord?
There was James, the other son of Zebedee, so ferociously certain that he could never fail Jesus;
Now so afraid that he could.
Show me this traitor.
Bring him to me, that I may lay down mighty judgment on his head!
You can sometimes be too kind, too forgiving.
I'm not encumbered by such.
Some even see your mercy as a sign of weakness.
It cannot be me you speak of.
I'm sure of it.
Am I not one of the sons of thunder?
Is my father not an influential man?
I have been promised a seat at your table, along with my brother, too.
How could either of us betray you?
I was there on the mountain.
I saw you transfigured.
John and I heard the very voice of God.
Only three of us can claim that.
Oh Lord, will my righteous fury unbalance me?
Will I strike out to hurt, rather than to heal?
Is it me, Lord?
Thomas, my friend, must you forever second-guess yourself and him?
I knew this would happen.
I saw it from the first.
I tried to tell them this would not end well.
Now they argue over the identity of the betrayer.
What difference does it make?
Every act has been carved in stone.
Long before we drew first breath.
All our efforts and dreams are nothing.
Where has it brought us?
To the brink of ruin.
What if his end is somehow, someway a new beginning, and it's my doubts, my pessimism that will hinder the coming of this new world?
What if it's the darkness of my own mind that signals his end?
It cannot be.
Is it me, Jesus?
Poor Philip.
That was the one time I couldn't cover him.
The fear was his to face on his own.
It's probably me.
I'm sure I will make another mistake along the way or ask another foolish question, and that somehow will cause all of this to end.
Why did Jesus pick me?
Is the Lord allowing me to be such a misfit, knowing that my foolish ways will bring upon his demise?
But I can think of no other reason Jesus would invite me into his kingdom.
I am not worthy of it.
Is it me, Lord?
You knew the hearts of all these men so intimately.
They were my brothers together in our love of Christ.
We lived, suffered through many trials.
And what of your actual brother, Andrew?
His heart I knew best of all.
He loved Jesus, wanted so badly to please him.
Lord?
The traitor cannot be me.
I am the first.
You-you saw me, and you called to me, didn't you?
I saw you, and I knew you were the Messiah right away.
I brought you my brother.
Yes, he is talented in swaying the hearts of men, but I am a firstborn.
I am the first chosen.
I deserve my place of honor, don't I?
Or am I only to be known for being Peters older brother, destined to live in the shadow of one greater than I?
Do I have a place in heaven only because I am Peter's brother?
Will I come to resent it and thereby fall by the wayside?
Will that be my downfall and yours?
Is it me, Lord?
And what of you, Simon Peter?
Was your mind so full of dark thoughts and suspicions?
More than I would have imagined.
I felt the same fear
I did on that hilltop the day I ﬁrst saw him.
There can't be a traitor.
It's impossible.
I won't believe it.
But you say there is, so it must be true.
More than likely, it's Matthew or Simon.
I should say something.
Yes, I will stand and accuse them both.
What am I saying?
Matthew and Simon, they love you with all of their hearts.
Maybe Nathaniel or Philip.
Yes, most certainly Philip, it has to be.
Why didn't!
See it before?
No, poor simple Philip has the faith of a child.
He would be the last to betray you.
Who then?
Surely not I.
Am I not the rock?
Did I not walk on the water?
And did I not sink like a rock into the sea when I lost my faith and became afraid?
What if it is me?
Is it me, Lord?
Thirty pieces of silver.
Did you know that, Teacher?
The price of a slave.
That's all they think you're worth.
I'm afraid.
Am I to be the villain only because I saw through you?
Am I to be punished because I'm the only one of the twelve who did not believe your lies?
You call yourself a Savior;
Then save yourself.
If you will not, nothing will change.
Your life will be meaningless and your death will be in vain.
It appears our Messiah needs a Messiah.
Who will save you, Jesus?
Who can save you?
It was me, Lord.
I will not sit for this!
The Master accuses and then says nothing.
I will not sit for it.
Lord?
Hurry and do what you must do.
Where is he going?
Teacher, what is happening?
Is Judas the betrayer, Lord?
Now is the Son of man glorified.
Why did he do it?
What could he gain?
Satan the deceive!
Had entered into him.
He was promised great rewards.
And did Jesus order you to go after him?
Jesus forgave Judas his deed.
I don't understand this forgiveness.
If a man plots to betray you, or strikes you, or steals from you,
I mean, how could you forgive such a man?
Only the Son of God can.
Jesus... he is the way, the truth, the life.
I tell you, do not resist an evil person.
If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other cheek, also.
And if someone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat, as well.
If someone forces you to go 1 mile, go with him 2 mile.
Give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
Again, I see his wisdom.
Are your eyes beginning to be opened?
So what happened to Judas?
Judas fled.
Jesus forgave Judas, but the betrayer could not forgive himself nor accept Jesus gift of forgiveness, so he took his own life.
Easy death for a traitor.
Some have said so.
So then after the supper, then Jesus was captured?
Yes, though the hour was late,
Jesus led us out into the country to a garden called Gethsemane.
This night, you will all fall away.
My friends, if the world hates you, know that it hated me first.
Remember what I taught you.
No servant is greater than his master.
If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also.
Indeed, the day is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is pleasing God.
Lord, there's danger here.
Let us depart.
Listen to my words.
The time is coming when you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice;
But I promise you, your sorrow will turn into joy.
My Father, the time has come.
Glorify your Son, so that I may glorify you.
As you sent me into the world, so I send these who you have given to me, into the world.
Sit here while I go and pray.
Peter
John,
James, come.
Remain here and keep watch while I pray.
What is the purpose of this night?
The Lord ﬁlls our minds with moments of death, betrayal, sorrow, and rejoice.
He bring us here to Gethsemane in the dark of night to pray?
He's going to his Father to seek his will.
He is sorely troubled.
Have we not done enough to lighten his load?
See how he suffers.
Shall we go to him?
He bid us only to stay and watch.
Watch for what?
Only us twelve know about this secret place.
That is what unsettles me.
We are twelve no longer.
One of us is a betrayer.
Why then would he choose us three to accompany him?
I feel that I cannot stay awake.
I feel it, too.
A warm night makes me weary.
We will watch in shifts.
Peter, you stay awake and watch our Lord.
Stay awake with me, brothers.
What if this is how the betrayal happens, that we fail our Master's command and fall asleep?
I'll stay...
I will not fail you, Lord.
I will stay awake all night, keep watch.
What?
Could you not watch with me for 1 hour?
Forgive me, Lord.
I failed you.
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.
Yes.
The betrayal is at hand!
Brother.
Put down your weapon.
Remember what I taught you.
He who lives by the sword will die by the sword.
Put down your weapon.
Who is it that you seek?
Jesus of Nazareth.
I am he.
Lord!
This is a tale for the ages.
You swear it all happened as you say?
Every word.
So they took Lord Jesus... your Lord Jesus... and they crucified him?
Tell me of that.
It was... witnessed by many.
Jesus our Lord was crucified just as it was prophesied.
He had to die.
I don't understand.
Why did he die?
Why did he not call his angels to save him, use his power to come down from the cross, anything to avoid the horror of crucifixion?
At last, we come to it.
You are clever, Martinian.
Your thoughts, we!
...
Think back to all that I have told you of Jesus.
So Jesus said he would be gloriﬁed in death, so he must have planned on being betrayed.
So his death was a sacrifice, but a sacrifice of what?
We were speaking of sin, so the sacrifice was for a sin, but what sin?
He was pure and had none.
So he died for a sin that was not his own.
Go on.
Since we've sinned, he must have died for our sins.
So when he died, he sacrificed himself for all our sins.
Martinian, you do understand.
No...
No, I...
I don't know
I think it was better when I didn't know any of this.
I don't think I'm ready.
If I become a follower of Jesus,
I might be persecuted and die like you.
How are you not afraid to die?
I do not want to die, burl am not afraid of death.
This life is temporary.
Just as Christ was raised from the dead into life,
I, and all who believe in him, will be raised from the dead.
Don't forget, I saw the risen Christ.
I know he died.
I saw the empty tomb.
But more than this,
I saw the risen Lord.
I walked with him, and talked with him, and ate with him.
I must think on this.
I must speak to my wife.
My love, what news?
What?
Have you gone mad?
You haven't left this spot.
You must go home.
You've been here the entire night!
I wait to hear Simon Peter's answer.
Why did you make me ask that question?
You are a man grown.
You may do as you wish.
You make threats I can't ignore.
No, I was as curious as you.
I've gone too far, and now I am unsure.
Unsure?
Of what?
Everything.
The gods, the world, the afterlife, myself.
And I will not endanger you by accepting this faith.
Martinian...
No, you are my wife.
I am your husband.
Martinian- it is my duty to protect you!
I am putting my foot down.
We will hear no more of these Christians.
My love, I am already a Christian.
How?
How did this happen?
There was a slave who told me of Jesus, a girl from the market, told me the words of Christ.
I met her in secret, and we talked many times.
When she took ill, I tended her death bed.
My love, she... she had no fear of dying.
She had a peace that was indescribable.
She was meek, gentle, kind.
She was the least, and she shall stand ﬁrst next to Christ in heaven.
When death took her, she smiled, as if she could already see his face.
I have that same peace, Martinian.
If I were to die tomorrow, I have such rest in my heart.
My beloved Martinian, do you not desire to have that same... that same rest in your heart?
Call to Jesus in prayer.
Ask him to forgive your sins.
Ask him to be your Savior from sin and punishment.
I do not believe my ears.
I am married to an outlaw!
Do you love me?
You know I do with all my heart.
Then you must choose, for my path is with Christ.
Where does your path lead?
I don't know.
You have taken counsel with Simon Peter himself.
You have heard the truth from his lips.
What more do you need to hear?
Nothing.
I need nothing more.
Do you still seek his blessing?
Wait here.
Time's up, ﬁsherman.
Third day breaks.
You are mine.
I fear no evil.
Christ has victory over you.
My fate is sealed by Christ.
I just have one last question.
Where did you find the strength to become the man that you are, from an ordinary fisherman to a great apostle?
People line up just so that your shadow might fall on them.
What caused this transformation?
It was all God.
Jesus chose me.
He walked with me and taught me.
He gave me the Holy Spirit to guide me, and God has a plan for you, too.
The wager is yours, Simon Peter.
You have won.
I have decided.
I will stand with you and as Christ is my Lord.
Now come, I will take you out of here before the shift changes.
Jesus Christ welcomes you with honor and love, Martinian, but I cannot go with you.
That would only endanger you.
I will die.
Oh, cursed on that.
I thought you would say that.
Hold on.
What have you done?
You would not come to her.
What else was I to do?
This is dangerous.
Simon Peter, apostle of Christ,
I beg you, give me your blessing.
Novella, is your life given over to Jesus?
Do you claim him to be your Lord and salvation?
Yes.
Then you shall be blessed as you desire.
Accept this blessing in the glorious name of the Father,
His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy...
Processus.
Processus, what are you doing?
Do you like persecution so much that you want to partake of it?
You heard his words, as well as I.
Did you not hear the truth in them?
They were just stories.
What of Christ, the man himself?
His words, his followers are spreading across the land, fulfilling prophecies, performing miracles, risen from the dead, that is no story!
He was a rebel, and his followers are outlaws!
That is what the emperor says.
What do you think?
Am I an outlaw?
My wife?
Would you see us tortured and killed?
You're asking me to disobey my command!
I'm asking you to think for your soul, the part of you that will live forever.
Stop confusing me!
Let go of your anger, your distrust.
How dare you talk down to me.
I am arresting you!
Let him into your heart.
Shut your mouth!
Save yourself!
I said shut up!
Martinian!
Strike me all you want.
I am your friend and I love you.
Christ our Lord loves you.
Come Process us.
Receive Jesus as your Savior and be free of all your sins.
God the Father, you have given us salvation.
Touch these hearts, as today they recognize their need for you, and they wish to accept Jesus as Lord.
Processus,
Martinan, pray with me.
"Lord, I accept Jesus as my Savior, and I thank you for the forgiveness of sin."
Lord, I accept Jesus as my Savior, and I thank you for the forgiveness of sin.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Novella, you seek the blessing of Christ.
May I ask?
We are without child.
"I will withhold no good thing from those who love me,"
says the Lord.
Go in peace.
Thank you.
How many times have I told the guards?
Political prisoners on the left, religious fanatics on the right.
Do I have to do everything myself around here?
You two, where's your prisoner?
It is past dawn, you great louts.
He is to be crucified.
Bind him and take him.
We need the cell for another.
Who is it?
Sir, another Christian, Saul of Tarsus.
They're crawling out of the walls, these Christians!
This is gonna be the hardest thing I've ever done.
Is it time?
It's time, Simon Peter.
The cell is required for another Christian prisoner, a certain Saul of Tars us.
Paul, my old friend.
Teacher, I cannot do this.
I cannot do this.
For all that you've done for the sake of Christ our Lord, let us escort you to safety.
My dear Maninian, that is exactly where I'm going.
What!
Told you in the darkness, speak in the light.
What I whispered in your ear, proclaim from the rooftops.
We must go.
Then take me to Jesus and be quick about it.
I can't bear to be away from him a moment longer.
Peace, I leave you.
My peace I give you;
Not as the world gives peace, for in this world you will have many troubles.
But take heart, for!
Have overcome this world.
I am the way.
I am the truth.
I am the life.
No one comes to the Father, except through me.
Everyone who asks will receive.
He who seeks will ﬁnd, and to him who knocks the door will be opened.
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Do not be afraid.
Remain in my love.
Again I say, remain in my love;
And surely, I am with you always to the very end of the age.

Sorry, brah.
We're all good.
Sorry.
Maybe I just don't get it.
On this island, when you drop in on someone's wave, you cause problems for other surfers.
That's just what happens.
Like everything else on this island, that makes zero sense.
Okay, I saw a wave, I rode it.
If anybody else wants to ride it with me, they're welcome.
No, you're wrong, okay?
If somebody's on the wave first, they own the wave.
Ho!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ho!
You can't own a wave.
Certainly not because you paddle faster than the next guy.
All right, that's number one.
- I - clearly told the guy
I was coming down on his left.
I said, "Hey, buddy, I'm on the wave!"
It's the Pacific Ocean.
Danny, it's not a bike path.
Okay, well, I-I think that the same rules should apply for any thoroughfare.
Take it from me, someone who was not born on this island, therefore was not raised with all the mumbo jumbo.
You can't own a wave.
While we're on the subject,
Spam is not part of any food group that I care to recognize.
And last but not least, an appetizer should never, never, under any circumstances, be referred to as a pupu.
Hey!
There you guys are.
I didn't know your sister was in town.
- Neither did I.
- Hi.
I've been looking for you two for over an hour.
You weren't home, so I figured
I'd check your favorite little surf spot.
So here I am.
Surprise.
What are you doing here, Mary?
What does it look like I'm doing here?
It looks like you're, uh, going to a Halloween party dressed as a flight attendant.
Come on.
Seriously.
You're working for the airlines?
Yes!
It's the coolest job ever.
I started like two weeks ago, and they gave me the Oahu to New York run.
I'm going to be flying back and forth like twice a week.
We can hang out during my layovers.
How sweet is that?
Pretty sweet.
Right?
Huh?
Come here.
Hi.
Come on.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Pick up your board, Danny.
Come on.
Pick it up!
So... so, you guys are, like, surf buddies now, huh?
Uh, yeah, kind of.
So cute.
Why didn't you call me?
I could've picked you up from the airport.
'Cause I wanted to surprise you.
Look at him.
He's definitely surprised.
In a good way.
In a good way.
So a stewardess.
How exactly did that happen?
Uh, well, my friend Angela worked for the airlines, and she knew I needed a job, so here I am.
And, by the way, we like
- to be called flight attendants.
- I knew that.
I did, actually.
Can I have a cup of coffee, too?
Are you, uh...
are you staying in town for a while?
Actually, no.
I'm working the return flight back to New York, so I got to take a rain check on the coffee.
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You just got here.
I know, but I have to go back to the hotel and freshen up before the flight.
So we'll catch up next time.
I have so much to tell you.
But it's all good stuff, so don't worry.
I'm not worried.
I'm really happy for you.
Thank you.
All right, I'll see you guys in, like, three days.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- See you.
- Bye, sis.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
So we are kind of surf buddies now?
You sensitive right now?
Yeah, little bit.
Hello, Mary.
You've kept me waiting.
We need to talk.

Hey.
What's up, Steve?
What's up?
Hey.
All right, see you later.
Okay.
What's up?
What was that?
What was what?
Why'd they just, uh... why'd they run out of here so quick?
What were you guys talking about?
What were we talking about?
I don't know.
Stuff.
General stuff.
What, uh... what, are you being paranoid now?
No, this is not paranoia, Daniel.
This has been happening a lot lately.
You guys have been acting weird.
Oh, okay.
Well, I think you should relax, maybe, and stop overanalyzing things.
Relax?
That's funny coming from you.
Okay, no, no, no.
Do what you want to do.
Be paranoid.
Okay, go nuts.
Let your mind play tricks on you.
Next thing you know, you are going to be wearing a tinfoil hat, babbling about black helicopters.
Black helicopters are real.
What do you mean, they're real?
They're real.
This is McGarrett.
Is this a joke?
I'll be right there.
Mary's been arrested.
Commander McGarrett.
- Thanks for your call.
- Not a problem.
Earlier today, we got a tip on one of the unrecorded lines that a stewardess was planning on smuggling some contraband onto a New York bound flight.
Okay, all right, this is crazy.
Mary's not a smuggler.
Are you sure you have the right person?
Commander McGarrett, your sister had about $20 million worth of diamonds duct-taped to her torso, so, yeah, I think we got the right person.
Did she say why she had the diamonds?
She refused to talk to us.
That's why we called you.
She won't talk to anyone else.
Okay, you said you stopped her based on a tip.
- Who gave it to you?
- It was an anonymous tip.
A male caller.
We tried to trace it, but he hung up too fast.
It was probably a prepaid cell anyway.
And is that unusual-- to get a call out of the blue like that?
No.
We get anonymous tips about drug mules all the time.
It's usually a rival group trying to put the competition out of business.
All right, listen, as a professional courtesy,
I'd like to speak to my sister in private.
What the hell happened?
I went straight to my hotel when I left you guys, and there was a man in my room with a gun.
Okay.
Have you ever seen this guy before?
No.
Don't think so.
- You don't think so?
- No, I-I know so.
I've never seen him before.
You believe me, right?
Of course, I believe you.
Mary, just slow down.
And tell me how you got away from this guy and how you ended up with these diamonds.
I didn't get away.
He taped the diamonds to me, and he told me that Angela's dead if I don't do exactly what he says.
Okay, who's Angela?
I told you about her, didn't I?
I don't... maybe.
Just tell me again.
We work together as flight attendants.
We came from New York together.
Okay, so she was your friend before this?
Yes.
We met at yoga class, like, three months ago.
I mean, she's really, like, the only real friend that I have.
She helped me get this job.
Steve, I really screwed up.
If I'm not on that plane when it lands, she's going to be killed.
Listen, Mary, just take a deep breath, okay, and calm down, all right?
Now, tell me everything you know about this guy who took your friend.
That's the thing, is I don't know anything about him, but he knew everything about me.
He was in my room waiting.
Okay, well, can you describe this guy to me?
Yeah.
He was tall.
He had dark skin.
He had a deep voice.
He had an accent.
Wasn't European, but similar.
You're positive you've never seen him before?
Yes, I'm positive.
I've never seen him, okay?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Because it's not adding up, Mary.
You understand?
Like, I'm trying to put this thing together, but it doesn't... it doesn't make sense to me.
Like, why would they take you?
Okay, and why would you not call me the minute you got away from him?
'Cause I was terrified.
I still am, Steve.
He took a picture of me on his cell phone, and he told me that he's going to text his partner, and that when I land, this guy's going to text me instructions.
He did that to keep you scared and cooperating, you understand?
Well, it's working.
I can't believe
I'm in this mess now.
Steve, if I'm not on that plane in nine hours with the diamonds,
Angela's going to be killed.
That's not going to happen, Mary.
Because that plane took off half an hour ago.
You understand?
Which means we got nine hours to save your friend.
We'll find her, Mary, all right?
Hey.
We'll find her.
Okay?
We need to find this Angela.
- Yes.
If there really is an Angela.
- Danny, she's my sister.
I think I'd know if she was lying.
Okay.
All right, what are you getting at?
Listen to me.
I thought I knew my brother-- right?
-- and he lied to me, and now he's on the FBI Most Wanted list.
No offense, but I think I'm a little closer to my sister than you were to your brother.
Okay, so then you know she was arrested two months ago for drunk driving?
Wait a minute.
You ran background on my sister?
No, I didn't run background on your sister;
TSA did, and I am relaying information.
Okay, well, holding back the fact that she got arrested two months ago does not mean that she's lying to us today.
I'm not saying she's lying, maybe just not telling us the full story.
Okay, look, we're going to check that hotel room, then we're going to know more.
Until then, I'm going on the assumption that she's telling me the truth.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
So the room hasn't been serviced, so it should be in the same condition as when your sister checked out.
Well, so far, we have no signs of a forced entry, struggle, or a girl named Angela.
Okay, well, it doesn't mean it didn't happen and she doesn't exist, right?
The guy could have used the pass key.
Yeah, well, the hotel staff said that Mary was the only one issued with a room key, and nobody saw her with another woman.
But I did confirm that Mary has a co-worker named Angela Branson who flew in with her.
She's based out of New York and isn't due to fly out again for three days.
And according to the hotel records, there was a room booked in her name, but she never actually checked in.
All right, well, good.
That's a good start.
We got any, uh...
got any other contact info?
The airline gave us her cell phone number, but it's just rolling straight to voicemail whenever we try it.
Well, if she'd been kidnapped, that would make sense, right?
Okay, are you trying to convince us or yourself?
Maybe a little of both.
Okay.
We need to get a look at this security feed.
Okay, that's him.
That's the guy Mary described.
He's got Angela.
Stop.
Push in.
All right, so he brings Angela down the back way so no one can see him.
Danny, call Kono, have her pick Mary up from the TSA's custody, and drop her in my office, but tell her I want it done low-key.
For Angela's safety, we can't let anybody know that Mary and the diamonds didn't make that flight.
Okay, okay!
Would you slow down, please?
Please!
We're not gonna be able to help anybody if we end up wrapped around a telephone pole.
That anonymous call about Mary and the diamonds it doesn't add up.
There are a lot of things about this case that do not add up, and I apologize for not believing Mary's story, but please stop driving this car like it's stolen, and slow down!
Driving like I always do.
Listen, whoever made the call to TSA about Mary had to have been a part of the smuggler's operation.
Right?
That's the only way that they would have known that Mary had the diamonds on her.
Okay, we don't know who made the call, but maybe Kono got a chance to enhance that video, and we will get an I.D. on her kidnapper.
Please slow down.
I'm asking you nicely.
I said please don't do it, please...
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
Thank you.
You okay?
Yeah.
All right.
Okay, Kono, tell me something good.
All right, well, the rest of the security videos don't show much.
They only have coverage of the stairwell, so there's no actual footage of anyone going in or out of that specific room.
But we got footage of Angela being dragged down the back stairwell.
What about the, uh, facial recognition thingie?
I already tried that.
The angles are bad.
There's not enough to get a complete scan.
Okay, uh, Chin, what about the origin of the diamonds?
I checked through Interpol.
There's no reports of any diamond shipments this size, either missing or stolen.
The good news is that Angela's safe as long as they believe that Mary and the diamonds are on that plane.
Well, I hate to be the one that states the obvious.
She is not on the plane, so, we're gonna have a big problem in about eight hours, when it lands.
Okay, maybe, maybe.
What do you mean?
I got plan-- it might be a goofy plan-- but what if, what if we get Mary and those diamonds on the governor's G-4?
In the next half an hour, we can beat that plane to New York.
When the guy there approaches her and takes possession of the diamonds, we snatch him for smuggling.
Very good.
Okay, and if we can flip him, then we can roll back and arrest whoever's holding Angela.
Okay, Kono, get the governor on the phone.
We need that plane ready, fueled to go in a half an hour.
Please call HPD, and tell them we need those diamonds here immediately.
42-30?
42-30, come in.
Go for 42-30.
Per the watch commander, start heading towards Iolani Palace.
See Detective Williams for an evidence transfer.
42-30.
Copy that.
Evidence transfer?
What the hell's that about?
Hey.
Hey, look, just so there's no confusion, this is HPD's handle, not Five-O's.
Well, most people like to start the day off with some pleasantries, but not the new chief of detectives, huh?
You do know that that transport van contained evidence from a case we were working?
I've already been briefed on the kidnapping case.
The murder of my two cops trumps it-- come on.
- Okay, listen to me...
- Detective Kelly?
...you do know that the only people who knew the diamonds were in that van were cops.
All right, so if you're gonna start looking for the hijacker, you start with HPD.
Hey, look, no way in hell.
I cleaned house.
I'll bet my job none of my guys are involved.
Hey, they just ran the plate on that semi.
It was reported stolen last night.
Okay, if they stole the semi truck last night, they already knew the diamonds were going to be seized today.
All right, who would have known something about that?
The guy who called in the anonymous tip on Mary.
But if they were always gonna steal the diamonds, why wouldn't they just snatch Mary when she arrived at the airport?
Because they were more afraid of the diamond smugglers than they were of us.
Let's make 'em worry about us.
Mary, we need to determine who may have targeted you to smuggle those diamonds.
So, was there anyone new that either you or Angela had met?
Maybe an overfriendly passenger?
No.
Nobody.
How long have you known Angela?
We met a few months back at this yoga club in New York.
And she's the one that helped me get this job.
Oh, my God.
This could be from the people that have Angela.
What do you mean?
Well, the kidnappers said
I was gonna get a text message from his guy in New York.
What does it say?
"When you land, walk directly to baggage carousel three.
"I'll be watching, so don't try and involve the cops, or your friend's... dead."
Good news is, they still have no idea
Mary didn't make that plane.
Yeah, looks like we got about five hours till they find out.
All right, when you get those diamonds, we can use them as a bargaining chip for Angela's life.
Hey, I've been thinking about these diamonds.
If these guys just came in possession of 20 million in ice, they need to move it through a broker.
If they are still on the island.
Yeah, but these guys killed two cops to get these stones, so they know we're watching everyone leaving the island.
The smartest thing these guys can do is to try and move those diamonds while they're still here.
Right, and as far as brokers go, there's only so many guys on the island that can handle this kind of weight.
Now this is a criminal file on a fence released from prison six months ago.
If there's a deal he'll have heard about it.
So, this guy's been off the radar since he finished serving his sentence six months ago.
You got new leverage on him?
Nothing.
No parole.
Did his full 30-year term, dropped his tail.
Doesn't mean he's not dirty.
In my experience, once a crook, you are always a crook.
I agree.
August March.
HPD.
We need to ask you a few questions.
Nobody here by that name.
Have you tried next door?
You lie to me again, you're going straight back to jail.
You know, last time I checked, you needed a man's invitation to walk into his house.
That rule applies to citizens.
You stopped being one 30 years ago.
30 years...
Well, maybe you should talk to my attorney about what my rights are...
You finish making that call...
Yeah?
You are going to jail.
Either way, you're gonna answer my questions, because...
You-you can't...
- ...
I don't have time for your games.
- No, no.
You understand me?
You understand me?
Yeah, well, I certainly won't answer your questions...
Excuse me.
Come on, Vince.
Why don't you pull it back a little bit?
All right?
This guy's done his time.
Why don't you just take it easy?
All right, I'm not holding nothing back, McGarrett.
I got two dead cops.
Two.
And I'm betting that this old man knows who's responsible, okay?
Now don't be fooled by the way he looks.
August March ran one of the largest smuggling networks in the world.
He was the fence for stolen art and gems.
Nothing moved on or off Honolulu without August March taking a piece of the action.
His operation and pipeline continued long after he was in prison for ordering the murder of two of his business associates.
They made the mistake of trusting him, and they got a bullet for it.
The man is a cold-blooded killer.
It's a very colorful, but less-than-accurate description of what I was convicted of.
Whatever crimes I committed in the past are just that.
The past!
Now, please leave me alone, or I'm gonna file a complaint!
Listen, there's a woman whose life is in danger.
All we need is a little bit of your time and some help with the smuggler that we're looking for, okay?
I'm sorry, but I don't do that anymore.
I've been on ice for 30 years.
I'm not in that business anymore.
Okay, but you do know people that are in that business, correct?
Yeah, I do, and unlike you guys, they take me at my word when I say I'm out.
All we're trying to do is prevent an innocent woman from being killed over the theft of a few lousy diamonds here.
This is about diamonds?
Yes.
Do you know anything about it?
I might.
But if I help you, you've got to give me your word that you'll never bother me again.
And nobody must know about my involvement.
You have my word.
Well...
I'm not just talking about you.
Look, you give me the guys that killed my men...
Yeah?
...you will never, never lay eyes on me again.
Fine.
Fine, fine, fine.
I got a call yesterday from a stranger.
I don't know who he is, nor who referred him to me.
But he said he wanted to fence... s-some diamonds.
Yeah, uh...
It's, it's the last number on there.
Maybe you can trace the number.
Okay.
Did I hear right, that your name's McGarrett?
Yeah.
There was a young officer named McGarrett who transported me to jail 30 years ago.
Any relation?
Yeah, that was my father.
Yeah.
No kidding.
Small world.
How's he doing?
He's dead.
Shame.
Sorry to hear that.
He was a good man.
I tried to offer him... $100,000 bribe that day.
A fortune at that time.
My father wasn't that kind of cop.
But there were plenty of cops around him who would've taken that money, right, Chief?
It's a pre-paid.
Can't trace it.
Thank you.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I tried.
I wish I could help you more.
Hey, look, you're not done.
You're not.
Call that guy back.
Set up a meet and let me grab him.
- Give him to me.
Just give him to me.
- No!
Come on.
That's a young man's game.
I'm too old for that kind of thing.
Come on.
This is probably the only chance we have to get this girl back safe.
This guy better show.
Plane lands in New York in less than four hours.
I got him.
I got a visual, 10:00.
Right now. 10:00.
He's strapped.
Butt of a gun sticking out of his shirt.
If March gets compromised, that guy pulls out that gun, every single one of these civilians is at risk here.
This guy's an old pro.
He'll do fine.
Let's hope your right.
August March?
Take a seat.
You're making the waiter nervous.
By yourself, right?
Because if not, anything happens, you're the first to get shot.
Relax, kid.
I'm here for one piece of business.
The only thing that's gonna happen here today, is you and me are gonna get rich.
Just remember, we wait for him to inspect the diamonds.
That's the arrest signal.
- That is when we move in.
- You sure you can move this kind of weight?
Eh, don't worry.
I got the connections.
Whoever sent you to me knows that.
Good.
So what's the brokerage fee on 20 million worth?
Well, as I told you on the phone,
I can't say without seeing the quality of the product.
Y-You did bring all of the diamonds like I told you.
You didn't really think I'd be dumb enough to bring all of them, did you?
Nobody said you were dumb.
But... without seeing all of them
I can't estimate the overall quality of the product.
For all I know, you could've handpicked the best one.
I didn't.
Now!
Move out!
I've got 200 more of that same quality.
Now how much?
You say you're not dumb, but with what you've been handling lately, the moves you've been making,
I'm starting to think you are.
- Why's that?
- Killing cops?
In my day, we would've never done a thing like that.
Brings too much heat.
How'd you know about the cops?
Nice shot, Fryer.
Trouble is now our only lead is dead.
You okay.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
I told your partner I was too old for this.
March was telling me he thinks he can identify where the diamonds are from.
Okay, that's good.
How?
Every diamond has a distinct marking.
If I could look at this stone this guy brought under a microscope,
I might be able to tell you something about it.
Okay, all right, good.
Take Mr. March over to Fong's, we have a microscope for you to look at, okay?
Fine, fine, fine.
I mean...
Now, look, I just did what I had to do, all right?
And besides, this guy matches the description of the evidence van hijacker, okay?
- Okay.
- Do we have a positive I.D.?
Yeah.
And it tells a whole lot.
Okay, what?
His name's Darryl Kaleo.
Brother of an ex-cop you put away last year for the murder of your ex-partner.
I know who he is.
Are you implying that he's involved with this?
Hey, look, he's capable of killing cops.
- He's also in prison.
- That's right.
He's in a life term.
Doesn't mean he's not behind this.
You think that he just orchestrated this whole thing?
From jail?
Why?
What does he get out of it?
Just helping his brother?
Doesn't make sense.
Why don't we pay him a visit and find out.
He's easy to find.
Life is pretty good here in the Protective Custody Wing, right?
One of the perks of being a cop.
Ex-cop.
You should be walking the main line with the rest of these lowlifes, and you know it.
My prior law enforcement work makes me a target.
Is there a reason you two are tossing my place or did you just miss me?
You two have no legal authority to be shaking me down.
- This is harassment.
- You're in prison.
Subject to search whenever and wherever.
Why are you really here?
I know you're looking for something.
Why bother lying?
Okay.
I will play along.
Your brother... he robbed a transport van, killed two cops.
You already know that, don't ya?
Huh?
Listen, Kaleo, we know that you helped set this thing up, and we are here to prove that-- that's what we're gonna do.
Be my guest.
Okay.
You know, Williams...
What?
You mentioning my brother makes me nostalgic about family.
You got a kid, right?
How's she doing, anyway?
My daughter is doing fine.
Thank you.
Your brother Darryl, on the other hand, he's not doing so good.
He's dead.
Hey.
Look what we got here.
Cell phone.
You planted that.
It ain't mine.
I'm sure your prints are gonna be all over it.
So tell me... is this how you arranged the transport van's hijacking?
It is, isn't it?
You got questions, run them by my lawyer.
Okay, no problem.
Listen, um,... you know, last time I saw you...
I broke a couple of bones in your face, right?
You ever mention my daughter again...
I promise you I'm gonna come back here,
I'm gonna break every single bone in your body, okay?
You understand?
Put him back in his cage.
Interesting.
This explains why these diamonds were never reported missing.
Based on quality,
I would say... that this stone comes from the Republic of Liberia.
Are you sure?
Things change.
I mean, you've been locked up for 30 years.
30 years, 13 million years, this is an allotrope of carbon formed at high pressure and high temperature conditions.
That never changes.
This stone, my dear, comes from Africa.
Which leads me to believe that is is probably... a conflict diamond.
Blood diamonds... sold on the black market, and used to finance civil wars and genocide on the Africa coast.
Have you ever done business with people from Liberia?
No, no.
But...
I'm a student of the game.
The game never changes.
Just the players do.
Well, then that would explain the kidnapper's accent.
Exactly.
And that's why, if I were you,
I would check out Liberians here on temporary visas.
Okay.
We really appreciate the help.
This at least gives us an idea of who's holding Angela.
I wish you luck.
And feel free to call on me anytime.
Bye.
Mr. March.
Hmm?
I'm gonna need that diamond back.
The diamond?
!
Here we go.
Can't blame a guy for trying.
All the outbound calls off of Kaleo's cell phone are to his brother Darryl... with the exception of this one.
Okay, who's this one to?
TSA security line.
Hey, look at the time stamp.
30 minutes before Mary was arrested.
So Kaleo made the call that got Mary arrested and the diamonds seized.
He told him the description of the van, the route, so they could hijack it.
But the part of the puzzle we don't have is how they know about the Liberian smuggling operation in the first place.
I reached out to TSA.
I worked up a list of Liberians that are on the island on temporary visas.
It's not extensive.
That's him.
Bottom left.
That's the guy that kidnapped Angela.
Jordan Nevins.
He landed on the island three days ago.
Okay, well, it looks like he didn't lie on his TSA entry form.
Just confirmed he's staying in the penthouse suite.
Let's go pay him a visit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
Getting my vest.
No, I'll get your ve...
Uh, Chin?
Help him with the thing.
Hey, hey, Steve, come on over here a second.
What are you talking about?
What is that?
That was your birthday cake.
I was planning on taking it by the office.
Got sidetracked by this case.
Is that why you guys all stopped talking when I came in the office this morning?
Yeah.
Like usual, you figured out a way to ruin everything.
Thanks.
It's butter cream.
Butter cream's my favorite.
Move in!
Hey, hey!
I got Jordan.
Continue clearing.
All clear.
Bedroom's clear; no girl.
All right, where's Angela?
I-I don't know...
Hey!
Where's Angela?
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right, we'll see about that.
I'm a Liberian citizen.
If you lay a finger on me,
I will have the consulate crawling so far up your...
That's a good idea.
And afterwards, I can tell your bosses that you lost their diamond shipment.
You seized some diamonds?
That look familiar?
It would take less than an hour for me to prepare a press release announcing the seizure of 20 million in conflict diamonds.
You know, it's funny, there's something about your body language right now that tells me that if that press release hits, you're gonna feel safer in here with us than you are out there on the street.
If I tell you everything, you gotta protect me and a promise of no deportation.
I'll be a dead man if you send me back to Liberia.
You got it.
Where's the girl?
I have no idea.
After our little charade at the hotel, we parted ways.
What are you talking about-- "charade"?
Angela faked her own kidnapping?
We didn't have a choice.
Angela was bumped from the flight at the last minute.
Let me guess, you had already told the people in New York the diamonds were on the flight.
I'm a facilitator.
I am paid to deliver the product to a buyer at a specific date and time.
And if that doesn't happen...
People like you get killed.
They had to, uh, use the other girl to make the drop as scheduled.
The other girl was my sister.
Did you know?
It was Angela's idea to scare her into doing it.
So, Angela and you worked together before?
Yes.
She made several runs for me in the last few months, but nothing as large as this.
This is the first time for the both of us.
You've been played.
Angela probably set Mary up, so when the diamonds didn't get there, she wouldn't be blamed.
You and my sister Mary did.
No...
I doubt if Angela would...
double-cross me.
She's not smart enough to come up with something like this on her own.
Maybe she met somebody who was.
So, what was the plan?
You were gonna use your share of the dough to make an appeal?
Bribe a judge?
What?
It was worth a try.
Okay.
Where's Angela?
She's in the wind.
Where she lands, your guess is as good as mine.
Okay, how did she hook up with Darryl?
She's his ex-old lady.
She reached out to him with an opportunity to make a big score.
She just didn't want to get killed doing it.
And your brother turned to you for advice?
Advice?
Guess you could call it that.
I just figured a way for her and my brother to get rich.
All right, well, I'm gonna charge you with the death of those two cops.
What you just said, coupled with the phone records gives us enough-- more than enough-- to prove that you orchestrated the whole thing.
I'm doing life without, and there's no death penalty here in Hawaii.
Sorry to disappoint you, but another case is not going to make a difference to me.
That might be true, but since you've killed two more cops, you have lost your right to be housed in protective custody.
Isn't that true?
It is, it's true.
And...
believe me, uh, when you meet your new cell mate, life is going to get very interesting.
Wait, you can't do that.
Yes I can;
I just did.
Stand up.
Turn around, Sunshine.
Cuff him.

Commander McGarrett.
- Thanks for your call.
- Not a problem.
Earlier today, we got a tip on one of the unrecorded lines that a stewardess was planning on smuggling some contraband onto a New York bound flight.
Okay, all right, this is crazy.
Mary's not a smuggler.
Are you sure you have the right person?
Commander McGarrett, your sister had about $20 million worth of diamonds duct-taped to her torso, so, yeah, I think we got the right person.
Did she say why she had the diamonds?
She refused to talk to us.
That's why we called you.
She won't talk to anyone else.
Okay, you said you stopped her based on a tip.

A male caller.
We tried to trace it, but he hung up too fast.
It was probably a prepaid cell anyway.

I went straight to my hotel when I left you guys, and there was a man in my room with a gun.
Okay.
Have you ever seen this guy before?
No.
Don't think so.
- You don't think so?
- No, I-I know so.
I've never seen him before.
You believe me, right?
Of course, I believe you.
Mary, just slow down.
And tell me how you got away from this guy and how you ended up with these diamonds.
I didn't get away.
He taped the diamonds to me, and he told me that Angela's dead if I don't do exactly what he says.
Okay, who's Angela?
I told you about her, didn't I?
I don't... maybe.
Just tell me again.
We work together as flight attendants.
We came from New York together.
Okay, so she was your friend before this?
Yes.
We met at yoga class, like, three months ago.
I mean, she's really, like, the only real friend that I have.
She helped me get this job.
Steve, I really screwed up.
If I'm not on that plane when it lands, she's going to be killed.
Listen, Mary, just take a deep breath, okay, and calm down, all right?
Now, tell me everything you know about this guy who took your friend.
That's the thing, is I don't know anything about him, but he knew everything about me.
He was in my room waiting.
Okay, well, can you describe this guy to me?
Yeah.
He was tall.
He had dark skin.
He had a deep voice.
He had an accent.
Wasn't European, but similar.
You're positive you've never seen him before?
Yes, I'm positive.
I've never seen him, okay?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Because it's not adding up, Mary.
You understand?
Like, I'm trying to put this thing together, but it doesn't... it doesn't make sense to me.
Like, why would they take you?
Okay, and why would you not call me the minute you got away from him?
'Cause I was terrified.
I still am, Steve.
He took a picture of me on his cell phone, and he told me that he's going to text his partner, and that when I land, this guy's going to text me instructions.
He did that to keep you scared and cooperating, you understand?
Well, it's working.
I can't believe
I'm in this mess now.
Steve, if I'm not on that plane in nine hours with the diamonds,
Angela's going to be killed.
That's not going to happen, Mary.
Because that plane took off half an hour ago.
You understand?
Which means we got nine hours to save your friend.
We'll find her, Mary, all right?
Hey.
We'll find her.
Okay?
We need to find this Angela.
- Yes.
If there really is an Angela.
- Danny, she's my sister.
I think I'd know if she was lying.
Okay.
All right, what are you getting at?
Listen to me.
I thought I knew my brother-- right?
-- and he lied to me, and now he's on the FBI Most Wanted list.
No offense, but I think I'm a little closer to my sister than you were to your brother.
Okay, so then you know she was arrested two months ago for drunk driving?
Wait a minute.
You ran background on my sister?
No, I didn't run background on your sister;
TSA did, and I am relaying information.
Okay, well, holding back the fact that she got arrested two months ago does not mean that she's lying to us today.
I'm not saying she's lying, maybe just not telling us the full story.
Okay, look, we're going to check that hotel room, then we're going to know more.
Until then, I'm going on the assumption that she's telling me the truth.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
So the room hasn't been serviced, so it should be in the same condition as when your sister checked out.
Well, so far, we have no signs of a forced entry, struggle, or a girl named Angela.
Okay, well, it doesn't mean it didn't happen and she doesn't exist, right?
The guy could have used the pass key.
Yeah, well, the hotel staff said that Mary was the only one issued with a room key, and nobody saw her with another woman.
But I did confirm that Mary has a co-worker named Angela Branson who flew in with her.
She's based out of New York and isn't due to fly out again for three days.
KONO:
And according to the hotel records, there was a room booked in her name, but she never actually checked in.
All right, well, good.
That's a good start.
We got any, uh...
got any other contact info?
The airline gave us her cell phone number, but it's just rolling straight to voicemail whenever we try it.
Well, if she'd been kidnapped, that would make sense, right?
Okay, are you trying to convince us or yourself?
Maybe a little of both.
(elevator bell dings) Okay.
We need to get a look at this security feed.
(computer trilling)
Okay, that's him.
That's the guy Mary described.
DANNY:
He's got Angela.
Stop.
Push in.
All right, so he brings Angela down the back way so no one can see him.
Danny, call Kono, have her pick Mary up from the TSA's custody, and drop her in my office, but tell her I want it done low-key.
For Angela's safety, we can't let anybody know that Mary and the diamonds didn't make that flight.
(tires squealing, engine revving)
Okay, okay!
Would you slow down, please?
Please!
We're not gonna be able to help anybody if we end up wrapped around a telephone pole.
That anonymous call about Mary and the diamonds... (tires squealing, engine revving) ...it doesn't add up.
There are a lot of things about this case that do not add up, and I apologize for not believing Mary's story, but please stop driving this car like it's stolen, and slow down!
Driving like I always do.
(engine revving, tires squealing)
Listen, whoever made the call to TSA about Mary had to have been a part of the smuggler's operation.
Right?
That's the only way that they would have known that Mary had the diamonds on her.
Okay, we don't know who made the call, but maybe Kono got a chance to enhance that video, and we will get an I.D. on her kidnapper.
Please slow down.
I'm asking you nicely.
I said please don't do it, please...
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
Thank you.
You okay?
Yeah.
All right.
Okay, Kono, tell me something good.
All right, well, the rest of the security videos don't show much.
They only have coverage of the stairwell, so there's no actual footage of anyone going in or out of that specific room.
But we got footage of Angela being dragged down the back stairwell.
What about the, uh, facial recognition thingie?
I already tried that.
The angles are bad.
There's not enough to get a complete scan.
Okay, uh, Chin, what about the origin of the diamonds?
I checked through Interpol.
There's no reports of any diamond shipments this size, either missing or stolen.
The good news is that Angela's safe as long as they believe that Mary and the diamonds are on that plane.
Well, I hate to be the one that states the obvious.
She is not on the plane, so, we're gonna have a big problem in about eight hours, when it lands.
Okay, maybe, maybe.
What do you mean?
I got plan-- it might be a goofy plan-- but what if, what if we get Mary and those diamonds on the governor's G-4?
In the next half an hour, we can beat that plane to New York.
When the guy there approaches her and takes possession of the diamonds, we snatch him for smuggling.
Very good.
Okay, and if we can flip him, then we can roll back and arrest whoever's holding Angela.
Okay, Kono, get the governor on the phone.
We need that plane ready, fueled to go in a half an hour.
Please call HPD, and tell them we need those diamonds here immediately.
FEMALE DISPATCHER (over radio):
42-30?
42-30, come in.
Go for 42-30.
Per the watch commander, start heading towards Iolani Palace.
See Detective Williams for an evidence transfer.
42-30.
Copy that.
Evidence transfer?
What the hell's that about?
(tires squealing, engine revving)
Hey.
Hey, look, just so there's no confusion, this is HPD's handle, not Five-O's.
Well, most people like to start the day off with some pleasantries, but not the new chief of detectives, huh?
You do know that that transport van contained evidence from a case we were working?
I've already been briefed on the kidnapping case.
The murder of my two cops trumps it-- come on.
DANNY:
Okay, listen to me...
OFFICER:
Detective Kelly?
...you do know that the only people who knew the diamonds were in that van were cops.
All right, so if you're gonna start looking for the hijacker, you start with HPD.
Hey, look, no way in hell.
I cleaned house.
I'll bet my job none of my guys are involved.
Hey, they just ran the plate on that semi.
It was reported stolen last night.
Okay, if they stole the semi truck last night, they already knew the diamonds were going to be seized today.
All right, who would have known something about that?
The guy who called in the anonymous tip on Mary.
But if they were always gonna steal the diamonds, why wouldn't they just snatch Mary when she arrived at the airport?
Because they were more afraid of the diamond smugglers than they were of us.
Let's make 'em worry about us.
KONO:
Mary, we need to determine who may have targeted you to smuggle those diamonds.
So, was there anyone new that either you or Angela had met?
Maybe an overfriendly passenger?
No.
Nobody.
How long have you known Angela?
We met a few months back at this yoga club in New York.
(phone chimes) And she's the one that helped me get this job.
Oh, my God.
This could be from the people that have Angela.
What do you mean?
Well, the kidnappers said
I was gonna get a text message from his guy in New York.
What does it say?
"When you land, walk directly to baggage carousel three.
"I'll be watching, so don't try and involve the cops, or your friend's... dead."
DANNY:
Good news is, they still have no idea
Mary didn't make that plane.
Yeah, looks like we got about five hours till they find out.
All right, when you get those diamonds, we can use them as a bargaining chip for Angela's life.
Hey, I've been thinking about these diamonds.
If these guys just came in possession of 20 million in ice, they need to move it through a broker.
If they are still on the island.
Yeah, but these guys killed two cops to get these stones, so they know we're watching everyone leaving the island.
The smartest thing these guys can do is to try and move those diamonds while they're still here.
Right, and as far as brokers go, there's only so many guys on the island that can handle this kind of weight.
Now this is a criminal file on a fence released from prison six months ago.
If there's a deal he'll have heard about it.
FRYER:
So, this guy's been off the radar since he finished serving his sentence six months ago.
You got new leverage on him?
Nothing.
No parole.
Did his full 30-year term, dropped his tail.
Doesn't mean he's not dirty.
In my experience, once a crook, you are always a crook.
I agree.
(knocking on door)
August March.
HPD.
We need to ask you a few questions.
Nobody here by that name.
Have you tried next door?
You lie to me again, you're going straight back to jail.
You know, last time I checked, you needed a man's invitation to walk into his house.
That rule applies to citizens.
You stopped being one 30 years ago.
30 years...
Well, maybe you should talk to my attorney about what my rights are...
You finish making that call...
Yeah?
You are going to jail.
Either way, you're gonna answer my questions, because...
You-you can't I don't have time for your games.
MARCH:
No, no.
You understand me?
You understand me?
Yeah, well, I certainly won't answer your questions...
Excuse me.
Come on, Vince.
Why don't you pull it back a little bit?
All right?
This guy's done his time.
Why don't you just take it easy?
All right, I'm not holding nothing back, McGarrett.
I got two dead cops.
Two.
And I'm betting that this old man knows who's responsible, okay?
Now don't be fooled by the way he looks.
August March ran one of the largest smuggling networks in the world.
He was the fence for stolen art and gems.
Nothing moved on or off Honolulu without August March taking a piece of the action.
His operation and pipeline continued long after he was in prison for ordering the murder of two of his business associates.
They made the mistake of trusting him, and they got a bullet for it.
The man is a cold-blooded killer.
It's a very colorful, but less-than-accurate description of what I was convicted of.
Whatever crimes I committed in the past are just that.
The past!
Now, please leave me alone, or I'm gonna file a complaint!
Listen, there's a woman whose life is in danger.
All we need is a little bit of your time and some help with the smuggler that we're looking for, okay?
I'm sorry, but I don't do that anymore.
I've been on ice for 30 years.
I'm not in that business anymore.
Okay, but you do know people that are in that business, correct?
Yeah, I do, and unlike you guys, they take me at my word when I say I'm out.
STEVE:
All we're trying to do is prevent an innocent woman from being killed over the theft of a few lousy diamonds here.
This is about diamonds?
Yes.
Do you know anything about it?
I might.
But if I help you, you've got to give me your word that you'll never bother me again.
And nobody must know about my involvement.
You have my word.
MARCH:
Well...
I'm not just talking about you.
FRYER:
Look, you give me the guys that killed my men...
Yeah?
...you will never, never lay eyes on me again.
Fine.
Fine, fine, fine.
I got a call yesterday from a stranger.
I don't know who he is, nor who referred him to me.
But he said he wanted to fence... s-some diamonds.
Yeah, uh...
It's, it's the last number on there.
Maybe you can trace the number.
DANNY:
Okay.
Did I hear right, that your name's McGarrett?
Yeah.
There was a young officer named McGarrett who transported me to jail 30 years ago.
Any relation?
Yeah, that was my father.
Yeah.
No kidding.
Small world.
How's he doing?
He's dead.
Shame.
Sorry to hear that.
He was a good man.
I tried to offer him... $100,000 bribe that day.
A fortune at that time.
My father wasn't that kind of cop.
But there were plenty of cops around him who would've taken that money, right, Chief?
DANNY:
It's a pre-paid.
Can't trace it.
Thank you.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I tried.
I wish I could help you more.
Hey, look, you're not done.
You're not.
Call that guy back.
Set up a meet and let me grab him.
- Give him to me.
Just give him to me.
- No!
Come on.
That's a young man's game.
I'm too old for that kind of thing.
Come on.
This is probably the only chance we have to get this girl back safe.
This guy better show.
Plane lands in New York in less than four hours.
I got him.
STEVE:
I got a visual, 10:00.
Right now. 10:00.
DANNY:
He's strapped.
Butt of a gun sticking out of his shirt.
STEVE:
If March gets compromised, that guy pulls out that gun, every single one of these civilians is at risk here.
FRYER:
This guy's an old pro.
He'll do fine.
STEVE:
Let's hope your right.
August March?
Take a seat.
You're making the waiter nervous.
By yourself, right?
Because if not, anything happens, you're the first to get shot.
(laughs)
Relax, kid.
I'm here for one piece of business.
The only thing that's gonna happen here today, is you and me are gonna get rich.
Just remember, we wait for him to inspect the diamonds.
That's the arrest signal.
That is when we move in.
DARRYL:
You sure you can move this kind of weight?
Eh, don't worry.
I got the connections.
Whoever sent you to me knows that.
Good.
So what's the brokerage fee on 20 million worth?
Well, as I told you on the phone,
I can't say without seeing the quality of the product.
Y-You did bring all of the diamonds like I told you.
You didn't really think I'd be dumb enough to bring all of them, did you?
Nobody said you were dumb.
But... without seeing all of them
I can't estimate the overall quality of the product.
For all I know, you could've handpicked the best one.
I didn't.
Now!
Move out!
I've got 200 more of that same quality.
Now how much?
You say you're not dumb, but with what you've been handling lately, the moves you've been making,
I'm starting to think you are.
- Why's that?
- Killing cops?
In my day, we would've never done a thing like that.
Brings too much heat.
How'd you know about the cops?
(people screaming)
Nice shot, Fryer.
STEVE:
Trouble is now our only lead is dead.
You okay.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
I told your partner I was too old for this.
March was telling me he thinks he can identify where the diamonds are from.
Okay, that's good.
How?
Every diamond has a distinct marking.
If I could look at this stone this guy brought under a microscope,
I might be able to tell you something about it.
Okay, all right, good.
Take Mr. March over to Fong's, we have a microscope for you to look at, okay?
Fine, fine, fine.
I mean...
Now, look, I just did what I had to do, all right?
And besides, this guy matches the description of the evidence van hijacker, okay?
- Okay.
- Do we have a positive I.D.?
Yeah.
And it tells a whole lot.
Okay, what?
His name's Darryl Kaleo.
Brother of an ex-cop you put away last year for the murder of your ex-partner.
I know who he is.
Are you implying that he's involved with this?
Hey, look, he's capable of killing cops.
- He's also in prison.
- That's right.
He's in a life term.
Doesn't mean he's not behind this.
You think that he just orchestrated this whole thing?
From jail?
Why?
What does he get out of it?
Just helping his brother?
Doesn't make sense.
Why don't we pay him a visit and find out.
He's easy to find.
DANNY:
Life is pretty good here in the Protective Custody Wing, right?
One of the perks of being a cop.
Ex-cop.
You should be walking the main line with the rest of these lowlifes, and you know it.
My prior law enforcement work makes me a target.
Is there a reason you two are tossing my place or did you just miss me?
KALEO:
You two have no legal authority to be shaking me down.
This is harassment.
FRYER:
You're in prison.
Subject to search whenever and wherever.
Why are you really here?
I know you're looking for something.
Why bother lying?
Okay.
I will play along.
Your brother... he robbed a transport van, killed two cops.
FRYER:
You already know that, don't ya?
Huh?
Listen, Kaleo, we know that you helped set this thing up, and we are here to prove that-- that's what we're gonna do.
Be my guest.
Okay.
You know, Williams...
What?
You mentioning my brother makes me nostalgic about family.
You got a kid, right?
How's she doing, anyway?
My daughter is doing fine.
Thank you.
Your brother Darryl, on the other hand, he's not doing so good.
He's dead.
FRYER:
Hey.
Look what we got here.
Cell phone.
You planted that.
It ain't mine.
I'm sure your prints are gonna be all over it.
So tell me... is this how you arranged the transport van's hijacking?
It is, isn't it?
You got questions, run them by my lawyer.
Okay, no problem.
Listen, um,... (whispering):
you know, last time I saw you...
I broke a couple of bones in your face, right?
You ever mention my daughter again...
I promise you I'm gonna come back here,
I'm gonna break every single bone in your body, okay?
You understand?
(slaps Kaleo's back) Put him back in his cage.
MARCH:
Interesting.
This explains why these diamonds were never reported missing.
Based on quality,
I would say... that this stone comes from the Republic of Liberia.
Are you sure?
Things change.
I mean, you've been locked up for 30 years.
30 years, 13 million years, this is an allotrope of carbon formed at high pressure and high temperature conditions.
That never changes.
This stone, my dear, comes from Africa.
Which leads me to believe that is is probably... a conflict diamond.
Blood diamonds... sold on the black market, and used to finance civil wars and genocide on the Africa coast.
Have you ever done business with people from Liberia?
No, no.
But...
I'm a student of the game.
The game never changes.
Just the players do.
Well, then that would explain the kidnapper's accent.
Exactly.
And that's why, if I were you,
I would check out Liberians here on temporary visas.
Okay.
We really appreciate the help.
This at least gives us an idea of who's holding Angela.
I wish you luck.
And feel free to call on me anytime.
Bye.
Mr. March.
Hmm?
I'm gonna need that diamond back.
The diamond?
!
(laughs)
Here we go.
Can't blame a guy for trying.
CHIN:
All the outbound calls off of Kaleo's cell phone are to his brother Darryl... with the exception of this one.
Okay, who's this one to?
CHIN:
TSA security line.
Hey, look at the time stamp.
FRYER: 30 minutes before Mary was arrested.
So Kaleo made the call that got Mary arrested and the diamonds seized.
He told him the description of the van, the route, so they could hijack it.
But the part of the puzzle we don't have is how they know about the Liberian smuggling operation in the first place.
I reached out to TSA.
I worked up a list of Liberians that are on the island on temporary visas.
It's not extensive.
That's him.
Bottom left.
That's the guy that kidnapped Angela.
(beeping)
KONO:
Jordan Nevins.
He landed on the island three days ago.
Okay, well, it looks like he didn't lie on his TSA entry form.
Just confirmed he's staying in the penthouse suite.
Let's go pay him a visit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
Getting my vest.
No, I'll get your ve...
Uh, Chin?
Help him with the thing.
Hey, hey, Steve, come on over here a second.
What are you talking about?
What is that?
That was your birthday cake.
I was planning on taking it by the office.
Got sidetracked by this case.
Is that why you guys all stopped talking when I came in the office this morning?
Yeah.
Like usual, you figured out a way to ruin everything.
Thanks.
It's butter cream.
Butter cream's my favorite.
Move in!
Hey, hey!
I got Jordan.
Continue clearing.
All clear.
Bedroom's clear; no girl.
All right, where's Angela?
I-I don't know...
Hey!
Where's Angela?
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right, we'll see about that.
NEVINS:
I'm a Liberian citizen.
If you lay a finger on me,
I will have the consulate crawling so far up your...
That's a good idea.
And afterwards, I can tell your bosses that you lost their diamond shipment.
You seized some diamonds?
That look familiar?
It would take less than an hour for me to prepare a press release announcing the seizure of 20 million in conflict diamonds.
You know, it's funny, there's something about your body language right now that tells me that if that press release hits, you're gonna feel safer in here with us than you are out there on the street.
If I tell you everything, you gotta protect me and a promise of no deportation.
I'll be a dead man if you send me back to Liberia.
You got it.
Where's the girl?
(sighs)
I have no idea.
After our little charade at the hotel, we parted ways.
What are you talking about-- "charade"?
Angela faked her own kidnapping?
We didn't have a choice.
Angela was bumped from the flight at the last minute.
FRYER:
Let me guess, you had already told the people in New York the diamonds were on the flight.
I'm a facilitator.
I am paid to deliver the product to a buyer at a specific date and time.
And if that doesn't happen...
People like you get killed.
They had to, uh, use the other girl to make the drop as scheduled.
The other girl was my sister.
Did you know?
It was Angela's idea to scare her into doing it.
So, Angela and you worked together before?
NEVINS:
Yes.
She made several runs for me in the last few months, but nothing as large as this.
This is the first time for the both of us.
You've been played.
Angela probably set Mary up, so when the diamonds didn't get there, she wouldn't be blamed.
You and my sister Mary did.
No...
I doubt if Angela would...
double-cross me.
She's not smart enough to come up with something like this on her own.
Maybe she met somebody who was.
DANNY:
So, what was the plan?
You were gonna use your share of the dough to make an appeal?
Bribe a judge?
What?
It was worth a try.
Okay.
Where's Angela?
She's in the wind.
Where she lands, your guess is as good as mine.
Okay, how did she hook up with Darryl?
She's his ex-old lady.
She reached out to him with an opportunity to make a big score.
She just didn't want to get killed doing it.
And your brother turned to you for advice?
Advice?
Guess you could call it that.
I just figured a way for her and my brother to get rich.
All right, well, I'm gonna charge you with the death of those two cops.
What you just said, coupled with the phone records gives us enough-- more than enough-- to prove that you orchestrated the whole thing.
I'm doing life without, and there's no death penalty here in Hawaii.
Sorry to disappoint you, but another case is not going to make a difference to me.
That might be true, but since you've killed two more cops, you have lost your right to be housed in protective custody.
Isn't that true?
It is, it's true.
And (chuckles)...
believe me, uh, when you meet your new cell mate, life is going to get very interesting.
Wait, you can't do that.
Yes I can;
I just did.
Stand up.
Turn around, Sunshine.
Cuff him.
Hey... dead man walking.

(sighs) I feel so stupid.
Mary, this happens to all of us.
I mean, people we think we can trust tell us lies.
I know, but I thought she was my friend.
Look, Angela's gonna resurface eventually.
She's gonna try to fence those diamonds.
And when she does, Interpol and the FBI are gonna be waiting for her.
It's only a matter of time, Mary.
She's on every country's watch list.
(quietly):
Wow.
All right, well, what-what now?
What about me?
You move on.
You pick yourself up.
You learn from your mistakes.
(sighs)
I honestly don't even know what to do with myself.
I...
I liked that job.
You know, I finally felt like
I was starting a new chapter in my life.
Well, you'll be happy to know that that chapter's still open for you.

I spoke to the airline.
They know you're a victim in all this.

It is?
Yeah.

Yeah, really.

I will also remember that.
STEVE:
Wow.
Here you go, birthday boy.
DANNY:
Happy birthday, buddy.
Thank you.
Guys, listen, I think we should just face the fact, that I'm not that easy to surprise.
You know?
Surprise!
(laughter)
Better than butter cream, right?
No, I'm good, thank you.
Okay.
So, I'd never heard anything like it before.
They said salt cake, I said, "What's the plan?"
MARCH:
I'm delighted you reached out to me, Angela.
I didn't have many options.
But with your help, this actually worked out better than I hoped.
Your diamonds.
It's been a pleasure.
Oh, believe me, the pleasure's all mine.
But there's one more thing you need to learn about this type of business.
As I said before... never turn your back on the buyer.

Sorry, brah.
We're all good.
Sorry.
Maybe I just don't get it.
On this island, when you drop in on someone's wave, you cause problems for other surfers.
That's just what happens.
Like everything else on this island, that makes zero sense.
Okay, I saw a wave, I rode it.
If anybody else wants to ride it with me, they're welcome.
No, you're wrong, okay?
If somebody's on the wave first, they own the wave.
Ho!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ho!
You can't own a wave.
Certainly not because you paddle faster than the next guy.
All right, that's number one.
Number two:
I clearly told the guy
I was coming down on his left.
I said, "Hey, buddy, I'm on the wave!"
It's the Pacific Ocean.
Danny, it's not a bike path.
Okay, well, I-I think that the same rules should apply for any thoroughfare.
Take it from me, someone who was not born on this island, therefore was not raised with all the mumbo jumbo.
You can't own a wave.
While we're on the subject,
Spam is not part of any food group that I care to recognize.
And last but not least, an appetizer should never, never, under any circumstances, be referred to as a pupu.
Hey!
There you guys are.
I didn't know your sister was in town.
- Neither did I.
- Hi.
I've been looking for you two for over an hour.
You weren't home, so I figured
I'd check your favorite little surf spot.
So here I am.
Surprise.
What are you doing here, Mary?
What does it look like I'm doing here?
It looks like you're, uh, going to a Halloween party dressed as a flight attendant.
Come on.
Seriously.
You're working for the airlines?
Yes!
It's the coolest job ever.
I started like two weeks ago, and they gave me the Oahu to New York run.
I'm going to be flying back and forth like twice a week.
We can hang out during my layovers.
How sweet is that?
Pretty sweet.
Right?
Huh?
Come here.
Hi.
Come on.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Pick up your board, Danny.
Come on.
Pick it up!
So... so, you guys are, like, surf buddies now, huh?
Uh, yeah, kind of.
So cute.
Why didn't you call me?
I could've picked you up from the airport.
'Cause I wanted to surprise you.
Look at him.
He's definitely surprised.
In a good way.
In a good way.
So a stewardess.
How exactly did that happen?
Uh, well, my friend Angela worked for the airlines, and she knew I needed a job, so here I am.
And, by the way, we like
- to be called flight attendants.
- I knew that.
I did, actually.
Can I have a cup of coffee, too?
Are you, uh...
are you staying in town for a while?
Actually, no.
I'm working the return flight back to New York, so I got to take a rain check on the coffee.
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You just got here.
I know, but I have to go back to the hotel and freshen up before the flight.
So we'll catch up next time.
I have so much to tell you.
But it's all good stuff, so don't worry.
I'm not worried.
I'm really happy for you.
Thank you.
All right, I'll see you guys in, like, three days.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- See you.
- Bye, sis.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
So we are kind of surf buddies now?
You sensitive right now?
Yeah, little bit.
Hello, Mary.
You've kept me waiting.
We need to talk.

Hey.
What's up, Steve?
What's up?
Hey.
All right, see you later.
Okay.
What's up?
What was that?
What was what?
Why'd they just, uh... why'd they run out of here so quick?
What were you guys talking about?
What were we talking about?
I don't know.
Stuff.
General stuff.
What, uh... what, are you being paranoid now?
No, this is not paranoia, Daniel.
This has been happening a lot lately.
You guys have been acting weird.
Oh, okay.
Well, I think you should relax, maybe, and stop overanalyzing things.
Relax?
That's funny coming from you.
Okay, no, no, no.
Do what you want to do.
Be paranoid.
Okay, go nuts.
Let your mind play tricks on you.
Next thing you know, you are going to be wearing a tinfoil hat, babbling about black helicopters.
Black helicopters are real.
What do you mean, they're real?
They're real.
This is McGarrett.
Is this a joke?
I'll be right there.
Mary's been arrested.
Commander McGarrett.
- Thanks for your call.
- Not a problem.
Earlier today, we got a tip on one of the unrecorded lines that a stewardess was planning on smuggling some contraband onto a New York bound flight.
Okay, all right, this is crazy.
Mary's not a smuggler.
Are you sure you have the right person?
Commander McGarrett, your sister had about $20 million worth of diamonds duct-taped to her torso, so, yeah, I think we got the right person.
Did she say why she had the diamonds?
She refused to talk to us.
That's why we called you.
She won't talk to anyone else.
Okay, you said you stopped her based on a tip.
- Who gave it to you?
- It was an anonymous tip.
A male caller.
We tried to trace it, but he hung up too fast.
It was probably a prepaid cell anyway.
And is that unusual-- to get a call out of the blue like that?
No.
We get anonymous tips about drug mules all the time.
It's usually a rival group trying to put the competition out of business.
All right, listen, as a professional courtesy,
I'd like to speak to my sister in private.
What the hell happened?
I went straight to my hotel when I left you guys, and there was a man in my room with a gun.
Okay.
Have you ever seen this guy before?
No.
Don't think so.
- You don't think so?
- No, I-I know so.
I've never seen him before.
You believe me, right?
Of course, I believe you.
Mary, just slow down.
And tell me how you got away from this guy and how you ended up with these diamonds.
I didn't get away.
He taped the diamonds to me, and he told me that Angela's dead if I don't do exactly what he says.
Okay, who's Angela?
I told you about her, didn't I?
I don't... maybe.
Just tell me again.
We work together as flight attendants.
We came from New York together.
Okay, so she was your friend before this?
Yes.
We met at yoga class, like, three months ago.
I mean, she's really, like, the only real friend that I have.
She helped me get this job.
Steve, I really screwed up.
If I'm not on that plane when it lands, she's going to be killed.
Listen, Mary, just take a deep breath, okay, and calm down, all right?
Now, tell me everything you know about this guy who took your friend.
That's the thing, is I don't know anything about him, but he knew everything about me.
He was in my room waiting.
Okay, well, can you describe this guy to me?
Yeah.
He was tall.
He had dark skin.
He had a deep voice.
He had an accent.
Wasn't European, but similar.
You're positive you've never seen him before?
Yes, I'm positive.
I've never seen him, okay?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Because it's not adding up, Mary.
You understand?
Like, I'm trying to put this thing together, but it doesn't... it doesn't make sense to me.
Like, why would they take you?
Okay, and why would you not call me the minute you got away from him?
'Cause I was terrified.
I still am, Steve.
He took a picture of me on his cell phone, and he told me that he's going to text his partner, and that when I land, this guy's going to text me instructions.
He did that to keep you scared and cooperating, you understand?
Well, it's working.
I can't believe
I'm in this mess now.
Steve, if I'm not on that plane in nine hours with the diamonds,
Angela's going to be killed.
That's not going to happen, Mary.
Because that plane took off half an hour ago.
You understand?
Which means we got nine hours to save your friend.
We'll find her, Mary, all right?
Hey.
We'll find her.
Okay?
We need to find this Angela.
- Yes.
If there really is an Angela.
- Danny, she's my sister.
I think I'd know if she was lying.
Okay.
All right, what are you getting at?
Listen to me.
I thought I knew my brother-- right?
-- and he lied to me, and now he's on the FBI Most Wanted list.
No offense, but I think I'm a little closer to my sister than you were to your brother.
Okay, so then you know she was arrested two months ago for drunk driving?
Wait a minute.
You ran background on my sister?
No, I didn't run background on your sister;
TSA did, and I am relaying information.
Okay, well, holding back the fact that she got arrested two months ago does not mean that she's lying to us today.
I'm not saying she's lying, maybe just not telling us the full story.
Okay, look, we're going to check that hotel room, then we're going to know more.
Until then, I'm going on the assumption that she's telling me the truth.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
So the room hasn't been serviced, so it should be in the same condition as when your sister checked out.
Well, so far, we have no signs of a forced entry, struggle, or a girl named Angela.
Okay, well, it doesn't mean it didn't happen and she doesn't exist, right?
The guy could have used the pass key.
Yeah, well, the hotel staff said that Mary was the only one issued with a room key, and nobody saw her with another woman.
But I did confirm that Mary has a co-worker named Angela Branson who flew in with her.
She's based out of New York and isn't due to fly out again for three days.
And according to the hotel records, there was a room booked in her name, but she never actually checked in.
All right, well, good.
That's a good start.
We got any, uh...
got any other contact info?
The airline gave us her cell phone number, but it's just rolling straight to voicemail whenever we try it.
Well, if she'd been kidnapped, that would make sense, right?
Okay, are you trying to convince us or yourself?
Maybe a little of both.
Okay.
We need to get a look at this security feed.
Okay, that's him.
That's the guy Mary described.
He's got Angela.
Stop.
Push in.
All right, so he brings Angela down the back way so no one can see him.
Danny, call Kono, have her pick Mary up from the TSA's custody, and drop her in my office, but tell her I want it done low-key.
For Angela's safety, we can't let anybody know that Mary and the diamonds didn't make that flight.
Okay, okay!
Would you slow down, please?
Please!
We're not gonna be able to help anybody if we end up wrapped around a telephone pole.
That anonymous call about Mary and the diamonds it doesn't add up.
There are a lot of things about this case that do not add up, and I apologize for not believing Mary's story, but please stop driving this car like it's stolen, and slow down!
Driving like I always do.
Listen, whoever made the call to TSA about Mary had to have been a part of the smuggler's operation.
Right?
That's the only way that they would have known that Mary had the diamonds on her.
Okay, we don't know who made the call, but maybe Kono got a chance to enhance that video, and we will get an I.D. on her kidnapper.
Please slow down.
I'm asking you nicely.
I said please don't do it, please...
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
Thank you.
You okay?
Yeah.
All right.
Okay, Kono, tell me something good.
All right, well, the rest of the security videos don't show much.
They only have coverage of the stairwell, so there's no actual footage of anyone going in or out of that specific room.
But we got footage of Angela being dragged down the back stairwell.
What about the, uh, facial recognition thingie?
I already tried that.
The angles are bad.
There's not enough to get a complete scan.
Okay, uh, Chin, what about the origin of the diamonds?
I checked through Interpol.
There's no reports of any diamond shipments this size, either missing or stolen.
The good news is that Angela's safe as long as they believe that Mary and the diamonds are on that plane.
Well, I hate to be the one that states the obvious.
She is not on the plane, so, we're gonna have a big problem in about eight hours, when it lands.
Okay, maybe, maybe.
What do you mean?
I got plan-- it might be a goofy plan-- but what if, what if we get Mary and those diamonds on the governor's G-4?
In the next half an hour, we can beat that plane to New York.
When the guy there approaches her and takes possession of the diamonds, we snatch him for smuggling.
Very good.
Okay, and if we can flip him, then we can roll back and arrest whoever's holding Angela.
Okay, Kono, get the governor on the phone.
We need that plane ready, fueled to go in a half an hour.
Please call HPD, and tell them we need those diamonds here immediately.
42-30?
42-30, come in.
Go for 42-30.
Per the watch commander, start heading towards Iolani Palace.
See Detective Williams for an evidence transfer.
42-30.
Copy that.
Evidence transfer?
What the hell's that about?
Hey.
Hey, look, just so there's no confusion, this is HPD's handle, not Five-O's.
Well, most people like to start the day off with some pleasantries, but not the new chief of detectives, huh?
You do know that that transport van contained evidence from a case we were working?
I've already been briefed on the kidnapping case.
The murder of my two cops trumps it-- come on.
- Okay, listen to me...
- Detective Kelly?
...you do know that the only people who knew the diamonds were in that van were cops.
All right, so if you're gonna start looking for the hijacker, you start with HPD.
Hey, look, no way in hell.
I cleaned house.
I'll bet my job none of my guys are involved.
Hey, they just ran the plate on that semi.
It was reported stolen last night.
Okay, if they stole the semi truck last night, they already knew the diamonds were going to be seized today.
All right, who would have known something about that?
The guy who called in the anonymous tip on Mary.
But if they were always gonna steal the diamonds, why wouldn't they just snatch Mary when she arrived at the airport?
Because they were more afraid of the diamond smugglers than they were of us.
Let's make 'em worry about us.
Mary, we need to determine who may have targeted you to smuggle those diamonds.
So, was there anyone new that either you or Angela had met?
Maybe an overfriendly passenger?
No.
Nobody.
How long have you known Angela?
We met a few months back at this yoga club in New York.
And she's the one that helped me get this job.
Oh, my God.
This could be from the people that have Angela.
What do you mean?
Well, the kidnappers said
I was gonna get a text message from his guy in New York.
What does it say?
"When you land, walk directly to baggage carousel three.
"I'll be watching, so don't try and involve the cops, or your friend's... dead."
Good news is, they still have no idea
Mary didn't make that plane.
Yeah, looks like we got about five hours till they find out.
All right, when you get those diamonds, we can use them as a bargaining chip for Angela's life.
Hey, I've been thinking about these diamonds.
If these guys just came in possession of 20 million in ice, they need to move it through a broker.
If they are still on the island.
Yeah, but these guys killed two cops to get these stones, so they know we're watching everyone leaving the island.
The smartest thing these guys can do is to try and move those diamonds while they're still here.
Right, and as far as brokers go, there's only so many guys on the island that can handle this kind of weight.
Now this is a criminal file on a fence released from prison six months ago.
If there's a deal he'll have heard about it.
So, this guy's been off the radar since he finished serving his sentence six months ago.
You got new leverage on him?
Nothing.
No parole.
Did his full 30-year term, dropped his tail.
Doesn't mean he's not dirty.
In my experience, once a crook, you are always a crook.
I agree.
August March.
HPD.
We need to ask you a few questions.
Nobody here by that name.
Have you tried next door?
You lie to me again, you're going straight back to jail.
You know, last time I checked, you needed a man's invitation to walk into his house.
That rule applies to citizens.
You stopped being one 30 years ago.
30 years...
Well, maybe you should talk to my attorney about what my rights are...
You finish making that call...
Yeah?
You are going to jail.
Either way, you're gonna answer my questions, because...
You-you can't...
- ...
I don't have time for your games.
- No, no.
You understand me?
You understand me?
Yeah, well, I certainly won't answer your questions...
Excuse me.
Come on, Vince.
Why don't you pull it back a little bit?
All right?
This guy's done his time.
Why don't you just take it easy?
All right, I'm not holding nothing back, McGarrett.
I got two dead cops.
Two.
And I'm betting that this old man knows who's responsible, okay?
Now don't be fooled by the way he looks.
August March ran one of the largest smuggling networks in the world.
He was the fence for stolen art and gems.
Nothing moved on or off Honolulu without August March taking a piece of the action.
His operation and pipeline continued long after he was in prison for ordering the murder of two of his business associates.
They made the mistake of trusting him, and they got a bullet for it.
The man is a cold-blooded killer.
It's a very colorful, but less-than-accurate description of what I was convicted of.
Whatever crimes I committed in the past are just that.
The past!
Now, please leave me alone, or I'm gonna file a complaint!
Listen, there's a woman whose life is in danger.
All we need is a little bit of your time and some help with the smuggler that we're looking for, okay?
I'm sorry, but I don't do that anymore.
I've been on ice for 30 years.
I'm not in that business anymore.
Okay, but you do know people that are in that business, correct?
Yeah, I do, and unlike you guys, they take me at my word when I say I'm out.
All we're trying to do is prevent an innocent woman from being killed over the theft of a few lousy diamonds here.
This is about diamonds?
Yes.
Do you know anything about it?
I might.
But if I help you, you've got to give me your word that you'll never bother me again.
And nobody must know about my involvement.
You have my word.
Well...
I'm not just talking about you.
Look, you give me the guys that killed my men...
Yeah?
...you will never, never lay eyes on me again.
Fine.
Fine, fine, fine.
I got a call yesterday from a stranger.
I don't know who he is, nor who referred him to me.
But he said he wanted to fence... s-some diamonds.
Yeah, uh...
It's, it's the last number on there.
Maybe you can trace the number.
Okay.
Did I hear right, that your name's McGarrett?
Yeah.
There was a young officer named McGarrett who transported me to jail 30 years ago.
Any relation?
Yeah, that was my father.
Yeah.
No kidding.
Small world.
How's he doing?
He's dead.
Shame.
Sorry to hear that.
He was a good man.
I tried to offer him... $100,000 bribe that day.
A fortune at that time.
My father wasn't that kind of cop.
But there were plenty of cops around him who would've taken that money, right, Chief?
It's a pre-paid.
Can't trace it.
Thank you.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I tried.
I wish I could help you more.
Hey, look, you're not done.
You're not.
Call that guy back.
Set up a meet and let me grab him.
- Give him to me.
Just give him to me.
- No!
Come on.
That's a young man's game.
I'm too old for that kind of thing.
Come on.
This is probably the only chance we have to get this girl back safe.
This guy better show.
Plane lands in New York in less than four hours.
I got him.
I got a visual, 10:00.
Right now. 10:00.
He's strapped.
Butt of a gun sticking out of his shirt.
If March gets compromised, that guy pulls out that gun, every single one of these civilians is at risk here.
This guy's an old pro.
He'll do fine.
Let's hope your right.
August March?
Take a seat.
You're making the waiter nervous.
By yourself, right?
Because if not, anything happens, you're the first to get shot.
Relax, kid.
I'm here for one piece of business.
The only thing that's gonna happen here today, is you and me are gonna get rich.
Just remember, we wait for him to inspect the diamonds.
That's the arrest signal.
- That is when we move in.
- You sure you can move this kind of weight?
Eh, don't worry.
I got the connections.
Whoever sent you to me knows that.
Good.
So what's the brokerage fee on 20 million worth?
Well, as I told you on the phone,
I can't say without seeing the quality of the product.
Y-You did bring all of the diamonds like I told you.
You didn't really think I'd be dumb enough to bring all of them, did you?
Nobody said you were dumb.
But... without seeing all of them
I can't estimate the overall quality of the product.
For all I know, you could've handpicked the best one.
I didn't.
Now!
Move out!
I've got 200 more of that same quality.
Now how much?
You say you're not dumb, but with what you've been handling lately, the moves you've been making,
I'm starting to think you are.
- Why's that?
- Killing cops?
In my day, we would've never done a thing like that.
Brings too much heat.
How'd you know about the cops?
Nice shot, Fryer.
Trouble is now our only lead is dead.
You okay.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
I told your partner I was too old for this.
March was telling me he thinks he can identify where the diamonds are from.
Okay, that's good.
How?
Every diamond has a distinct marking.
If I could look at this stone this guy brought under a microscope,
I might be able to tell you something about it.
Okay, all right, good.
Take Mr. March over to Fong's, we have a microscope for you to look at, okay?
Fine, fine, fine.
I mean...
Now, look, I just did what I had to do, all right?
And besides, this guy matches the description of the evidence van hijacker, okay?
- Okay.
- Do we have a positive I.D.?
Yeah.
And it tells a whole lot.
Okay, what?
His name's Darryl Kaleo.
Brother of an ex-cop you put away last year for the murder of your ex-partner.
I know who he is.
Are you implying that he's involved with this?
Hey, look, he's capable of killing cops.
- He's also in prison.
- That's right.
He's in a life term.
Doesn't mean he's not behind this.
You think that he just orchestrated this whole thing?
From jail?
Why?
What does he get out of it?
Just helping his brother?
Doesn't make sense.
Why don't we pay him a visit and find out.
He's easy to find.
Life is pretty good here in the Protective Custody Wing, right?
One of the perks of being a cop.
Ex-cop.
You should be walking the main line with the rest of these lowlifes, and you know it.
My prior law enforcement work makes me a target.
Is there a reason you two are tossing my place or did you just miss me?
You two have no legal authority to be shaking me down.
- This is harassment.
- You're in prison.
Subject to search whenever and wherever.
Why are you really here?
I know you're looking for something.
Why bother lying?
Okay.
I will play along.
Your brother... he robbed a transport van, killed two cops.
You already know that, don't ya?
Huh?
Listen, Kaleo, we know that you helped set this thing up, and we are here to prove that-- that's what we're gonna do.
Be my guest.
Okay.
You know, Williams...
What?
You mentioning my brother makes me nostalgic about family.
You got a kid, right?
How's she doing, anyway?
My daughter is doing fine.
Thank you.
Your brother Darryl, on the other hand, he's not doing so good.
He's dead.
Hey.
Look what we got here.
Cell phone.
You planted that.
It ain't mine.
I'm sure your prints are gonna be all over it.
So tell me... is this how you arranged the transport van's hijacking?
It is, isn't it?
You got questions, run them by my lawyer.
Okay, no problem.
Listen, um,... you know, last time I saw you...
I broke a couple of bones in your face, right?
You ever mention my daughter again...
I promise you I'm gonna come back here,
I'm gonna break every single bone in your body, okay?
You understand?
Put him back in his cage.
Interesting.
This explains why these diamonds were never reported missing.
Based on quality,
I would say... that this stone comes from the Republic of Liberia.
Are you sure?
Things change.
I mean, you've been locked up for 30 years.
30 years, 13 million years, this is an allotrope of carbon formed at high pressure and high temperature conditions.
That never changes.
This stone, my dear, comes from Africa.
Which leads me to believe that is is probably... a conflict diamond.
Blood diamonds... sold on the black market, and used to finance civil wars and genocide on the Africa coast.
Have you ever done business with people from Liberia?
No, no.
But...
I'm a student of the game.
The game never changes.
Just the players do.
Well, then that would explain the kidnapper's accent.
Exactly.
And that's why, if I were you,
I would check out Liberians here on temporary visas.
Okay.
We really appreciate the help.
This at least gives us an idea of who's holding Angela.
I wish you luck.
And feel free to call on me anytime.
Bye.
Mr. March.
Hmm?
I'm gonna need that diamond back.
The diamond?
!
Here we go.
Can't blame a guy for trying.
All the outbound calls off of Kaleo's cell phone are to his brother Darryl... with the exception of this one.
Okay, who's this one to?
TSA security line.
Hey, look at the time stamp.
30 minutes before Mary was arrested.
So Kaleo made the call that got Mary arrested and the diamonds seized.
He told him the description of the van, the route, so they could hijack it.
But the part of the puzzle we don't have is how they know about the Liberian smuggling operation in the first place.
I reached out to TSA.
I worked up a list of Liberians that are on the island on temporary visas.
It's not extensive.
That's him.
Bottom left.
That's the guy that kidnapped Angela.
Jordan Nevins.
He landed on the island three days ago.
Okay, well, it looks like he didn't lie on his TSA entry form.
Just confirmed he's staying in the penthouse suite.
Let's go pay him a visit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
Getting my vest.
No, I'll get your ve...
Uh, Chin?
Help him with the thing.
Hey, hey, Steve, come on over here a second.
What are you talking about?
What is that?
That was your birthday cake.
I was planning on taking it by the office.
Got sidetracked by this case.
Is that why you guys all stopped talking when I came in the office this morning?
Yeah.
Like usual, you figured out a way to ruin everything.
Thanks.
It's butter cream.
Butter cream's my favorite.
Move in!
Hey, hey!
I got Jordan.
Continue clearing.
All clear.
Bedroom's clear; no girl.
All right, where's Angela?
I-I don't know...
Hey!
Where's Angela?
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right, we'll see about that.
I'm a Liberian citizen.
If you lay a finger on me,
I will have the consulate crawling so far up your...
That's a good idea.
And afterwards, I can tell your bosses that you lost their diamond shipment.
You seized some diamonds?
That look familiar?
It would take less than an hour for me to prepare a press release announcing the seizure of 20 million in conflict diamonds.
You know, it's funny, there's something about your body language right now that tells me that if that press release hits, you're gonna feel safer in here with us than you are out there on the street.
If I tell you everything, you gotta protect me and a promise of no deportation.
I'll be a dead man if you send me back to Liberia.
You got it.
Where's the girl?
I have no idea.
After our little charade at the hotel, we parted ways.
What are you talking about-- "charade"?
Angela faked her own kidnapping?
We didn't have a choice.
Angela was bumped from the flight at the last minute.
Let me guess, you had already told the people in New York the diamonds were on the flight.
I'm a facilitator.
I am paid to deliver the product to a buyer at a specific date and time.
And if that doesn't happen...
People like you get killed.
They had to, uh, use the other girl to make the drop as scheduled.
The other girl was my sister.
Did you know?
It was Angela's idea to scare her into doing it.
So, Angela and you worked together before?
Yes.
She made several runs for me in the last few months, but nothing as large as this.
This is the first time for the both of us.
You've been played.
Angela probably set Mary up, so when the diamonds didn't get there, she wouldn't be blamed.
You and my sister Mary did.
No...
I doubt if Angela would...
double-cross me.
She's not smart enough to come up with something like this on her own.
Maybe she met somebody who was.
So, what was the plan?
You were gonna use your share of the dough to make an appeal?
Bribe a judge?
What?
It was worth a try.
Okay.
Where's Angela?
She's in the wind.
Where she lands, your guess is as good as mine.
Okay, how did she hook up with Darryl?
She's his ex-old lady.
She reached out to him with an opportunity to make a big score.
She just didn't want to get killed doing it.
And your brother turned to you for advice?
Advice?
Guess you could call it that.
I just figured a way for her and my brother to get rich.
All right, well, I'm gonna charge you with the death of those two cops.
What you just said, coupled with the phone records gives us enough-- more than enough-- to prove that you orchestrated the whole thing.
I'm doing life without, and there's no death penalty here in Hawaii.
Sorry to disappoint you, but another case is not going to make a difference to me.
That might be true, but since you've killed two more cops, you have lost your right to be housed in protective custody.
Isn't that true?
It is, it's true.
And...
believe me, uh, when you meet your new cell mate, life is going to get very interesting.
Wait, you can't do that.
Yes I can;
I just did.
Stand up.
Turn around, Sunshine.
Cuff him.

Mary, this happens to all of us.
I mean, people we think we can trust tell us lies.
I know, but I thought she was my friend.
Look, Angela's gonna resurface eventually.
She's gonna try to fence those diamonds.
And when she does, Interpol and the FBI are gonna be waiting for her.
It's only a matter of time, Mary.
She's on every country's watch list.
Wow.

Certainly not because you paddle faster than the next guy.

Hey!
There you guys are.
I didn't know your sister was in town.
- Neither did I.
- Hi.
I've been looking for you two for over an hour.
You weren't home, so I figured
I'd check your favorite little surf spot.
So here I am.
Surprise.
What are you doing here, Mary?
What does it look like I'm doing here?
It looks like you're, uh, going to a Halloween party dressed as a flight attendant.
Come on.
Seriously.
You're working for the airlines?
Yes!
It's the coolest job ever.
I started like two weeks ago, and they gave me the Oahu to New York run.
I'm going to be flying back and forth like twice a week.
We can hang out during my layovers.
How sweet is that?
Pretty sweet.
Right?
Huh?
Come here.
Hi.
Come on.

So... so, you guys are, like, surf buddies now, huh?
Uh, yeah, kind of.
So cute.
Why didn't you call me?
I could've picked you up from the airport.
'Cause I wanted to surprise you.
DANNY:
Look at him.
He's definitely surprised.
STEVE:
In a good way.
In a good way.
So a stewardess.
How exactly did that happen?
Uh, well, my friend Angela worked for the airlines, and she knew I needed a job, so here I am.
And, by the way, we like to be called flight attendants.
DANNY:
I knew that.
I did, actually.
Can I have a cup of coffee, too?
Are you, uh...
are you staying in town for a while?
Actually, no.
I'm working the return flight back to New York, so I got to take a rain check on the coffee.
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You just got here.
I know, but I have to go back to the hotel and freshen up before the flight.
So we'll catch up next time.
I have so much to tell you.
But it's all good stuff, so don't worry.
I'm not worried.

They're real.
This is McGarrett.
Is this a joke?
I'll be right there.
Mary's been arrested.
Commander McGarrett.
- Thanks for your call.
- Not a problem.
Earlier today, we got a tip on one of the unrecorded lines that a stewardess was planning on smuggling some contraband onto a New York bound flight.
Okay, all right, this is crazy.
Mary's not a smuggler.
Are you sure you have the right person?
Commander McGarrett, your sister had about $20 million worth of diamonds duct-taped to her torso, so, yeah, I think we got the right person.
Did she say why she had the diamonds?
She refused to talk to us.
That's why we called you.
She won't talk to anyone else.
Okay, you said you stopped her based on a tip.
- Who gave it to you?
- It was an anonymous tip.
A male caller.
We tried to trace it, but he hung up too fast.
It was probably a prepaid cell anyway.
And is that unusual-- to get a call out of the blue like that?
No.
We get anonymous tips about drug mules all the time.
It's usually a rival group trying to put the competition out of business.
All right, listen, as a professional courtesy,
I'd like to speak to my sister in private.
What the hell happened?
I went straight to my hotel when I left you guys, and there was a man in my room with a gun.
Okay.
Have you ever seen this guy before?
No.
Don't think so.
- You don't think so?
- No, I-I know so.
I've never seen him before.
You believe me, right?
Of course, I believe you.
Mary, just slow down.
And tell me how you got away from this guy and how you ended up with these diamonds.
I didn't get away.
He taped the diamonds to me, and he told me that Angela's dead if I don't do exactly what he says.
Okay, who's Angela?
I told you about her, didn't I?
I don't... maybe.
Just tell me again.
We work together as flight attendants.
We came from New York together.
Okay, so she was your friend before this?
Yes.
We met at yoga class, like, three months ago.
I mean, she's really, like, the only real friend that I have.
She helped me get this job.
Steve, I really screwed up.
If I'm not on that plane when it lands, she's going to be killed.
Listen, Mary, just take a deep breath, okay, and calm down, all right?
Now, tell me everything you know about this guy who took your friend.
That's the thing, is I don't know anything about him, but he knew everything about me.
He was in my room waiting.
Okay, well, can you describe this guy to me?
Yeah.
He was tall.
He had dark skin.
He had a deep voice.
He had an accent.
Wasn't European, but similar.
You're positive you've never seen him before?
Yes, I'm positive.
I've never seen him, okay?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Because it's not adding up, Mary.
You understand?
Like, I'm trying to put this thing together, but it doesn't... it doesn't make sense to me.
Like, why would they take you?
Okay, and why would you not call me the minute you got away from him?
'Cause I was terrified.
I still am, Steve.
He took a picture of me on his cell phone, and he told me that he's going to text his partner, and that when I land, this guy's going to text me instructions.
He did that to keep you scared and cooperating, you understand?
Well, it's working.
I can't believe
I'm in this mess now.
Steve, if I'm not on that plane in nine hours with the diamonds,
Angela's going to be killed.
That's not going to happen, Mary.
Because that plane took off half an hour ago.
You understand?
Which means we got nine hours to save your friend.
We'll find her, Mary, all right?
Hey.
We'll find her.
Okay?
We need to find this Angela.
- Yes.
If there really is an Angela.
- Danny, she's my sister.
I think I'd know if she was lying.
Okay.
All right, what are you getting at?
Listen to me.
I thought I knew my brother-- right?
-- and he lied to me, and now he's on the FBI Most Wanted list.
No offense, but I think I'm a little closer to my sister than you were to your brother.
Okay, so then you know she was arrested two months ago for drunk driving?
Wait a minute.
You ran background on my sister?
No, I didn't run background on your sister;
TSA did, and I am relaying information.
Okay, well, holding back the fact that she got arrested two months ago does not mean that she's lying to us today.
I'm not saying she's lying, maybe just not telling us the full story.
Okay, look, we're going to check that hotel room, then we're going to know more.
Until then, I'm going on the assumption that she's telling me the truth.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
So the room hasn't been serviced, so it should be in the same condition as when your sister checked out.
Well, so far, we have no signs of a forced entry, struggle, or a girl named Angela.
Okay, well, it doesn't mean it didn't happen and she doesn't exist, right?
The guy could have used the pass key.
Yeah, well, the hotel staff said that Mary was the only one issued with a room key, and nobody saw her with another woman.
But I did confirm that Mary has a co-worker named Angela Branson who flew in with her.
She's based out of New York and isn't due to fly out again for three days.
KONO:
And according to the hotel records, there was a room booked in her name, but she never actually checked in.
All right, well, good.
That's a good start.
We got any, uh...
got any other contact info?
The airline gave us her cell phone number, but it's just rolling straight to voicemail whenever we try it.
Well, if she'd been kidnapped, that would make sense, right?
Okay, are you trying to convince us or yourself?
Maybe a little of both.
(elevator bell dings) Okay.
We need to get a look at this security feed.
(computer trilling)
Okay, that's him.
That's the guy Mary described.
DANNY:
He's got Angela.
Stop.
Push in.
All right, so he brings Angela down the back way so no one can see him.
Danny, call Kono, have her pick Mary up from the TSA's custody, and drop her in my office, but tell her I want it done low-key.
For Angela's safety, we can't let anybody know that Mary and the diamonds didn't make that flight.
(tires squealing, engine revving)
Okay, okay!
Would you slow down, please?
Please!
We're not gonna be able to help anybody if we end up wrapped around a telephone pole.
That anonymous call about Mary and the diamonds... (tires squealing, engine revving) ...it doesn't add up.
There are a lot of things about this case that do not add up, and I apologize for not believing Mary's story, but please stop driving this car like it's stolen, and slow down!
Driving like I always do.
(engine revving, tires squealing)
Listen, whoever made the call to TSA about Mary had to have been a part of the smuggler's operation.
Right?
That's the only way that they would have known that Mary had the diamonds on her.
Okay, we don't know who made the call, but maybe Kono got a chance to enhance that video, and we will get an I.D. on her kidnapper.
Please slow down.
I'm asking you nicely.
I said please don't do it, please...
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
Thank you.
You okay?
Yeah.
All right.
Okay, Kono, tell me something good.
All right, well, the rest of the security videos don't show much.
They only have coverage of the stairwell, so there's no actual footage of anyone going in or out of that specific room.
But we got footage of Angela being dragged down the back stairwell.
What about the, uh, facial recognition thingie?
I already tried that.
The angles are bad.
There's not enough to get a complete scan.
Okay, uh, Chin, what about the origin of the diamonds?
I checked through Interpol.
There's no reports of any diamond shipments this size, either missing or stolen.
The good news is that Angela's safe as long as they believe that Mary and the diamonds are on that plane.
Well, I hate to be the one that states the obvious.
She is not on the plane, so, we're gonna have a big problem in about eight hours, when it lands.
Okay, maybe, maybe.
What do you mean?
I got plan-- it might be a goofy plan-- but what if, what if we get Mary and those diamonds on the governor's G-4?
In the next half an hour, we can beat that plane to New York.
When the guy there approaches her and takes possession of the diamonds, we snatch him for smuggling.
Very good.
Okay, and if we can flip him, then we can roll back and arrest whoever's holding Angela.
Okay, Kono, get the governor on the phone.
We need that plane ready, fueled to go in a half an hour.
Please call HPD, and tell them we need those diamonds here immediately.

Well, most people like to start the day off with some pleasantries, but not the new chief of detectives, huh?
You do know that that transport van contained evidence from a case we were working?
I've already been briefed on the kidnapping case.
The murder of my two cops trumps it-- come on.
DANNY:
Okay, listen to me...
OFFICER:
Detective Kelly?
...you do know that the only people who knew the diamonds were in that van were cops.
All right, so if you're gonna start looking for the hijacker, you start with HPD.
Hey, look, no way in hell.
I cleaned house.
I'll bet my job none of my guys are involved.
Hey, they just ran the plate on that semi.
It was reported stolen last night.
Okay, if they stole the semi truck last night, they already knew the diamonds were going to be seized today.
All right, who would have known something about that?
The guy who called in the anonymous tip on Mary.
But if they were always gonna steal the diamonds, why wouldn't they just snatch Mary when she arrived at the airport?
Because they were more afraid of the diamond smugglers than they were of us.
Let's make 'em worry about us.
KONO:
Mary, we need to determine who may have targeted you to smuggle those diamonds.
So, was there anyone new that either you or Angela had met?
Maybe an overfriendly passenger?
No.
Nobody.
How long have you known Angela?
We met a few months back at this yoga club in New York.
(phone chimes) And she's the one that helped me get this job.
Oh, my God.
This could be from the people that have Angela.
What do you mean?
Well, the kidnappers said
I was gonna get a text message from his guy in New York.
What does it say?
"When you land, walk directly to baggage carousel three.
"I'll be watching, so don't try and involve the cops, or your friend's... dead."
DANNY:
Good news is, they still have no idea
Mary didn't make that plane.
Yeah, looks like we got about five hours till they find out.
All right, when you get those diamonds, we can use them as a bargaining chip for Angela's life.
Hey, I've been thinking about these diamonds.
If these guys just came in possession of 20 million in ice, they need to move it through a broker.
If they are still on the island.
Yeah, but these guys killed two cops to get these stones, so they know we're watching everyone leaving the island.
The smartest thing these guys can do is to try and move those diamonds while they're still here.
Right, and as far as brokers go, there's only so many guys on the island that can handle this kind of weight.
Now this is a criminal file on a fence released from prison six months ago.
If there's a deal he'll have heard about it.
FRYER:
So, this guy's been off the radar since he finished serving his sentence six months ago.
You got new leverage on him?
Nothing.
No parole.

Doesn't mean he's not dirty.

We need to ask you a few questions.

You lie to me again, you're going straight back to jail.

That rule applies to citizens.
You stopped being one 30 years ago.
30 years...
Well, maybe you should talk to my attorney about what my rights are...
You finish making that call...
Yeah?
You are going to jail.
Either way, you're gonna answer my questions, because...
You-you can't I don't have time for your games.
MARCH:
No, no.
You understand me?
You understand me?
Yeah, well, I certainly won't answer your questions...
Excuse me.
Come on, Vince.
Why don't you pull it back a little bit?
All right?
This guy's done his time.
Why don't you just take it easy?
All right, I'm not holding nothing back, McGarrett.
I got two dead cops.
Two.
And I'm betting that this old man knows who's responsible, okay?
Now don't be fooled by the way he looks.
August March ran one of the largest smuggling networks in the world.
He was the fence for stolen art and gems.
Nothing moved on or off Honolulu without August March taking a piece of the action.
His operation and pipeline continued long after he was in prison for ordering the murder of two of his business associates.
They made the mistake of trusting him, and they got a bullet for it.
The man is a cold-blooded killer.
It's a very colorful, but less-than-accurate description of what I was convicted of.
Whatever crimes I committed in the past are just that.
The past!
Now, please leave me alone, or I'm gonna file a complaint!
Listen, there's a woman whose life is in danger.
All we need is a little bit of your time and some help with the smuggler that we're looking for, okay?
I'm sorry, but I don't do that anymore.
I've been on ice for 30 years.
I'm not in that business anymore.
Okay, but you do know people that are in that business, correct?
Yeah, I do, and unlike you guys, they take me at my word when I say I'm out.
STEVE:
All we're trying to do is prevent an innocent woman from being killed over the theft of a few lousy diamonds here.
This is about diamonds?
Yes.
Do you know anything about it?
I might.
But if I help you, you've got to give me your word that you'll never bother me again.
And nobody must know about my involvement.
You have my word.
MARCH:
Well...
I'm not just talking about you.
FRYER:
Look, you give me the guys that killed my men...
Yeah?
...you will never, never lay eyes on me again.
Fine.
Fine, fine, fine.
I got a call yesterday from a stranger.
I don't know who he is, nor who referred him to me.
But he said he wanted to fence... s-some diamonds.
Yeah, uh...
It's, it's the last number on there.
Maybe you can trace the number.
DANNY:
Okay.
Did I hear right, that your name's McGarrett?
Yeah.
There was a young officer named McGarrett who transported me to jail 30 years ago.
Any relation?
Yeah, that was my father.
Yeah.
No kidding.
Small world.
How's he doing?
He's dead.
Shame.
Sorry to hear that.
He was a good man.
I tried to offer him... $100,000 bribe that day.
A fortune at that time.
My father wasn't that kind of cop.
But there were plenty of cops around him who would've taken that money, right, Chief?
DANNY:
It's a pre-paid.
Can't trace it.
Thank you.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I tried.
I wish I could help you more.
Hey, look, you're not done.
You're not.
Call that guy back.
Set up a meet and let me grab him.
- Give him to me.
Just give him to me.
- No!
Come on.
That's a young man's game.
I'm too old for that kind of thing.
Come on.
This is probably the only chance we have to get this girl back safe.
This guy better show.
Plane lands in New York in less than four hours.
I got him.
STEVE:
I got a visual, 10:00.
Right now. 10:00.
DANNY:
He's strapped.
Butt of a gun sticking out of his shirt.
STEVE:
If March gets compromised, that guy pulls out that gun, every single one of these civilians is at risk here.
FRYER:
This guy's an old pro.
He'll do fine.
STEVE:
Let's hope your right.
August March?
Take a seat.
You're making the waiter nervous.
By yourself, right?
Because if not, anything happens, you're the first to get shot.
(laughs)
Relax, kid.
I'm here for one piece of business.
The only thing that's gonna happen here today, is you and me are gonna get rich.
Just remember, we wait for him to inspect the diamonds.
That's the arrest signal.
That is when we move in.
DARRYL:
You sure you can move this kind of weight?
Eh, don't worry.
I got the connections.
Whoever sent you to me knows that.
Good.
So what's the brokerage fee on 20 million worth?
Well, as I told you on the phone,
I can't say without seeing the quality of the product.
Y-You did bring all of the diamonds like I told you.
You didn't really think I'd be dumb enough to bring all of them, did you?
Nobody said you were dumb.
But... without seeing all of them
I can't estimate the overall quality of the product.
For all I know, you could've handpicked the best one.
I didn't.
Now!
Move out!
I've got 200 more of that same quality.
Now how much?
You say you're not dumb, but with what you've been handling lately, the moves you've been making,
I'm starting to think you are.
- Why's that?
- Killing cops?
In my day, we would've never done a thing like that.
Brings too much heat.
How'd you know about the cops?
(people screaming)
Nice shot, Fryer.
STEVE:
Trouble is now our only lead is dead.
You okay.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
I told your partner I was too old for this.
March was telling me he thinks he can identify where the diamonds are from.
Okay, that's good.
How?
Every diamond has a distinct marking.
If I could look at this stone this guy brought under a microscope,
I might be able to tell you something about it.
Okay, all right, good.
Take Mr. March over to Fong's, we have a microscope for you to look at, okay?
Fine, fine, fine.
I mean...
Now, look, I just did what I had to do, all right?
And besides, this guy matches the description of the evidence van hijacker, okay?
- Okay.
- Do we have a positive I.D.?
Yeah.
And it tells a whole lot.
Okay, what?
His name's Darryl Kaleo.
Brother of an ex-cop you put away last year for the murder of your ex-partner.
I know who he is.
Are you implying that he's involved with this?
Hey, look, he's capable of killing cops.
- He's also in prison.
- That's right.
He's in a life term.
Doesn't mean he's not behind this.
You think that he just orchestrated this whole thing?
From jail?
Why?
What does he get out of it?
Just helping his brother?
Doesn't make sense.
Why don't we pay him a visit and find out.
He's easy to find.
DANNY:
Life is pretty good here in the Protective Custody Wing, right?
One of the perks of being a cop.
Ex-cop.
You should be walking the main line with the rest of these lowlifes, and you know it.
My prior law enforcement work makes me a target.
Is there a reason you two are tossing my place or did you just miss me?
KALEO:
You two have no legal authority to be shaking me down.
This is harassment.
FRYER:
You're in prison.
Subject to search whenever and wherever.
Why are you really here?
I know you're looking for something.
Why bother lying?
Okay.
I will play along.
Your brother... he robbed a transport van, killed two cops.
FRYER:
You already know that, don't ya?
Huh?
Listen, Kaleo, we know that you helped set this thing up, and we are here to prove that-- that's what we're gonna do.
Be my guest.
Okay.
You know, Williams...
What?
You mentioning my brother makes me nostalgic about family.
You got a kid, right?
How's she doing, anyway?
My daughter is doing fine.
Thank you.
Your brother Darryl, on the other hand, he's not doing so good.
He's dead.
FRYER:
Hey.
Look what we got here.
Cell phone.
You planted that.
It ain't mine.
I'm sure your prints are gonna be all over it.
So tell me... is this how you arranged the transport van's hijacking?
It is, isn't it?
You got questions, run them by my lawyer.
Okay, no problem.
Listen, um,... (whispering):
you know, last time I saw you...
I broke a couple of bones in your face, right?
You ever mention my daughter again...
I promise you I'm gonna come back here,
I'm gonna break every single bone in your body, okay?
You understand?
(slaps Kaleo's back) Put him back in his cage.
MARCH:
Interesting.
This explains why these diamonds were never reported missing.
Based on quality,
I would say... that this stone comes from the Republic of Liberia.
Are you sure?
Things change.
I mean, you've been locked up for 30 years.
30 years, 13 million years, this is an allotrope of carbon formed at high pressure and high temperature conditions.
That never changes.
This stone, my dear, comes from Africa.
Which leads me to believe that is is probably... a conflict diamond.
Blood diamonds... sold on the black market, and used to finance civil wars and genocide on the Africa coast.
Have you ever done business with people from Liberia?
No, no.
But...
I'm a student of the game.
The game never changes.
Just the players do.
Well, then that would explain the kidnapper's accent.
Exactly.
And that's why, if I were you,
I would check out Liberians here on temporary visas.
Okay.
We really appreciate the help.
This at least gives us an idea of who's holding Angela.
I wish you luck.
And feel free to call on me anytime.
Bye.
Mr. March.
Hmm?
I'm gonna need that diamond back.
The diamond?
!
(laughs)
Here we go.
Can't blame a guy for trying.
CHIN:
All the outbound calls off of Kaleo's cell phone are to his brother Darryl... with the exception of this one.
Okay, who's this one to?
CHIN:
TSA security line.
Hey, look at the time stamp.
FRYER: 30 minutes before Mary was arrested.
So Kaleo made the call that got Mary arrested and the diamonds seized.
He told him the description of the van, the route, so they could hijack it.
But the part of the puzzle we don't have is how they know about the Liberian smuggling operation in the first place.
I reached out to TSA.
I worked up a list of Liberians that are on the island on temporary visas.
It's not extensive.
That's him.
Bottom left.
That's the guy that kidnapped Angela.
(beeping)
KONO:
Jordan Nevins.
He landed on the island three days ago.
Okay, well, it looks like he didn't lie on his TSA entry form.
Just confirmed he's staying in the penthouse suite.
Let's go pay him a visit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
Getting my vest.
No, I'll get your ve...
Uh, Chin?
Help him with the thing.
Hey, hey, Steve, come on over here a second.
What are you talking about?
What is that?
That was your birthday cake.
I was planning on taking it by the office.
Got sidetracked by this case.
Is that why you guys all stopped talking when I came in the office this morning?
Yeah.
Like usual, you figured out a way to ruin everything.
Thanks.
It's butter cream.
Butter cream's my favorite.
Move in!
Hey, hey!
I got Jordan.
Continue clearing.
All clear.
Bedroom's clear; no girl.
All right, where's Angela?
I-I don't know...
Hey!
Where's Angela?
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right, we'll see about that.
NEVINS:
I'm a Liberian citizen.
If you lay a finger on me,
I will have the consulate crawling so far up your...
That's a good idea.
And afterwards, I can tell your bosses that you lost their diamond shipment.
You seized some diamonds?
That look familiar?
It would take less than an hour for me to prepare a press release announcing the seizure of 20 million in conflict diamonds.
You know, it's funny, there's something about your body language right now that tells me that if that press release hits, you're gonna feel safer in here with us than you are out there on the street.
If I tell you everything, you gotta protect me and a promise of no deportation.
I'll be a dead man if you send me back to Liberia.
You got it.
Where's the girl?
(sighs)
I have no idea.
After our little charade at the hotel, we parted ways.
What are you talking about-- "charade"?
Angela faked her own kidnapping?
We didn't have a choice.
Angela was bumped from the flight at the last minute.
FRYER:
Let me guess, you had already told the people in New York the diamonds were on the flight.
I'm a facilitator.
I am paid to deliver the product to a buyer at a specific date and time.
And if that doesn't happen...
People like you get killed.
They had to, uh, use the other girl to make the drop as scheduled.
The other girl was my sister.
Did you know?
It was Angela's idea to scare her into doing it.
So, Angela and you worked together before?
NEVINS:
Yes.
She made several runs for me in the last few months, but nothing as large as this.
This is the first time for the both of us.
You've been played.
Angela probably set Mary up, so when the diamonds didn't get there, she wouldn't be blamed.
You and my sister Mary did.
No...
I doubt if Angela would...
double-cross me.
She's not smart enough to come up with something like this on her own.
Maybe she met somebody who was.
DANNY:
So, what was the plan?
You were gonna use your share of the dough to make an appeal?
Bribe a judge?
What?
It was worth a try.
Okay.
Where's Angela?
She's in the wind.
Where she lands, your guess is as good as mine.
Okay, how did she hook up with Darryl?
She's his ex-old lady.
She reached out to him with an opportunity to make a big score.
She just didn't want to get killed doing it.
And your brother turned to you for advice?
Advice?
Guess you could call it that.
I just figured a way for her and my brother to get rich.
All right, well, I'm gonna charge you with the death of those two cops.
What you just said, coupled with the phone records gives us enough-- more than enough-- to prove that you orchestrated the whole thing.
I'm doing life without, and there's no death penalty here in Hawaii.
Sorry to disappoint you, but another case is not going to make a difference to me.
That might be true, but since you've killed two more cops, you have lost your right to be housed in protective custody.
Isn't that true?
It is, it's true.
And (chuckles)...
believe me, uh, when you meet your new cell mate, life is going to get very interesting.
Wait, you can't do that.
Yes I can;
I just did.
Stand up.
Turn around, Sunshine.
Cuff him.
Hey... dead man walking.
(buzzer sounds)
♪ ♪
(sighs) I feel so stupid.
Mary, this happens to all of us.
I mean, people we think we can trust tell us lies.
I know, but I thought she was my friend.
Look, Angela's gonna resurface eventually.
She's gonna try to fence those diamonds.
And when she does, Interpol and the FBI are gonna be waiting for her.
It's only a matter of time, Mary.
She's on every country's watch list.
(quietly):
Wow.
All right, well, what-what now?
What about me?
You move on.
You pick yourself up.
You learn from your mistakes.
(sighs)
I honestly don't even know what to do with myself.
I...
I liked that job.
You know, I finally felt like
I was starting a new chapter in my life.
Well, you'll be happy to know that that chapter's still open for you.
What do you mean?
I spoke to the airline.
They know you're a victim in all this.
Your job's there if you want it.
It is?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
(sighs) I'm sorry.
Okay.

That's an awesome cake.
We were gonna jump out and yell surprise, but then we figured what's the use?
Well, you should never surprise a man who is armed and who has extensive close-quarter battle training, anyway.
Ah, that's good to keep in mind.
I will also remember that.
STEVE:
Wow.
Here you go, birthday boy.
DANNY:
Happy birthday, buddy.
Thank you.
Guys, listen, I think we should just face the fact, that I'm not that easy to surprise.
You know?
Surprise!
(laughter)
Better than butter cream, right?
No, I'm good, thank you.
Okay.
So, I'd never heard anything like it before.
They said salt cake, I said, "What's the plan?"
MARCH:
I'm delighted you reached out to me, Angela.
I didn't have many options.
But with your help, this actually worked out better than I hoped.
Your diamonds.
It's been a pleasure.
Oh, believe me, the pleasure's all mine.
But there's one more thing you need to learn about this type of business.
As I said before... never turn your back on the buyer.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
MAN:
Whoo!
Sorry, brah.
We're all good.
[MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Sorry.
Maybe I just don't get it.
In this island, you don't drop in on somebody else's wave.
It causes problems for other surfers.
That's just what happens.
Like everything else on this island, that makes zero sense.
Okay?
I saw a wave.
I rode it.
If anybody else wants to ride it, they're welcome.
No, you're wrong.
Okay?
If somebody's on the wave first, they own the wave.
They...
Oh.
Ho, whoa, whoa, ho.
You can't own a wave.
Not because you paddle faster than the next guy.
That's number one.
Number two, I told the guy I was coming down on his left.
I said, "Hey, buddy, I'm on the wave."
It's the Pacific Ocean.
Danny, it's not a bike path.
Okay.
Well, I think that the same rules should apply for any thoroughfare.
Take it from me, someone who's not born on this island and therefore was not raised with all the mumbo jumbo.
You can't own a wave.
While we're on the subject, Spam is not part of any food group that I care to recognize.
And last but not least, an appetizer should never, never, under any circumstances, be referred to as a pupu.
Hey.
There you guys are.
Heh.
- I didn't know your sister was in town.
- Neither did I.
Hi.
I've been looking for you two for over an hour.
You weren't home, so I figured I'd check your favorite little surf spot.
So here I am.
- Surprise.
- What are you doing here, Mary?
What does it look like I'm doing here?
It looks like you're, uh, going to a Halloween party dressed as a flight attendant.
Come on.
Seriously.
- You're working for the airlines?
MARY:
Yes.
It's the coolest job ever.
I started, like, two weeks ago.
And they gave me the Oahu-to-New York run.
I'm gonna be flying back and forth, like, twice a week.
We can hang out during my layovers.
How sweet is that?
- Pretty sweet.
MARY:
Heh-heh.
Right, huh?
Come here.
Hi.
- Come on.
- Hey.
DANNY:
Hey.
MARY:
Heh-heh.
- Pick up your board, Danny.
DANNY:
Mm.
McGARRETT:
Welcome.
MARY:
Good to see you.
So you guys are, like, surf buddies now, huh?
Uh, yeah.
Kind of.
So cute.
Heh.
Why didn't you call?
I could've picked you up.
Because I wanted to surprise you.
Look at him.
He's definitely surprised.
- Heh-heh-heh.
- In a good way.
In a good way.
So a stewardess, how exactly did that happen?
Uh, well, my friend, Angela, worked for the airlines, and she knew I needed a job, so here I am.
And by the way, we like to be called flight attendants.
I knew that.
I did.
Can I have a cup of coffee too?
Are you, uh, staying in town for a while?
[MOUTHS] Okay.
No, I'm working the return flight back to New York, so I gotta take a rain check on the coffee.
Well, wait, wait.
You just got here.
I have to go back to the hotel and freshen up before the flight.
So we'll catch up next time.
I have so much to tell you, but it's all good stuff, so don't worry.
I'm not worried.
I'm really happy for you.
Thank you.
All right, I'll see you guys in, like, three days.
- Okay.
MARY:
Bye.
- See you.
McGARRETT:
Bye, sis.
DANNY:
Excuse me.
- Yeah?
So we are kind of surf buddies now?
You sensitive right now?
Yeah, a little bit.
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]
[GUN COCKS THEN MARY GASPS]
Hello, Mary.
You've kept me waiting.
We need to talk.
[CHATTERING]
KONO:
No, no, no.
You said you could do it.
- Hey.
CHIN HO:
What's up, Steve?
- What's up?
- Hey.
- All right.
See you later.
- Okay.
What's up?
What was that?
What was what?
What did they just, uh...?
Why did they run out of here so quick?
- What were you talking about?
- What were we talking about?
I don't know.
Stuff.
General stuff.
What, uh...?
What, are you being paranoid now?
No.
This is not paranoia, Daniel.
This has been happening a lot lately.
You guys have been acting weird.
Oh, okay.
Well, I think you should relax maybe, and stop overanalyzing things.
Relax?
That's funny coming from you.
Okay.
Do what you wanna do.
Be paranoid.
Go nuts.
Let your mind play tricks on you.
Next thing you know, you're wearing a tinfoil hat, babbling about black helicopters.
Black helicopters are real.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
What do you mean they're real?
They're real.
This is McGarrett.
Is this a joke?
I'll be right there.
Mary's been arrested.
MYERS:
Commander McGarrett.
Thanks for your call.
Not a problem.
Earlier today, we got a tip on one of the unrecorded lines that a stewardess was planning on smuggling some contraband onto a New York-bound flight.
Okay.
All right.
This is crazy.
Mary's not a smuggler.
Are you sure you have the right person?
Commander McGarrett, your sister had about $20 million worth of diamonds duct-taped to her torso.
So, yeah, I think we got the right person.
- She say why she had the diamonds?
- No, she refused to talk to us.
That's why we called you.
She won't talk to anyone else.
Okay, you said you stopped her based on a tip.
Who gave it to you?
It was an anonymous tip, a male caller.
We tried to trace it, but he hung up too fast.
It was probably a prepaid cell anyway.
Is that unusual, to get a call out of the blue like that?
MYERS:
No, we get anonymous tips about drug mules all the time.
It's usually a rival group trying to put the competition out of business.
Listen, as a professional courtesy, I'd like to speak to my sister in private.
[CHATTERING]
What the hell happened?
[SIGHS]
I went straight to my hotel when I left you guys, and there was a man in my room with a gun.
Okay.
Have you ever seen this guy before?
No.
Don't think so.
- You don't think so?
- I know so.
I've never seen him before.
- You believe me, right?
- Of course I believe you, Mary.
Just slow down and tell me how you got away from this guy and how you ended up with these diamonds.
I didn't get away.
He taped the diamonds to me and he told me that Angela's dead if I don't do exactly what he says.
Okay.
Who's Angela?
- I told you about her, didn't I?
- I don't...
Maybe.
Just tell me again.
We work together as flight attendants.
We came from New York together.
Okay, so she was your friend before this?
Yes, we met at yoga class, like, three months ago.
You know, she's really, like, the only real friend that I have.
She helped me get this job.
Steve, I really screwed up.
If I'm not on that plane when it lands, she's gonna be killed.
Listen, Mary, just take a deep breath, okay?
And calm down, all right?
Tell me everything you know about this guy who took your friend.
That's the thing, I don't know anything about him, but he knew everything about me.
He was in my room waiting.
Okay.
Well, can you describe this guy to me?
Yeah.
He was tall, he had dark skin, he had a deep voice.
He had an accent.
It wasn't European, but similar.
You're positive you've never seen him before?
Yes, I'm positive.
I've never seen him, okay?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Because it's not adding up.
Do you understand?
I'm trying to put this thing together, but it doesn't make sense to me.
Like, why would they take you?
Okay?
Why would you not call me the minute you got away from him?
Because I was terrified.
I still am, Steve.
He took a picture of me on his cell phone.
And he told me that he's gonna text his partner.
And that when I land, this guy is gonna text me instructions.
He did that to keep you scared and cooperating.
Understand?
Well, it's working.
I can't believe I'm in this mess now.
Steve, if I'm not on that plane in nine hours with the diamonds,
Angela's gonna be killed.
That's not gonna happen, Mary.
Because that plane took off half an hour ago.
You understand?
Which means we got nine hours to save your friend.
We'll find her, Mary, all right?
Hey, we'll find her.
Okay?
We need to find this Angela.
DANNY:
Yes.
If there really is an Angela.
Danny, she's my sister.
I think I'd know if she was lying.
Okay.
- All right, what are you getting at?
- Listen, I thought I knew my brother.
And he lied to me, and now he's on the FBI Most Wanted list.
No offense, but I'm a little closer to my sister than you were to your brother.
Okay.
So then you know she was arrested two months ago for drunk driving?
Wait a minute.
You ran background on my sister?
No, I didn't run background on your sister.
TSA did.
I'm relaying information.
Okay, holding back the fact that she got arrested two months ago does not mean that she's lying to us.
I'm not saying she's lying.
Maybe just not telling us the full story.
We're gonna check that hotel room, then we're gonna know more.
Until then, I'm going on the assumption she's telling me the truth.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
So the room hasn't been serviced.
It should be in the same condition as when your sister checked out.
Yeah.
So far, we have no signs of a forced entry, struggle, or a girl named Angela.
Well, it doesn't mean it didn't happen and she doesn't exist.
The guy could've used a pass key.
The hotel staff said that Mary was the only one issued with the room key and nobody saw her with another woman.
But I did confirm that Mary has a coworker named Angela Branson who flew in with her.
She's based out of New York and isn't due to fly for three days.
According to the hotel records, there was a room booked in her name, but she never actually checked in.
All right, well, good.
That's a good start.
We got any other contact info?
The airline gave us her number, but it's just rolling straight to voice mail.
Well, if she'd been kidnapped, that would make sense, right?
Okay.
Are you trying to convince us or yourself?
Maybe a little of both.
Okay.
We need to get a look at the security feed.
[COMPUTER WHIRRS]
Okay, that's him.
That's the guy Mary described.
DANNY:
He's got Angela.
Stop and push in.
All right, so he brings Angela down the back way so no one can see him.
Danny, call Kono.
Have her pick Mary up from TSA's custody and drop her to my office.
I want it done low-key.
For Angela's safety, we can't let anybody know that Mary and the diamonds didn't make that flight.
[TIRES SCREECHING]
Okay.
Okay.
Would you slow down, please?
Please.
Not gonna be able to help anybody if we end up wrapped around a pole.
That anonymous call about Mary and the diamonds...
It doesn't add up.
There are things about this case that do not add up.
And I apologize for not believing Mary's story.
But please stop driving this car like it's stolen.
Slow down.
Driving like I always do.
[TIRES SCREECHING]
Listen, whoever made the call to TSA about Mary had to have been a part of the smuggler's operation, right?
That's the only way that they would have known that Mary had the diamonds on her.
Okay, we don't know who made the call.
Maybe Kono got a chance to enhance that video and we will get an ID on the kidnapper.
Slow down.
I'm asking you nicely.
I said, please.
Don't do it, please.
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
Thank you.
[CHATTERING]
- You okay?
- Yeah.
All right.
Okay, Kono.
Tell me something good.
All right, well, the rest of the security videos don't show much.
They only have coverage of the stairwell.
So there's no footage of anyone going in or out of that room.
We got the footage of Angela being dragged down the stairwell.
What about the, uh, facial recognition thingy?
I already tried that.
The angles are bad.
There's not enough to get a scan.
Chin, what about the origin of the diamonds?
I checked through Interpol.
No reports of any shipments this size, either missing or stolen.
The good news is that Angela's safe as long as they believe that Mary and the diamonds are on that plane.
I hate to be the one that states the obvious.
She is not on the plane.
We're gonna have a big problem in about eight hours when it lands.
Okay.
Maybe.
Maybe.
- What do you mean?
- I got a plan.
Might be a goofy plan.
But what if we get Mary and those diamonds on the governor's GIV.
In the next half an hour, we can beat that plane to New York.
When the guy there approaches her and takes the diamonds,
- we snatch him for smuggling.
- Bing.
Okay.
If we can flip him, then we can roll back,
- arrest whoever's holding Angela.
- Get the governor on the phone.
We need that plane ready, fueled to go in a half an hour.
Please call H.P.D. Tell them we need those diamonds here immediately.

You do know that that van contained evidence from a case we were working.
I've been briefed on the kidnapping case.
The murder of my two cops trumps it.
Come on.
MAN:
Detective Kelly?
DANNY:
Okay, listen to me.
The only people who knew the diamonds were in that van were cops.
So if you're gonna start looking for the hijack, you start with H.P.D.
Hey, look.
No way in hell.
I cleaned house.
I'll bet my job.
None of my guys are involved.
CHIN HO:
Hey, they just ran the plate on that semi.
It was reported stolen last night.
Okay, if they stole the semi truck last night, they already knew the diamonds were gonna be seized today.
Who would've known about that?
The guy who called in the anonymous tip on Mary.
If they were gonna steal the diamonds, why wouldn't they snatch Mary when she arrived at the airport?
Because they were more afraid of the diamond smugglers than they were of us.
Let's make them worry about us.
Mary, we need to determine who may have targeted you to smuggle those diamonds.
So was there anyone new that either you or Angela had met?
- Maybe an overfriendly passenger?
- No.
Nobody.
How long have you known Angela?
We met a few months back at this yoga club in New York.
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
She's the one that helped me get this job.
Oh, my God.
This could be from the people that have Angela.
- What do you mean?
- The kidnapper said
I was gonna get a text message from his guy in New York.
What does it say?
"When you land, walk directly to Baggage Carousel 3.
I'll be watching, so don't try to involve the cops or your friend's dead."
DANNY:
Good news is, they still have no idea Mary didn't make that plane.
Yeah, looks like we got about five hours till they find out.
We need to get those diamonds.
We can use them as a bargaining chip for Angela's life.
FRYER:
Hey.
I've been thinking about these diamonds.
If these guys just came in possession of 20 million in ice,
- they need to move it through a broker.
- If they're on the island.
But these guys killed two cops to get these stones.
They know we're watching everyone leaving the island.
The smartest thing these guys can do is move those diamonds
- while they're here.
FRYER:
Right.
As far as brokers go, there's only so many guys on the island that could handle this.
Now, this is the criminal file on a fence released from prison six months ago.
If there's a deal this big going down, he'll have heard about it.
FRYER:
This guy's been off the radar since he finished serving his sentence six months ago.
- Got any leverage on him?
- No parole.
Did his full 30-year term.
Docked his tail.
Doesn't mean he's not dirty.
In my experience, once a crook, you are always a crook.
FRYER:
I agree.
[BANGING ON DOOR]
August March, H.P.D. We need to ask you a few questions.
You're not...
Nobody here by that name.
Have you tried next door?
You lie to me again, you're going straight back to jail.
You know, last time I checked, you needed a man's invitation to walk into his house.
That rule applies to citizens.
You stopped being one 30 years ago.
Thirty year...
Oh.
Maybe you should talk to my attorney about what my rights are.
- You finish making that call, MARCH:
Yeah?
You are going to jail.
- You're gonna answer my questions.
- You can't...
FRYER:
I don't have time for your games.
You understand me?
- Yeah.
I won't answer your questions.
- What?
Fryer, Fryer.
Would you excuse me?
Come with me.
Why don't you pull it back a minute?
This guy has done his time.
Why don't you just take it easy?
All right.
I'm not holding nothing back, McGarrett.
I got two dead cops.
Two.
And I'm betting that this old man knows who's responsible.
Okay?
Now, don't be fooled by the way he looks.
August March ran one of the largest smuggling networks in the world.
He was the fence for stolen art and gems.
Nothing moved on or off Oahu without August March taking a piece of the action.
His operation and pipeline continued long after he was imprisoned for ordering the murder of two of his business associates.
They made the mistake of trusting him, and they got a bullet for it.
The man is a cold-blooded killer.
That's a very colorful, but less than accurate description of what I was convicted of.
Whatever crimes I committed in the past are just that.
The past.
Now, please leave me alone or I'm gonna file a complaint.
Listen, there's a woman whose life is in danger.
All we need is a little bit of your time and some help with a smuggler that we're looking for, okay?
I'm sorry, but I don't do that anymore.
I've been on ice for 30 years.
I'm not in that business anymore.
But you do know people that are in that business, correct?
MARCH:
Yeah, I do.
And unlike you guys, they take me at my word when I say I'm out.
All we're trying to do is prevent an innocent woman from being killed over the theft of a few lousy diamonds here.
This is about diamonds?
Yes.
Do you know anything about it?
I might.
But if I help you, you've got to give me your word that you'll never bother me again.
And nobody must know about my involvement.
You have my word.
I'm not just talking about you.
FRYER:
Look, you give me the guys that killed my men,
MARCH:
Yeah?
- You will never, never lay eyes on me again.
Fine, fine, fine.
I got a call yesterday from a stranger.
I don't know who he is, nor who referred him to me.
But he said he wanted to fence some diamonds.
Uh...
It's the last number on there.
Maybe you can trace the number.
DANNY:
Okay.
Did I hear right,
- that your name is McGarrett?
- Yeah.
MARCH:
There was a young officer named McGarrett who transported me to jail 30 years ago.
Any relation?
Yeah, that was my father.
Yeah.
MARCH:
Ah, no kidding.
McGARRETT:
No kidding.
Small world.
How's he doing?
- He's dead.
MARCH:
Shame.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He was a good man.
I tried to offer him a $100,000 bribe that day.
A fortune at that time.
My father wasn't that kind of cop.
MARCH:
But there were plenty of cops around him who would've taken that money, right, chief?
It's a pre-paid.
Can't trace it.
- Thank you, though.
- I'm sorry.
I tried.
I wish I could help you more.
Hey, look.
You're not done.
You're not.
Call that guy back.
Set up a meet and let me grab him.
- Give him to me.
Give him to me.
- No.
- Come on.
MARCH:
That's a young man's game.
I'm too old for that kind of thing.
Come on.
This is probably the only chance we have to get this girl back safe.
[CHATTERING]
This guy better show.
The plane lands in New York in less than four hours.
I got him.
I got a visual, 10 o'clock.
Right now, 10 o'clock.
DANNY:
He's strapped.
See the butt of a gun sticking out of his shirt.
If March gets compromised, that guy pulls out that gun, every single one of these civilians is at risk here.
This guy is an old pro.
He'll do fine.
McGARRETT [OVER RADIO]:
I hope you're right.
WAITER:
That's our special.
August March?
Take a seat.
You're making the waiter nervous.
You're by yourself, right?
Because if not, anything happens, you're the first to get shot.
[CHUCKLES]
Relax, kid.
I'm here for one piece of business.
The only thing that's gonna happen here is you and me are gonna get rich.
Just remember, we wait for him to inspect the diamonds.
That's the arrest signal.
That is when we move in.
You sure you can move this kind of weight?
Oh, don't worry.
I got the connections.
Whoever sent you to me knows that.
Good.
So, what's the brokerage fee on 20 million worth?
Well, it's...
As I told you on the phone,
I can't say without seeing the quality of the product.
You did bring all of the diamonds like I told you to?
You didn't really think I'd be dumb enough to bring all of them, did you?
Nobody said you were dumb.
But without seeing all of them,
I can't estimate the overall quality of the product.
For all I know,
- you could've handpicked the best.
- I didn't.
McGARRETT:
Let's go.
Move out.
I've got 200 more that same quality.
Now, how much?
You say you're not dumb, but with what you've been handling lately, the moves you've been making, I'm starting to think you are.
Why is that?
Killing cops.
In my day, we would never have done a thing like that.
Brings too much heat.
How'd you know about the cops?
MARCH:
Wait.
[CHATTERING]
Nice shot, Fryer.
Trouble is, now our only lead is dead.
[SIREN WAILING]
Hey.
You okay?
I should have kept my mouth shut.
I told your partner I was too old for this.
March thinks he can identify where the diamond's from.
Okay, that's good.
How?
Every diamond has a distinct marking.
If I could look at this stone this guy brought under a microscope,
I might be able to tell you something about it.
Okay.
All right.
Good.
Uh, take Mr. March over to Fong's.
We have a microscope for you to look at.
Fine, fine, fine.
- I mean...
- I just did what I had to do, all right?
This guy matches the description of the evidence-van hijacker, okay?
- Okay.
Do we have a positive ID?
- Yeah.
And that tells a whole lot.
- Okay, what?
- His name's Darryl Kaleo.
Brother of an ex-cop you put away last year for the murder of your ex-partner.
I know who he is.
Are you implying he's involved with this?
- Okay, he's capable of killing cops.
- He's also in prison.
Right.
He's doing a life term.
Doesn't mean he's not behind this.
You think that he just orchestrated this whole thing from jail?
What does he get out of it?
Helping his brother?
Doesn't make sense.
Why don't we pay him a visit and find out?
He's easy to find.
Oh, life is pretty good here on the protective custody wing, right?
One of the perks of being a cop.
- Ah.
- Ex-cop.
You should be walking the main line with the rest of these lowlifes, and you know it.
My prior law enforcement work makes me a target.
Is there a reason you two are tossing my place?
Or did you just miss me?
You two have no legal authority to be shaking me down.
- This is harassment.
FRYER:
You're in prison.
You're subject to search whenever and wherever.
Why are you really here?
I know you're looking for something.
Why bother lying?
Okay.
I will play along.
Your brother, he robbed a transport van, killed two cops.
You already know that, don't you?
Huh?
Listen, Kaleo, we know that you helped set this thing up.
And we are here to prove that.
That's what we're gonna do.
Be my guest.
- You know, Williams...
- What?
You mentioning my brother makes me nostalgic about family.
You got a kid, right?
How's she doing, anyway?
My daughter is doing fine.
Thank you.
Your brother, Darryl, on the other hand, he's not doing so good.
He's dead.
FRYER:
Hey.
Look what we got here.
- A cell phone.
- You planted that.
It ain't mine.
FRYER:
Heh.
- Your prints are gonna be all over it.
So tell me, is this how you arranged the transport van's hijacking?
It is, isn't it?
You got questions, run them by my lawyer.
Okay.
No problem.
Listen, uh, you know the last time I saw you,
I broke a couple bones in your face, right?
You ever mention my daughter again,
I promise you I'm gonna come back here.
I'm gonna break every single bone in your body, okay?
You understand?
Put him back in his cage.
[BELL RINGS]
MARCH:
Interesting.
This explains why these diamonds were never reported missing.
Based on quality,
I would say that this stone comes from the Republic of Liberia.
Are you sure?
Because things change.
You've been locked up for 30 years.
Thirty years, 13 million years.
This is an allotrope of carbon formed at high pressure and high temperature conditions.
That never changes.
And this stone, my dear, comes from Africa, which leads me to believe that this is probably a conflict diamond.
Blood diamonds, sold on the black market and used to finance civil wars and genocide on the Africa coast.
Have you ever done business with people from Liberia?
No.
No.
But I'm a student of the game.
The game never changes, just the players do.
Well, that would explain the kidnapper's accent.
Exactly.
And that's why, if I were you,
I would check out Liberians here on temporary visas.
Okay.
We really appreciate the help.
This at least gives us an idea of who's holding Angela.
Well, I wish you luck.
And feel free to call on me anytime.
Bye.
- Mr. March?
- Hm?
I'm gonna need that diamond back.
The diamond?
[GASPS]
Here we go.
Can't blame a guy for trying.
CHIN HO:
All the outbound calls off of Kaleo's cell phone are to his brother Darryl, with the exception of this one.
- Okay, who is this one to?
CHIN HO:
TSA security line.
Hey.
Look at the time stamp.
Thirty minutes before Mary was arrested.
So Kaleo made the call that got Mary arrested and the diamonds seized.
Called his brother, he told him the description of the van,
- the route, so they could hijack it.
- Part of the puzzle we don't have is how they know about the Liberian smuggling operation.
I reached out to TSA.
I worked up a list of Liberians that are on the island on temporary visas.
It's not extensive.
That's him.
Bottom left.
That's the guy that kidnapped Angela.
Jordan Nevins.
He landed on the island three days ago.
Okay, well, it looks like he didn't lie on his TSA entry form.
He's staying in the penthouse suite.
Well, let's go pay him a visit.
DANNY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, oh.
- What are you doing?
- Getting my vest.
I'll get your ve...
Chin, help him with the thing.
Hey, hey, Steve.
Come over here a second.
- The thing, would you?
- What are you talking about?
What is that?
That was your birthday cake.
I was planning on taking it by the office.
We got sidetracked by this case.
That why you guys stopped talking when I came into the office?
Yeah.
Like usual, you figured out a way to ruin everything.
Thanks.
Buttercream.
Buttercream's my favorite.
CHIN HO:
Move in.
- Hey, hey.
Got Jordan.
Continue clearing.
All clear.
Bedroom's clear.
No girl.
- All right, where's Angela?
- I don't know...
Hey.
Where's Angela?
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right, we'll see about that.
JORDAN:
I'm a Liberian citizen.
If you lay a finger on me, I will have the consulate crawling so far...
That's a good idea.
Afterwards, they can tell your bosses that you lost their diamond shipment.
You seized some diamonds?
McGARRETT:
That look familiar?
FRYER:
It'll take less than an hour for me to prepare a press release announcing the seizure of 20 million in conflict diamonds.
You know what's funny?
Something about your body language that tells me that if that press release hits, you're gonna feel safer in here with us than you are out there on the street.
If I tell you everything, you've got to protect me and a promise of no deportation.
I'll be a dead man if you send me back to Liberia.
You got it.
Where's the girl?
I have no idea.
After our little charade at the hotel, we parted ways.
McGARRETT:
Whoa.
What are you talking about, "charade"?
Angela faked her own kidnapping?
We didn't have a choice.
Angela was bumped from the flight at the last minute.
Let me guess.
You had already told the people in New York the diamonds were on the flight.
I'm a facilitator.
I am paid to deliver the product to a buyer at a specific date and time.
And if that doesn't happen...
People like you get killed.
I had to, uh, use the other girl to make the drop as scheduled.
The other girl was my sister.
Did you know that?
It was Angela's idea to scare her into doing it.
So Angela and you worked together before?
Yes, she made several runs for me in the last few months.
But nothing as large as this.
This is the first time for the both of us.
You've been played.
Angela probably set Mary up, so when the diamonds didn't get there, she wouldn't be blamed.
You and my sister, Mary, did.
No.
I doubt if Angela would double-cross me.
She's not smart enough to come up with something like this on her own.
Maybe she met somebody that was.
What was the plan?
You were gonna use your share of the dough to make an appeal?
Bribe a judge?
What?
It was worth a try.
- Okay, where's Angela?
KALEO:
She's in the wind.
Where she lands, your guess is as good as mine.
Okay, how did she hook up with Darryl?
She's his ex-old lady.
She reached out to him with an opportunity to make a big score.
She just didn't wanna get killed doing it.
And your brother turned to you for advice.
Advice?
I guess you could call it that.
I just figured a way for her and my brother to get rich.
[DANNY CHUCKLES]
All right.
Well, I'm gonna charge you with the death of those two cops.
Uh, what you just said, coupled with the phone records, is enough...
More than enough to prove that you orchestrated the whole thing.
[CHUCKLES]
I'm doing life without.
And there's no death penalty here in Hawaii.
Sorry to disappoint you, but another case is not gonna make a difference to me.
That might be true.
But since you've killed two more cops, you have lost your right to be housed in protective custody.
Isn't that true?
DANNY:
It is.
It's true.
And, heh-heh-heh, believe me, uh, when you meet your new cellmate, life is going to get very interesting.
Wait, you can't do that.
Yes, I can.
I just did.
Stand up.

She's gonna try to fence those diamonds.
And when she does, Interpol and the FBI are gonna be waiting for her.
It's only a matter of time, Mary.
She's on every country's watch list.
Yeah.
All right, well, what...?

- Yeah, really.
Oh...

- You're welcome.

Okay.

- Heh.
I will also remember that.

Hey!
There you guys are.
I didn't know your sister was in town.
- Neither did I.
- Hi.
I've been looking for you two for over an hour.
You weren't home, so I figured
I'd check your favorite little surf spot.
So here I am.
Surprise.
What are you doing here, Mary?
What does it look like I'm doing here?
It looks like you're, uh, going to a Halloween party dressed as a flight attendant.
Come on.
Seriously.
You're working for the airlines?
Yes!
It's the coolest job ever.
I started like two weeks ago, and they gave me the Oahu to New York run.
I'm going to be flying back and forth like twice a week.
We can hang out during my layovers.
How sweet is that?
Pretty sweet.
Right?
Huh?
Come here.
Hi.
Come on.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Pick up your board, Danny.
Come on.
Pick it up!
So... so, you guys are, like, surf buddies now, huh?
Uh, yeah, kind of.
So cute.
Why didn't you call me?
I could've picked you up from the airport.
'Cause I wanted to surprise you.
DANNY:
Look at him.
He's definitely surprised.
STEVE:
In a good way.
In a good way.
So a stewardess.
How exactly did that happen?
Uh, well, my friend Angela worked for the airlines, and she knew I needed a job, so here I am.
And, by the way, we like to be called flight attendants.
DANNY:
I knew that.
I did, actually.
Can I have a cup of coffee, too?
Are you, uh...
are you staying in town for a while?
Actually, no.
I'm working the return flight back to New York, so I got to take a rain check on the coffee.
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You just got here.
I know, but I have to go back to the hotel and freshen up before the flight.
So we'll catch up next time.
I have so much to tell you.
But it's all good stuff, so don't worry.
I'm not worried.
I'm really happy for you.
Thank you.

This is McGarrett.
Is this a joke?
I'll be right there.
Mary's been arrested.
Commander McGarrett.
- Thanks for your call.
- Not a problem.
Earlier today, we got a tip on one of the unrecorded lines that a stewardess was planning on smuggling some contraband onto a New York bound flight.
Okay, all right, this is crazy.
Mary's not a smuggler.
Are you sure you have the right person?
Commander McGarrett, your sister had about $20 million worth of diamonds duct-taped to her torso, so, yeah, I think we got the right person.
Did she say why she had the diamonds?
She refused to talk to us.
That's why we called you.
She won't talk to anyone else.
Okay, you said you stopped her based on a tip.
- Who gave it to you?
- It was an anonymous tip.
A male caller.
We tried to trace it, but he hung up too fast.
It was probably a prepaid cell anyway.
And is that unusual-- to get a call out of the blue like that?
No.
We get anonymous tips about drug mules all the time.
It's usually a rival group trying to put the competition out of business.
All right, listen, as a professional courtesy,
I'd like to speak to my sister in private.
What the hell happened?
I went straight to my hotel when I left you guys, and there was a man in my room with a gun.
Okay.
Have you ever seen this guy before?
No.
Don't think so.
- You don't think so?
- No, I-I know so.
I've never seen him before.
You believe me, right?
Of course, I believe you.
Mary, just slow down.
And tell me how you got away from this guy and how you ended up with these diamonds.
I didn't get away.
He taped the diamonds to me, and he told me that Angela's dead if I don't do exactly what he says.
Okay, who's Angela?
I told you about her, didn't I?
I don't... maybe.
Just tell me again.
We work together as flight attendants.
We came from New York together.
Okay, so she was your friend before this?
Yes.
We met at yoga class, like, three months ago.
I mean, she's really, like, the only real friend that I have.
She helped me get this job.
Steve, I really screwed up.
If I'm not on that plane when it lands, she's going to be killed.
Listen, Mary, just take a deep breath, okay, and calm down, all right?
Now, tell me everything you know about this guy who took your friend.
That's the thing, is I don't know anything about him, but he knew everything about me.
He was in my room waiting.
Okay, well, can you describe this guy to me?
Yeah.
He was tall.
He had dark skin.
He had a deep voice.
He had an accent.
Wasn't European, but similar.
You're positive you've never seen him before?
Yes, I'm positive.
I've never seen him, okay?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Because it's not adding up, Mary.
You understand?
Like, I'm trying to put this thing together, but it doesn't... it doesn't make sense to me.
Like, why would they take you?
Okay, and why would you not call me the minute you got away from him?
'Cause I was terrified.
I still am, Steve.
He took a picture of me on his cell phone, and he told me that he's going to text his partner, and that when I land, this guy's going to text me instructions.
He did that to keep you scared and cooperating, you understand?
Well, it's working.
I can't believe
I'm in this mess now.
Steve, if I'm not on that plane in nine hours with the diamonds,
Angela's going to be killed.
That's not going to happen, Mary.
Because that plane took off half an hour ago.
You understand?
Which means we got nine hours to save your friend.
We'll find her, Mary, all right?
Hey.
We'll find her.
Okay?
We need to find this Angela.
- Yes.
If there really is an Angela.
- Danny, she's my sister.
I think I'd know if she was lying.
Okay.
All right, what are you getting at?
Listen to me.
I thought I knew my brother-- right?
-- and he lied to me, and now he's on the FBI Most Wanted list.
No offense, but I think I'm a little closer to my sister than you were to your brother.
Okay, so then you know she was arrested two months ago for drunk driving?
Wait a minute.
You ran background on my sister?
No, I didn't run background on your sister;
TSA did, and I am relaying information.
Okay, well, holding back the fact that she got arrested two months ago does not mean that she's lying to us today.
I'm not saying she's lying, maybe just not telling us the full story.
Okay, look, we're going to check that hotel room, then we're going to know more.
Until then, I'm going on the assumption that she's telling me the truth.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
So the room hasn't been serviced, so it should be in the same condition as when your sister checked out.
Well, so far, we have no signs of a forced entry, struggle, or a girl named Angela.
Okay, well, it doesn't mean it didn't happen and she doesn't exist, right?
The guy could have used the pass key.
Yeah, well, the hotel staff said that Mary was the only one issued with a room key, and nobody saw her with another woman.
But I did confirm that Mary has a co-worker named Angela Branson who flew in with her.
She's based out of New York and isn't due to fly out again for three days.
KONO:
And according to the hotel records, there was a room booked in her name, but she never actually checked in.
All right, well, good.
That's a good start.
We got any, uh...
got any other contact info?
The airline gave us her cell phone number, but it's just rolling straight to voicemail whenever we try it.
Well, if she'd been kidnapped, that would make sense, right?
Okay, are you trying to convince us or yourself?
Maybe a little of both.
(elevator bell dings) Okay.
We need to get a look at this security feed.
(computer trilling)
Okay, that's him.
That's the guy Mary described.
DANNY:
He's got Angela.
Stop.
Push in.
All right, so he brings Angela down the back way so no one can see him.
Danny, call Kono, have her pick Mary up from the TSA's custody, and drop her in my office, but tell her I want it done low-key.
For Angela's safety, we can't let anybody know that Mary and the diamonds didn't make that flight.
(tires squealing, engine revving)
Okay, okay!
Would you slow down, please?
Please!
We're not gonna be able to help anybody if we end up wrapped around a telephone pole.
That anonymous call about Mary and the diamonds... (tires squealing, engine revving) ...it doesn't add up.
There are a lot of things about this case that do not add up, and I apologize for not believing Mary's story, but please stop driving this car like it's stolen, and slow down!
Driving like I always do.
(engine revving, tires squealing)
Listen, whoever made the call to TSA about Mary had to have been a part of the smuggler's operation.
Right?
That's the only way that they would have known that Mary had the diamonds on her.
Okay, we don't know who made the call, but maybe Kono got a chance to enhance that video, and we will get an I.D. on her kidnapper.
Please slow down.
I'm asking you nicely.
I said please don't do it, please...
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
Thank you.
You okay?
Yeah.
All right.
Okay, Kono, tell me something good.
All right, well, the rest of the security videos don't show much.
They only have coverage of the stairwell, so there's no actual footage of anyone going in or out of that specific room.
But we got footage of Angela being dragged down the back stairwell.
What about the, uh, facial recognition thingie?
I already tried that.
The angles are bad.
There's not enough to get a complete scan.
Okay, uh, Chin, what about the origin of the diamonds?
I checked through Interpol.
There's no reports of any diamond shipments this size, either missing or stolen.
The good news is that Angela's safe as long as they believe that Mary and the diamonds are on that plane.
Well, I hate to be the one that states the obvious.
She is not on the plane, so, we're gonna have a big problem in about eight hours, when it lands.
Okay, maybe, maybe.
What do you mean?
I got plan-- it might be a goofy plan-- but what if, what if we get Mary and those diamonds on the governor's G-4?
In the next half an hour, we can beat that plane to New York.
When the guy there approaches her and takes possession of the diamonds, we snatch him for smuggling.
Very good.
Okay, and if we can flip him, then we can roll back and arrest whoever's holding Angela.
Okay, Kono, get the governor on the phone.
We need that plane ready, fueled to go in a half an hour.
Please call HPD, and tell them we need those diamonds here immediately.
FEMALE DISPATCHER (over radio):
42-30?
42-30, come in.
Go for 42-30.
Per the watch commander, start heading towards Iolani Palace for an evidence transfer..
See Detective Williams 42-30.
Copy that.
Evidence transfer?
What the hell's that about?
(tires squealing, engine revving)
Hey.
Hey, look, just so there's no confusion, this is HPD's handle, not Five-O's.
Well, most people like to start the day off with some pleasantries, but not the new chief of detectives, huh?
You do know that that transport van contained evidence from a case we were working?
I've already been briefed on the kidnapping case.
The murder of my two cops trumps it-- come on.
DANNY:
Okay, listen to me...
OFFICER:
Detective Kelly?
...you do know that the only people who knew the diamonds were in that van were cops.
All right, so if you're gonna start looking for the hijacker, you start with HPD.
Hey, look, no way in hell.
I cleaned house.
I'll bet my job none of my guys are involved.
Hey, they just ran the plate on that semi.
It was reported stolen last night.
Okay, if they stole the semi truck last night, they already knew the diamonds were going to be seized today.
All right, who would have known something about that?
The guy who called in the anonymous tip on Mary.
But if they were always gonna steal the diamonds, why wouldn't they just snatch Mary when she arrived at the airport?
Because they were more afraid of the diamond smugglers than they were of us.
Let's make 'em worry about us.
KONO:
Mary, we need to determine who may have targeted you to smuggle those diamonds.
So, was there anyone new that either you or Angela had met?
Maybe an overfriendly passenger?
No.
Nobody.
How long have you known Angela?
We met a few months back at this yoga club in New York.
(phone chimes) And she's the one that helped me get this job.
Oh, my God.
This could be from the people that have Angela.
What do you mean?
Well, the kidnappers said
I was gonna get a text message from his guy in New York.
What does it say?
"When you land, walk directly to baggage carousel three.
"I'll be watching, so don't try and involve the cops, or your friend's... dead."
DANNY:
Good news is, they still have no idea
Mary didn't make that plane.
Yeah, looks like we got about five hours till they find out.
All right, when you get those diamonds, we can use them as a bargaining chip for Angela's life.
Hey, I've been thinking about these diamonds.
If these guys just came in possession of 20 million in ice, they need to move it through a broker.
If they are still on the island.
Yeah, but these guys killed two cops to get these stones, so they know we're watching everyone leaving the island.
The smartest thing these guys can do is to try and move those diamonds while they're still here.
Right, and as far as brokers go, there's only so many guys on the island that can handle this kind of weight.
Now this is a criminal file on a fence released from prison six months ago.
If there's a deal he'll have heard about it.
FRYER:
So, this guy's been off the radar since he finished serving his sentence six months ago.
You got new leverage on him?
Nothing.
No parole.
Did his full 30-year term, dropped his tail.
Doesn't mean he's not dirty.
In my experience, once a crook, you are always a crook.
I agree.
(knocking on door)
August March.
HPD.
We need to ask you a few questions.
Nobody here by that name.
Have you tried next door?
You lie to me again, you're going straight back to jail.
You know, last time I checked, you needed a man's invitation to walk into his house.
That rule applies to citizens.
You stopped being one 30 years ago.
30 years...
Well, maybe you should talk to my attorney about what my rights are...
You finish making that call...
Yeah?
You are going to jail.
Either way, you're gonna answer my questions, because...
You-you can't I don't have time for your games.
MARCH:
No, no.
You understand me?
You understand me?
Yeah, well, I certainly won't answer your questions...
Excuse me.
Come on, Vince.
Why don't you pull it back a little bit?
All right?
This guy's done his time.
Why don't you just take it easy?
All right, I'm not holding nothing back, McGarrett.
I got two dead cops.
Two.
And I'm betting that this old man knows who's responsible, okay?
Now don't be fooled by the way he looks.
August March ran one of the largest smuggling networks in the world.
He was the fence for stolen art and gems.
Nothing moved on or off Honolulu without August March taking a piece of the action.
His operation and pipeline continued long after he was in prison for ordering the murder of two of his business associates.
They made the mistake of trusting him, and they got a bullet for it.
The man is a cold-blooded killer.
It's a very colorful, but less-than-accurate description of what I was convicted of.
Whatever crimes I committed in the past are just that.
The past!
Now, please leave me alone, or I'm gonna file a complaint!
Listen, there's a woman whose life is in danger.
All we need is a little bit of your time and some help with the smuggler that we're looking for, okay?
I'm sorry, but I don't do that anymore.
I've been on ice for 30 years.
I'm not in that business anymore.
Okay, but you do know people that are in that business, correct?
Yeah, I do, and unlike you guys, they take me at my word when I say I'm out.
STEVE:
All we're trying to do is prevent an innocent woman from being killed over the theft of a few lousy diamonds here.
This is about diamonds?
Yes.
Do you know anything about it?
I might.
But if I help you, you've got to give me your word that you'll never bother me again.
And nobody must know about my involvement.
You have my word.
MARCH:
Well...
I'm not just talking about you.
FRYER:
Look, you give me the guys that killed my men...
Yeah?
...you will never, never lay eyes on me again.
Fine.
Fine, fine, fine.
I got a call yesterday from a stranger.
I don't know who he is, nor who referred him to me.
But he said he wanted to fence... s-some diamonds.
Yeah, uh...
It's, it's the last number on there.
Maybe you can trace the number.
DANNY:
Okay.
Did I hear right, that your name's McGarrett?
Yeah.
There was a young officer named McGarrett who transported me to jail 30 years ago.
Any relation?
Yeah, that was my father.
Yeah.
No kidding.
Small world.
How's he doing?
He's dead.
Shame.
Sorry to hear that.
He was a good man.
I tried to offer him... $100,000 bribe that day.
A fortune at that time.
My father wasn't that kind of cop.
But there were plenty of cops around him who would've taken that money, right, Chief?
DANNY:
It's a pre-paid.
Can't trace it.
Thank you.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I tried.
I wish I could help you more.
Hey, look, you're not done.
You're not.
Call that guy back.
Set up a meet and let me grab him.
- Give him to me.
Just give him to me.
- No!
Come on.
That's a young man's game.
I'm too old for that kind of thing.
Come on.
This is probably the only chance we have to get this girl back safe.
This guy better show.
Plane lands in New York in less than four hours.
I got him.
STEVE:
I got a visual, 10:00.
Right now. 10:00.
DANNY:
He's strapped.
Butt of a gun sticking out of his shirt.
STEVE:
If March gets compromised, that guy pulls out that gun, every single one of these civilians is at risk here.
FRYER:
This guy's an old pro.
He'll do fine.
STEVE:
Let's hope your right.
August March?
Take a seat.
You're making the waiter nervous.
By yourself, right?
Because if not, anything happens, you're the first to get shot.
(laughs)
Relax, kid.
I'm here for one piece of business.
The only thing that's gonna happen here today, is you and me are gonna get rich.
Just remember, we wait for him to inspect the diamonds.
That's the arrest signal.
That is when we move in.
DARRYL:
You sure you can move this kind of weight?
Eh, don't worry.
I got the connections.
Whoever sent you to me knows that.
Good.
So what's the brokerage fee on 20 million worth?
Well, as I told you on the phone,
I can't say without seeing the quality of the product.
Y-You did bring all of the diamonds like I told you.
You didn't really think I'd be dumb enough to bring all of them, did you?
Nobody said you were dumb.
But... without seeing all of them
I can't estimate the overall quality of the product.
For all I know, you could've handpicked the best one.
I didn't.
Now!
Move out!
I've got 200 more of that same quality.
Now how much?
You say you're not dumb, but with what you've been handling lately, the moves you've been making,
I'm starting to think you are.
- Why's that?
- Killing cops?
In my day, we would've never done a thing like that.
Brings too much heat.
How'd you know about the cops?
(people screaming)
Nice shot, Fryer.
STEVE:
Trouble is now our only lead is dead.
You okay.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
I told your partner I was too old for this.
March was telling me he thinks he can identify where the diamonds are from.
Okay, that's good.
How?
Every diamond has a distinct marking.
If I could look at this stone this guy brought under a microscope,
I might be able to tell you something about it.
Okay, all right, good.
Take Mr. March over to Fong's, we have a microscope for you to look at, okay?
Fine, fine, fine.
I mean...
Now, look, I just did what I had to do, all right?
And besides, this guy matches the description of the evidence van hijacker, okay?
- Okay.
- Do we have a positive I.D.?
Yeah.
And it tells a whole lot.
Okay, what?
His name's Darryl Kaleo.
Brother of an ex-cop you put away last year for the murder of your ex-partner.
I know who he is.
Are you implying that he's involved with this?
Hey, look, he's capable of killing cops.
- He's also in prison.
- That's right.
He's in a life term.
Doesn't mean he's not behind this.
You think that he just orchestrated this whole thing?
From jail?
Why?
What does he get out of it?
Just helping his brother?
Doesn't make sense.
Why don't we pay him a visit and find out.
He's easy to find.
DANNY:
Life is pretty good here in the Protective Custody Wing, right?
One of the perks of being a cop.
Ex-cop.
You should be walking the main line with the rest of these lowlifes, and you know it.
My prior law enforcement work makes me a target.
Is there a reason you two are tossing my place or did you just miss me?
KALEO:
You two have no legal authority to be shaking me down.
This is harassment.
FRYER:
You're in prison.
Subject to search whenever and wherever.
Why are you really here?
I know you're looking for something.
Why bother lying?
Okay.
I will play along.
Your brother... he robbed a transport van, killed two cops.
FRYER:
You already know that, don't ya?
Huh?
Listen, Kaleo, we know that you helped set this thing up, and we are here to prove that-- that's what we're gonna do.
Be my guest.
Okay.
You know, Williams...
What?
You mentioning my brother makes me nostalgic about family.
You got a kid, right?
How's she doing, anyway?
My daughter is doing fine.
Thank you.
Your brother Darryl, on the other hand, he's not doing so good.
He's dead.
FRYER:
Hey.
Look what we got here.
Cell phone.
You planted that.
It ain't mine.
I'm sure your prints are gonna be all over it.
So tell me... is this how you arranged the transport van's hijacking?
It is, isn't it?
You got questions, run them by my lawyer.
Okay, no problem.
Listen, um,... (whispering):
you know, last time I saw you...
I broke a couple of bones in your face, right?
You ever mention my daughter again...
I promise you I'm gonna come back here,
I'm gonna break every single bone in your body, okay?
You understand?
(slaps Kaleo's back) Put him back in his cage.
MARCH:
Interesting.
This explains why these diamonds were never reported missing.
Based on quality,
I would say... that this stone comes from the Republic of Liberia.
Are you sure?
Things change.
I mean, you've been locked up for 30 years.
30 years, 13 million years, this is an allotrope of carbon formed at high pressure and high temperature conditions.
That never changes.
This stone, my dear, comes from Africa.
Which leads me to believe that is is probably... a conflict diamond.
Blood diamonds... sold on the black market, and used to finance civil wars and genocide on the Africa coast.
Have you ever done business with people from Liberia?
No, no.
But...
I'm a student of the game.
The game never changes.
Just the players do.
Well, then that would explain the kidnapper's accent.
Exactly.
And that's why, if I were you,
I would check out Liberians here on temporary visas.
Okay.
We really appreciate the help.
This at least gives us an idea of who's holding Angela.
I wish you luck.
And feel free to call on me anytime.
Bye.
Mr. March.
Hmm?
I'm gonna need that diamond back.
The diamond?
!
(laughs)
Here we go.
Can't blame a guy for trying.
CHIN:
All the outbound calls off of Kaleo's cell phone are to his brother Darryl... with the exception of this one.
Okay, who's this one to?
CHIN:
TSA security line.
Hey, look at the time stamp.
FRYER: 30 minutes before Mary was arrested.
So Kaleo made the call that got Mary arrested and the diamonds seized.
He told him the description of the van, the route, so they could hijack it.
But the part of the puzzle we don't have is how they know about the Liberian smuggling operation in the first place.
I reached out to TSA.
I worked up a list of Liberians that are on the island on temporary visas.
It's not extensive.
That's him.
Bottom left.
That's the guy that kidnapped Angela.
(beeping)
KONO:
Jordan Nevins.
He landed on the island three days ago.
Okay, well, it looks like he didn't lie on his TSA entry form.
Just confirmed he's staying in the penthouse suite.
Let's go pay him a visit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
Getting my vest.
No, I'll get your ve...
Uh, Chin?
Help him with the thing.
Hey, hey, Steve, come on over here a second.
What are you talking about?
What is that?
That was your birthday cake.
I was planning on taking it by the office.
Got sidetracked by this case.
Is that why you guys all stopped talking when I came in the office this morning?
Yeah.
Like usual, you figured out a way to ruin everything.
Thanks.
It's butter cream.
Butter cream's my favorite.
Move in!
Hey, hey!
I got Jordan.
Continue clearing.
All clear.
Bedroom's clear; no girl.
All right, where's Angela?
I-I don't know...
Hey!
Where's Angela?
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right, we'll see about that.
NEVINS:
I'm a Liberian citizen.
If you lay a finger on me,
I will have the consulate crawling so far up your...
That's a good idea.
And afterwards, I can tell your bosses that you lost their diamond shipment.
You seized some diamonds?
That look familiar?
It would take less than an hour for me to prepare a press release announcing the seizure of 20 million in conflict diamonds.
You know, it's funny, there's something about your body language right now that tells me that if that press release hits, you're gonna feel safer in here with us than you are out there on the street.
If I tell you everything, you gotta protect me and a promise of no deportation.
I'll be a dead man if you send me back to Liberia.
You got it.
Where's the girl?
(sighs)
I have no idea.
After our little charade at the hotel, we parted ways.
What are you talking about-- "charade"?
Angela faked her own kidnapping?
We didn't have a choice.
Angela was bumped from the flight at the last minute.
FRYER:
Let me guess, you had already told the people in New York the diamonds were on the flight.
I'm a facilitator.
I am paid to deliver the product to a buyer at a specific date and time.
And if that doesn't happen...
People like you get killed.
They had to, uh, use the other girl to make the drop as scheduled.
The other girl was my sister.
Did you know?
It was Angela's idea to scare her into doing it.
So, Angela and you worked together before?
NEVINS:
Yes.
She made several runs for me in the last few months, but nothing as large as this.
This is the first time for the both of us.
You've been played.
Angela probably set Mary up, so when the diamonds didn't get there, she wouldn't be blamed.
You and my sister Mary did.
No...
I doubt if Angela would...
double-cross me.
She's not smart enough to come up with something like this on her own.
Maybe she met somebody who was.
DANNY:
So, what was the plan?
You were gonna use your share of the dough to make an appeal?
Bribe a judge?
What?
It was worth a try.
Okay.
Where's Angela?
She's in the wind.
Where she lands, your guess is as good as mine.
Okay, how did she hook up with Darryl?
She's his ex-old lady.
She reached out to him with an opportunity to make a big score.
She just didn't want to get killed doing it.
And your brother turned to you for advice?
Advice?
Guess you could call it that.
I just figured a way for her and my brother to get rich.
All right, well, I'm gonna charge you with the death of those two cops.
What you just said, coupled with the phone records gives us enough-- more than enough-- to prove that you orchestrated the whole thing.
I'm doing life without, and there's no death penalty here in Hawaii.
Sorry to disappoint you, but another case is not going to make a difference to me.
That might be true, but since you've killed two more cops, you have lost your right to be housed in protective custody.
Isn't that true?
It is, it's true.
And (chuckles)...
believe me, uh, when you meet your new cell mate, life is going to get very interesting.
Wait, you can't do that.
Yes I can;
I just did.
Stand up.
Turn around, Sunshine.
Cuff him.
Hey... dead man walking.

♪ ♪
(sighs) I feel so stupid.
Mary, this happens to all of us.
I mean, people we think we can trust tell us lies.
I know, but I thought she was my friend.
Look, Angela's gonna resurface eventually.
She's gonna try to fence those diamonds.
And when she does, Interpol and the FBI are gonna be waiting for her.
It's only a matter of time, Mary.
She's on every country's watch list.
(quietly):
Wow.
All right, well, what-what now?
What about me?
You move on.
You pick yourself up.
You learn from your mistakes.
(sighs)
I honestly don't even know what to do with myself.
I...
I liked that job.
You know, I finally felt like
I was starting a new chapter in my life.
Well, you'll be happy to know that that chapter's still open for you.

I spoke to the airline.
They know you're a victim in all this.

It is?
Yeah.

Yeah, really.

That's an awesome cake.
We were gonna jump out and yell surprise, but then we figured what's the use?
Well, you should never surprise a man who is armed and who has extensive close-quarter battle training, anyway.
Ah, that's good to keep in mind.
I will also remember that.
STEVE:
Wow.
Here you go, birthday boy.
DANNY:
Happy birthday, buddy.
Thank you.
Guys, listen, I think we should just face the fact, that I'm not that easy to surprise.
You know?
Surprise!
(laughter)
Better than butter cream, right?
No, I'm good, thank you.
Okay.
So, I'd never heard anything like it before.
They said salt cake, I said, "What's the plan?"
MARCH:
I'm delighted you reached out to me, Angela.
I didn't have many options.
But with your help, this actually worked out better than I hoped.
Your diamonds.
It's been a pleasure.
Oh, believe me, the pleasure's all mine.
But there's one more thing you need to learn about this type of business.
As I said before... never turn your back on the buyer.

Sorry, brah.

Sorry.
Maybe I just don't get it.
On this island, when you drop in on someone's wave, you cause problems for other surfers.
That's just what happens.
Like everything else on this island, that makes zero sense.
Okay, I saw a wave, I rode it.
If anybody else wants to ride it with me, they're welcome.
No, you're wrong, okay?
If somebody's on the wave first, they own the wave.
Ho!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ho!
You can't own a wave.
Certainly not because you paddle faster than the next guy.
All right, that's number one.
Number two:
I clearly told the guy
I was coming down on his left.
I said, "Hey, buddy, I'm on the wave!"
It's the Pacific Ocean.
Danny, it's not a bike path.
Okay, well, I-I think that the same rules should apply for any thoroughfare.
Take it from me, someone who was not born on this island, therefore was not raised with all the mumbo jumbo.
You can't own a wave.

Spam is not part of any food group that I care to recognize.

Hey!
There you guys are.
I didn't know your sister was in town.
- Neither did I.
- Hi.
I've been looking for you two for over an hour.
You weren't home, so I figured
I'd check your favorite little surf spot.
So here I am.
Surprise.
What are you doing here, Mary?
What does it look like I'm doing here?
It looks like you're, uh, going to a Halloween party dressed as a flight attendant.
Come on.
Seriously.
You're working for the airlines?
Yes!
It's the coolest job ever.
I started like two weeks ago, and they gave me the Oahu to New York run.
I'm going to be flying back and forth like twice a week.
We can hang out during my layovers.
How sweet is that?
Pretty sweet.
Right?
Huh?
Come here.
Hi.
Come on.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Pick up your board, Danny.
Come on.
Pick it up!
So... so, you guys are, like, surf buddies now, huh?
Uh, yeah, kind of.
So cute.
Why didn't you call me?
I could've picked you up from the airport.
'Cause I wanted to surprise you.
Look at him.
He's definitely surprised.
In a good way.
In a good way.
So a stewardess.
How exactly did that happen?
Uh, well, my friend Angela worked for the airlines, and she knew I needed a job, so here I am.
And, by the way, we like
- to be called flight attendants.
- I knew that.
I did, actually.
Can I have a cup of coffee, too?
Are you, uh...
are you staying in town for a while?
Actually, no.
I'm working the return flight back to New York, so I got to take a rain check on the coffee.
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You just got here.
I know, but I have to go back to the hotel and freshen up before the flight.
So we'll catch up next time.
I have so much to tell you.
But it's all good stuff, so don't worry.
I'm not worried.
I'm really happy for you.
Thank you.
All right, I'll see you guys in, like, three days.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- See you.
- Bye, sis.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
So we are kind of surf buddies now?
You sensitive right now?
Yeah, little bit.
Hello, Mary.
You've kept me waiting.
We need to talk.

Hey.
What's up, Steve?
What's up?
Hey.
All right, see you later.
Okay.
What's up?
What was that?
What was what?
Why'd they just, uh... why'd they run out of here so quick?
What were you guys talking about?
What were we talking about?
I don't know.
Stuff.
General stuff.
What, uh... what, are you being paranoid now?
No, this is not paranoia, Daniel.
This has been happening a lot lately.
You guys have been acting weird.
Oh, okay.
Well, I think you should relax, maybe, and stop overanalyzing things.
Relax?
That's funny coming from you.
Okay, no, no, no.
Do what you want to do.
Be paranoid.
Okay, go nuts.
Let your mind play tricks on you.
Next thing you know, you are going to be wearing a tinfoil hat, babbling about black helicopters.
Black helicopters are real.
What do you mean, they're real?
They're real.
This is McGarrett.
Is this a joke?
I'll be right there.
Mary's been arrested.
Commander McGarrett.
- Thanks for your call.
- Not a problem.
Earlier today, we got a tip on one of the unrecorded lines that a stewardess was planning on smuggling some contraband onto a New York bound flight.
Okay, all right, this is crazy.
Mary's not a smuggler.
Are you sure you have the right person?
Commander McGarrett, your sister had about $20 million worth of diamonds duct-taped to her torso, so, yeah, I think we got the right person.
Did she say why she had the diamonds?
She refused to talk to us.
That's why we called you.
She won't talk to anyone else.
Okay, you said you stopped her based on a tip.
- Who gave it to you?
- It was an anonymous tip.
A male caller.
We tried to trace it, but he hung up too fast.
It was probably a prepaid cell anyway.
And is that unusual-- to get a call out of the blue like that?
No.
We get anonymous tips about drug mules all the time.
It's usually a rival group trying to put the competition out of business.
All right, listen, as a professional courtesy,
I'd like to speak to my sister in private.
What the hell happened?
I went straight to my hotel when I left you guys, and there was a man in my room with a gun.
Okay.
Have you ever seen this guy before?
No.
Don't think so.
- You don't think so?
- No, I-I know so.
I've never seen him before.
You believe me, right?
Of course, I believe you.
Mary, just slow down.
And tell me how you got away from this guy and how you ended up with these diamonds.
I didn't get away.
He taped the diamonds to me, and he told me that Angela's dead if I don't do exactly what he says.
Okay, who's Angela?
I told you about her, didn't I?
I don't... maybe.
Just tell me again.
We work together as flight attendants.
We came from New York together.
Okay, so she was your friend before this?
Yes.
We met at yoga class, like, three months ago.
I mean, she's really, like, the only real friend that I have.
She helped me get this job.
Steve, I really screwed up.
If I'm not on that plane when it lands, she's going to be killed.
Listen, Mary, just take a deep breath, okay, and calm down, all right?
Now, tell me everything you know about this guy who took your friend.
That's the thing, is I don't know anything about him, but he knew everything about me.
He was in my room waiting.
Okay, well, can you describe this guy to me?
Yeah.
He was tall.
He had dark skin.
He had a deep voice.
He had an accent.
Wasn't European, but similar.
You're positive you've never seen him before?
Yes, I'm positive.
I've never seen him, okay?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Because it's not adding up, Mary.
You understand?
Like, I'm trying to put this thing together, but it doesn't... it doesn't make sense to me.
Like, why would they take you?
Okay, and why would you not call me the minute you got away from him?
'Cause I was terrified.
I still am, Steve.
He took a picture of me on his cell phone, and he told me that he's going to text his partner, and that when I land, this guy's going to text me instructions.
He did that to keep you scared and cooperating, you understand?
Well, it's working.
I can't believe
I'm in this mess now.
Steve, if I'm not on that plane in nine hours with the diamonds,
Angela's going to be killed.
That's not going to happen, Mary.
Because that plane took off half an hour ago.
You understand?
Which means we got nine hours to save your friend.
We'll find her, Mary, all right?
Hey.
We'll find her.
Okay?
We need to find this Angela.
- Yes.
If there really is an Angela.
- Danny, she's my sister.
I think I'd know if she was lying.
Okay.
All right, what are you getting at?
Listen to me.
I thought I knew my brother-- right?
-- and he lied to me, and now he's on the FBI Most Wanted list.
No offense, but I think I'm a little closer to my sister than you were to your brother.
Okay, so then you know she was arrested two months ago for drunk driving?
Wait a minute.
You ran background on my sister?
No, I didn't run background on your sister;
TSA did, and I am relaying information.
Okay, well, holding back the fact that she got arrested two months ago does not mean that she's lying to us today.
I'm not saying she's lying, maybe just not telling us the full story.
Okay, look, we're going to check that hotel room, then we're going to know more.
Until then, I'm going on the assumption that she's telling me the truth.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
So the room hasn't been serviced, so it should be in the same condition as when your sister checked out.
Well, so far, we have no signs of a forced entry, struggle, or a girl named Angela.
Okay, well, it doesn't mean it didn't happen and she doesn't exist, right?
The guy could have used the pass key.
Yeah, well, the hotel staff said that Mary was the only one issued with a room key, and nobody saw her with another woman.
But I did confirm that Mary has a co-worker named Angela Branson who flew in with her.
She's based out of New York and isn't due to fly out again for three days.
And according to the hotel records, there was a room booked in her name, but she never actually checked in.
All right, well, good.
That's a good start.
We got any, uh...
got any other contact info?
The airline gave us her cell phone number, but it's just rolling straight to voicemail whenever we try it.
Well, if she'd been kidnapped, that would make sense, right?
Okay, are you trying to convince us or yourself?
Maybe a little of both.
Okay.
We need to get a look at this security feed.
Okay, that's him.
That's the guy Mary described.
He's got Angela.
Stop.
Push in.
All right, so he brings Angela down the back way so no one can see him.
Danny, call Kono, have her pick Mary up from the TSA's custody, and drop her in my office, but tell her I want it done low-key.
For Angela's safety, we can't let anybody know that Mary and the diamonds didn't make that flight.
Okay, okay!
Would you slow down, please?
Please!
We're not gonna be able to help anybody if we end up wrapped around a telephone pole.
That anonymous call about Mary and the diamonds it doesn't add up.
There are a lot of things about this case that do not add up, and I apologize for not believing Mary's story, but please stop driving this car like it's stolen, and slow down!
Driving like I always do.
Listen, whoever made the call to TSA about Mary had to have been a part of the smuggler's operation.
Right?
That's the only way that they would have known that Mary had the diamonds on her.
Okay, we don't know who made the call, but maybe Kono got a chance to enhance that video, and we will get an I.D. on her kidnapper.
Please slow down.
I'm asking you nicely.
I said please don't do it, please...
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
Thank you.
You okay?
Yeah.
All right.
Okay, Kono, tell me something good.
All right, well, the rest of the security videos don't show much.
They only have coverage of the stairwell, so there's no actual footage of anyone going in or out of that specific room.
But we got footage of Angela being dragged down the back stairwell.
What about the, uh, facial recognition thingie?
I already tried that.
The angles are bad.
There's not enough to get a complete scan.
Okay, uh, Chin, what about the origin of the diamonds?
I checked through Interpol.
There's no reports of any diamond shipments this size, either missing or stolen.
The good news is that Angela's safe as long as they believe that Mary and the diamonds are on that plane.
Well, I hate to be the one that states the obvious.
She is not on the plane, so, we're gonna have a big problem in about eight hours, when it lands.
Okay, maybe, maybe.
What do you mean?
I got plan-- it might be a goofy plan-- but what if, what if we get Mary and those diamonds on the governor's G-4?
In the next half an hour, we can beat that plane to New York.
When the guy there approaches her and takes possession of the diamonds, we snatch him for smuggling.
Very good.
Okay, and if we can flip him, then we can roll back and arrest whoever's holding Angela.
Okay, Kono, get the governor on the phone.
We need that plane ready, fueled to go in a half an hour.
Please call HPD, and tell them we need those diamonds here immediately.
42-30?
42-30, come in.
Go for 42-30.
Per the watch commander, start heading towards Iolani Palace.
See Detective Williams for an evidence transfer.
42-30.
Copy that.
Evidence transfer?
What the hell's that about?
Hey.
Hey, look, just so there's no confusion, this is HPD's handle, not Five-O's.
Well, most people like to start the day off with some pleasantries, but not the new chief of detectives, huh?
You do know that that transport van contained evidence from a case we were working?
I've already been briefed on the kidnapping case.
The murder of my two cops trumps it-- come on.
- Okay, listen to me...
- Detective Kelly?
...you do know that the only people who knew the diamonds were in that van were cops.
All right, so if you're gonna start looking for the hijacker, you start with HPD.
Hey, look, no way in hell.
I cleaned house.
I'll bet my job none of my guys are involved.
Hey, they just ran the plate on that semi.
It was reported stolen last night.
Okay, if they stole the semi truck last night, they already knew the diamonds were going to be seized today.
All right, who would have known something about that?
The guy who called in the anonymous tip on Mary.
But if they were always gonna steal the diamonds, why wouldn't they just snatch Mary when she arrived at the airport?
Because they were more afraid of the diamond smugglers than they were of us.
Let's make 'em worry about us.
Mary, we need to determine who may have targeted you to smuggle those diamonds.
So, was there anyone new that either you or Angela had met?
Maybe an overfriendly passenger?
No.
Nobody.
How long have you known Angela?
We met a few months back at this yoga club in New York.
And she's the one that helped me get this job.
Oh, my God.
This could be from the people that have Angela.
What do you mean?
Well, the kidnappers said
I was gonna get a text message from his guy in New York.
What does it say?
"When you land, walk directly to baggage carousel three.
"I'll be watching, so don't try and involve the cops, or your friend's... dead."
Good news is, they still have no idea
Mary didn't make that plane.
Yeah, looks like we got about five hours till they find out.
All right, when you get those diamonds, we can use them as a bargaining chip for Angela's life.
Hey, I've been thinking about these diamonds.
If these guys just came in possession of 20 million in ice, they need to move it through a broker.
If they are still on the island.
Yeah, but these guys killed two cops to get these stones, so they know we're watching everyone leaving the island.
The smartest thing these guys can do is to try and move those diamonds while they're still here.
Right, and as far as brokers go, there's only so many guys on the island that can handle this kind of weight.
Now this is a criminal file on a fence released from prison six months ago.
If there's a deal he'll have heard about it.
So, this guy's been off the radar since he finished serving his sentence six months ago.
You got new leverage on him?
Nothing.
No parole.
Did his full 30-year term, dropped his tail.
Doesn't mean he's not dirty.
In my experience, once a crook, you are always a crook.
I agree.
August March.
HPD.
We need to ask you a few questions.
Nobody here by that name.
Have you tried next door?
You lie to me again, you're going straight back to jail.
You know, last time I checked, you needed a man's invitation to walk into his house.
That rule applies to citizens.
You stopped being one 30 years ago.
30 years...
Well, maybe you should talk to my attorney about what my rights are...
You finish making that call...
Yeah?
You are going to jail.
Either way, you're gonna answer my questions, because...
You-you can't...
- ...
I don't have time for your games.
- No, no.
You understand me?
You understand me?
Yeah, well, I certainly won't answer your questions...
Excuse me.
Come on, Vince.
Why don't you pull it back a little bit?
All right?
This guy's done his time.
Why don't you just take it easy?
All right, I'm not holding nothing back, McGarrett.
I got two dead cops.
Two.
And I'm betting that this old man knows who's responsible, okay?
Now don't be fooled by the way he looks.
August March ran one of the largest smuggling networks in the world.
He was the fence for stolen art and gems.
Nothing moved on or off Honolulu without August March taking a piece of the action.
His operation and pipeline continued long after he was in prison for ordering the murder of two of his business associates.
They made the mistake of trusting him, and they got a bullet for it.
The man is a cold-blooded killer.
It's a very colorful, but less-than-accurate description of what I was convicted of.
Whatever crimes I committed in the past are just that.
The past!
Now, please leave me alone, or I'm gonna file a complaint!
Listen, there's a woman whose life is in danger.
All we need is a little bit of your time and some help with the smuggler that we're looking for, okay?
I'm sorry, but I don't do that anymore.
I've been on ice for 30 years.
I'm not in that business anymore.
Okay, but you do know people that are in that business, correct?
Yeah, I do, and unlike you guys, they take me at my word when I say I'm out.
All we're trying to do is prevent an innocent woman from being killed over the theft of a few lousy diamonds here.
This is about diamonds?
Yes.
Do you know anything about it?
I might.
But if I help you, you've got to give me your word that you'll never bother me again.
And nobody must know about my involvement.
You have my word.
Well...
I'm not just talking about you.
Look, you give me the guys that killed my men...
Yeah?
...you will never, never lay eyes on me again.
Fine.
Fine, fine, fine.
I got a call yesterday from a stranger.
I don't know who he is, nor who referred him to me.
But he said he wanted to fence... s-some diamonds.
Yeah, uh...
It's, it's the last number on there.
Maybe you can trace the number.
Okay.
Did I hear right, that your name's McGarrett?
Yeah.
There was a young officer named McGarrett who transported me to jail 30 years ago.
Any relation?
Yeah, that was my father.
Yeah.
No kidding.
Small world.
How's he doing?
He's dead.
Shame.
Sorry to hear that.
He was a good man.
I tried to offer him... $100,000 bribe that day.
A fortune at that time.
My father wasn't that kind of cop.
But there were plenty of cops around him who would've taken that money, right, Chief?
It's a pre-paid.
Can't trace it.
Thank you.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I tried.
I wish I could help you more.
Hey, look, you're not done.
You're not.
Call that guy back.
Set up a meet and let me grab him.
- Give him to me.
Just give him to me.
- No!
Come on.
That's a young man's game.
I'm too old for that kind of thing.
Come on.
This is probably the only chance we have to get this girl back safe.
This guy better show.
Plane lands in New York in less than four hours.
I got him.
I got a visual, 10:00.
Right now. 10:00.
He's strapped.
Butt of a gun sticking out of his shirt.
If March gets compromised, that guy pulls out that gun, every single one of these civilians is at risk here.
This guy's an old pro.
He'll do fine.
Let's hope your right.
August March?
Take a seat.
You're making the waiter nervous.
By yourself, right?
Because if not, anything happens, you're the first to get shot.
Relax, kid.
I'm here for one piece of business.
The only thing that's gonna happen here today, is you and me are gonna get rich.
Just remember, we wait for him to inspect the diamonds.
That's the arrest signal.
- That is when we move in.
- You sure you can move this kind of weight?
Eh, don't worry.
I got the connections.
Whoever sent you to me knows that.
Good.
So what's the brokerage fee on 20 million worth?
Well, as I told you on the phone,
I can't say without seeing the quality of the product.
Y-You did bring all of the diamonds like I told you.
You didn't really think I'd be dumb enough to bring all of them, did you?
Nobody said you were dumb.
But... without seeing all of them
I can't estimate the overall quality of the product.
For all I know, you could've handpicked the best one.
I didn't.
Now!
Move out!
I've got 200 more of that same quality.
Now how much?
You say you're not dumb, but with what you've been handling lately, the moves you've been making,
I'm starting to think you are.
- Why's that?
- Killing cops?
In my day, we would've never done a thing like that.
Brings too much heat.
How'd you know about the cops?
Nice shot, Fryer.
Trouble is now our only lead is dead.
You okay.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
I told your partner I was too old for this.
March was telling me he thinks he can identify where the diamonds are from.
Okay, that's good.
How?
Every diamond has a distinct marking.
If I could look at this stone this guy brought under a microscope,
I might be able to tell you something about it.
Okay, all right, good.
Take Mr. March over to Fong's, we have a microscope for you to look at, okay?
Fine, fine, fine.
I mean...
Now, look, I just did what I had to do, all right?
And besides, this guy matches the description of the evidence van hijacker, okay?
- Okay.
- Do we have a positive I.D.?
Yeah.
And it tells a whole lot.
Okay, what?
His name's Darryl Kaleo.
Brother of an ex-cop you put away last year for the murder of your ex-partner.
I know who he is.
Are you implying that he's involved with this?
Hey, look, he's capable of killing cops.
- He's also in prison.
- That's right.
He's in a life term.
Doesn't mean he's not behind this.
You think that he just orchestrated this whole thing?
From jail?
Why?
What does he get out of it?
Just helping his brother?
Doesn't make sense.
Why don't we pay him a visit and find out.
He's easy to find.
Life is pretty good here in the Protective Custody Wing, right?
One of the perks of being a cop.
Ex-cop.
You should be walking the main line with the rest of these lowlifes, and you know it.
My prior law enforcement work makes me a target.
Is there a reason you two are tossing my place or did you just miss me?
You two have no legal authority to be shaking me down.
- This is harassment.
- You're in prison.
Subject to search whenever and wherever.
Why are you really here?
I know you're looking for something.
Why bother lying?
Okay.
I will play along.
Your brother... he robbed a transport van, killed two cops.
You already know that, don't ya?
Huh?
Listen, Kaleo, we know that you helped set this thing up, and we are here to prove that-- that's what we're gonna do.
Be my guest.
Okay.
You know, Williams...
What?
You mentioning my brother makes me nostalgic about family.
You got a kid, right?
How's she doing, anyway?
My daughter is doing fine.
Thank you.
Your brother Darryl, on the other hand, he's not doing so good.
He's dead.
Hey.
Look what we got here.
Cell phone.
You planted that.
It ain't mine.
I'm sure your prints are gonna be all over it.
So tell me... is this how you arranged the transport van's hijacking?
It is, isn't it?
You got questions, run them by my lawyer.
Okay, no problem.
Listen, um,... you know, last time I saw you...
I broke a couple of bones in your face, right?
You ever mention my daughter again...
I promise you I'm gonna come back here,
I'm gonna break every single bone in your body, okay?
You understand?
Put him back in his cage.
Interesting.
This explains why these diamonds were never reported missing.
Based on quality,
I would say... that this stone comes from the Republic of Liberia.
Are you sure?
Things change.
I mean, you've been locked up for 30 years.
30 years, 13 million years, this is an allotrope of carbon formed at high pressure and high temperature conditions.
That never changes.
This stone, my dear, comes from Africa.
Which leads me to believe that is is probably... a conflict diamond.
Blood diamonds... sold on the black market, and used to finance civil wars and genocide on the Africa coast.
Have you ever done business with people from Liberia?
No, no.
But...
I'm a student of the game.
The game never changes.
Just the players do.
Well, then that would explain the kidnapper's accent.
Exactly.
And that's why, if I were you,
I would check out Liberians here on temporary visas.
Okay.
We really appreciate the help.
This at least gives us an idea of who's holding Angela.
I wish you luck.
And feel free to call on me anytime.
Bye.
Mr. March.
Hmm?
I'm gonna need that diamond back.
The diamond?
!
Here we go.
Can't blame a guy for trying.
All the outbound calls off of Kaleo's cell phone are to his brother Darryl... with the exception of this one.
Okay, who's this one to?
TSA security line.
Hey, look at the time stamp.
30 minutes before Mary was arrested.
So Kaleo made the call that got Mary arrested and the diamonds seized.
He told him the description of the van, the route, so they could hijack it.
But the part of the puzzle we don't have is how they know about the Liberian smuggling operation in the first place.
I reached out to TSA.
I worked up a list of Liberians that are on the island on temporary visas.
It's not extensive.
That's him.
Bottom left.
That's the guy that kidnapped Angela.
Jordan Nevins.
He landed on the island three days ago.
Okay, well, it looks like he didn't lie on his TSA entry form.
Just confirmed he's staying in the penthouse suite.
Let's go pay him a visit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
Getting my vest.
No, I'll get your ve...
Uh, Chin?
Help him with the thing.
Hey, hey, Steve, come on over here a second.
What are you talking about?
What is that?
That was your birthday cake.
I was planning on taking it by the office.
Got sidetracked by this case.
Is that why you guys all stopped talking when I came in the office this morning?
Yeah.
Like usual, you figured out a way to ruin everything.
Thanks.
It's butter cream.
Butter cream's my favorite.
Move in!
Hey, hey!
I got Jordan.
Continue clearing.
All clear.
Bedroom's clear; no girl.
All right, where's Angela?
I-I don't know...
Hey!
Where's Angela?
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right, we'll see about that.
I'm a Liberian citizen.
If you lay a finger on me,
I will have the consulate crawling so far up your...
That's a good idea.
And afterwards, I can tell your bosses that you lost their diamond shipment.
You seized some diamonds?
That look familiar?
It would take less than an hour for me to prepare a press release announcing the seizure of 20 million in conflict diamonds.
You know, it's funny, there's something about your body language right now that tells me that if that press release hits, you're gonna feel safer in here with us than you are out there on the street.
If I tell you everything, you gotta protect me and a promise of no deportation.
I'll be a dead man if you send me back to Liberia.
You got it.
Where's the girl?
I have no idea.
After our little charade at the hotel, we parted ways.
What are you talking about-- "charade"?
Angela faked her own kidnapping?
We didn't have a choice.
Angela was bumped from the flight at the last minute.
Let me guess, you had already told the people in New York the diamonds were on the flight.
I'm a facilitator.
I am paid to deliver the product to a buyer at a specific date and time.
And if that doesn't happen...
People like you get killed.
They had to, uh, use the other girl to make the drop as scheduled.
The other girl was my sister.
Did you know?
It was Angela's idea to scare her into doing it.
So, Angela and you worked together before?
Yes.
She made several runs for me in the last few months, but nothing as large as this.
This is the first time for the both of us.
You've been played.
Angela probably set Mary up, so when the diamonds didn't get there, she wouldn't be blamed.
You and my sister Mary did.
No...
I doubt if Angela would...
double-cross me.
She's not smart enough to come up with something like this on her own.
Maybe she met somebody who was.
So, what was the plan?
You were gonna use your share of the dough to make an appeal?
Bribe a judge?
What?
It was worth a try.
Okay.
Where's Angela?
She's in the wind.
Where she lands, your guess is as good as mine.
Okay, how did she hook up with Darryl?
She's his ex-old lady.
She reached out to him with an opportunity to make a big score.
She just didn't want to get killed doing it.
And your brother turned to you for advice?
Advice?
Guess you could call it that.
I just figured a way for her and my brother to get rich.
All right, well, I'm gonna charge you with the death of those two cops.
What you just said, coupled with the phone records gives us enough-- more than enough-- to prove that you orchestrated the whole thing.
I'm doing life without, and there's no death penalty here in Hawaii.
Sorry to disappoint you, but another case is not going to make a difference to me.
That might be true, but since you've killed two more cops, you have lost your right to be housed in protective custody.
Isn't that true?
It is, it's true.
And...
believe me, uh, when you meet your new cell mate, life is going to get very interesting.
Wait, you can't do that.
Yes I can;
I just did.
Stand up.
Turn around, Sunshine.
Cuff him.

Mary, this happens to all of us.
I mean, people we think we can trust tell us lies.
I know, but I thought she was my friend.
Look, Angela's gonna resurface eventually.
She's gonna try to fence those diamonds.
And when she does, Interpol and the FBI are gonna be waiting for her.
It's only a matter of time, Mary.
She's on every country's watch list.
Wow.
All right, well, what-what now?

Hey!
There you guys are.
I didn't know your sister was in town.
- Neither did I.
- Hi.
I've been looking for you two for over an hour.
You weren't home, so I figured
I'd check your favorite little surf spot.
So here I am.
Surprise.
What are you doing here, Mary?
What does it look like I'm doing here?
It looks like you're, uh, going to a Halloween party dressed as a flight attendant.
Come on.
Seriously.
You're working for the airlines?
Yes!
It's the coolest job ever.
I started like two weeks ago, and they gave me the Oahu to New York run.
I'm going to be flying back and forth like twice a week.
We can hang out during my layovers.
How sweet is that?
Pretty sweet.
Right?
Huh?
Come here.
Hi.
Come on.

So... so, you guys are, like, surf buddies now, huh?
Uh, yeah, kind of.
So cute.
Why didn't you call me?
I could've picked you up from the airport.
'Cause I wanted to surprise you.
DANNY:
Look at him.
He's definitely surprised.
STEVE:
In a good way.
In a good way.
So a stewardess.
How exactly did that happen?
Uh, well, my friend Angela worked for the airlines, and she knew I needed a job, so here I am.
And, by the way, we like to be called flight attendants.
DANNY:
I knew that.
I did, actually.
Can I have a cup of coffee, too?
Are you, uh...
are you staying in town for a while?
Actually, no.
I'm working the return flight back to New York, so I got to take a rain check on the coffee.
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You just got here.
I know, but I have to go back to the hotel and freshen up before the flight.
So we'll catch up next time.
I have so much to tell you.
But it's all good stuff, so don't worry.
I'm not worried.

They're real.
This is McGarrett.
Is this a joke?
I'll be right there.
Mary's been arrested.
Commander McGarrett.
- Thanks for your call.
- Not a problem.
Earlier today, we got a tip on one of the unrecorded lines that a stewardess was planning on smuggling some contraband onto a New York bound flight.
Okay, all right, this is crazy.
Mary's not a smuggler.
Are you sure you have the right person?
Commander McGarrett, your sister had about $20 million worth of diamonds duct-taped to her torso, so, yeah, I think we got the right person.
Did she say why she had the diamonds?
She refused to talk to us.
That's why we called you.
She won't talk to anyone else.
Okay, you said you stopped her based on a tip.
- Who gave it to you?
- It was an anonymous tip.
A male caller.
We tried to trace it, but he hung up too fast.
It was probably a prepaid cell anyway.
And is that unusual-- to get a call out of the blue like that?
No.
We get anonymous tips about drug mules all the time.
It's usually a rival group trying to put the competition out of business.
All right, listen, as a professional courtesy,
I'd like to speak to my sister in private.
What the hell happened?
I went straight to my hotel when I left you guys, and there was a man in my room with a gun.
Okay.
Have you ever seen this guy before?
No.
Don't think so.
- You don't think so?
- No, I-I know so.
I've never seen him before.
You believe me, right?
Of course, I believe you.
Mary, just slow down.
And tell me how you got away from this guy and how you ended up with these diamonds.
I didn't get away.
He taped the diamonds to me, and he told me that Angela's dead if I don't do exactly what he says.
Okay, who's Angela?
I told you about her, didn't I?
I don't... maybe.
Just tell me again.
We work together as flight attendants.
We came from New York together.
Okay, so she was your friend before this?
Yes.
We met at yoga class, like, three months ago.
I mean, she's really, like, the only real friend that I have.
She helped me get this job.
Steve, I really screwed up.
If I'm not on that plane when it lands, she's going to be killed.
Listen, Mary, just take a deep breath, okay, and calm down, all right?
Now, tell me everything you know about this guy who took your friend.
That's the thing, is I don't know anything about him, but he knew everything about me.
He was in my room waiting.
Okay, well, can you describe this guy to me?
Yeah.
He was tall.
He had dark skin.
He had a deep voice.
He had an accent.
Wasn't European, but similar.
You're positive you've never seen him before?
Yes, I'm positive.
I've never seen him, okay?
Why do you keep asking me that?
Because it's not adding up, Mary.
You understand?
Like, I'm trying to put this thing together, but it doesn't... it doesn't make sense to me.
Like, why would they take you?
Okay, and why would you not call me the minute you got away from him?
'Cause I was terrified.
I still am, Steve.
He took a picture of me on his cell phone, and he told me that he's going to text his partner, and that when I land, this guy's going to text me instructions.
He did that to keep you scared and cooperating, you understand?
Well, it's working.
I can't believe
I'm in this mess now.
Steve, if I'm not on that plane in nine hours with the diamonds,
Angela's going to be killed.
That's not going to happen, Mary.
Because that plane took off half an hour ago.
You understand?
Which means we got nine hours to save your friend.
We'll find her, Mary, all right?
Hey.
We'll find her.
Okay?
We need to find this Angela.
- Yes.
If there really is an Angela.
- Danny, she's my sister.
I think I'd know if she was lying.
Okay.
All right, what are you getting at?
Listen to me.
I thought I knew my brother-- right?
-- and he lied to me, and now he's on the FBI Most Wanted list.
No offense, but I think I'm a little closer to my sister than you were to your brother.
Okay, so then you know she was arrested two months ago for drunk driving?
Wait a minute.
You ran background on my sister?
No, I didn't run background on your sister;
TSA did, and I am relaying information.
Okay, well, holding back the fact that she got arrested two months ago does not mean that she's lying to us today.
I'm not saying she's lying, maybe just not telling us the full story.
Okay, look, we're going to check that hotel room, then we're going to know more.
Until then, I'm going on the assumption that she's telling me the truth.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
So the room hasn't been serviced, so it should be in the same condition as when your sister checked out.
Well, so far, we have no signs of a forced entry, struggle, or a girl named Angela.
Okay, well, it doesn't mean it didn't happen and she doesn't exist, right?
The guy could have used the pass key.
Yeah, well, the hotel staff said that Mary was the only one issued with a room key, and nobody saw her with another woman.
But I did confirm that Mary has a co-worker named Angela Branson who flew in with her.
She's based out of New York and isn't due to fly out again for three days.
KONO:
And according to the hotel records, there was a room booked in her name, but she never actually checked in.
All right, well, good.
That's a good start.
We got any, uh...
got any other contact info?
The airline gave us her cell phone number, but it's just rolling straight to voicemail whenever we try it.
Well, if she'd been kidnapped, that would make sense, right?
Okay, are you trying to convince us or yourself?
Maybe a little of both.
(elevator bell dings) Okay.
We need to get a look at this security feed.
(computer trilling)
Okay, that's him.
That's the guy Mary described.
DANNY:
He's got Angela.
Stop.
Push in.
All right, so he brings Angela down the back way so no one can see him.
Danny, call Kono, have her pick Mary up from the TSA's custody, and drop her in my office, but tell her I want it done low-key.
For Angela's safety, we can't let anybody know that Mary and the diamonds didn't make that flight.
(tires squealing, engine revving)
Okay, okay!
Would you slow down, please?
Please!
We're not gonna be able to help anybody if we end up wrapped around a telephone pole.
That anonymous call about Mary and the diamonds... (tires squealing, engine revving) ...it doesn't add up.
There are a lot of things about this case that do not add up, and I apologize for not believing Mary's story, but please stop driving this car like it's stolen, and slow down!
Driving like I always do.
(engine revving, tires squealing)
Listen, whoever made the call to TSA about Mary had to have been a part of the smuggler's operation.
Right?
That's the only way that they would have known that Mary had the diamonds on her.
Okay, we don't know who made the call, but maybe Kono got a chance to enhance that video, and we will get an I.D. on her kidnapper.
Please slow down.
I'm asking you nicely.
I said please don't do it, please...
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
Thank you.
You okay?
Yeah.
All right.
Okay, Kono, tell me something good.
All right, well, the rest of the security videos don't show much.
They only have coverage of the stairwell, so there's no actual footage of anyone going in or out of that specific room.
But we got footage of Angela being dragged down the back stairwell.
What about the, uh, facial recognition thingie?
I already tried that.
The angles are bad.
There's not enough to get a complete scan.
Okay, uh, Chin, what about the origin of the diamonds?
I checked through Interpol.
There's no reports of any diamond shipments this size, either missing or stolen.
The good news is that Angela's safe as long as they believe that Mary and the diamonds are on that plane.
Well, I hate to be the one that states the obvious.
She is not on the plane, so, we're gonna have a big problem in about eight hours, when it lands.
Okay, maybe, maybe.
What do you mean?
I got plan-- it might be a goofy plan-- but what if, what if we get Mary and those diamonds on the governor's G-4?
In the next half an hour, we can beat that plane to New York.
When the guy there approaches her and takes possession of the diamonds, we snatch him for smuggling.
Very good.
Okay, and if we can flip him, then we can roll back and arrest whoever's holding Angela.
Okay, Kono, get the governor on the phone.
We need that plane ready, fueled to go in a half an hour.
Please call HPD, and tell them we need those diamonds here immediately.

Well, most people like to start the day off with some pleasantries, but not the new chief of detectives, huh?
You do know that that transport van contained evidence from a case we were working?
I've already been briefed on the kidnapping case.
The murder of my two cops trumps it-- come on.
DANNY:
Okay, listen to me...
OFFICER:
Detective Kelly?
...you do know that the only people who knew the diamonds were in that van were cops.
All right, so if you're gonna start looking for the hijacker, you start with HPD.
Hey, look, no way in hell.
I cleaned house.
I'll bet my job none of my guys are involved.
Hey, they just ran the plate on that semi.
It was reported stolen last night.
Okay, if they stole the semi truck last night, they already knew the diamonds were going to be seized today.
All right, who would have known something about that?
The guy who called in the anonymous tip on Mary.
But if they were always gonna steal the diamonds, why wouldn't they just snatch Mary when she arrived at the airport?
Because they were more afraid of the diamond smugglers than they were of us.
Let's make 'em worry about us.
KONO:
Mary, we need to determine who may have targeted you to smuggle those diamonds.
So, was there anyone new that either you or Angela had met?
Maybe an overfriendly passenger?
No.
Nobody.
How long have you known Angela?
We met a few months back at this yoga club in New York.
(phone chimes) And she's the one that helped me get this job.
Oh, my God.
This could be from the people that have Angela.
What do you mean?
Well, the kidnappers said
I was gonna get a text message from his guy in New York.
What does it say?
"When you land, walk directly to baggage carousel three.
"I'll be watching, so don't try and involve the cops, or your friend's... dead."
DANNY:
Good news is, they still have no idea
Mary didn't make that plane.
Yeah, looks like we got about five hours till they find out.
All right, when you get those diamonds, we can use them as a bargaining chip for Angela's life.
Hey, I've been thinking about these diamonds.
If these guys just came in possession of 20 million in ice, they need to move it through a broker.
If they are still on the island.
Yeah, but these guys killed two cops to get these stones, so they know we're watching everyone leaving the island.
The smartest thing these guys can do is to try and move those diamonds while they're still here.
Right, and as far as brokers go, there's only so many guys on the island that can handle this kind of weight.
Now this is a criminal file on a fence released from prison six months ago.
If there's a deal he'll have heard about it.
FRYER:
So, this guy's been off the radar since he finished serving his sentence six months ago.
You got new leverage on him?
Nothing.
No parole.

Doesn't mean he's not dirty.

We need to ask you a few questions.

Have you tried next door?
You lie to me again, you're going straight back to jail.
You know, last time I checked, you needed a man's invitation to walk into his house.
That rule applies to citizens.
You stopped being one 30 years ago.
30 years...
Well, maybe you should talk to my attorney about what my rights are...
You finish making that call...
Yeah?
You are going to jail.
Either way, you're gonna answer my questions, because...
You-you can't I don't have time for your games.
MARCH:
No, no.
You understand me?
You understand me?
Yeah, well, I certainly won't answer your questions...
Excuse me.
Come on, Vince.
Why don't you pull it back a little bit?
All right?
This guy's done his time.
Why don't you just take it easy?
All right, I'm not holding nothing back, McGarrett.
I got two dead cops.
Two.
And I'm betting that this old man knows who's responsible, okay?
Now don't be fooled by the way he looks.
August March ran one of the largest smuggling networks in the world.
He was the fence for stolen art and gems.
Nothing moved on or off Honolulu without August March taking a piece of the action.
His operation and pipeline continued long after he was in prison for ordering the murder of two of his business associates.
They made the mistake of trusting him, and they got a bullet for it.
The man is a cold-blooded killer.
It's a very colorful, but less-than-accurate description of what I was convicted of.
Whatever crimes I committed in the past are just that.
The past!
Now, please leave me alone, or I'm gonna file a complaint!
Listen, there's a woman whose life is in danger.
All we need is a little bit of your time and some help with the smuggler that we're looking for, okay?
I'm sorry, but I don't do that anymore.
I've been on ice for 30 years.
I'm not in that business anymore.
Okay, but you do know people that are in that business, correct?
Yeah, I do, and unlike you guys, they take me at my word when I say I'm out.
STEVE:
All we're trying to do is prevent an innocent woman from being killed over the theft of a few lousy diamonds here.
This is about diamonds?
Yes.
Do you know anything about it?
I might.
But if I help you, you've got to give me your word that you'll never bother me again.
And nobody must know about my involvement.
You have my word.
MARCH:
Well...
I'm not just talking about you.
FRYER:
Look, you give me the guys that killed my men...
Yeah?
...you will never, never lay eyes on me again.
Fine.
Fine, fine, fine.
I got a call yesterday from a stranger.
I don't know who he is, nor who referred him to me.
But he said he wanted to fence... s-some diamonds.
Yeah, uh...
It's, it's the last number on there.
Maybe you can trace the number.
DANNY:
Okay.
Did I hear right, that your name's McGarrett?
Yeah.
There was a young officer named McGarrett who transported me to jail 30 years ago.
Any relation?
Yeah, that was my father.
Yeah.
No kidding.
Small world.
How's he doing?
He's dead.
Shame.
Sorry to hear that.
He was a good man.
I tried to offer him... $100,000 bribe that day.
A fortune at that time.
My father wasn't that kind of cop.
But there were plenty of cops around him who would've taken that money, right, Chief?
DANNY:
It's a pre-paid.
Can't trace it.
Thank you.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I tried.
I wish I could help you more.
Hey, look, you're not done.
You're not.
Call that guy back.
Set up a meet and let me grab him.
- Give him to me.
Just give him to me.
- No!
Come on.
That's a young man's game.
I'm too old for that kind of thing.
Come on.
This is probably the only chance we have to get this girl back safe.
This guy better show.
Plane lands in New York in less than four hours.
I got him.
STEVE:
I got a visual, 10:00.
Right now. 10:00.
DANNY:
He's strapped.
Butt of a gun sticking out of his shirt.
STEVE:
If March gets compromised, that guy pulls out that gun, every single one of these civilians is at risk here.
FRYER:
This guy's an old pro.
He'll do fine.
STEVE:
Let's hope your right.
August March?
Take a seat.
You're making the waiter nervous.
By yourself, right?
Because if not, anything happens, you're the first to get shot.
(laughs)
Relax, kid.
I'm here for one piece of business.
The only thing that's gonna happen here today, is you and me are gonna get rich.
Just remember, we wait for him to inspect the diamonds.
That's the arrest signal.
That is when we move in.
DARRYL:
You sure you can move this kind of weight?
Eh, don't worry.
I got the connections.
Whoever sent you to me knows that.
Good.
So what's the brokerage fee on 20 million worth?
Well, as I told you on the phone,
I can't say without seeing the quality of the product.
Y-You did bring all of the diamonds like I told you.
You didn't really think I'd be dumb enough to bring all of them, did you?
Nobody said you were dumb.
But... without seeing all of them
I can't estimate the overall quality of the product.
For all I know, you could've handpicked the best one.
I didn't.
Now!
Move out!
I've got 200 more of that same quality.
Now how much?
You say you're not dumb, but with what you've been handling lately, the moves you've been making,
I'm starting to think you are.
- Why's that?
- Killing cops?
In my day, we would've never done a thing like that.
Brings too much heat.
How'd you know about the cops?
(people screaming)
Nice shot, Fryer.
STEVE:
Trouble is now our only lead is dead.
You okay.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
I told your partner I was too old for this.
March was telling me he thinks he can identify where the diamonds are from.
Okay, that's good.
How?
Every diamond has a distinct marking.
If I could look at this stone this guy brought under a microscope,
I might be able to tell you something about it.
Okay, all right, good.
Take Mr. March over to Fong's, we have a microscope for you to look at, okay?
Fine, fine, fine.
I mean...
Now, look, I just did what I had to do, all right?
And besides, this guy matches the description of the evidence van hijacker, okay?
- Okay.
- Do we have a positive I.D.?
Yeah.
And it tells a whole lot.
Okay, what?
His name's Darryl Kaleo.
Brother of an ex-cop you put away last year for the murder of your ex-partner.
I know who he is.
Are you implying that he's involved with this?
Hey, look, he's capable of killing cops.
- He's also in prison.
- That's right.
He's in a life term.
Doesn't mean he's not behind this.
You think that he just orchestrated this whole thing?
From jail?
Why?
What does he get out of it?
Just helping his brother?
Doesn't make sense.
Why don't we pay him a visit and find out.
He's easy to find.
DANNY:
Life is pretty good here in the Protective Custody Wing, right?
One of the perks of being a cop.
Ex-cop.
You should be walking the main line with the rest of these lowlifes, and you know it.
My prior law enforcement work makes me a target.
Is there a reason you two are tossing my place or did you just miss me?
KALEO:
You two have no legal authority to be shaking me down.
This is harassment.
FRYER:
You're in prison.
Subject to search whenever and wherever.
Why are you really here?
I know you're looking for something.
Why bother lying?
Okay.
I will play along.
Your brother... he robbed a transport van, killed two cops.
FRYER:
You already know that, don't ya?
Huh?
Listen, Kaleo, we know that you helped set this thing up, and we are here to prove that-- that's what we're gonna do.
Be my guest.
Okay.
You know, Williams...
What?
You mentioning my brother makes me nostalgic about family.
You got a kid, right?
How's she doing, anyway?
My daughter is doing fine.
Thank you.
Your brother Darryl, on the other hand, he's not doing so good.
He's dead.
FRYER:
Hey.
Look what we got here.
Cell phone.
You planted that.
It ain't mine.
I'm sure your prints are gonna be all over it.
So tell me... is this how you arranged the transport van's hijacking?
It is, isn't it?
You got questions, run them by my lawyer.
Okay, no problem.
Listen, um,... (whispering):
you know, last time I saw you...
I broke a couple of bones in your face, right?
You ever mention my daughter again...
I promise you I'm gonna come back here,
I'm gonna break every single bone in your body, okay?
You understand?
(slaps Kaleo's back) Put him back in his cage.
MARCH:
Interesting.
This explains why these diamonds were never reported missing.
Based on quality,
I would say... that this stone comes from the Republic of Liberia.
Are you sure?
Things change.
I mean, you've been locked up for 30 years.
30 years, 13 million years, this is an allotrope of carbon formed at high pressure and high temperature conditions.
That never changes.
This stone, my dear, comes from Africa.
Which leads me to believe that is is probably... a conflict diamond.
Blood diamonds... sold on the black market, and used to finance civil wars and genocide on the Africa coast.
Have you ever done business with people from Liberia?
No, no.
But...
I'm a student of the game.
The game never changes.
Just the players do.
Well, then that would explain the kidnapper's accent.
Exactly.
And that's why, if I were you,
I would check out Liberians here on temporary visas.
Okay.
We really appreciate the help.
This at least gives us an idea of who's holding Angela.
I wish you luck.
And feel free to call on me anytime.
Bye.
Mr. March.
Hmm?
I'm gonna need that diamond back.
The diamond?
!
(laughs)
Here we go.
Can't blame a guy for trying.
CHIN:
All the outbound calls off of Kaleo's cell phone are to his brother Darryl... with the exception of this one.
Okay, who's this one to?
CHIN:
TSA security line.
Hey, look at the time stamp.
FRYER: 30 minutes before Mary was arrested.
So Kaleo made the call that got Mary arrested and the diamonds seized.
He told him the description of the van, the route, so they could hijack it.
But the part of the puzzle we don't have is how they know about the Liberian smuggling operation in the first place.
I reached out to TSA.
I worked up a list of Liberians that are on the island on temporary visas.
It's not extensive.
That's him.
Bottom left.
That's the guy that kidnapped Angela.
(beeping)
KONO:
Jordan Nevins.
He landed on the island three days ago.
Okay, well, it looks like he didn't lie on his TSA entry form.
Just confirmed he's staying in the penthouse suite.
Let's go pay him a visit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?
Getting my vest.
No, I'll get your ve...
Uh, Chin?
Help him with the thing.
Hey, hey, Steve, come on over here a second.
What are you talking about?
What is that?
That was your birthday cake.
I was planning on taking it by the office.
Got sidetracked by this case.
Is that why you guys all stopped talking when I came in the office this morning?
Yeah.
Like usual, you figured out a way to ruin everything.
Thanks.
It's butter cream.
Butter cream's my favorite.
Move in!
Hey, hey!
I got Jordan.
Continue clearing.
All clear.
Bedroom's clear; no girl.
All right, where's Angela?
I-I don't know...
Hey!
Where's Angela?
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right, we'll see about that.
NEVINS:
I'm a Liberian citizen.
If you lay a finger on me,
I will have the consulate crawling so far up your...
That's a good idea.
And afterwards, I can tell your bosses that you lost their diamond shipment.
You seized some diamonds?
That look familiar?
It would take less than an hour for me to prepare a press release announcing the seizure of 20 million in conflict diamonds.
You know, it's funny, there's something about your body language right now that tells me that if that press release hits, you're gonna feel safer in here with us than you are out there on the street.
If I tell you everything, you gotta protect me and a promise of no deportation.
I'll be a dead man if you send me back to Liberia.
You got it.
Where's the girl?
(sighs)
I have no idea.
After our little charade at the hotel, we parted ways.
What are you talking about-- "charade"?
Angela faked her own kidnapping?
We didn't have a choice.
Angela was bumped from the flight at the last minute.
FRYER:
Let me guess, you had already told the people in New York the diamonds were on the flight.
I'm a facilitator.
I am paid to deliver the product to a buyer at a specific date and time.
And if that doesn't happen...
People like you get killed.
They had to, uh, use the other girl to make the drop as scheduled.
The other girl was my sister.
Did you know?
It was Angela's idea to scare her into doing it.
So, Angela and you worked together before?
NEVINS:
Yes.
She made several runs for me in the last few months, but nothing as large as this.
This is the first time for the both of us.
You've been played.
Angela probably set Mary up, so when the diamonds didn't get there, she wouldn't be blamed.
You and my sister Mary did.
No...
I doubt if Angela would...
double-cross me.
She's not smart enough to come up with something like this on her own.
Maybe she met somebody who was.
DANNY:
So, what was the plan?
You were gonna use your share of the dough to make an appeal?
Bribe a judge?
What?
It was worth a try.
Okay.
Where's Angela?
She's in the wind.
Where she lands, your guess is as good as mine.
Okay, how did she hook up with Darryl?
She's his ex-old lady.
She reached out to him with an opportunity to make a big score.
She just didn't want to get killed doing it.
And your brother turned to you for advice?
Advice?
Guess you could call it that.
I just figured a way for her and my brother to get rich.
All right, well, I'm gonna charge you with the death of those two cops.
What you just said, coupled with the phone records gives us enough-- more than enough-- to prove that you orchestrated the whole thing.
I'm doing life without, and there's no death penalty here in Hawaii.
Sorry to disappoint you, but another case is not going to make a difference to me.
That might be true, but since you've killed two more cops, you have lost your right to be housed in protective custody.
Isn't that true?
It is, it's true.
And (chuckles)...
believe me, uh, when you meet your new cell mate, life is going to get very interesting.
Wait, you can't do that.
Yes I can;
I just did.
Stand up.
Turn around, Sunshine.
Cuff him.
Hey... dead man walking.
(buzzer sounds)
♪ ♪
(sighs) I feel so stupid.
Mary, this happens to all of us.
I mean, people we think we can trust tell us lies.
I know, but I thought she was my friend.
Look, Angela's gonna resurface eventually.
She's gonna try to fence those diamonds.
And when she does, Interpol and the FBI are gonna be waiting for her.
It's only a matter of time, Mary.
She's on every country's watch list.
(quietly):
Wow.
All right, well, what-what now?
What about me?
You move on.
You pick yourself up.
You learn from your mistakes.
(sighs)
I honestly don't even know what to do with myself.
I...
I liked that job.
You know, I finally felt like
I was starting a new chapter in my life.
Well, you'll be happy to know that that chapter's still open for you.
What do you mean?
I spoke to the airline.
They know you're a victim in all this.
Your job's there if you want it.
It is?
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

We were gonna jump out and yell surprise, but then we figured what's the use?
Well, you should never surprise a man who is armed and who has extensive close-quarter battle training, anyway.
Ah, that's good to keep in mind.
I will also remember that.
STEVE:
Wow.
Here you go, birthday boy.
DANNY:
Happy birthday, buddy.
Thank you.
Guys, listen, I think we should just face the fact, that I'm not that easy to surprise.
You know?
Surprise!
(laughter)
Better than butter cream, right?
No, I'm good, thank you.
Okay.
So, I'd never heard anything like it before.
They said salt cake, I said, "What's the plan?"
MARCH:
I'm delighted you reached out to me, Angela.
I didn't have many options.
But with your help, this actually worked out better than I hoped.
Your diamonds.
It's been a pleasure.
Oh, believe me, the pleasure's all mine.
But there's one more thing you need to learn about this type of business.
As I said before... never turn your back on the buyer.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Now that you are ambassadors of my Father's kingdom,
You have thereby becomea class of men separate and distinct from all other men on earth.
You are not now as men among men but as the enlightened citizens of another country among the ignorant creatures of this dark world.

All we need to do is keep calm and we'll find a way out.
But what have we done to these people?
We've turned them into monsters!

Welcome to "The Voice"!
I'm Carson Daly, and the results of your votes are in tonight!
Say hello to your coaches...
Adam Levine.
[ Cheers and applause ] Way over beyonder, the one and only Blake Shelton!
We will see Cee Lo and
Christina in a few minutes.
What a show last night!
Each of our top 12 artists gave the performances of their lives.
Tonight, we'll find out which of them were saved by America's votes.
And for the fist time in "Voice" history, the bottom two artists, regardless of what team they belong to, will go home.
We have a big night tonight.
Country superstar Jason Aldean is here with his new single "The only way I know."
He'll be joined by two of our artists.
Coaches Cee Lo and Blake will each take the stage with their teams.
We are minutes away from the world premiere of Christina Aguilera's new single.
Before we get to it, let's take another look at the powerful performances from last night.
We are live with the top 12.
Tonight, the competition gets stiffer, but my team is the best team.
That's the truth.
You know, I consider you my favorite mistake.
I know you could win this entire thing.
That was probably your most emotional performance, you conveyed a message and connected with people.
You definitely had that breakout moment that really showed people how incredible you are.
Bryan put a smile on my face, 150% in my team's corner.
They are just amazing superstars.
♪
How can you guys not love this guy?
I agree with the girls.
Just waaaaa!
♪ Playful and so cute.
Adam loves girls that get up in his face.
He does.
You are just tried and true fearless.
Team Blake set the bar tonight.
Cassadee, that was my favorite performance from you thus far.
You just have this thing that people love you.
I always enjoy you.
You have become one of my favorites in this competition.
My heart is pounding right now because it was so good.
Holy crap, I can't even talk.
That was so good.
Ladies and gentlemen, please say hi to a gift to rock music.
I wish Terry had been on my team, but I'm telling you, team
Cee Lo is the team to beat.
You remind us that this is still fun.
You are so strange and beautiful.
Nicholas is special.
You can't argue with that.
You have a gift from God.
I never heard anything like it.
I'm humbled by your voice, man.
Your talent is immense.
It's our last three.
It's down to the wire.
And I just truly hope America makes the right choice. [ Cheers and applause ] Carson:
By the way, we had up precedent voting last night.
In fact, we received even more votes than our finale last season.
Plus, every single one of our top 12 charted on iTunes.
We are going to find out who you saved in just a bit.
And speaking of iTunes, here's something cool this season.
Downloading your favorite artist's songs could provide that artist with a big bonus.
For the first time, every song you download on iTunes from the live shows starting tonight and up until our finale, December 17th, will count toward that artist's final vote total.
That could be just what your favorites need to win it all.
Before we get to our eliminations, let's hear some music!
We are starting big tonight.
It's gonna be good, real quick.
Two superstar coaches are taking the stage for one incredible collaboration.
With the world premiere of
Christina's single, "Make the world move," give it up for Christina Aguilera, joined by

[ Cheers and applause ] Carson:
Our coaches, Christina Aguilera and
Cee Lo Green!
Christina's new album "Lotus" is out now.
That was awesome.
All right.
We will take our first break.
We will come back and find out the first two artists saved by your votes and the later, Cee Lo and Blake will join their teams on stage the very first time this season when "The Voice"
returns on NBC.
See you in a minute.
[ Cheers and applause ] Carson:
Welcome back to the live eliminations!
We are moments away from revealing the first two artists saved by America's votes.
But first let's take a minute and talk to our coaches.
Adam Levine, let's start with you.
Let's chat.
Carson:
Let's chat.
This is the first time in America, people watching, have 100% control what do you think of that?
I think that sucks, Carson.
I don't think that sucks, I love you, America.
You're going to make great choices.
It's not that cool though because we work with these guys and we love our team so much, so that's just tough to kind of relinquish that control, I'm a control freak.
It is tough to put it in the hands of the rest of the country.
However, I think it's good 'cause it's challenging.
As coaches, we really need to step it up and work it out or else they are going to go home and we can't control that maybe a double-edged sword, good and bad.
Carson:
Thank you, I think.
Cee Lo Green, is there an artist that surprised you last night?
[ Cheering ] You look tough. [ Laughter ]
Like a tough dude.
Usually, it's all the flowers.
Carson:
What did you think last night, Cee Lo, top 12 performances, anybody stand out?
- Um, yeah, yeah, there were definitely a couple of standouts.
I like Terry all of the time.
I love Terry.
I love Dez.
And I love Nicholas and Trevin.
Carson:
Well said.
Well played, sir.
Nice performance, too.
Christina Aguilera, congratulations on the release of your record "Lotus" today.
That was a lovely world-premiere performance. [ Cheers and applause] Who do you think of your coaches is your biggest competition?
You know, I have to say... [ Laughter ]
It's been a surprise.
One week, I thought maybe Adam was, because I know I wanted
Amanda.
Another week I was like, oh, my God it is all about Cee Lo and then Cassadee comes in on Blake's team and I'm like, wait a minute.
It's been all over the place.
Proves to be a good show though.
- Thank you very much.
Blake Shelton...
What?
[ Applause ]
Carson:
Do you... [ Applause ] Hey, buddy.
What you doing, buddy?
Carson:
Entertainer of the week.
Good to see you.
- Thank you.
Carson:
Thank you for being here.
You trust America's vote right now, they are going to make the right decision when this is all said and done?
It depends if all three of mine made it, absolutely I trust them. [ Laughter ]
If all three of my didn't, wrong.
Carson:
Blake, a little love for you.
For our top 12, winning "The"
"Voice" would mean finally fulfilling their dreams in music.
But many of them have realized that just getting to this point in the competition has already made a pretty big impact on their day-to-day lives.
Take a look.
How much has The Voice changed my life?
It's pretty dramatic actually.
Tons of people will come up to me in the street and say, "hey, were you on 'The Voice'?"
My fan base is starting to grow.
We've got Belew's crew.
We're got Cody's cougars.
They're a fun group.
To get recognized and asked for an autograph is, like, amazing.
But not so amazing when I'm looking, like, really rough.
For some reason, moms love me.
Someone told me that they want to get a tattoo of my face on their knee.
I think that's a bad decision, but I was flattered.
- An 80-year-old lady wanted to adopt me.
- People keep referring to me as "the mohawk girl."
You would not believe the broad spectrum of comments I get on the haircut.
This isn't a mullet.
See, it goes all the way around.
It comes down the sides.
Now, this... now, that's a mullet.
I've had people contacting me to marry me, which that's new for a 19-year-old.
- Do I have a lot of girls coming up to me?
How do I answer this?
I'm single right now, and let's see how that goes.
- This lady came up to me, and she was like, "oh, my Gawd."
"You're that girl, aren't ya?
I'm gonna kiss ya." I was like, "what?"
And before I could say no, her lips were already on my cheek.
- I was in the bathroom.
And this guy recognized me from the show, and he started, like, freaking out and freaking out.
And he barely has pants zipped up.
And he's like, "hey, man, can I"
get a picture with you?" And I said, "not in the bathroom, son."
Did he get a picture with you?
Once we got out of the bathroom, yes.
Carson:
Pipes in he waited until you got out of the bathroom.
Could be the beginning of a long career of dealing with all of that.
[ Applause ] All right.
It is time now to get down to business.
The top 12 artists stand with me now on stage.
Silvia, let's start with you.
You know, you told me that the song you performed last night was the first song you learned when you moved to America.
How did it feel to sing it to
America?
- It was definitely surreal.
I never imagined that I would be able to sing this song on such a huge stage so it is a huge honor to have gotten a chance.
[ Cheers and applause ] Carson:
You did a great job.
After the your performances last night, America voted.
And in my hand, I have the names of the first two artists who are safe and moving on to next week's live show.
Let's get to it.
[ Cheers and applause ] America has saved... from team Adam...
[ Applause ] Bryan Keith!
Team Christina...
Silvia Yacoub!
[ Applause ] Bryan and Silvia are moving on to next week's live show.
[ Cheers and applause ] Congratulations.
And an impromptu hug from her coach.
For the rest of you, of course, that means you are still at risk from being eliminated.
Wow.
Let's take a break.
When we come back, we are going to find two more artists saved by your votes.
Plus, Cee lo and Blake will join their teams for the very first time this season.
But first, a performance by country superstar Jason Aldean!
That's right after this.
You're watching "The Voice," live on NBC!
[ Cheers and applause ] Carson:
Welcome back to "The"
"Voice" live eliminations.
Before the break, we found out that Bryan Keith from team Adam and Silvia Yacoub from team Christina are safe and advancing to next week's live show.
We'll reveal more results in a bit.
But first, a performance by a country superstar with ten number one hits and sold out concerts all across the country.
Tonight, he's joined by Dez Duron and Bryan Keith.
With his single, "The only way I"
"know," give it up for Jason Aldean!

[ Cheers and applause ]
Thank you guys, very much.
Carson:
All right.
Let's bring out our ten remaining artists center stage and keep it moving on the live elimination show.
Thank you to Jason Aldean.
Let's chat with you, Adam.
You know, Adam, you said something interesting last night, Bryan Keith from your team came out here and said, you know, I think the right song at the right time is important on the show.
We have seen it happen before you said it happened with him last night and sure enough, America voted him through.
Some thoughts?
Yeah.
That's absolutely the case.
There's a lot of things.
It's very cumulative, over time, you build up those moments, hopefully that's the plan.
You have everyone's attention, especially as it gets down to the wire.
So, I think that you want to have as many of those as you can.
That's all you can ever hope for and Bryan had a great moment at a great time and he is moving ahead.
- Carson:
You are right.
- I'm not always right.
I'm wrong a lot, too.
- Carson:
In my hand, I have the names of the next two artists who are safe and moving on to next week's live show.
Here we go.
[ Cheers and applause ] America has saved, from team Cee Lo...
Nicholas David!
[ Applause ] America has also saved, from team Christina,
Dez Duron!
Congratulations, Nicholas and Dez are moving on to next week's top ten live show!
[ Cheers and applause ] And for the remaining eight artists on stage, that means they are all still at risk of being eliminated.
When we get back, wow, more of your saves revealed.
But first, coach Cee Lo Green and his team, for the first time this season, perform.
There's wigs, bell-bottoms, disco balls.
You're not gonna want to miss this.
"The Voice" continues, right after this.
[ Cheers and applause ] Carson:
Welcome back to "The Voice" live eliminations.
Nicholas David from team Cee Lo and Dez Duron from team Christina were saved by your votes.
Now eight artists remain and are at risk of elimination.
More of your saves coming up.
First, let's check in with Christina Milian up in the
Sprint sky box.
What's up?
Such a crazy night, a little bit of a pressure key, up in here.
I'm here with Jason Aldean, our saved artists, Bryan, Dez and Silvia.
Jason, you had the opportunity to perform with two of our artists, right here, actually.
How did the guys do?
Think they did great.
Usually, I do the song with Luke Bryan and Eric Church, obviously, they respect here tonight.
I think these guys stepped in well and obviously, America thinks they are pretty good, too.
Not too bad, guys.
Huge country superstar, any advice you have to give to these guys right here?
- I think the main thing as an artist is you got to be yourself and there's going to be a lot of people in the music business that try to shape you and change you into what they think you should be.
I think as an artist, you got to know what that is and stick to it.
I think that's the best advice I can give anybody.
Absolutely.
Now, as a country artist, I imagine you might know Blake, right?
How do you guys know each other?
Unfortunately, I have known Blake for que a while.
- Unfortunately?
Shut up!
You like me!
Say it!
We actually... first time I met Blake, we were actually on tour together, we were both opening acts for Rascal Flats back in about 2006.
- Nice.
[ Applause ] And... and see you guys may not remember this, but Blake used to have one of the gnarli mullets I have seen in my life.
I will have one for the end of the night.
- You were in shock, huh?
I took a really huge risk singing that song, but thank you guys so much.
I might have had a panic attack backstage.
- Well, congratulations to all you guys, I can't wait to see the rest.
Don't forget, tomorrow is the premiere of The Voice
Aftershow presented by Sprint, I will be hanging out in the top ten, finding out what you really want to know behind-the-scenes and anticipating all your burning questions. star in the house tonight.
All right. [ Applause ]
Let's get ready to go back in time with the '70s disco classic "Stayin' alive."
It's Cody Belew, Nicholas David and Trevin Hunte, joined by their coach...
Cee Lo Green!

Good job, fellas.

You can take your seat.
Let's bring out our remaining eight artist.
Thank you.
Great performance.
Let get back to business on a jam-packed elimination show live on NBC.
Blake Sheldon, we notice none of your artists are saved yet, are you nervous?
- When you say it like that, hell, yes, I am.

Coming up, we're gonna find out two more of your saves, but first, Blake's gonna perform with his team for the first time this season.
You are watching the live eliminations on NBC.
Don't go anywhere.
Carson:
Welcome back to The Voice.
The live eliminations continue.
We are moments away from revealing two more artists saved by your vote.
But first, coach Blake Shelton takes "The Voice" stage to join his team for the first time this season.

Carson:
Give it up, Cassadee, Michaela, Terry and their coach,
Blake Shelton.
Thank you, Blake.
Good to see you playing guitar.
While Blake settles back into his seat, let's bring back the six remaining artists on this live elimination show give them a second to get settled.
Cee Lo Green, good night for you.
Nicholas, Trevin, two of your guys, America has saved.
Do you think you're going to go 3-3 tonight?
- I really hope so.
I really hope so.
Cody, I would love for you to stay.
Carson:
Let's get to it.
I'm going to announce the names of two more artists saved by
America's votes.
The remaining four will still be at risk of going home.
Here we go.
America has saved... from team Blake...
Terry Mcdermott!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Five "Voice" artists remain.
Two go home tonight.
America has also saved... from team Adam...
Amanda Brown!
[ Cheers and applause] Terry and Amanda are moving on to next week's top ten live show.
And that leaves the four of you.
When we come back, two of these artists will be safe and move on.
Two will be go home.
We will find out how America voted next.
You're watching the live eliminations on "The Voice" on NBC.
We will be right back.
Carson:
Welcome back, everybody.
Four artists on "The Voice" now remain at risk for elimination.
Michaela, Adrianna, Cody, and Melanie.
[ Cheers and applause ] A couple of quick questions here while we have time.
Cody, Christina said maybe she missed a little bit of your energy last night.
Do you think that that might have had something to say with how America voted?
Well, um, I noticed she had her eyes shut most of the time I was singing so that's probably how she didn't know I was giving it all.
That was a joke.
You can laugh.
No, you know, for me, it's a bam bam, bam everything you do, whether it's a slow song or fast song.
I'm just wanting to continue in the competition.
- Carson:
Thank you, Cody.
Melanie, you described yourself as an outcast but you found a coach who believes in you, how does it feel to find somebody who sees something so special in you?
I didn't expect to get to this point and I'm just really grateful to be here.
So, if, like, I go out... [ applause ] I'm just super happy.
Carson:
The time has come.
Two of you were saved by America's votes and, therefore, advancing to America's live top ten show the other two will be leaving us tonight.
Here we go.
America has saved...
Cody Belew from team Cee Lo!
[ Applause ] Congratulations, Cody!
Kidding.
Nobody laughed.
I said you just had your eyes closed.
Carson:
And now, center stage, three "Voice" artists remain.
Only one more can move on to the live top ten next week.
Unfortunately, we have to say good-bye to one more.
America has also saved tonight...
Melanie Martinez from team Adam!
Please, put your hands together for Michaela and Adrianna, both exiting "The Voice," season three tonight.
You did an amazing job.
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.
Carson:
Let me talk to
Adrianna, any final words as you talk to your coach, Christina Aguilera?
What do you want to say to her?
Carson:
Go ahead.
- Thank you for being everything I could have wished for and more.
You're the best coach I could have ever asked for.
You believed in me more than I believed in myself.
So, thank you so much this is just the beginning.
- It is.
It is
- Carson:
Coach Christina, say something to Adrianna, mentioned last night, you were on "Star Search," you didn't whip, but what can you say?
Just that.
You know...
Cee Lo, you come on these shows and you know, at this point, you're going to go beyond this show.
This is only a moment in time that will pass and everyone's gonna see how amazingly talented this girl is yet to come.
[ Applause ] She still has yet to show the world how amazing she truly...
I know.
But I know you.
Carson:
Adrianna Louise, everybody.
Let me slide over, excuse me, Christina.
Michaela, my fellow radio deejay.
You have been such an inspiration to all of us.
People forget how young you are. 16 in this competition.
I'm sorry you leave us tonight, but a man with his arm around you who has, through three seasons of his show, shown how much he cares about his artists.
Tell me about Blake Shelton?
Honestly, you know, the moment he turned his chair around for me, I knew that I won.
And I know that... [ Applause ]
If I've inspired anybody out there, that's all that I came here to do follow your dreams and go after what you want.
Please.
[ Applause ] Carson:
Blake, some words for Michaela?
I love this...
I love this little girl so much.
And it's... it's just the... this is her first stab at this thing and she's gonna be a star.
You're gonna see her many times.
Her big old mohawk is going to be walking across the stage of the Grammys and I can't wait.
I can't wait.
I'm so glad that I had this one small chapter in your book.
Carson:
Thank you for being on our show, both of you.
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for the two leaving our show tonight, Adrianna Louise, Michaela Paige.
Let's bring out our top ten artists advancing to next week's live shows.
Here they come.
A big thank you to all of our coaches.
What a night.
Next week, we continue.
The top ten perform on Monday.
Wow.
Thank you for watching.
The live shows, 8/7 central, next Monday.
Thank you to all of our coaches, thanks to Paul Mirkovich and "The Voice Band", we'll see you next Monday right here on NBC.
Good night, America.
No, don't do it!
Don't do it!
No!
Hey, look who made it for happy hour.
I was just watching the feed from last weekend.
These customers, they're crazy.
They're getting their faces chewed off trying to save their Boy George album.
It's the end of the world.
You know, the last report said China got a handle on it.
China?
Right, that's right.
China's coming out here to save us.
You let me know how that turns out.
Oh yes.
- So where are you going?
- Cynthiana.
- Cynthiana?
What's there?
A woman?
- No, my kid sister.
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.
She's alive I just got a text from her 4 days ago.
4 days?
4 days might as well be 4 years.
She's with a group.
They've got a caravan that's leaving at dawn in DC.
You know, you...
you could come with us.
What the hell for?
Here, watch that.
Everybody predicted it.
Most people dreaded it.
Some crazy morons even celebrated it.
But, Chase...
You got to appreciate that you and me...
We are the chosen ones.
See, we get to be here, and watch the whole thing come tumbling down.
I gotta tell you something.
I am...
What is that word I am looking for?
I am humble.
Humble, to be part of it.
- You're ready to do this?
- You ready to give up one of those trucks?
Oh, well, I'll tell you what, Chase.
You...you scratch my back...
I'll see what I can do to get you on that caravan on time.
Hey, are you lost in there?
I see it.
Hold on.
Take one of those breaker boxes.
Ain't a rocket scientist.
Its a grey thing on the wall.
Yeah, I got it.
Dickhead.
*** the button go before you call someone a dickhead, dickhead.
Alright, open the panel.
There's a plastic flip marked number 2.
Flip it open when I give you the word.
When I give you the word.
Okay, flip it.
Flip it back.
Alright, flip it.
Okay, flip it back.
Flip it.
You got a few more seconds.
What did I tell you?
Easy peasy.
Oh, hey.
Sorry about Lennie.
I thought I put him down for good.
What about her?
You put her down too?
Kelly.
That's Kelly.
No, she called in sick the day that shit hit the fan.
*** with her boyfriend.
Or one of those things got her.
Either way, she's being eaten.
The others, they go out like Lennie?
Are you asking or telling?
I am asking if I can go now.
I'd like to hit the road while there's still light.
Grand idea, friend.
Why don't you take Lennie and his friends, take them out to the loading dock.
And tell me when you like a new burger.
It will be us more than the dead.
Now you wonder why were we so choked up about.
They're not mourning us.
All they do is eat.
Say hello to your sister for me.
Transcript by honeybunny
Previously on Revenge:
My mother's still alive.
Victoria's the only person left who could possibly tell me where she is.
- Mason Treadwell.
- I know who you are.
You wrote that book about David Clarke.
Thank you for taking an interest.
My father told me my mother died in an institution.
Why would he make me believe she was dead when she was obviously still alive?
- Because he was trying to protect you.
- Amanda...
Damn it.
Your mother tried to kill you.
That's a lie.
It is the absolute truth!
Aah!
(Gasps)
Jack, it's Amanda.
There's been an accident.
Mommy's here.
(Muffled screaming)
Come here.
(Crying)
It's okay.
Emily:
They say let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
(Voice echoes) Amanda!
(Grunts)
(Coughs, gasps)
Hang in there, Amanda.
Daddy's here.
Amanda!
And to be without sin requires absolute forgiveness.
Come on, baby.
Hang in there.
- Amanda!
- No!
Don't touch her!
Okay, come on.
Breathe.
Breathe, Amanda.
(Panting)
But when your memories are freshly opened wounds, forgiveness is the most unnatural of human emotions.
(Sighs)
You okay?
I know why my father lied to me.
Like always, he was protecting me.
Your father and I, we... share the same protective instinct.
The reason I didn't tell you I'd found Kara is because I wanted to make sure she couldn't hurt you.
There's something else you need to know about your mother.
Gordon Murphy wasn't just her savior.
He was her husband.
- No.
- She told me herself.
And after she tased me and left me to die,
I believe her.
I've been so driven to find her,
I never stopped to consider who she is.
Then you let me help you remember what you came here to do... avenge your father's death.
You're Takeda's proxy.
Use that to get inside Grayson Global and destabilize the company.
That's the best way to ferret them out.
Hey, you sure you're all right?
I needed someone.
You walked through the door.
Don't let it go to your head.
(Snipping)
Mrs. Grayson, there's someone here to see you.
Tell them I'm not accepting any visitors.
Kara:
Victoria.
Kara Clarke.
I'm so glad you're safe.
2x03 Forgiveness
Kara:
Such a beautiful home.
And so smart to build it right on the ocean.
You can always see your enemies coming.
Well, my enemies have become
- increasingly difficult to identify.
- Oh, I know.
I was so shocked to learn that the man that kidnapped you was the FBI agent you'd been working with.
He seemed like a good man.
All men are born hardwired to betray.
It's just a question of when.
Do they have any leads on his whereabouts?
No, they don't.
But I'm so relieved that you didn't fall victim to him as well.
Oh, no.
He gave me a new life, taught me how to live off the grid.
I hadn't seen him for twenty years.
Then he shows up a few months ago.
Why'd he go to you?
I don't know.
Did you file a statement with the authorities?
No.
I'm...
I'm sure you can appreciate why.
Yes.
Where do you think he is?
If he's wise, far, far away from here.
And as you pointed out, he's very gifted at the art of vanishing.
But I imagine your main concern is about Amanda.
Of course.
You've been so incredibly kind to her...
Bringing her into your home...
And in such a public way.
I never would've been able to find her otherwise.
Well, it was the least I could do for her, poor thing.
Tragedy and sorrow seem to follow her everywhere she goes.
Oh.
(Chuckles)
I'm such a dope.
May I wash up?
Aiden:
Well, I take no pleasure in saying this, but we fear Grayson Global may be an unrightable ship.
Your funds are being handled with the utmost discretion.
Discretion, or secrecy, rather, is the problem.
When Daniel first brought Mr. Takeda into the fold, he offered a hands-on approach.
And since the feud between you and your son was on full display at the board meeting last week, that which I do see does not inspire confidence.
Oh, the Graysons hail from a rather spirited bloodline.
Whatever disagreement you may have witnessed,
I assure you, there is no rift.
With all due respect, my employer requires greater assurances.
Ah.
(Beep) Daniel Grayson.
Son, I am sitting with Aiden Mathis,
Mr. Takeda's proxy.
I'd like you to make good on your promise of transparency and acquaint Aiden with all aspects of our organization.
I am sending him to you now.
(Cell phone rings)
(Ring) Excuse me.
(Ring)
(Beep) What is it, sweetheart?
I'm busy.
Too busy to deal with the fact that Kara Clarke is still alive?
Uh, thank you, Mr. Mathis.
Would you mind closing the door?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
(Door closes)
Is this a joke?
No, Conrad.
At this very moment, she's in our powder room washing blood off her hands, literally.
I thought Gordon Murphy took care of her decades ago.
- You've got to get rid of her.
- Oh, on the contrary.
I've asked her to stay for lunch.
Are you out of your mind?
Last I heard, Kara Clarke was a violent psychopath.
Don't you find it interesting that she suddenly reemerges one day after her daughter takes that fall?
She could be the source of the journals, the log-in sheet, everything.
I want to see you here in one hour.
[ Kurt Vile ] ♪ I won't be able... ♪
(Exhales deeply)
(Clatter)
- Hey, Declan.
- Hey.
I thought you should have this back.
- It was very gentlemanly of you.
- Oh, yeah.
We Porters are descended from a long line of gentlemen.
I'm headed to the hospital to check in on Amanda and the latest little Porter.
You want to come with?
Uh, you know, you might want to wait.
Jack said they may try to bring her out of it today.
Does that mean she's okay?
I hope so, for everyone's sake.
But I gotta get this stuff done so little Carl has a home to come back to.
Okay.
I guess I'll see you around.
I'm beginning to understand why you robbed me.
Girl like that's not gonna go for a Groupon.
You got it all wrong, man.
I barely even know her.
Hmm.
Satisfy my curiosity.
Why'd you do it?
I don't have the money to go to college, okay?
Right.
That'd make for one hell of an admissions essay...
"how I rolled houses for a brighter future."
You think I'm an idiot.
I get it.
On the contrary.
You remind me of myself at your age.
(Sighs) Call this guy.
He's got a certified crew that'll do the work here for half the price, twice as fast.
And why...
why would you help me?
'Cause I want my money back sooner than later.
And whatever you got in that little spray bottle is not getting the job done.
Call or don't call.
But if you want that pretty little rich girl to see you as more than a guy she rebelled with for one summer, and I can tell you do, you'll need that degree.
I gotta lay you down, buddy.
(Fusses)
Papa Porter.
Congrats, pal.
Hey.
Hey, how you holding up, huh?
- Uh, I'm a little tired.
- Hmm.
I bet.
How's Mama Mandy?
She's gettin' better by the minute.
(Carl fusses)
Uh, wow, Jack.
That is one hell of a swaddle.
Oh, well, get this.
His grandmother taught me.
What, your mom's back?
Not mine.
Hers.
Y...
You're...
- You're not serious.
- I know, right?
As if things aren't messy enough.
Oh, uh, they...
They do hourly checks.
Eh, say no more.
I, uh, have to go see someone anyway.
Hang in there, pal.
Aiden:
Encouraging numbers.
You should also read the analysis.
Why?
Would it tell me a different story?
It will if my dad took a pass... (Door opens) Daniel, an alert's come through the system.
Ashley Davenport, Aiden Mathis.
Charmed.
We didn't officially get to meet the other day.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Aiden is Mr. Takeda's proxy.
My father asked me to acquaint him with all things Grayson Global.
So whatever you have to say, feel free to say it.
Personnel's flagged an outside request for David Clarke's employment contract.
That's right.
A bona fide terrorist used to work here.
That's something we try hard to forget.
Who's looking for it?
I don't know.
Maybe a meeting might be prudent.
Set it up.
Let's see who's suddenly curious.
- Now back to the quarterlies.
- Suddenly,
I'm more interested in this company's more historic associations.
Why don't we introduce Mr. Mathis to the power of the corporate card?
Drinks tonight at Rinellas?
(Cell phone rings)
(Ring)
(Ring)
(Beep)
(Cell phone rings)
(Ring)
(Beep)
Hello?
Someone's interested in your father's contract at Grayson Global.
Any reason to think it's your mother?
I don't even know where she is.
I've checked every hotel and hostel in the area.
Did you check the Graysons'?
Conrad took a phone call from Victoria, paled at the sound of her voice.
(Pounding on door)
Nolan:
Emily!
Keep me posted.
(Beep)
(Seagulls calling)
Way to keep me out of the loop, Ems.
Your mother's summering in the Hamptons?
Who told you that?
Jack, who's currently registering a 6 on the freak-o-meter.
Me?
I'm at 9, which must put you at infinity times infinity.
I don't have time for this.
Well, assuming you don't have time to check your messages either.
Otherwise you'd know that, uh...
My dad died.
(Exhales) Oh, my God, Nolan.
Look, I know he wasn't murdered in prison or accused of a crime he didn't commit, still...
(Chuckles)
Turns out he loved me.
(Sighs) I should've been there for you.
I'm sorry.
Hmm.
Mm, it's okay.
But enough about that.
Tell me about Kara Clarke.
All I can tell you is that she thinks Amanda is her daughter.
That's good for...
revenge-y stuff, but sad for you.
I'm sorry, Ems.
(Pressing keys)
Let's see.
(Conrad) So what are your plans, Ms. Clarke?
(Victoria) I should hope that you'd stay with us.
She's staying at the Graysons'?
You think it's safe here?
What about your kidnapper?
That man is nothing more than a slippery coward who wouldn't have the guts to darken our doorstep.
Even if he did, he'd be shot on sight.
In other words, so long as you remain under our roof, you'll be safe.
No place like home.
Huh, Auntie Ems?
(Cell phone rings)
(Ring)
(Beep) Hey, Jack.
Emily, the doctors are ready.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
(Beep)
Amanda's out of her coma.
(Sighs) Well, that's good.
Right?
It is until my mother hears the news.
She's not out of the woods yet.
Jack:
Hey, welcome back.
We got someone here who wants to meet you.
(Whispers) Oh, my God.
(Carl fussing)
(Voice breaks) That's him?
Is he okay?
(Crying and fussing)
This is your mommy.
(Exhales)
(Whispers) Oh.
(Continues crying)
He's so little.
Don't worry.
He's tougher than he looks, like his mom.
I didn't know the two of you would be here when I woke up.
Well, we're here.
Neither one of us is going anywhere.
All right?
Thanks for coming back to us.
I couldn't do this alone.
Welcome back, Amanda.
(Sighs)
We're gonna go home soon, okay?
Where's Mommy?
What do you remember last?
- We were swimming.
- Mm-hmm.
Do you know how sometimes when people get sick, no matter how hard they try and no matter how many doctors help, they just aren't able to get better?
But Mommy said she was better.
She wanted to be.
She wanted that more than anything.
But I... she just...
she wasn't strong enough.
Where is she?
She's... gone.
Okay?
I'm so sorry, honey.
(Carl continues crying)
I'll let you two get acquainted.
(Mouths word)
(Sighs deeply)
You must be so relieved.
Look, I know The Stowaway's not open yet, and Amanda still has a bunch of stuff at my house, so they're welcome to stay with me temporarily.
Are you sure?
Carl has a lot of stuff for someone who only weighs 7 pounds.
(Chuckles) I'll always have a room for him.
(Mouths word)
Have you called Amanda's mom yet?
I wanted to wait until I told her that she was back.
That's a good idea.
And you should go home, take a break...
Change your clothes.
(Chuckles) I stink?
Eh, a shower wouldn't kill you.
(Laughs)
Thanks, Emily.
(Carl crying)
Hey, I'm, uh, I'm running home for a bit, but Emily's here if you need anything, okay?
Congratulations.
He's somethin'.
Yeah.
He is.
We're survivors.
Amanda, I had no right to put you in that situation.
I'm so sorry.
So the hunt for your mother is over?
She's back, Amanda.
- She showed up last night.
- Good.
So at least it wasn't all for nothing.
(Knock on door)
Ms. Clarke?
You ready to come with me for those last few tests?
Mm-hmm.
I can look after Carl if you wanna go.
Is that where David lived?
He told me that he had fallen in love with the woman next door.
I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.
Well, thinking about David always makes me uncomfortable.
I imagine that's something we both share.
Why did you save me all those years ago?
A lot of women would've felt threatened by me.
Although...
(Chuckles)
Technically, you're the other woman, not me.
You know, he led me to believe that you were dead for the longest time.
Obviously, we both fell prey to David's deception.
And now Gordon's.
Mom?
I just got off the phone with the hospital.
Amanda's awake and okay.
Charlotte, this is Amanda's mother, Kara Clarke.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'll come back and bring my things.
(Whispers) Thank you.
- You asked her to stay with us?
- Temporarily, yes.
I feel so bad about what happened to her daughter that I just wanted to help out.
Wow.
Maybe you have changed.
(Spraying)
Oh, Dec!
What the hell, man?
It smells terrible in here.
I know.
I'm doing the best I can with what we have... pops.
(Chuckles)
How's Amanda?
She's good.
She's good.
We're, uh... we're good.
Good.
That's good.
Yeah, well, something's gotta be when I'm standing in the place that's supposed to be making us our living and paying these hospital bills.
I know.
Um, Kenny stopped by today with a plan "b."
He says that that guy can get done what we need fast and cheap.
I like the sound of that.
Yeah, me, too, only my judgment's been a little bit off lately and... (Chuckles) Yeah, well,
I wanted to wait for your okay.
Well, he's a businessman who wants his money.
Why have us waste any more of it, right?
I'll give this guy a call right now.
- Thank you for coming in.
I'm Daniel Gray...
- Daniel Grayson.
I know.
Padma Lahari, Nolcorp C.F.O.
I hope everything's okay?
Why wouldn't it be?
In my experience, when a simple request gets an outsized response, either something's wrong or I've won something.
Have I won something?
Let's see what we're playing first, shall we?
Please, sit.
I understand you're looking for information about David Clarke.
Yes.
I need to corroborate his initial terms of employment at Grayson Global.
I hope you can understand the sensitivity we still feel over the unfortunate association this company has with such a man.
Yes.
I imagine it can be quite tricky.
Tell me, what do the terms of Mr. Clarke's employment at a Wall Street investment firm have to do with a tech company like Nolcorp?
I wanted to make sure that when Nolcorp invested in Grayson Global years ago that David Clarke wasn't on the account.
It wouldn't do to have a terrorist handling our finances, would it?
I'll look into it and get back to you.
I'm much obliged.
So that explains that.
I'm not sure it does.
Tyler tried to land Nolcorp last summer for the first time, which means they've never invested with us before.
(Knocks on doorframe)
Are we still on for drinks?
(Carl fussing)
Where are you taking my grandson?
I was just trying to settle him.
I'm his godmother.
I'm Kara,
Amanda's actual mother.
May I?
Don't worry.
He knows his family.
Ohh.
Amanda was the same way, always happy in her Mommy's arms.
Oh!
The perfect little baby boy.
What was Amanda like as a kid?
She...
She was so gentle.
She wouldn't even let me kill a spider.
No matter how big or small,
I had to catch it in a glass and set it free outside.
She just always had this innate goodness.
Does she ever talk about me?
Honestly, no.
When was the last time you saw her?
Well, now that is a fascinating question.
Oh, please allow me to introduce myself.
Mason Treadwell.
And is it possible that you're Kara Clarke?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
God, I love the Hamptons.
You see, I was inexorably drawn back here in pursuit of the truth behind your daughter's recent welcome into the Grayson fold, which makes your appearance...
How shall I say it?
A revelation.
Are you for real?
Oh, I am, my dear, and so wonderfully are you.
The years have been kind, Kara.
Where have you been?
Away.
Oh, that's one of my favorite places.
If you don't mind my asking, why let your daughter think that you were deceased these last two decades?
(Whispers) I do.
(Normal voice) I do mind you asking.
Wow.
When you get a C.A.T. Scan, you throw me a party.
(Mason chuckles) Well, admittedly, I'm a crasher, but one who only brings well-wishes.
What the hell are you doing here?
Paying my respects, of course.
Please, allow me.
(Sighs)
Please.
I think you've done quite enough, Mason.
I'll come back.
(Sighs)
Amanda, sweetie...
Do you remember me?
(Carl crying)
- I think Carl's hungry.
- I'll bring him to you.
Oh, sweetheart.
(Crying)
Shh.
Shh.
Kara, I think we should let these two rest.
When Amanda's released, she'll be staying with me for a few days.
Perhaps you'd like to come visit in the morning?
Yes.
Maybe I could drive you home.
She didn't recognize me.
I really thought she would.
Can't imagine how that must feel.
- Have you read Treadwell's book?
- Mm.
I still can't accept that David was capable of such terrible things.
He was my high school sweetheart.
(Chuckles) Can you believe that?
You never know when or how you'll meet your true love.
He was only my first love.
There's a difference.
Well, at least David didn't destroy Amanda.
No.
He didn't.
(Siren wailing)
I know I've been A.W.O.L., but...
I just became an uncle.
Well, one of those non-uncle uncles, like Kracker or Fester.
Pretty sure fester actually was Gomez's older brother.
All right, you pass.
Where did you get this?
It was amongst your father's memorabilia.
You did nothing with it?
No.
Why?
- Should I?
- Nope.
I'll take care of it, but...
Not before I take you to breakfast.
(Laughs) But it's 10:00 at night, Nolan.
Then we've got some time to kill.
(Chuckles)
To a growing relationship, both business and personal.
(Clink) Well, tell that to my dad.
The company's falling apart, and he leaves before lunch.
Which is something
I'm sure you wouldn't want me to convey to Mr. Takeda.
You see, this is why we English are stereotyped as reserved.
Candor runs the risk of brooking discontent.
Oh, well, the American way is truth, honesty...
And a tiny bladder.
Oh.
(Chuckles)
Now if you'll excuse me, I... (Imitates British accent) Need to use the loo.
(Laughs) Very good.
You make a nice couple.
What about you?
Anyone special?
Well, the nomadic lifestyle doesn't allow for much permanence, I'm afraid.
Although Mr. Takeda did mention somebody that I should look up.
Uh, a miss, um...
Emily...
Thorpe?
- Thorne.
- Ah.
She and Daniel used to be engaged.
Well, leave it to me to step in it.
Oh, no, you didn't.
She did.
She cheated on him.
Well, to, uh, your good fortune and, um, maybe mine.
We nomads have little need for fidelity, so I may ring her up.
(Sighs)
You can't be here.
But you told me to keep you posted.
(Keys clatter)
No, I mean, you can't be here.
(Closes drawer) My mother is next door.
She sees you, our cover's blown... not just with her but with the Graysons, which would never have happened if you hadn't gone to see her in the first place.
(Sighs) What do you want?
To inform you that the inquiry about your father's contract came from a woman named Padma Lahari, claiming to be Nolcorp's C.F.O.
She pulls that thread, it could expose the source of your wealth.
I liquidated my Nolcorp stock years ago.
But this could be bad for Nolan.
Well, he's not my concern.
Well, he's mine.
What's she doing?
(Cell phone rings)
That's his phone, isn't it?
(Ring)
(Ring) You had it all along.
Answer that phone and it will be the last thing you ever do.
- You wanna do this alone?
- Fine.
But you'll soon find out I make a far better partner than enemy.
How long until high tide?
20 minutes?
I like living on the edge of...
The land, the water, of the honeydew.
(Cell phone rings)
(Ring)
(Ring)
(Ring)
(Ring)
(Ring, beep)
Morning, sunshine.
We need to talk.
I've been trying to get ahold of you all night.
Mm.
Sounds serious.
Need my help?
No.
You need mine.
I'm already shocked.
Someone from your company asked Daniel about my father's investment.
Nolan, it was Padma.
You okay?
Then drink up before we're underwater.
Jack:
Just one night, I promise.
(Emily) Not a problem.
Jack:
All right.
(Carl fussing)
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take off and go to The Stowaway, okay?
Okay.
Thanks again.
Is everything okay?
Depends who you ask.
Jack seems happy with his little Carl.
But every time I see him holding the baby, I just...
I wanna tell him the truth, that Carl isn't his.
But, of course, I have to deal with your mom first.
All you have to do is tell her the truth, that you don't know who she is and she has to leave.
You spent all this time, risked my life looking for her, and now you just want her to leave?
(Sighs deeply)
While you were recovering, a memory came back to me.
When I was 5, my mother tried to kill me.
She succeeded, actually.
She drowned me.
My father had to bring me back to life.
(Whispers) How could a mother do that?
Maybe someday I'll know, but for now... (Exhales deeply)
The best thing for us, and especially for Carl, is that she leaves.
Call her.
(Knock on door)
(Sighs)
See, that's the thing about martinis.
Two's not enough, four is too many.
I could use another drink after the morning we're having.
You should tell Takeda to take his money and run.
But that would debilitate Grayson Global.
Well, maybe we deserve it.
I know how you feel about your father.
It's obvious that's why you want us to divest.
I feel the same way about the chains that bind me.
So?
I may have something.
It's about the Nolcorp request.
Okay, how do you know about that?
Because I'm ambitious, same as you.
When David Clarke worked here, he ran venture capital, right?
What if Nolan Ross came to him for start-up money?
But he didn't, or there'd be a record of it.
Not if the money he invested came from a personal account.
See, I think the young lady from Nolcorp was trying to sniff out whether or not Clarke's contract contained an exclusivity clause.
Which it would have.
They all do.
Which means he was working on behalf of the company, regardless of where the capital came from.
Which also means...
This company has a controlling interest in Nolcorp.
We play this right, we guarantee two things... me a seat here on the board, and you...
The seat behind your father's desk.
(Exhales)
Put me through to personnel.
Archives.
(Grunts)
(Groans)
There may be no sadder sight than a woman attempting to rob her own house.
Unless, of course, you misplaced something, like the dead woman who I hear has been sleeping in this bed.
Though being dead is de rigueur around here these days.
You should try it sometime, Mason.
- And how did you get in here?
- Every maid has her price, especially when grotesquely underpaid.
I read your Vanity Fair article.
It was like gazing at your lovely visage, Victoria... the most elegant blend of fact and fiction.
What do you want?
What do any of us want?
The truth.
I came to unearth it about your ludicrous kidnapping story, but now I've stumbled across something that's far juicier.
Now if memory serves, you told me that Kara Clarke was dead.
I honestly believed that.
Do you... gag a little when you say that? "Honestly"?
I think you've failed to understand the threat Kara poses to all of us.
She may know the truth about David, in which case, she will take you down along with us.
I think I'll be fine.
(Knocks on doorframe)
(Mouths words)
(Whispers) Sorry.
I'll leave you two alone.
(Whispers) I'll be right here.
Kara:
I... (Clears throat)
I understand if you want nothing to do with me.
So I'll just...
I'll just say my piece then go.
Despite... all the odds against you, you survived.
And you've grown into an amazing, amazing young woman.
You're strong.
You're independent.
You're... (Voice breaks) You're everything that I... could ever have hoped for you to be.
You need to know that, um,
I was very sick...
for a long time.
(Inhales sharply) And I w...
I was not fully in control of my actions.
(Crying)
And...
Your father and I made a choice...
One that I knew I would h...
have to live with.
(Kisses)
You need to tell her I died.
It'll be better for her if she thinks I'm gone.
Kara:
Somehow, your father found it in his heart to forgive me.
(Crying)
Oh.
(Sighs deeply)
(Gasps)
(Sniffles) Wait.
I forgive you, too.
Jack:
So this is it.
We're in the clear.
(Chuckles) We can finally start paying you back.
Well... there may be a bigger opportunity here.
Frankly, I've always wanted to be in the bar business.
You wanna buy it?
I will forgive your kid brother's debt if you let me.
(Sighs)
I asked around, Jack, heard what this place did to you.
Your mom left.
Your dad died.
So you wanna pull 14-hour shifts or you wanna spend quality time with your beautiful family?
Okay.
Let's talk.
I knew you were smart.
Well...
What'd the inspector say?
There's the boy wonder.
Dec, we're back in business and we couldn't have done it without you.
Are you seriously reading a book?
Yeah, it calms me.
You should try it.
Well, I found this hidden in Kara's room.
(Cell phone beeps) There's one number on it.
That's Gordon Murphy's number.
Mm-hmm.
She's made calls out.
None came in.
Kara's been feeding him information.
Too many people know our secrets, Conrad.
And if they surface, the Initiative is going to come after us... and worse, our children.
I don't know who to turn to.
You can turn to me, of course.
Oh, please.
Victoria Grayson, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?
- Again.
- What is the matter with you?
Just let me finish.
To have and to hold, and to be legally bound so that we may never be compelled to testify against each other in a court of law.
I'm sorry about what I said to your mom.
Forgiving her, it just...
came out.
Don't be.
You did the right thing.
I need to tell you something about Carl.
I lied to you.
Jack really is the father.
(Exhales)
Oh, my God.
Why would you do that to me?
I guess I felt like I needed to keep you on my side.
After everything we've been through?
Maybe because of it.
I know I haven't given you any reason to believe this.
I'm so sorry.
Me, too.
I knew you had feelings for Jack when I tricked him into believing I was you.
And now I have this incredible family.
(Sniffles) It's not fair.
You deserve better, and...
Jack deserves the truth.
Jack deserves happiness.
If you tell him the truth now, it'll only break his heart all over again.

Over time, we commit acts with intentions, either good or bad, that require forgiveness.

I think my family could've been happy here.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
It's okay.
Who knows?
Maybe David wouldn't have made the mistakes he made.
Maybe none of us would have.
Trust me.
Just as many mistakes are made here.
Do you think she really forgives me?
I think she wants to.
Just the woman I was looking for.
A quick raid of my research confirmed that you had a terrible scar from a burn you had suffered in a foster care fire... one that I couldn't help but notice is now missing.
I had it removed.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
From what part of your body?
(Chuckles)
Why do you care, Mason?
I think you and I both know the answer to that question, my dear.
You may be many things to many people... the latest, it would seem, a young mother to an infant boy.
But the daughter of Kara Wallace and David Clarke?
(Grunts)
That is one thing that you most definitely are not.
[ Whistling "Strangers in the Night" ]
Previously on Revenge:
My mother's still alive.
Victoria's the only person left who could possibly tell me where she is.
- Mason Treadwell.
- I know who you are.
You wrote that book about David Clarke.
Thank you for taking an interest.
My father told me my mother died in an institution.
Why would he make me believe she was dead when she was obviously still alive?
- Because he was trying to protect you.
- Amanda...
Damn it.
Your mother tried to kill you.
That's a lie.
It is the absolute truth!
Aah!
Jack, it's Amanda.
There's been an accident.
Mommy's here.
Come here.
It's okay.
They say let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
Amanda!
Hang in there, Amanda.
Daddy's here.
Amanda!
And to be without sin requires absolute forgiveness.
Come on, baby.
Hang in there.
- Amanda!
- No!
Don't touch her!
Okay, come on.
Breathe.
Breathe, Amanda.
But when your memories are freshly opened wounds, forgiveness is the most unnatural of human emotions.
You okay?
I know why my father lied to me.
Like always, he was protecting me.
Your father and I, we... share the same protective instinct.
The reason I didn't tell you I'd found Kara is because I wanted to make sure she couldn't hurt you.
There's something else you need to know about your mother.
Gordon Murphy wasn't just her savior.
He was her husband.
- No.
- She told me herself.
And after she tased me and left me to die,
I believe her.
I've been so driven to find her,
I never stopped to consider who she is.
Then you let me help you remember what you came here to do... avenge your father's death.
You're Takeda's proxy.
Use that to get inside Grayson Global and destabilize the company.
That's the best way to ferret them out.
Hey, you sure you're all right?
I needed someone.
You walked through the door.
Don't let it go to your head.
Mrs. Grayson, there's someone here to see you.
Tell them I'm not accepting any visitors.
Victoria.
Kara Clarke.
I'm so glad you're safe.
2x03 Forgiveness
Such a beautiful home.
And so smart to build it right on the ocean.
You can always see your enemies coming.
Well, my enemies have become
- increasingly difficult to identify.
- Oh, I know.
I was so shocked to learn that the man that kidnapped you was the FBI agent you'd been working with.
He seemed like a good man.
All men are born hardwired to betray.
It's just a question of when.
Do they have any leads on his whereabouts?
No, they don't.
But I'm so relieved that you didn't fall victim to him as well.
Oh, no.
He gave me a new life, taught me how to live off the grid.
I hadn't seen him for twenty years.
Then he shows up a few months ago.
Why'd he go to you?
I don't know.
Did you file a statement with the authorities?
No.
I'm...
I'm sure you can appreciate why.
Yes.
Where do you think he is?
If he's wise, far, far away from here.
And as you pointed out, he's very gifted at the art of vanishing.
But I imagine your main concern is about Amanda.
Of course.
You've been so incredibly kind to her...
Bringing her into your home...
And in such a public way.
I never would've been able to find her otherwise.
Well, it was the least I could do for her, poor thing.
Tragedy and sorrow seem to follow her everywhere she goes.
Oh.
I'm such a dope.
May I wash up?
Well, I take no pleasure in saying this, but we fear Grayson Global may be an unrightable ship.
Your funds are being handled with the utmost discretion.
Discretion, or secrecy, rather, is the problem.
When Daniel first brought Mr. Takeda into the fold, he offered a hands-on approach.
And since the feud between you and your son was on full display at the board meeting last week, that which I do see does not inspire confidence.
Oh, the Graysons hail from a rather spirited bloodline.
Whatever disagreement you may have witnessed,
I assure you, there is no rift.
With all due respect, my employer requires greater assurances.
Ah.
Daniel Grayson.
Son, I am sitting with Aiden Mathis,
Mr. Takeda's proxy.
I'd like you to make good on your promise of transparency and acquaint Aiden with all aspects of our organization.
I am sending him to you now.
Excuse me.
What is it, sweetheart?
I'm busy.
Too busy to deal with the fact that Kara Clarke is still alive?
Uh, thank you, Mr. Mathis.
Would you mind closing the door?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Is this a joke?
No, Conrad.
At this very moment, she's in our powder room washing blood off her hands, literally.
I thought Gordon Murphy took care of her decades ago.
- You've got to get rid of her.
- Oh, on the contrary.
I've asked her to stay for lunch.
Are you out of your mind?
Last I heard, Kara Clarke was a violent psychopath.
Don't you find it interesting that she suddenly reemerges one day after her daughter takes that fall?
She could be the source of the journals, the log-in sheet, everything.
I want to see you here in one hour.
[ Kurt Vile ] ♪ I won't be able... ♪
- Hey, Declan.
- Hey.
I thought you should have this back.
- It was very gentlemanly of you.
- Oh, yeah.
We Porters are descended from a long line of gentlemen.
I'm headed to the hospital to check in on Amanda and the latest little Porter.
You want to come with?
Uh, you know, you might want to wait.
Jack said they may try to bring her out of it today.
Does that mean she's okay?
I hope so, for everyone's sake.
But I gotta get this stuff done so little Carl has a home to come back to.
Okay.
I guess I'll see you around.
I'm beginning to understand why you robbed me.
Girl like that's not gonna go for a Groupon.
You got it all wrong, man.
I barely even know her.
Hmm.
Satisfy my curiosity.
Why'd you do it?
I don't have the money to go to college, okay?
Right.
That'd make for one hell of an admissions essay...
"how I rolled houses for a brighter future."
You think I'm an idiot.
I get it.
On the contrary.
You remind me of myself at your age.
Call this guy.
He's got a certified crew that'll do the work here for half the price, twice as fast.
And why...
why would you help me?
'Cause I want my money back sooner than later.
And whatever you got in that little spray bottle is not getting the job done.
Call or don't call.
But if you want that pretty little rich girl to see you as more than a guy she rebelled with for one summer, and I can tell you do, you'll need that degree.
I gotta lay you down, buddy.
Papa Porter.
Congrats, pal.
Hey.
Hey, how you holding up, huh?
- Uh, I'm a little tired.
- Hmm.
I bet.
How's Mama Mandy?
She's gettin' better by the minute.
Uh, wow, Jack.
That is one hell of a swaddle.
Oh, well, get this.
His grandmother taught me.
What, your mom's back?
Not mine.
Hers.
Y...
You're...
- You're not serious.
- I know, right?
As if things aren't messy enough.
Oh, uh, they...
They do hourly checks.
Eh, say no more.
I, uh, have to go see someone anyway.
Hang in there, pal.
Encouraging numbers.
You should also read the analysis.
Why?
Would it tell me a different story?
It will if my dad took a pass...
Daniel, an alert's come through the system.
Ashley Davenport, Aiden Mathis.
Charmed.
We didn't officially get to meet the other day.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Aiden is Mr. Takeda's proxy.
My father asked me to acquaint him with all things Grayson Global.
So whatever you have to say, feel free to say it.
Personnel's flagged an outside request for David Clarke's employment contract.
That's right.
A bona fide terrorist used to work here.
That's something we try hard to forget.
Who's looking for it?
I don't know.
Maybe a meeting might be prudent.
Set it up.
Let's see who's suddenly curious.
- Now back to the quarterlies.
- Suddenly,
I'm more interested in this company's more historic associations.
Why don't we introduce Mr. Mathis to the power of the corporate card?
Drinks tonight at Rinellas?
Hello?
Someone's interested in your father's contract at Grayson Global.
Any reason to think it's your mother?
I don't even know where she is.
I've checked every hotel and hostel in the area.
Did you check the Graysons'?
Conrad took a phone call from Victoria, paled at the sound of her voice.
Emily!
Keep me posted.
Way to keep me out of the loop, Ems.
Your mother's summering in the Hamptons?
Who told you that?
Jack, who's currently registering a 6 on the freak-o-meter.
Me?
I'm at 9, which must put you at infinity times infinity.
I don't have time for this.
Well, assuming you don't have time to check your messages either.
Otherwise you'd know that, uh...
My dad died.
Oh, my God, Nolan.
Look, I know he wasn't murdered in prison or accused of a crime he didn't commit, still...
Turns out he loved me.
I should've been there for you.
I'm sorry.
Hmm.
Mm, it's okay.
But enough about that.
Tell me about Kara Clarke.
All I can tell you is that she thinks Amanda is her daughter.
That's good for...
revenge-y stuff, but sad for you.
I'm sorry, Ems.
Let's see.
So what are your plans, Ms. Clarke?
I should hope that you'd stay with us.
She's staying at the Graysons'?
You think it's safe here?
What about your kidnapper?
That man is nothing more than a slippery coward who wouldn't have the guts to darken our doorstep.
Even if he did, he'd be shot on sight.
In other words, so long as you remain under our roof, you'll be safe.
No place like home.
Huh, Auntie Ems?
Hey, Jack.
Emily, the doctors are ready.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Amanda's out of her coma.
Well, that's good.
Right?
It is until my mother hears the news.
She's not out of the woods yet.
Hey, welcome back.
We got someone here who wants to meet you.
Oh, my God.
That's him?
Is he okay?
This is your mommy.
Oh.
He's so little.
Don't worry.
He's tougher than he looks, like his mom.
I didn't know the two of you would be here when I woke up.
Well, we're here.
Neither one of us is going anywhere.
All right?
Thanks for coming back to us.
I couldn't do this alone.
Welcome back, Amanda.
We're gonna go home soon, okay?
Where's Mommy?
What do you remember last?
- We were swimming.
- Mm-hmm.
Do you know how sometimes when people get sick, no matter how hard they try and no matter how many doctors help, they just aren't able to get better?
But Mommy said she was better.
She wanted to be.
She wanted that more than anything.
But I... she just...
she wasn't strong enough.
Where is she?
She's... gone.
Okay?
I'm so sorry, honey.
I'll let you two get acquainted.
You must be so relieved.
Look, I know The Stowaway's not open yet, and Amanda still has a bunch of stuff at my house, so they're welcome to stay with me temporarily.
Are you sure?
Carl has a lot of stuff for someone who only weighs 7 pounds.
I'll always have a room for him.
Have you called Amanda's mom yet?
I wanted to wait until I told her that she was back.
That's a good idea.
And you should go home, take a break...
Change your clothes.
I stink?
Eh, a shower wouldn't kill you.
Thanks, Emily.
Hey, I'm, uh, I'm running home for a bit, but Emily's here if you need anything, okay?
Congratulations.
He's somethin'.
Yeah.
He is.
We're survivors.
Amanda, I had no right to put you in that situation.
I'm so sorry.
So the hunt for your mother is over?
She's back, Amanda.
- She showed up last night.
- Good.
So at least it wasn't all for nothing.
Ms. Clarke?
You ready to come with me for those last few tests?
Mm-hmm.
I can look after Carl if you wanna go.
Is that where David lived?
He told me that he had fallen in love with the woman next door.
I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.
Well, thinking about David always makes me uncomfortable.
I imagine that's something we both share.
Why did you save me all those years ago?
A lot of women would've felt threatened by me.
Although...
Technically, you're the other woman, not me.
You know, he led me to believe that you were dead for the longest time.
Obviously, we both fell prey to David's deception.
And now Gordon's.
Mom?
I just got off the phone with the hospital.
Amanda's awake and okay.
Charlotte, this is Amanda's mother, Kara Clarke.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'll come back and bring my things.
Thank you.
- You asked her to stay with us?
- Temporarily, yes.
I feel so bad about what happened to her daughter that I just wanted to help out.
Wow.
Maybe you have changed.
Oh, Dec!
What the hell, man?
It smells terrible in here.
I know.
I'm doing the best I can with what we have... pops.
How's Amanda?
She's good.
She's good.
We're, uh... we're good.
Good.
That's good.
Yeah, well, something's gotta be when I'm standing in the place that's supposed to be making us our living and paying these hospital bills.
I know.
Um, Kenny stopped by today with a plan "b."
He says that that guy can get done what we need fast and cheap.
I like the sound of that.
Yeah, me, too, only my judgment's been a little bit off lately and...
Yeah, well,
I wanted to wait for your okay.
Well, he's a businessman who wants his money.
Why have us waste any more of it, right?
I'll give this guy a call right now.
- Thank you for coming in.
I'm Daniel Gray...
- Daniel Grayson.
I know.
Padma Lahari, Nolcorp C.F.O.
I hope everything's okay?
Why wouldn't it be?
In my experience, when a simple request gets an outsized response, either something's wrong or I've won something.
Have I won something?
Let's see what we're playing first, shall we?
Please, sit.
I understand you're looking for information about David Clarke.
Yes.
I need to corroborate his initial terms of employment at Grayson Global.
I hope you can understand the sensitivity we still feel over the unfortunate association this company has with such a man.
Yes.
I imagine it can be quite tricky.
Tell me, what do the terms of Mr. Clarke's employment at a Wall Street investment firm have to do with a tech company like Nolcorp?
I wanted to make sure that when Nolcorp invested in Grayson Global years ago that David Clarke wasn't on the account.
It wouldn't do to have a terrorist handling our finances, would it?
I'll look into it and get back to you.
I'm much obliged.
So that explains that.
I'm not sure it does.
Tyler tried to land Nolcorp last summer for the first time, which means they've never invested with us before.
Are we still on for drinks?
Where are you taking my grandson?
I was just trying to settle him.
I'm his godmother.
I'm Kara,
Amanda's actual mother.
May I?
Don't worry.
He knows his family.
Ohh.
Amanda was the same way, always happy in her Mommy's arms.
Oh!
The perfect little baby boy.
What was Amanda like as a kid?
She...
She was so gentle.
She wouldn't even let me kill a spider.
No matter how big or small,
I had to catch it in a glass and set it free outside.
She just always had this innate goodness.
Does she ever talk about me?
Honestly, no.
When was the last time you saw her?
Well, now that is a fascinating question.
Oh, please allow me to introduce myself.
Mason Treadwell.
And is it possible that you're Kara Clarke?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
God, I love the Hamptons.
You see, I was inexorably drawn back here in pursuit of the truth behind your daughter's recent welcome into the Grayson fold, which makes your appearance...
How shall I say it?
A revelation.
Are you for real?
Oh, I am, my dear, and so wonderfully are you.
The years have been kind, Kara.
Where have you been?
Away.
Oh, that's one of my favorite places.
If you don't mind my asking, why let your daughter think that you were deceased these last two decades?
I do.
I do mind you asking.
Wow.
When you get a C.A.T. Scan, you throw me a party.
Well, admittedly, I'm a crasher, but one who only brings well-wishes.
What the hell are you doing here?
Paying my respects, of course.
Please, allow me.
Please.
I think you've done quite enough, Mason.
I'll come back.
Amanda, sweetie...
Do you remember me?
- I think Carl's hungry.
- I'll bring him to you.
Oh, sweetheart.
Shh.
Shh.
Kara, I think we should let these two rest.
When Amanda's released, she'll be staying with me for a few days.
Perhaps you'd like to come visit in the morning?
Yes.
Maybe I could drive you home.
She didn't recognize me.
I really thought she would.
Can't imagine how that must feel.
- Have you read Treadwell's book?
- Mm.
I still can't accept that David was capable of such terrible things.
He was my high school sweetheart.
Can you believe that?
You never know when or how you'll meet your true love.
He was only my first love.
There's a difference.
Well, at least David didn't destroy Amanda.
No.
He didn't.
I know I've been A.W.O.L., but...
I just became an uncle.
Well, one of those non-uncle uncles, like Kracker or Fester.
Pretty sure fester actually was Gomez's older brother.
All right, you pass.
Where did you get this?
It was amongst your father's memorabilia.
You did nothing with it?
No.
Why?
- Should I?
- Nope.
I'll take care of it, but...
Not before I take you to breakfast.
But it's 10:00 at night, Nolan.
Then we've got some time to kill.
To a growing relationship, both business and personal.
Well, tell that to my dad.
The company's falling apart, and he leaves before lunch.
Which is something
I'm sure you wouldn't want me to convey to Mr. Takeda.
You see, this is why we English are stereotyped as reserved.
Candor runs the risk of brooking discontent.
Oh, well, the American way is truth, honesty...
And a tiny bladder.
Oh.
Now if you'll excuse me, I...
Need to use the loo.
Very good.
You make a nice couple.
What about you?
Anyone special?
Well, the nomadic lifestyle doesn't allow for much permanence, I'm afraid.
Although Mr. Takeda did mention somebody that I should look up.
Uh, a miss, um...
Emily...
Thorpe?
- Thorne.
- Ah.
She and Daniel used to be engaged.
Well, leave it to me to step in it.
Oh, no, you didn't.
She did.
She cheated on him.
Well, to, uh, your good fortune and, um, maybe mine.
We nomads have little need for fidelity, so I may ring her up.
You can't be here.
But you told me to keep you posted.
No, I mean, you can't be here.
My mother is next door.
She sees you, our cover's blown... not just with her but with the Graysons, which would never have happened if you hadn't gone to see her in the first place.
What do you want?
To inform you that the inquiry about your father's contract came from a woman named Padma Lahari, claiming to be Nolcorp's C.F.O.
She pulls that thread, it could expose the source of your wealth.
I liquidated my Nolcorp stock years ago.
But this could be bad for Nolan.
Well, he's not my concern.
Well, he's mine.
What's she doing?
That's his phone, isn't it?
You had it all along.
Answer that phone and it will be the last thing you ever do.
- You wanna do this alone?
- Fine.
But you'll soon find out I make a far better partner than enemy.
How long until high tide?
20 minutes?
I like living on the edge of...
The land, the water, of the honeydew.
Morning, sunshine.
We need to talk.
I've been trying to get ahold of you all night.
Mm.
Sounds serious.
Need my help?
No.
You need mine.
I'm already shocked.
Someone from your company asked Daniel about my father's investment.
Nolan, it was Padma.
You okay?
Then drink up before we're underwater.
Just one night, I promise.
Not a problem.
All right.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take off and go to The Stowaway, okay?
Okay.
Thanks again.
Is everything okay?
Depends who you ask.
Jack seems happy with his little Carl.
But every time I see him holding the baby, I just...
I wanna tell him the truth, that Carl isn't his.
But, of course, I have to deal with your mom first.
All you have to do is tell her the truth, that you don't know who she is and she has to leave.
You spent all this time, risked my life looking for her, and now you just want her to leave?
While you were recovering, a memory came back to me.
When I was 5, my mother tried to kill me.
She succeeded, actually.
She drowned me.
My father had to bring me back to life.
How could a mother do that?
Maybe someday I'll know, but for now...
The best thing for us, and especially for Carl, is that she leaves.
Call her.
See, that's the thing about martinis.
Two's not enough, four is too many.
I could use another drink after the morning we're having.
You should tell Takeda to take his money and run.
But that would debilitate Grayson Global.
Well, maybe we deserve it.
I know how you feel about your father.
It's obvious that's why you want us to divest.
I feel the same way about the chains that bind me.
So?
I may have something.
It's about the Nolcorp request.
Okay, how do you know about that?
Because I'm ambitious, same as you.
When David Clarke worked here, he ran venture capital, right?
What if Nolan Ross came to him for start-up money?
But he didn't, or there'd be a record of it.
Not if the money he invested came from a personal account.
See, I think the young lady from Nolcorp was trying to sniff out whether or not Clarke's contract contained an exclusivity clause.
Which it would have.
They all do.
Which means he was working on behalf of the company, regardless of where the capital came from.
Which also means...
This company has a controlling interest in Nolcorp.
We play this right, we guarantee two things... me a seat here on the board, and you...
The seat behind your father's desk.
Put me through to personnel.
Archives.
There may be no sadder sight than a woman attempting to rob her own house.
Unless, of course, you misplaced something, like the dead woman who I hear has been sleeping in this bed.
Though being dead is de rigueur around here these days.
You should try it sometime, Mason.
- And how did you get in here?
- Every maid has her price, especially when grotesquely underpaid.
I read your Vanity Fair article.
It was like gazing at your lovely visage, Victoria... the most elegant blend of fact and fiction.
What do you want?
What do any of us want?
The truth.
I came to unearth it about your ludicrous kidnapping story, but now I've stumbled across something that's far juicier.
Now if memory serves, you told me that Kara Clarke was dead.
I honestly believed that.
Do you... gag a little when you say that? "Honestly"?
I think you've failed to understand the threat Kara poses to all of us.
She may know the truth about David, in which case, she will take you down along with us.
I think I'll be fine.
Sorry.
I'll leave you two alone.
I'll be right here.
I...
I understand if you want nothing to do with me.
So I'll just...
I'll just say my piece then go.
Despite... all the odds against you, you survived.
And you've grown into an amazing, amazing young woman.
You're strong.
You're independent.
You're...
You're everything that I... could ever have hoped for you to be.
You need to know that, um,
I was very sick...
for a long time.
And I w...
I was not fully in control of my actions.
And...
Your father and I made a choice...
One that I knew I would h...
have to live with.
You need to tell her I died.
It'll be better for her if she thinks I'm gone.
Somehow, your father found it in his heart to forgive me.
Oh.
Wait.
I forgive you, too.
So this is it.
We're in the clear.
We can finally start paying you back.
Well... there may be a bigger opportunity here.
Frankly, I've always wanted to be in the bar business.
You wanna buy it?
I will forgive your kid brother's debt if you let me.
I asked around, Jack, heard what this place did to you.
Your mom left.
Your dad died.
So you wanna pull 14-hour shifts or you wanna spend quality time with your beautiful family?
Okay.
Let's talk.
I knew you were smart.
Well...
What'd the inspector say?
There's the boy wonder.
Dec, we're back in business and we couldn't have done it without you.
Are you seriously reading a book?
Yeah, it calms me.
You should try it.
Well, I found this hidden in Kara's room.
There's one number on it.
That's Gordon Murphy's number.
Mm-hmm.
She's made calls out.
None came in.
Kara's been feeding him information.
Too many people know our secrets, Conrad.
And if they surface, the Initiative is going to come after us... and worse, our children.
I don't know who to turn to.
You can turn to me, of course.
Oh, please.
Victoria Grayson, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?
- Again.
- What is the matter with you?
Just let me finish.
To have and to hold, and to be legally bound so that we may never be compelled to testify against each other in a court of law.
I'm sorry about what I said to your mom.
Forgiving her, it just...
came out.
Don't be.
You did the right thing.
I need to tell you something about Carl.
I lied to you.
Jack really is the father.
Oh, my God.
Why would you do that to me?
I guess I felt like I needed to keep you on my side.
After everything we've been through?
Maybe because of it.
I know I haven't given you any reason to believe this.
I'm so sorry.
Me, too.
I knew you had feelings for Jack when I tricked him into believing I was you.
And now I have this incredible family.
It's not fair.
You deserve better, and...
Jack deserves the truth.
Jack deserves happiness.
If you tell him the truth now, it'll only break his heart all over again.
Over time, we commit acts with intentions, either good or bad, that require forgiveness.

I think my family could've been happy here.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
It's okay.
Who knows?
Maybe David wouldn't have made the mistakes he made.
Maybe none of us would have.
Trust me.
Just as many mistakes are made here.
Do you think she really forgives me?
I think she wants to.
Just the woman I was looking for.
A quick raid of my research confirmed that you had a terrible scar from a burn you had suffered in a foster care fire... one that I couldn't help but notice is now missing.
I had it removed.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
From what part of your body?
Why do you care, Mason?
I think you and I both know the answer to that question, my dear.
You may be many things to many people... the latest, it would seem, a young mother to an infant boy.
But the daughter of Kara Wallace and David Clarke?
That is one thing that you most definitely are not.
[ Whistling "Strangers in the Night" ]
Previously on Revenge:
My mother's still alive.
Victoria's the only person left who could possibly tell me where she is.
- Mason Treadwell.
- I know who you are.
You wrote that book about David Clarke.
Thank you for taking an interest.
My father told me my mother died in an institution.
Why would he make me believe she was dead when she was obviously still alive?
- Because he was trying to protect you.
- Amanda...
Damn it.
Your mother tried to kill you.
That's a lie.
It is the absolute truth!
Aah!
Jack, it's Amanda.
There's been an accident.
Mommy's here.
Come here.
It's okay.
They say let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
Amanda!
Hang in there, Amanda.
Daddy's here.
Amanda!
And to be without sin requires absolute forgiveness.
Come on, baby.
Hang in there.
- Amanda!
- No!
Don't touch her!
Okay, come on.
Breathe.
Breathe, Amanda.
But when your memories are freshly opened wounds, forgiveness is the most unnatural of human emotions.
You okay?
I know why my father lied to me.
Like always, he was protecting me.
Your father and I, we... share the same protective instinct.
The reason I didn't tell you I'd found Kara is because I wanted to make sure she couldn't hurt you.
There's something else you need to know about your mother.
Gordon Murphy wasn't just her savior.
He was her husband.
- No.
- She told me herself.
And after she tased me and left me to die,
I believe her.
I've been so driven to find her,
I never stopped to consider who she is.
Then you let me help you remember what you came here to do... avenge your father's death.
You're Takeda's proxy.
Use that to get inside Grayson Global and destabilize the company.
That's the best way to ferret them out.
Hey, you sure you're all right?
I needed someone.
You walked through the door.
Don't let it go to your head.
Mrs. Grayson, there's someone here to see you.
Tell them I'm not accepting any visitors.
Victoria.
Kara Clarke.
I'm so glad you're safe.
2x03 Forgiveness
Such a beautiful home.
And so smart to build it right on the ocean.
You can always see your enemies coming.
Well, my enemies have become
- increasingly difficult to identify.
- Oh, I know.
I was so shocked to learn that the man that kidnapped you was the FBI agent you'd been working with.
He seemed like a good man.
All men are born hardwired to betray.
It's just a question of when.
Do they have any leads on his whereabouts?
No, they don't.
But I'm so relieved that you didn't fall victim to him as well.
Oh, no.
He gave me a new life, taught me how to live off the grid.
I hadn't seen him for twenty years.
Then he shows up a few months ago.
Why'd he go to you?
I don't know.
Did you file a statement with the authorities?
No.
I'm...
I'm sure you can appreciate why.
Yes.
Where do you think he is?
If he's wise, far, far away from here.
And as you pointed out, he's very gifted at the art of vanishing.
But I imagine your main concern is about Amanda.
Of course.
You've been so incredibly kind to her...
Bringing her into your home...
And in such a public way.
I never would've been able to find her otherwise.
Well, it was the least I could do for her, poor thing.
Tragedy and sorrow seem to follow her everywhere she goes.
Oh.
I'm such a dope.
May I wash up?
Well, I take no pleasure in saying this, but we fear Grayson Global may be an unrightable ship.
Your funds are being handled with the utmost discretion.
Discretion, or secrecy, rather, is the problem.
When Daniel first brought Mr. Takeda into the fold, he offered a hands-on approach.
And since the feud between you and your son was on full display at the board meeting last week, that which I do see does not inspire confidence.
Oh, the Graysons hail from a rather spirited bloodline.
Whatever disagreement you may have witnessed,
I assure you, there is no rift.
With all due respect, my employer requires greater assurances.
Ah.
Daniel Grayson.
Son, I am sitting with Aiden Mathis,
Mr. Takeda's proxy.
I'd like you to make good on your promise of transparency and acquaint Aiden with all aspects of our organization.
I am sending him to you now.
Excuse me.
What is it, sweetheart?
I'm busy.
Too busy to deal with the fact that Kara Clarke is still alive?
Uh, thank you, Mr. Mathis.
Would you mind closing the door?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Is this a joke?
No, Conrad.
At this very moment, she's in our powder room washing blood off her hands, literally.
I thought Gordon Murphy took care of her decades ago.
- You've got to get rid of her.
- Oh, on the contrary.
I've asked her to stay for lunch.
Are you out of your mind?
Last I heard, Kara Clarke was a violent psychopath.
Don't you find it interesting that she suddenly reemerges one day after her daughter takes that fall?
She could be the source of the journals, the log-in sheet, everything.
I want to see you here in one hour.
[ Kurt Vile ] ♪ I won't be able... ♪
- Hey, Declan.
- Hey.
I thought you should have this back.
- It was very gentlemanly of you.
- Oh, yeah.
We Porters are descended from a long line of gentlemen.
I'm headed to the hospital to check in on Amanda and the latest little Porter.
You want to come with?
Uh, you know, you might want to wait.
Jack said they may try to bring her out of it today.
Does that mean she's okay?
I hope so, for everyone's sake.
But I gotta get this stuff done so little Carl has a home to come back to.
Okay.
I guess I'll see you around.
I'm beginning to understand why you robbed me.
Girl like that's not gonna go for a Groupon.
You got it all wrong, man.
I barely even know her.
Hmm.
Satisfy my curiosity.
Why'd you do it?
I don't have the money to go to college, okay?
Right.
That'd make for one hell of an admissions essay...
"how I rolled houses for a brighter future."
You think I'm an idiot.
I get it.
On the contrary.
You remind me of myself at your age.
Call this guy.
He's got a certified crew that'll do the work here for half the price, twice as fast.
And why...
why would you help me?
'Cause I want my money back sooner than later.
And whatever you got in that little spray bottle is not getting the job done.
Call or don't call.
But if you want that pretty little rich girl to see you as more than a guy she rebelled with for one summer, and I can tell you do, you'll need that degree.
I gotta lay you down, buddy.
Papa Porter.
Congrats, pal.
Hey.
Hey, how you holding up, huh?
- Uh, I'm a little tired.
- Hmm.
I bet.
How's Mama Mandy?
She's gettin' better by the minute.
Uh, wow, Jack.
That is one hell of a swaddle.
Oh, well, get this.
His grandmother taught me.
What, your mom's back?
Not mine.
Hers.
Y...
You're...
- You're not serious.
- I know, right?
As if things aren't messy enough.
Oh, uh, they...
They do hourly checks.
Eh, say no more.
I, uh, have to go see someone anyway.
Hang in there, pal.
Encouraging numbers.
You should also read the analysis.
Why?
Would it tell me a different story?
It will if my dad took a pass...
Daniel, an alert's come through the system.
Ashley Davenport, Aiden Mathis.
Charmed.
We didn't officially get to meet the other day.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Aiden is Mr. Takeda's proxy.
My father asked me to acquaint him with all things Grayson Global.
So whatever you have to say, feel free to say it.
Personnel's flagged an outside request for David Clarke's employment contract.
That's right.
A bona fide terrorist used to work here.
That's something we try hard to forget.
Who's looking for it?
I don't know.
Maybe a meeting might be prudent.
Set it up.
Let's see who's suddenly curious.
- Now back to the quarterlies.
- Suddenly,
I'm more interested in this company's more historic associations.
Why don't we introduce Mr. Mathis to the power of the corporate card?
Drinks tonight at Rinellas?
Hello?
Someone's interested in your father's contract at Grayson Global.
Any reason to think it's your mother?
I don't even know where she is.
I've checked every hotel and hostel in the area.
Did you check the Graysons'?
Conrad took a phone call from Victoria, paled at the sound of her voice.
Emily!
Keep me posted.
Way to keep me out of the loop, Ems.
Your mother's summering in the Hamptons?
Who told you that?
Jack, who's currently registering a 6 on the freak-o-meter.
Me?
I'm at 9, which must put you at infinity times infinity.
I don't have time for this.
Well, assuming you don't have time to check your messages either.
Otherwise you'd know that, uh...
My dad died.
Oh, my God, Nolan.
Look, I know he wasn't murdered in prison or accused of a crime he didn't commit, still...
Turns out he loved me.
I should've been there for you.
I'm sorry.
Hmm.
Mm, it's okay.
But enough about that.
Tell me about Kara Clarke.
All I can tell you is that she thinks Amanda is her daughter.
That's good for...
revenge-y stuff, but sad for you.
I'm sorry, Ems.
Let's see.
So what are your plans, Ms. Clarke?
I should hope that you'd stay with us.
She's staying at the Graysons'?
You think it's safe here?
What about your kidnapper?
That man is nothing more than a slippery coward who wouldn't have the guts to darken our doorstep.
Even if he did, he'd be shot on sight.
In other words, so long as you remain under our roof, you'll be safe.
No place like home.
Huh, Auntie Ems?
Hey, Jack.
Emily, the doctors are ready.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Amanda's out of her coma.
Well, that's good.
Right?
It is until my mother hears the news.
She's not out of the woods yet.
Hey, welcome back.
We got someone here who wants to meet you.
Oh, my God.
That's him?
Is he okay?
This is your mommy.
Oh.
He's so little.
Don't worry.
He's tougher than he looks, like his mom.
I didn't know the two of you would be here when I woke up.
Well, we're here.
Neither one of us is going anywhere.
All right?
Thanks for coming back to us.
I couldn't do this alone.
Welcome back, Amanda.
We're gonna go home soon, okay?
Where's Mommy?
What do you remember last?
- We were swimming.
- Mm-hmm.
Do you know how sometimes when people get sick, no matter how hard they try and no matter how many doctors help, they just aren't able to get better?
But Mommy said she was better.
She wanted to be.
She wanted that more than anything.
But I... she just...
she wasn't strong enough.
Where is she?
She's... gone.
Okay?
I'm so sorry, honey.
I'll let you two get acquainted.
You must be so relieved.
Look, I know The Stowaway's not open yet, and Amanda still has a bunch of stuff at my house, so they're welcome to stay with me temporarily.
Are you sure?
Carl has a lot of stuff for someone who only weighs 7 pounds.
I'll always have a room for him.
Have you called Amanda's mom yet?
I wanted to wait until I told her that she was back.
That's a good idea.
And you should go home, take a break...
Change your clothes.
I stink?
Eh, a shower wouldn't kill you.
Thanks, Emily.
Hey, I'm, uh, I'm running home for a bit, but Emily's here if you need anything, okay?
Congratulations.
He's somethin'.
Yeah.
He is.
We're survivors.
Amanda, I had no right to put you in that situation.
I'm so sorry.
So the hunt for your mother is over?
She's back, Amanda.
- She showed up last night.
- Good.
So at least it wasn't all for nothing.
Ms. Clarke?
You ready to come with me for those last few tests?
Mm-hmm.
I can look after Carl if you wanna go.
Is that where David lived?
He told me that he had fallen in love with the woman next door.
I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.
Well, thinking about David always makes me uncomfortable.
I imagine that's something we both share.
Why did you save me all those years ago?
A lot of women would've felt threatened by me.
Although...
Technically, you're the other woman, not me.
You know, he led me to believe that you were dead for the longest time.
Obviously, we both fell prey to David's deception.
And now Gordon's.
Mom?
I just got off the phone with the hospital.
Amanda's awake and okay.
Charlotte, this is Amanda's mother, Kara Clarke.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'll come back and bring my things.
Thank you.
- You asked her to stay with us?
- Temporarily, yes.
I feel so bad about what happened to her daughter that I just wanted to help out.
Wow.
Maybe you have changed.
Oh, Dec!
What the hell, man?
It smells terrible in here.
I know.
I'm doing the best I can with what we have... pops.
How's Amanda?
She's good.
She's good.
We're, uh... we're good.
Good.
That's good.
Yeah, well, something's gotta be when I'm standing in the place that's supposed to be making us our living and paying these hospital bills.
I know.
Um, Kenny stopped by today with a plan "b."
He says that that guy can get done what we need fast and cheap.
I like the sound of that.
Yeah, me, too, only my judgment's been a little bit off lately and...
Yeah, well,
I wanted to wait for your okay.
Well, he's a businessman who wants his money.
Why have us waste any more of it, right?
I'll give this guy a call right now.
- Thank you for coming in.
I'm Daniel Gray...
- Daniel Grayson.
I know.
Padma Lahari, Nolcorp C.F.O.
I hope everything's okay?
Why wouldn't it be?
In my experience, when a simple request gets an outsized response, either something's wrong or I've won something.
Have I won something?
Let's see what we're playing first, shall we?
Please, sit.
I understand you're looking for information about David Clarke.
Yes.
I need to corroborate his initial terms of employment at Grayson Global.
I hope you can understand the sensitivity we still feel over the unfortunate association this company has with such a man.
Yes.
I imagine it can be quite tricky.
Tell me, what do the terms of Mr. Clarke's employment at a Wall Street investment firm have to do with a tech company like Nolcorp?
I wanted to make sure that when Nolcorp invested in Grayson Global years ago that David Clarke wasn't on the account.
It wouldn't do to have a terrorist handling our finances, would it?
I'll look into it and get back to you.
I'm much obliged.
So that explains that.
I'm not sure it does.
Tyler tried to land Nolcorp last summer for the first time, which means they've never invested with us before.
Are we still on for drinks?
Where are you taking my grandson?
I was just trying to settle him.
I'm his godmother.
I'm Kara,
Amanda's actual mother.
May I?
Don't worry.
He knows his family.
Ohh.
Amanda was the same way, always happy in her Mommy's arms.
Oh!
The perfect little baby boy.
What was Amanda like as a kid?
She...
She was so gentle.
She wouldn't even let me kill a spider.
No matter how big or small,
I had to catch it in a glass and set it free outside.
She just always had this innate goodness.
Does she ever talk about me?
Honestly, no.
When was the last time you saw her?
Well, now that is a fascinating question.
Oh, please allow me to introduce myself.
Mason Treadwell.
And is it possible that you're Kara Clarke?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
God, I love the Hamptons.
You see, I was inexorably drawn back here in pursuit of the truth behind your daughter's recent welcome into the Grayson fold, which makes your appearance...
How shall I say it?
A revelation.
Are you for real?
Oh, I am, my dear, and so wonderfully are you.
The years have been kind, Kara.
Where have you been?
Away.
Oh, that's one of my favorite places.
If you don't mind my asking, why let your daughter think that you were deceased these last two decades?
I do.
I do mind you asking.
Wow.
When you get a C.A.T. Scan, you throw me a party.
Well, admittedly, I'm a crasher, but one who only brings well-wishes.
What the hell are you doing here?
Paying my respects, of course.
Please, allow me.
Please.
I think you've done quite enough, Mason.
I'll come back.
Amanda, sweetie...
Do you remember me?
- I think Carl's hungry.
- I'll bring him to you.
Oh, sweetheart.
Shh.
Shh.
Kara, I think we should let these two rest.
When Amanda's released, she'll be staying with me for a few days.
Perhaps you'd like to come visit in the morning?
Yes.
Maybe I could drive you home.
She didn't recognize me.
I really thought she would.
Can't imagine how that must feel.
- Have you read Treadwell's book?
- Mm.
I still can't accept that David was capable of such terrible things.
He was my high school sweetheart.
Can you believe that?
You never know when or how you'll meet your true love.
He was only my first love.
There's a difference.
Well, at least David didn't destroy Amanda.
No.
He didn't.
I know I've been A.W.O.L., but...
I just became an uncle.
Well, one of those non-uncle uncles, like Kracker or Fester.
Pretty sure fester actually was Gomez's older brother.
All right, you pass.
Where did you get this?
It was amongst your father's memorabilia.
You did nothing with it?
No.
Why?
- Should I?
- Nope.
I'll take care of it, but...
Not before I take you to breakfast.
But it's 10:00 at night, Nolan.
Then we've got some time to kill.
To a growing relationship, both business and personal.
Well, tell that to my dad.
The company's falling apart, and he leaves before lunch.
Which is something
I'm sure you wouldn't want me to convey to Mr. Takeda.
You see, this is why we English are stereotyped as reserved.
Candor runs the risk of brooking discontent.
Oh, well, the American way is truth, honesty...
And a tiny bladder.
Oh.
Now if you'll excuse me, I...
Need to use the loo.
Very good.
You make a nice couple.
What about you?
Anyone special?
Well, the nomadic lifestyle doesn't allow for much permanence, I'm afraid.
Although Mr. Takeda did mention somebody that I should look up.
Uh, a miss, um...
Emily...
Thorpe?
- Thorne.
- Ah.
She and Daniel used to be engaged.
Well, leave it to me to step in it.
Oh, no, you didn't.
She did.
She cheated on him.
Well, to, uh, your good fortune and, um, maybe mine.
We nomads have little need for fidelity, so I may ring her up.
You can't be here.
But you told me to keep you posted.
No, I mean, you can't be here.
My mother is next door.
She sees you, our cover's blown... not just with her but with the Graysons, which would never have happened if you hadn't gone to see her in the first place.
What do you want?
To inform you that the inquiry about your father's contract came from a woman named Padma Lahari, claiming to be Nolcorp's C.F.O.
She pulls that thread, it could expose the source of your wealth.
I liquidated my Nolcorp stock years ago.
But this could be bad for Nolan.
Well, he's not my concern.
Well, he's mine.
What's she doing?
That's his phone, isn't it?
You had it all along.
Answer that phone and it will be the last thing you ever do.
- You wanna do this alone?
- Fine.
But you'll soon find out I make a far better partner than enemy.
How long until high tide?
20 minutes?
I like living on the edge of...
The land, the water, of the honeydew.
Morning, sunshine.
We need to talk.
I've been trying to get ahold of you all night.
Mm.
Sounds serious.
Need my help?
No.
You need mine.
I'm already shocked.
Someone from your company asked Daniel about my father's investment.
Nolan, it was Padma.
You okay?
Then drink up before we're underwater.
Just one night, I promise.
Not a problem.
All right.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take off and go to The Stowaway, okay?
Okay.
Thanks again.
Is everything okay?
Depends who you ask.
Jack seems happy with his little Carl.
But every time I see him holding the baby, I just...
I wanna tell him the truth, that Carl isn't his.
But, of course, I have to deal with your mom first.
All you have to do is tell her the truth, that you don't know who she is and she has to leave.
You spent all this time, risked my life looking for her, and now you just want her to leave?
While you were recovering, a memory came back to me.
When I was 5, my mother tried to kill me.
She succeeded, actually.
She drowned me.
My father had to bring me back to life.
How could a mother do that?
Maybe someday I'll know, but for now...
The best thing for us, and especially for Carl, is that she leaves.
Call her.
See, that's the thing about martinis.
Two's not enough, four is too many.
I could use another drink after the morning we're having.
You should tell Takeda to take his money and run.
But that would debilitate Grayson Global.
Well, maybe we deserve it.
I know how you feel about your father.
It's obvious that's why you want us to divest.
I feel the same way about the chains that bind me.
So?
I may have something.
It's about the Nolcorp request.
Okay, how do you know about that?
Because I'm ambitious, same as you.
When David Clarke worked here, he ran venture capital, right?
What if Nolan Ross came to him for start-up money?
But he didn't, or there'd be a record of it.
Not if the money he invested came from a personal account.
See, I think the young lady from Nolcorp was trying to sniff out whether or not Clarke's contract contained an exclusivity clause.
Which it would have.
They all do.
Which means he was working on behalf of the company, regardless of where the capital came from.
Which also means...
This company has a controlling interest in Nolcorp.
We play this right, we guarantee two things... me a seat here on the board, and you...
The seat behind your father's desk.
Put me through to personnel.
Archives.
There may be no sadder sight than a woman attempting to rob her own house.
Unless, of course, you misplaced something, like the dead woman who I hear has been sleeping in this bed.
Though being dead is de rigueur around here these days.
You should try it sometime, Mason.
- And how did you get in here?
- Every maid has her price, especially when grotesquely underpaid.
I read your Vanity Fair article.
It was like gazing at your lovely visage, Victoria... the most elegant blend of fact and fiction.
What do you want?
What do any of us want?
The truth.
I came to unearth it about your ludicrous kidnapping story, but now I've stumbled across something that's far juicier.
Now if memory serves, you told me that Kara Clarke was dead.
I honestly believed that.
Do you... gag a little when you say that? "Honestly"?
I think you've failed to understand the threat Kara poses to all of us.
She may know the truth about David, in which case, she will take you down along with us.
I think I'll be fine.
Sorry.
I'll leave you two alone.
I'll be right here.
I...
I understand if you want nothing to do with me.
So I'll just...
I'll just say my piece then go.
Despite... all the odds against you, you survived.
And you've grown into an amazing, amazing young woman.
You're strong.
You're independent.
You're...
You're everything that I... could ever have hoped for you to be.
You need to know that, um,
I was very sick...
for a long time.
And I w...
I was not fully in control of my actions.
And...
Your father and I made a choice...
One that I knew I would h...
have to live with.
You need to tell her I died.
It'll be better for her if she thinks I'm gone.
Somehow, your father found it in his heart to forgive me.
Oh.
Wait.
I forgive you, too.
So this is it.
We're in the clear.
We can finally start paying you back.
Well... there may be a bigger opportunity here.
Frankly, I've always wanted to be in the bar business.
You wanna buy it?
I will forgive your kid brother's debt if you let me.
I asked around, Jack, heard what this place did to you.
Your mom left.
Your dad died.
So you wanna pull 14-hour shifts or you wanna spend quality time with your beautiful family?
Okay.
Let's talk.
I knew you were smart.
Well...
What'd the inspector say?
There's the boy wonder.
Dec, we're back in business and we couldn't have done it without you.
Are you seriously reading a book?
Yeah, it calms me.
You should try it.
Well, I found this hidden in Kara's room.
There's one number on it.
That's Gordon Murphy's number.
Mm-hmm.
She's made calls out.
None came in.
Kara's been feeding him information.
Too many people know our secrets, Conrad.
And if they surface, the Initiative is going to come after us... and worse, our children.
I don't know who to turn to.
You can turn to me, of course.
Oh, please.
Victoria Grayson, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?
- Again.
- What is the matter with you?
Just let me finish.
To have and to hold, and to be legally bound so that we may never be compelled to testify against each other in a court of law.
I'm sorry about what I said to your mom.
Forgiving her, it just...
came out.
Don't be.
You did the right thing.
I need to tell you something about Carl.
I lied to you.
Jack really is the father.
Oh, my God.
Why would you do that to me?
I guess I felt like I needed to keep you on my side.
After everything we've been through?
Maybe because of it.
I know I haven't given you any reason to believe this.
I'm so sorry.
Me, too.
I knew you had feelings for Jack when I tricked him into believing I was you.
And now I have this incredible family.
It's not fair.
You deserve better, and...
Jack deserves the truth.
Jack deserves happiness.
If you tell him the truth now, it'll only break his heart all over again.
Over time, we commit acts with intentions, either good or bad, that require forgiveness.

I think my family could've been happy here.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
It's okay.
Who knows?
Maybe David wouldn't have made the mistakes he made.
Maybe none of us would have.
Trust me.
Just as many mistakes are made here.
Do you think she really forgives me?
I think she wants to.
Just the woman I was looking for.
A quick raid of my research confirmed that you had a terrible scar from a burn you had suffered in a foster care fire... one that I couldn't help but notice is now missing.
I had it removed.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
From what part of your body?
Why do you care, Mason?
I think you and I both know the answer to that question, my dear.
You may be many things to many people... the latest, it would seem, a young mother to an infant boy.
But the daughter of Kara Wallace and David Clarke?
That is one thing that you most definitely are not.
[ Whistling "Strangers in the Night" ]
Previously on Revenge:
My mother's still alive.
Victoria's the only person left who could possibly tell me where she is.
- Mason Treadwell.
- I know who you are.
You wrote that book about David Clarke.
Thank you for taking an interest.
My father told me my mother died in an institution.
Why would he make me believe she was dead when she was obviously still alive?
- Because he was trying to protect you.
- Amanda...
Damn it.
Your mother tried to kill you.
That's a lie.
It is the absolute truth!
Aah!
Jack, it's Amanda.
There's been an accident.
Mommy's here.
Come here.
It's okay.
They say let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
Amanda!
Hang in there, Amanda.
Daddy's here.
Amanda!
And to be without sin requires absolute forgiveness.
Come on, baby.
Hang in there.
- Amanda!
- No!
Don't touch her!
Okay, come on.
Breathe.
Breathe, Amanda.
But when your memories are freshly opened wounds, forgiveness is the most unnatural of human emotions.
You okay?
I know why my father lied to me.
Like always, he was protecting me.
Your father and I, we... share the same protective instinct.
The reason I didn't tell you I'd found Kara is because I wanted to make sure she couldn't hurt you.
There's something else you need to know about your mother.
Gordon Murphy wasn't just her savior.
He was her husband.
- No.
- She told me herself.
And after she tased me and left me to die,
I believe her.
I've been so driven to find her,
I never stopped to consider who she is.
Then you let me help you remember what you came here to do... avenge your father's death.
You're Takeda's proxy.
Use that to get inside Grayson Global and destabilize the company.
That's the best way to ferret them out.
Hey, you sure you're all right?
I needed someone.
You walked through the door.
Don't let it go to your head.
Mrs. Grayson, there's someone here to see you.
Tell them I'm not accepting any visitors.
Victoria.
Kara Clarke.
I'm so glad you're safe.
Such a beautiful home.
And so smart to build it right on the ocean.
You can always see your enemies coming.
Well, my enemies have become
- increasingly difficult to identify.
- Oh, I know.
I was so shocked to learn that the man that kidnapped you was the FBI agent you'd been working with.
He seemed like a good man.
All men are born hardwired to betray.
It's just a question of when.
Do they have any leads on his whereabouts?
No, they don't.
But I'm so relieved that you didn't fall victim to him as well.
Oh, no.
He gave me a new life, taught me how to live off the grid.
I hadn't seen him for twenty years.
Then he shows up a few months ago.
Why'd he go to you?
I don't know.
Did you file a statement with the authorities?
No.
I'm...
I'm sure you can appreciate why.
Yes.
Where do you think he is?
If he's wise, far, far away from here.
And as you pointed out, he's very gifted at the art of vanishing.
But I imagine your main concern is about Amanda.
Of course.
You've been so incredibly kind to her...
Bringing her into your home...
And in such a public way.
I never would've been able to find her otherwise.
Well, it was the least I could do for her, poor thing.
Tragedy and sorrow seem to follow her everywhere she goes.
Oh.
I'm such a dope.
May I wash up?
Well, I take no pleasure in saying this, but we fear Grayson Global may be an unrightable ship.
Your funds are being handled with the utmost discretion.
Discretion, or secrecy, rather, is the problem.
When Daniel first brought Mr. Takeda into the fold, he offered a hands-on approach.
And since the feud between you and your son was on full display at the board meeting last week, that which I do see does not inspire confidence.
Oh, the Graysons hail from a rather spirited bloodline.
Whatever disagreement you may have witnessed,
I assure you, there is no rift.
With all due respect, my employer requires greater assurances.
Ah.
Daniel Grayson.
Son, I am sitting with Aiden Mathis,
Mr. Takeda's proxy.
I'd like you to make good on your promise of transparency and acquaint Aiden with all aspects of our organization.
I am sending him to you now.
Excuse me.
What is it, sweetheart?
I'm busy.
Too busy to deal with the fact that Kara Clarke is still alive?
Uh, thank you, Mr. Mathis.
Would you mind closing the door?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Is this a joke?
No, Conrad.
At this very moment, she's in our powder room washing blood off her hands, literally.
I thought Gordon Murphy took care of her decades ago.
- You've got to get rid of her.
- Oh, on the contrary.
I've asked her to stay for lunch.
Are you out of your mind?
Last I heard, Kara Clarke was a violent psychopath.
Don't you find it interesting that she suddenly reemerges one day after her daughter takes that fall?
She could be the source of the journals, the log-in sheet, everything.
I want to see you here in one hour.
- Hey, Declan.
- Hey.
I thought you should have this back.
- It was very gentlemanly of you.
- Oh, yeah.
We Porters are descended from a long line of gentlemen.
I'm headed to the hospital to check in on Amanda and the latest little Porter.
You want to come with?
Uh, you know, you might want to wait.
Jack said they may try to bring her out of it today.
Does that mean she's okay?
I hope so, for everyone's sake.
But I gotta get this stuff done so little Carl has a home to come back to.
Okay.
I guess I'll see you around.
I'm beginning to understand why you robbed me.
Girl like that's not gonna go for a Groupon.
You got it all wrong, man.
I barely even know her.
Hmm.
Satisfy my curiosity.
Why'd you do it?
I don't have the money to go to college, okay?
Right.
That'd make for one hell of an admissions essay...
"how I rolled houses for a brighter future."
You think I'm an idiot.
I get it.
On the contrary.
You remind me of myself at your age.
Call this guy.
He's got a certified crew that'll do the work here for half the price, twice as fast.
And why...
why would you help me?
'Cause I want my money back sooner than later.
And whatever you got in that little spray bottle is not getting the job done.
Call or don't call.
But if you want that pretty little rich girl to see you as more than a guy she rebelled with for one summer, and I can tell you do, you'll need that degree.
I gotta lay you down, buddy.
Papa Porter.
Congrats, pal.
Hey.
Hey, how you holding up, huh?
- Uh, I'm a little tired.
- Hmm.
I bet.
How's Mama Mandy?
She's gettin' better by the minute.
Uh, wow, Jack.
That is one hell of a swaddle.
Oh, well, get this.
His grandmother taught me.
What, your mom's back?
Not mine.
Hers.
Y...
You're...
- You're not serious.
- I know, right?
As if things aren't messy enough.
Oh, uh, they...
They do hourly checks.
Eh, say no more.
I, uh, have to go see someone anyway.
Hang in there, pal.
Encouraging numbers.
You should also read the analysis.
Why?
Would it tell me a different story?
It will if my dad took a pass...
Daniel, an alert's come through the system.
Ashley Davenport, Aiden Mathis.
Charmed.
We didn't officially get to meet the other day.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Aiden is Mr. Takeda's proxy.
My father asked me to acquaint him with all things Grayson Global.
So whatever you have to say, feel free to say it.
Personnel's flagged an outside request for David Clarke's employment contract.
That's right.
A bona fide terrorist used to work here.
That's something we try hard to forget.
Who's looking for it?
I don't know.
Maybe a meeting might be prudent.
Set it up.
Let's see who's suddenly curious.
- Now back to the quarterlies.
- Suddenly,
I'm more interested in this company's more historic associations.
Why don't we introduce Mr. Mathis to the power of the corporate card?
Drinks tonight at Rinellas?
Hello?
Someone's interested in your father's contract at Grayson Global.
Any reason to think it's your mother?
I don't even know where she is.
I've checked every hotel and hostel in the area.
Did you check the Graysons'?
Conrad took a phone call from Victoria, paled at the sound of her voice.
Emily!
Keep me posted.
Way to keep me out of the loop, Ems.
Your mother's summering in the Hamptons?
Who told you that?
Jack, who's currently registering a 6 on the freak-o-meter.
Me?
I'm at 9, which must put you at infinity times infinity.
I don't have time for this.
Well, assuming you don't have time to check your messages either.
Otherwise you'd know that, uh...
My dad died.
Oh, my God, Nolan.
Look, I know he wasn't murdered in prison or accused of a crime he didn't commit, still...
Turns out he loved me.
I should've been there for you.
I'm sorry.
Hmm.
Mm, it's okay.
But enough about that.
Tell me about Kara Clarke.
All I can tell you is that she thinks Amanda is her daughter.
That's good for...
revenge-y stuff, but sad for you.
I'm sorry, Ems.
Let's see.
So what are your plans, Ms. Clarke?
I should hope that you'd stay with us.
She's staying at the Graysons'?
You think it's safe here?
What about your kidnapper?
That man is nothing more than a slippery coward who wouldn't have the guts to darken our doorstep.
Even if he did, he'd be shot on sight.
In other words, so long as you remain under our roof, you'll be safe.
No place like home.
Huh, Auntie Ems?
Hey, Jack.
Emily, the doctors are ready.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Amanda's out of her coma.
Well, that's good.
Right?
It is until my mother hears the news.
She's not out of the woods yet.
Hey, welcome back.
We got someone here who wants to meet you.
Oh, my God.
That's him?
Is he okay?
This is your mommy.
Oh.
He's so little.
Don't worry.
He's tougher than he looks, like his mom.
I didn't know the two of you would be here when I woke up.
Well, we're here.
Neither one of us is going anywhere.
All right?
Thanks for coming back to us.
I couldn't do this alone.
Welcome back, Amanda.
We're gonna go home soon, okay?
Where's Mommy?
What do you remember last?
- We were swimming.
- Mm-hmm.
Do you know how sometimes when people get sick, no matter how hard they try and no matter how many doctors help, they just aren't able to get better?
But Mommy said she was better.
She wanted to be.
She wanted that more than anything.
But I... she just...
she wasn't strong enough.
Where is she?
She's... gone.
Okay?
I'm so sorry, honey.
I'll let you two get acquainted.
You must be so relieved.
Look, I know The Stowaway's not open yet, and Amanda still has a bunch of stuff at my house, so they're welcome to stay with me temporarily.
Are you sure?
Carl has a lot of stuff for someone who only weighs 7 pounds.
I'll always have a room for him.
Have you called Amanda's mom yet?
I wanted to wait until I told her that she was back.
That's a good idea.
And you should go home, take a break...
Change your clothes.
I stink?
Eh, a shower wouldn't kill you.
Thanks, Emily.
Hey, I'm, uh, I'm running home for a bit, but Emily's here if you need anything, okay?
Congratulations.
He's somethin'.
Yeah.
He is.
We're survivors.
Amanda, I had no right to put you in that situation.
I'm so sorry.
So the hunt for your mother is over?
She's back, Amanda.
- She showed up last night.
- Good.
So at least it wasn't all for nothing.
Ms. Clarke?
You ready to come with me for those last few tests?
Mm-hmm.
I can look after Carl if you wanna go.
Is that where David lived?
He told me that he had fallen in love with the woman next door.
I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.
Well, thinking about David always makes me uncomfortable.
I imagine that's something we both share.
Why did you save me all those years ago?
A lot of women would've felt threatened by me.
Although...
Technically, you're the other woman, not me.
You know, he led me to believe that you were dead for the longest time.
Obviously, we both fell prey to David's deception.
And now Gordon's.
Mom?
I just got off the phone with the hospital.
Amanda's awake and okay.
Charlotte, this is Amanda's mother, Kara Clarke.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'll come back and bring my things.
Thank you.
- You asked her to stay with us?
- Temporarily, yes.
I feel so bad about what happened to her daughter that I just wanted to help out.
Wow.
Maybe you have changed.
Oh, Dec!
What the hell, man?
It smells terrible in here.
I know.
I'm doing the best I can with what we have... pops.
How's Amanda?
She's good.
She's good.
We're, uh... we're good.
Good.
That's good.
Yeah, well, something's gotta be when I'm standing in the place that's supposed to be making us our living and paying these hospital bills.
I know.
Um, Kenny stopped by today with a plan "b."
He says that that guy can get done what we need fast and cheap.
I like the sound of that.
Yeah, me, too, only my judgment's been a little bit off lately and...
Yeah, well,
I wanted to wait for your okay.
Well, he's a businessman who wants his money.
Why have us waste any more of it, right?
I'll give this guy a call right now.
- Thank you for coming in.
I'm Daniel Gray...
- Daniel Grayson.
I know.
Padma Lahari, Nolcorp C.F.O.
I hope everything's okay?
Why wouldn't it be?
In my experience, when a simple request gets an outsized response, either something's wrong or I've won something.
Have I won something?
Let's see what we're playing first, shall we?
Please, sit.
I understand you're looking for information about David Clarke.
Yes.
I need to corroborate his initial terms of employment at Grayson Global.
I hope you can understand the sensitivity we still feel over the unfortunate association this company has with such a man.
Yes.
I imagine it can be quite tricky.
Tell me, what do the terms of Mr. Clarke's employment at a Wall Street investment firm have to do with a tech company like Nolcorp?
I wanted to make sure that when Nolcorp invested in Grayson Global years ago that David Clarke wasn't on the account.
It wouldn't do to have a terrorist handling our finances, would it?
I'll look into it and get back to you.
I'm much obliged.
So that explains that.
I'm not sure it does.
Tyler tried to land Nolcorp last summer for the first time, which means they've never invested with us before.
Are we still on for drinks?
Where are you taking my grandson?
I was just trying to settle him.
I'm his godmother.
I'm Kara,
Amanda's actual mother.
May I?
Don't worry.
He knows his family.
Ohh.
Amanda was the same way, always happy in her Mommy's arms.
Oh!
The perfect little baby boy.
What was Amanda like as a kid?
She...
She was so gentle.
She wouldn't even let me kill a spider.
No matter how big or small,
I had to catch it in a glass and set it free outside.
She just always had this innate goodness.
Does she ever talk about me?
Honestly, no.
When was the last time you saw her?
Well, now that is a fascinating question.
Oh, please allow me to introduce myself.
Mason Treadwell.
And is it possible that you're Kara Clarke?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
God, I love the Hamptons.
You see, I was inexorably drawn back here in pursuit of the truth behind your daughter's recent welcome into the Grayson fold, which makes your appearance...
How shall I say it?
A revelation.
Are you for real?
Oh, I am, my dear, and so wonderfully are you.
The years have been kind, Kara.
Where have you been?
Away.
Oh, that's one of my favorite places.
If you don't mind my asking, why let your daughter think that you were deceased these last two decades?
I do.
I do mind you asking.
Wow.
When you get a C.A.T. Scan, you throw me a party.
Well, admittedly, I'm a crasher, but one who only brings well-wishes.
What the hell are you doing here?
Paying my respects, of course.
Please, allow me.
Please.
I think you've done quite enough, Mason.
I'll come back.
Amanda, sweetie...
Do you remember me?
- I think Carl's hungry.
- I'll bring him to you.
Oh, sweetheart.
Shh.
Shh.
Kara, I think we should let these two rest.
When Amanda's released, she'll be staying with me for a few days.
Perhaps you'd like to come visit in the morning?
Yes.
Maybe I could drive you home.
She didn't recognize me.
I really thought she would.
Can't imagine how that must feel.
- Have you read Treadwell's book?
- Mm.
I still can't accept that David was capable of such terrible things.
He was my high school sweetheart.
Can you believe that?
You never know when or how you'll meet your true love.
He was only my first love.
There's a difference.
Well, at least David didn't destroy Amanda.
No.
He didn't.
I know I've been A.W.O.L., but...
I just became an uncle.
Well, one of those non-uncle uncles, like Kracker or Fester.
Pretty sure fester actually was Gomez's older brother.
All right, you pass.
Where did you get this?
It was amongst your father's memorabilia.
You did nothing with it?
No.
Why?
- Should I?
- Nope.
I'll take care of it, but...
Not before I take you to breakfast.
But it's 10:00 at night, Nolan.
Then we've got some time to kill.
To a growing relationship, both business and personal.
Well, tell that to my dad.
The company's falling apart, and he leaves before lunch.
Which is something
I'm sure you wouldn't want me to convey to Mr. Takeda.
You see, this is why we English are stereotyped as reserved.
Candor runs the risk of brooking discontent.
Oh, well, the American way is truth, honesty...
And a tiny bladder.
Oh.
Now if you'll excuse me, I...
Need to use the loo.
Very good.
You make a nice couple.
What about you?
Anyone special?
Well, the nomadic lifestyle doesn't allow for much permanence, I'm afraid.
Although Mr. Takeda did mention somebody that I should look up.
Uh, a miss, um...
Emily...
Thorpe?
- Thorne.
- Ah.
She and Daniel used to be engaged.
Well, leave it to me to step in it.
Oh, no, you didn't.
She did.
She cheated on him.
Well, to, uh, your good fortune and, um, maybe mine.
We nomads have little need for fidelity, so I may ring her up.
You can't be here.
But you told me to keep you posted.
No, I mean, you can't be here.
My mother is next door.
She sees you, our cover's blown... not just with her but with the Graysons, which would never have happened if you hadn't gone to see her in the first place.
What do you want?
To inform you that the inquiry about your father's contract came from a woman named Padma Lahari, claiming to be Nolcorp's C.F.O.
She pulls that thread, it could expose the source of your wealth.
I liquidated my Nolcorp stock years ago.
But this could be bad for Nolan.
Well, he's not my concern.
Well, he's mine.
What's she doing?
That's his phone, isn't it?
You had it all along.
Answer that phone and it will be the last thing you ever do.
- You wanna do this alone?
- Fine.
But you'll soon find out I make a far better partner than enemy.
How long until high tide?
20 minutes?
I like living on the edge of...
The land, the water, of the honeydew.
Morning, sunshine.
We need to talk.
I've been trying to get ahold of you all night.
Mm.
Sounds serious.
Need my help?
No.
You need mine.
I'm already shocked.
Someone from your company asked Daniel about my father's investment.
Nolan, it was Padma.
You okay?
Then drink up before we're underwater.
Just one night, I promise.
Not a problem.
All right.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take off and go to The Stowaway, okay?
Okay.
Thanks again.
Is everything okay?
Depends who you ask.
Jack seems happy with his little Carl.
But every time I see him holding the baby, I just...
I wanna tell him the truth, that Carl isn't his.
But, of course, I have to deal with your mom first.
All you have to do is tell her the truth, that you don't know who she is and she has to leave.
You spent all this time, risked my life looking for her, and now you just want her to leave?
While you were recovering, a memory came back to me.
When I was 5, my mother tried to kill me.
She succeeded, actually.
She drowned me.
My father had to bring me back to life.
How could a mother do that?
Maybe someday I'll know, but for now...
The best thing for us, and especially for Carl, is that she leaves.
Call her.
See, that's the thing about martinis.
Two's not enough, four is too many.
I could use another drink after the morning we're having.
You should tell Takeda to take his money and run.
But that would debilitate Grayson Global.
Well, maybe we deserve it.
I know how you feel about your father.
It's obvious that's why you want us to divest.
I feel the same way about the chains that bind me.
So?
I may have something.
It's about the Nolcorp request.
Okay, how do you know about that?
Because I'm ambitious, same as you.
When David Clarke worked here, he ran venture capital, right?
What if Nolan Ross came to him for start-up money?
But he didn't, or there'd be a record of it.
Not if the money he invested came from a personal account.
See, I think the young lady from Nolcorp was trying to sniff out whether or not Clarke's contract contained an exclusivity clause.
Which it would have.
They all do.
Which means he was working on behalf of the company, regardless of where the capital came from.
Which also means...
This company has a controlling interest in Nolcorp.
We play this right, we guarantee two things... me a seat here on the board, and you...
The seat behind your father's desk.
Put me through to personnel.
Archives.
There may be no sadder sight than a woman attempting to rob her own house.
Unless, of course, you misplaced something, like the dead woman who I hear has been sleeping in this bed.
Though being dead is de rigueur around here these days.
You should try it sometime, Mason.
- And how did you get in here?
- Every maid has her price, especially when grotesquely underpaid.
I read your Vanity Fair article.
It was like gazing at your lovely visage, Victoria... the most elegant blend of fact and fiction.
What do you want?
What do any of us want?
The truth.
I came to unearth it about your ludicrous kidnapping story, but now I've stumbled across something that's far juicier.
Now if memory serves, you told me that Kara Clarke was dead.
I honestly believed that.
Do you... gag a little when you say that? "Honestly"?
I think you've failed to understand the threat Kara poses to all of us.
She may know the truth about David, in which case, she will take you down along with us.
I think I'll be fine.
Sorry.
I'll leave you two alone.
I'll be right here.
I...
I understand if you want nothing to do with me.
So I'll just...
I'll just say my piece then go.
Despite... all the odds against you, you survived.
And you've grown into an amazing, amazing young woman.
You're strong.
You're independent.
You're...
You're everything that I... could ever have hoped for you to be.
You need to know that, um,
I was very sick...
for a long time.
And I w...
I was not fully in control of my actions.
And...
Your father and I made a choice...
One that I knew I would h...
have to live with.
You need to tell her I died.
It'll be better for her if she thinks I'm gone.
Somehow, your father found it in his heart to forgive me.
Oh.
Wait.
I forgive you, too.
- So this is it.
- We're in the clear.
We can finally start paying you back.
Well... there may be a bigger opportunity here.
Frankly, I've always wanted to be in the bar business.
You wanna buy it?
I will forgive your kid brother's debt if you let me.
I asked around, Jack, heard what this place did to you.
Your mom left.
Your dad died.
So you wanna pull 14-hour shifts or you wanna spend quality time with your beautiful family?
Okay.
Let's talk.
I knew you were smart.
Well...
What'd the inspector say?
There's the boy wonder.
Dec, we're back in business and we couldn't have done it without you.
Are you seriously reading a book?
Yeah, it calms me.
You should try it.
Well, I found this hidden in Kara's room.
There's one number on it.
That's Gordon Murphy's number.
Mm-hmm.
She's made calls out.
None came in.
Kara's been feeding him information.
Too many people know our secrets, Conrad.
And if they surface, the Initiative is going to come after us... and worse, our children.
I don't know who to turn to.
You can turn to me, of course.
Oh, please.
Victoria Grayson, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?
- Again.
- What is the matter with you?
Just let me finish.
To have and to hold, and to be legally bound so that we may never be compelled to testify against each other in a court of law.
I'm sorry about what I said to your mom.
Forgiving her, it just...
came out.
Don't be.
You did the right thing.
I need to tell you something about Carl.
I lied to you.
Jack really is the father.
Oh, my God.
Why would you do that to me?
I guess I felt like I needed to keep you on my side.
After everything we've been through?
Maybe because of it.
I know I haven't given you any reason to believe this.
I'm so sorry.
Me, too.
I knew you had feelings for Jack when I tricked him into believing I was you.
And now I have this incredible family.
It's not fair.
You deserve better, and...
Jack deserves the truth.
Jack deserves happiness.
If you tell him the truth now, it'll only break his heart all over again.
Over time, we commit acts with intentions, either good or bad, that require forgiveness.
I think my family could've been happy here.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
It's okay.
Who knows?
Maybe David wouldn't have made the mistakes he made.
Maybe none of us would have.
Trust me.
Just as many mistakes are made here.
Do you think she really forgives me?
I think she wants to.
Just the woman I was looking for.
A quick raid of my research confirmed that you had a terrible scar from a burn you had suffered in a foster care fire... one that I couldn't help but notice is now missing.
I had it removed.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
From what part of your body?
Why do you care, Mason?
I think you and I both know the answer to that question, my dear.
You may be many things to many people... the latest, it would seem, a young mother to an infant boy.
But the daughter of Kara Wallace and David Clarke?
That is one thing that you most definitely are not.
Previously on Revenge:
My mother's still alive.
Victoria's the only person left who could possibly tell me where she is.
- Mason Treadwell.
- I know who you are.
You wrote that book about David Clarke.
Thank you for taking an interest.
My father told me my mother died in an institution.
Why would he make me believe she was dead when she was obviously still alive?
- Because he was trying to protect you.
- Amanda...
Damn it.
Your mother tried to kill you.
That's a lie.
It is the absolute truth!
Aah!
(Gasps)
Jack, it's Amanda.
There's been an accident.
Mommy's here.
(Muffled screaming)
Come here.
(Crying)
It's okay.
(Emily) They say let he who is without sin cast the first stone.
(Voice echoes) Amanda!
(Grunts)
(Coughs, gasps)
Hang in there, Amanda.
Daddy's here.
Amanda!
And to be without sin requires absolute forgiveness.
Come on, baby.
Hang in there.
- Amanda!
- No!
Don't touch her!
Okay, come on.
Breathe.
Breathe, Amanda.
(Panting)
But when your memories are freshly opened wounds, forgiveness is the most unnatural of human emotions.
(Sighs)
You okay?
I know why my father lied to me.
Like always, he was protecting me.
Your father and I, we... share the same protective instinct.
The reason I didn't tell you I'd found Kara is because I wanted to make sure she couldn't hurt you.
There's something else you need to know about your mother.
Gordon Murphy wasn't just her savior.
He was her husband.
- No.
- She told me herself.
And after she tased me and left me to die,
I believe her.
I've been so driven to find her,
I never stopped to consider who she is.
Then you let me help you remember what you came here to do... avenge your father's death.
You're Takeda's proxy.
Use that to get inside Grayson Global and destabilize the company.
That's the best way to ferret them out.
Hey, you sure you're all right?
I needed someone.
You walked through the door.
Don't let it go to your head.
(Snipping)
Mrs. Grayson, there's someone here to see you.
Tell them I'm not accepting any visitors.
(Kara) Victoria.
Kara Clarke.
I'm so glad you're safe.
(Kara) Such a beautiful home.
And so smart to build it right on the ocean.
You can always see your enemies coming.
Well, my enemies have become
- increasingly difficult to identify.
- Oh, I know.
I was so shocked to learn that the man that kidnapped you was the FBI agent you'd been working with.
He seemed like a good man.
All men are born hardwired to betray.
It's just a question of when.
Do they have any leads on his whereabouts?
No, they don't.
But I'm so relieved that you didn't fall victim to him as well.
Oh, no.
He gave me a new life, taught me how to live off the grid.
I hadn't seen him for twenty years.
Then he shows up a few months ago.
Why'd he go to you?
I don't know.
Did you file a statement with the authorities?
No.
I'm...
I'm sure you can appreciate why.
Yes.
Where do you think he is?
If he's wise, far, far away from here.
And as you pointed out, he's very gifted at the art of vanishing.
But I imagine your main concern is about Amanda.
Of course.
You've been so incredibly kind to her...
Bringing her into your home...
And in such a public way.
I never would've been able to find her otherwise.
Well, it was the least I could do for her, poor thing.
Tragedy and sorrow seem to follow her everywhere she goes.
Oh.
(Chuckles)
I'm such a dope.
May I wash up?
(Aiden) Well, I take no pleasure in saying this, but we fear Grayson Global may be an unrightable ship.
Your funds are being handled with the utmost discretion.
Discretion, or secrecy, rather, is the problem.
When Daniel first brought Mr. Takeda into the fold, he offered a hands-on approach.
And since the feud between you and your son was on full display at the board meeting last week, that which I do see does not inspire confidence.
Oh, the Graysons hail from a rather spirited bloodline.
Whatever disagreement you may have witnessed,
I assure you, there is no rift.
With all due respect, my employer requires greater assurances.
Ah.
(Beep) Daniel Grayson.
Son, I am sitting with Aiden Mathis,
Mr. Takeda's proxy.
I'd like you to make good on your promise of transparency and acquaint Aiden with all aspects of our organization.
I am sending him to you now.
(Cell phone rings)
(Ring) Excuse me.
(Ring)
(Beep) What is it, sweetheart?
I'm busy.
Too busy to deal with the fact that Kara Clarke is still alive?
Uh, thank you, Mr. Mathis.
Would you mind closing the door?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
(Door closes)
Is this a joke?
No, Conrad.
At this very moment, she's in our powder room washing blood off her hands, literally.
I thought Gordon Murphy took care of her decades ago.
- You've got to get rid of her.
- Oh, on the contrary.
I've asked her to stay for lunch.
Are you out of your mind?
Last I heard, Kara Clarke was a violent psychopath.
Don't you find it interesting that she suddenly reemerges one day after her daughter takes that fall?
She could be the source of the journals, the log-in sheet, everything.
I want to see you here in one hour.
(Kurt Vile) ♪ I won't be able... ♪
(Exhales deeply)
(Clatter)
- Hey, Declan.
- Hey.
I thought you should have this back.
- It was very gentlemanly of you.
- Oh, yeah.
We Porters are descended from a long line of gentlemen.
I'm headed to the hospital to check in on Amanda and the latest little Porter.
You want to come with?
Uh, you know, you might want to wait.
Jack said they may try to bring her out of it today.
Does that mean she's okay?
I hope so, for everyone's sake.
But I gotta get this stuff done so little Carl has a home to come back to.
Okay.
I guess I'll see you around.
I'm beginning to understand why you robbed me.
Girl like that's not gonna go for a Groupon.
You got it all wrong, man.
I barely even know her.
Hmm.
Satisfy my curiosity.
Why'd you do it?
I don't have the money to go to college, okay?
Right.
That'd make for one hell of an admissions essay...
"how I rolled houses for a brighter future."
You think I'm an idiot.
I get it.
On the contrary.
You remind me of myself at your age.
(Sighs) Call this guy.
He's got a certified crew that'll do the work here for half the price, twice as fast.
And why...
why would you help me?
'Cause I want my money back sooner than later.
And whatever you got in that little spray bottle is not getting the job done.
Call or don't call.
But if you want that pretty little rich girl to see you as more than a guy she rebelled with for one summer, and I can tell you do, you'll need that degree.
I gotta lay you down, buddy.
(Fusses)
Papa Porter.
Congrats, pal.
Hey.
Hey, how you holding up, huh?
- Uh, I'm a little tired.
- Hmm.
I bet.
How's Mama Mandy?
She's gettin' better by the minute.
(Carl fusses)
Uh, wow, Jack.
That is one hell of a swaddle.
Oh, well, get this.
His grandmother taught me.
What, your mom's back?
Not mine.
Hers.
Y...
You're...
- You're not serious.
- I know, right?
As if things aren't messy enough.
Oh, uh, they...
They do hourly checks.
Eh, say no more.
I, uh, have to go see someone anyway.
Hang in there, pal.
(Aiden) Encouraging numbers.
You should also read the analysis.
Why?
Would it tell me a different story?
It will if my dad took a pass... (Door opens) Daniel, an alert's come through the system.
Ashley Davenport, Aiden Mathis.
Charmed.
We didn't officially get to meet the other day.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Aiden is Mr. Takeda's proxy.
My father asked me to acquaint him with all things Grayson Global.
So whatever you have to say, feel free to say it.
Personnel's flagged an outside request for David Clarke's employment contract.
That's right.
A bona fide terrorist used to work here.
That's something we try hard to forget.
Who's looking for it?
I don't know.
Maybe a meeting might be prudent.
Set it up.
Let's see who's suddenly curious.
- Now back to the quarterlies.
- Suddenly,
I'm more interested in this company's more historic associations.
Why don't we introduce Mr. Mathis to the power of the corporate card?
Drinks tonight at Rinellas?
(Cell phone rings)
(Ring)
(Ring)
(Beep)
(Cell phone rings)
(Ring)
(Beep)
Hello?
Someone's interested in your father's contract at Grayson Global.
Any reason to think it's your mother?
I don't even know where she is.
I've checked every hotel and hostel in the area.
Did you check the Graysons'?
Conrad took a phone call from Victoria, paled at the sound of her voice.
(Pounding on door)
(Nolan) Emily!
Keep me posted.
(Beep)
(Seagulls calling)
Way to keep me out of the loop, Ems.
Your mother's summering in the Hamptons?
Who told you that?
Jack, who's currently registering a 6 on the freak-o-meter.
Me?
I'm at 9, which must put you at infinity times infinity.
I don't have time for this.
Well, assuming you don't have time to check your messages either.
Otherwise you'd know that, uh...
My dad died.
(Exhales) Oh, my God, Nolan.
Look, I know he wasn't murdered in prison or accused of a crime he didn't commit, still...
(Chuckles)
Turns out he loved me.
(Sighs) I should've been there for you.
I'm sorry.
Hmm.
Mm, it's okay.
But enough about that.
Tell me about Kara Clarke.
All I can tell you is that she thinks Amanda is her daughter.
That's good for...
revenge-y stuff, but sad for you.
I'm sorry, Ems.
(Pressing keys)
Let's see.
(Conrad) So what are your plans, Ms. Clarke?
(Victoria) I should hope that you'd stay with us.
She's staying at the Graysons'?
You think it's safe here?
What about your kidnapper?
That man is nothing more than a slippery coward who wouldn't have the guts to darken our doorstep.
Even if he did, he'd be shot on sight.
In other words, so long as you remain under our roof, you'll be safe.
No place like home.
Huh, Auntie Ems?
(Cell phone rings)
(Ring)
(Beep) Hey, Jack.
Emily, the doctors are ready.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
(Beep)
Amanda's out of her coma.
(Sighs) Well, that's good.
Right?
It is until my mother hears the news.
She's not out of the woods yet.
(Jack) Hey, welcome back.
We got someone here who wants to meet you.
(Whispers) Oh, my God.
(Carl fussing)
(Voice breaks) That's him?
Is he okay?
(Crying and fussing)
This is your mommy.
(Exhales)
(Whispers) Oh.
(Continues crying)
He's so little.
Don't worry.
He's tougher than he looks, like his mom.
I didn't know the two of you would be here when I woke up.
Well, we're here.
Neither one of us is going anywhere.
All right?
Thanks for coming back to us.
I couldn't do this alone.
Welcome back, Amanda.
(Sighs)
We're gonna go home soon, okay?
Where's Mommy?
What do you remember last?
- We were swimming.
- Mm-hmm.
Do you know how sometimes when people get sick, no matter how hard they try and no matter how many doctors help, they just aren't able to get better?
But Mommy said she was better.
She wanted to be.
She wanted that more than anything.
But I... she just...
she wasn't strong enough.
Where is she?
She's... gone.
Okay?
I'm so sorry, honey.
(Carl continues crying)
I'll let you two get acquainted.
(Mouths word)
(Sighs deeply)
You must be so relieved.
Look, I know The Stowaway's not open yet, and Amanda still has a bunch of stuff at my house, so they're welcome to stay with me temporarily.
Are you sure?
Carl has a lot of stuff for someone who only weighs 7 pounds.
(Chuckles) I'll always have a room for him.
(Mouths word)
Have you called Amanda's mom yet?
I wanted to wait until I told her that she was back.
That's a good idea.
And you should go home, take a break...
Change your clothes.
(Chuckles) I stink?
Eh, a shower wouldn't kill you.
(Laughs)
Thanks, Emily.
(Carl crying)
Hey, I'm, uh, I'm running home for a bit, but Emily's here if you need anything, okay?
Congratulations.
He's somethin'.
Yeah.
He is.
We're survivors.
Amanda, I had no right to put you in that situation.
I'm so sorry.
So the hunt for your mother is over?
She's back, Amanda.
- She showed up last night.
- Good.
So at least it wasn't all for nothing.
(Knock on door)
Ms. Clarke?
You ready to come with me for those last few tests?
Mm-hmm.
I can look after Carl if you wanna go.
Is that where David lived?
He told me that he had fallen in love with the woman next door.
I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.
Well, thinking about David always makes me uncomfortable.
I imagine that's something we both share.
Why did you save me all those years ago?
A lot of women would've felt threatened by me.
Although...
(Chuckles)
Technically, you're the other woman, not me.
You know, he led me to believe that you were dead for the longest time.
Obviously, we both fell prey to David's deception.
And now Gordon's.
Mom?
I just got off the phone with the hospital.
Amanda's awake and okay.
Charlotte, this is Amanda's mother, Kara Clarke.
I'm going to the hospital.
I'll come back and bring my things.
(Whispers) Thank you.
- You asked her to stay with us?
- Temporarily, yes.
I feel so bad about what happened to her daughter that I just wanted to help out.
Wow.
Maybe you have changed.
(Spraying)
Oh, Dec!
What the hell, man?
It smells terrible in here.
I know.
I'm doing the best I can with what we have... pops.
(Chuckles)
How's Amanda?
She's good.
She's good.
We're, uh... we're good.
Good.
That's good.
Yeah, well, something's gotta be when I'm standing in the place that's supposed to be making us our living and paying these hospital bills.
I know.
Um, Kenny stopped by today with a plan "b."
He says that that guy can get done what we need fast and cheap.
I like the sound of that.
Yeah, me, too, only my judgment's been a little bit off lately and... (Chuckles) Yeah, well,
I wanted to wait for your okay.
Well, he's a businessman who wants his money.
Why have us waste any more of it, right?
I'll give this guy a call right now.
- Thank you for coming in.
I'm Daniel Gray...
- Daniel Grayson.
I know.
Padma Lahari, Nolcorp C.F.O.
I hope everything's okay?
Why wouldn't it be?
In my experience, when a simple request gets an outsized response, either something's wrong or I've won something.
Have I won something?
Let's see what we're playing first, shall we?
Please, sit.
I understand you're looking for information about David Clarke.
Yes.
I need to corroborate his initial terms of employment at Grayson Global.
I hope you can understand the sensitivity we still feel over the unfortunate association this company has with such a man.
Yes.
I imagine it can be quite tricky.
Tell me, what do the terms of Mr. Clarke's employment at a Wall Street investment firm have to do with a tech company like Nolcorp?
I wanted to make sure that when Nolcorp invested in Grayson Global years ago that David Clarke wasn't on the account.
It wouldn't do to have a terrorist handling our finances, would it?
I'll look into it and get back to you.
I'm much obliged.
So that explains that.
I'm not sure it does.
Tyler tried to land Nolcorp last summer for the first time, which means they've never invested with us before.
(Knocks on doorframe)
Are we still on for drinks?
(Carl fussing)
Where are you taking my grandson?
I was just trying to settle him.
I'm his godmother.
I'm Kara,
Amanda's actual mother.
May I?
Don't worry.
He knows his family.
Ohh.
Amanda was the same way, always happy in her Mommy's arms.
Oh!
The perfect little baby boy.
What was Amanda like as a kid?
She...
She was so gentle.
She wouldn't even let me kill a spider.
No matter how big or small,
I had to catch it in a glass and set it free outside.
She just always had this innate goodness.
Does she ever talk about me?
Honestly, no.
When was the last time you saw her?
Well, now that is a fascinating question.
Oh, please allow me to introduce myself.
Mason Treadwell.
And is it possible that you're Kara Clarke?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
God, I love the Hamptons.
You see, I was inexorably drawn back here in pursuit of the truth behind your daughter's recent welcome into the Grayson fold, which makes your appearance...
How shall I say it?
A revelation.
Are you for real?
Oh, I am, my dear, and so wonderfully are you.
The years have been kind, Kara.
Where have you been?
Away.
Oh, that's one of my favorite places.
If you don't mind my asking, why let your daughter think that you were deceased these last two decades?
(Whispers) I do.
(Normal voice) I do mind you asking.
Wow.
When you get a C.A.T. Scan, you throw me a party.
(Mason chuckles) Well, admittedly, I'm a crasher, but one who only brings well-wishes.
What the hell are you doing here?
Paying my respects, of course.
Please, allow me.
(Sighs)
Please.
I think you've done quite enough, Mason.
I'll come back.
(Sighs)
Amanda, sweetie...
Do you remember me?
(Carl crying)
- I think Carl's hungry.
- I'll bring him to you.
Oh, sweetheart.
(Crying)
Shh.
Shh.
Kara, I think we should let these two rest.
When Amanda's released, she'll be staying with me for a few days.
Perhaps you'd like to come visit in the morning?
Yes.
Maybe I could drive you home.
She didn't recognize me.
I really thought she would.
Can't imagine how that must feel.
- Have you read Treadwell's book?
- Mm.
I still can't accept that David was capable of such terrible things.
He was my high school sweetheart.
(Chuckles) Can you believe that?
You never know when or how you'll meet your true love.
He was only my first love.
There's a difference.
Well, at least David didn't destroy Amanda.
No.
He didn't.
(Siren wailing)
I know I've been A.W.O.L., but...
I just became an uncle.
Well, one of those non-uncle uncles, like Kracker or Fester.
Pretty sure fester actually was Gomez's older brother.
All right, you pass.
Where did you get this?
It was amongst your father's memorabilia.
You did nothing with it?
No.
Why?
- Should I?
- Nope.
I'll take care of it, but...
Not before I take you to breakfast.
(Laughs) But it's 10:00 at night, Nolan.
Then we've got some time to kill.
(Chuckles)
To a growing relationship, both business and personal.
(Clink) Well, tell that to my dad.
The company's falling apart, and he leaves before lunch.
Which is something
I'm sure you wouldn't want me to convey to Mr. Takeda.
You see, this is why we English are stereotyped as reserved.
Candor runs the risk of brooking discontent.
Oh, well, the American way is truth, honesty...
And a tiny bladder.
Oh.
(Chuckles)
Now if you'll excuse me, I... (Imitates British accent) Need to use the loo.
(Laughs) Very good.
You make a nice couple.
What about you?
Anyone special?
Well, the nomadic lifestyle doesn't allow for much permanence, I'm afraid.
Although Mr. Takeda did mention somebody that I should look up.
Uh, a miss, um...
Emily...
Thorpe?
- Thorne.
- Ah.
She and Daniel used to be engaged.
Well, leave it to me to step in it.
Oh, no, you didn't.
She did.
She cheated on him.
Well, to, uh, your good fortune and, um, maybe mine.
We nomads have little need for fidelity, so I may ring her up.
(Sighs)
You can't be here.
But you told me to keep you posted.
(Keys clatter)
No, I mean, you can't be here.
(Closes drawer) My mother is next door.
She sees you, our cover's blown... not just with her but with the Graysons, which would never have happened if you hadn't gone to see her in the first place.
(Sighs) What do you want?
To inform you that the inquiry about your father's contract came from a woman named Padma Lahari, claiming to be Nolcorp's C.F.O.
She pulls that thread, it could expose the source of your wealth.
I liquidated my Nolcorp stock years ago.
But this could be bad for Nolan.
Well, he's not my concern.
Well, he's mine.
What's she doing?
(Cell phone rings)
That's his phone, isn't it?
(Ring)
(Ring) You had it all along.
Answer that phone and it will be the last thing you ever do.
- You wanna do this alone?
- Fine.
But you'll soon find out I make a far better partner than enemy.
How long until high tide?
20 minutes?
I like living on the edge of...
The land, the water, of the honeydew.
(Cell phone rings)
(Ring)
(Ring)
(Ring)
(Ring)
(Ring, beep)
Morning, sunshine.
We need to talk.
I've been trying to get ahold of you all night.
Mm.
Sounds serious.
Need my help?
No.
You need mine.
I'm already shocked.
Someone from your company asked Daniel about my father's investment.
Nolan, it was Padma.
You okay?
Then drink up before we're underwater.
(Jack) Just one night, I promise.
(Emily) Not a problem.
(Jack) All right.
(Carl fussing)
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take off and go to The Stowaway, okay?
Okay.
Thanks again.
Is everything okay?
Depends who you ask.
Jack seems happy with his little Carl.
But every time I see him holding the baby, I just...
I wanna tell him the truth, that Carl isn't his.
But, of course, I have to deal with your mom first.
All you have to do is tell her the truth, that you don't know who she is and she has to leave.
You spent all this time, risked my life looking for her, and now you just want her to leave?
(Sighs deeply)
While you were recovering, a memory came back to me.
When I was 5, my mother tried to kill me.
She succeeded, actually.
She drowned me.
My father had to bring me back to life.
(Whispers) How could a mother do that?
Maybe someday I'll know, but for now... (Exhales deeply)
The best thing for us, and especially for Carl, is that she leaves.
Call her.
(Knock on door)
(Sighs)
See, that's the thing about martinis.
Two's not enough, four is too many.
I could use another drink after the morning we're having.
You should tell Takeda to take his money and run.
But that would debilitate Grayson Global.
Well, maybe we deserve it.
I know how you feel about your father.
It's obvious that's why you want us to divest.
I feel the same way about the chains that bind me.
So?
I may have something.
It's about the Nolcorp request.
Okay, how do you know about that?
Because I'm ambitious, same as you.
When David Clarke worked here, he ran venture capital, right?
What if Nolan Ross came to him for start-up money?
But he didn't, or there'd be a record of it.
Not if the money he invested came from a personal account.
See, I think the young lady from Nolcorp was trying to sniff out whether or not Clarke's contract contained an exclusivity clause.
Which it would have.
They all do.
Which means he was working on behalf of the company, regardless of where the capital came from.
Which also means...
This company has a controlling interest in Nolcorp.
We play this right, we guarantee two things... me a seat here on the board, and you...
The seat behind your father's desk.
(Exhales)
Put me through to personnel.
Archives.
(Grunts)
(Groans)
There may be no sadder sight than a woman attempting to rob her own house.
Unless, of course, you misplaced something, like the dead woman who I hear has been sleeping in this bed.
Though being dead is de rigueur around here these days.
You should try it sometime, Mason.
- And how did you get in here?
- Every maid has her price, especially when grotesquely underpaid.
I read your Vanity Fair article.
It was like gazing at your lovely visage, Victoria... the most elegant blend of fact and fiction.
What do you want?
What do any of us want?
The truth.
I came to unearth it about your ludicrous kidnapping story, but now I've stumbled across something that's far juicier.
Now if memory serves, you told me that Kara Clarke was dead.
I honestly believed that.
Do you... gag a little when you say that? "Honestly"?
I think you've failed to understand the threat Kara poses to all of us.
She may know the truth about David, in which case, she will take you down along with us.
I think I'll be fine.
(Knocks on doorframe)
(Mouths words)
(Whispers) Sorry.
I'll leave you two alone.
(Whispers) I'll be right here.
(Kara) I... (Clears throat)
I understand if you want nothing to do with me.
So I'll just...
I'll just say my piece then go.
Despite... all the odds against you, you survived.
And you've grown into an amazing, amazing young woman.
You're strong.
You're independent.
You're... (Voice breaks) You're everything that I... could ever have hoped for you to be.
You need to know that, um,
I was very sick...
for a long time.
(Inhales sharply) And I w...
I was not fully in control of my actions.
(Crying)
And...
Your father and I made a choice...
One that I knew I would h...
have to live with.
(Kisses)
You need to tell her I died.
It'll be better for her if she thinks I'm gone.
(Kara) Somehow, your father found it in his heart to forgive me.
(Crying)
Oh.
(Sighs deeply)
(Gasps)
(Sniffles) Wait.
I forgive you, too.
(Jack) So this is it.
We're in the clear.
(Chuckles) We can finally start paying you back.
Well... there may be a bigger opportunity here.
Frankly, I've always wanted to be in the bar business.
You wanna buy it?
I will forgive your kid brother's debt if you let me.
(Sighs)
I asked around, Jack, heard what this place did to you.
Your mom left.
Your dad died.
So you wanna pull 14-hour shifts or you wanna spend quality time with your beautiful family?
Okay.
Let's talk.
I knew you were smart.
Well...
What'd the inspector say?
There's the boy wonder.
Dec, we're back in business and we couldn't have done it without you.
Are you seriously reading a book?
Yeah, it calms me.
You should try it.
Well, I found this hidden in Kara's room.
(Cell phone beeps) There's one number on it.
That's Gordon Murphy's number.
Mm-hmm.
She's made calls out.
None came in.
Kara's been feeding him information.
Too many people know our secrets, Conrad.
And if they surface, the Initiative is going to come after us... and worse, our children.
I don't know who to turn to.
You can turn to me, of course.
Oh, please.
Victoria Grayson, will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?
- Again.
- What is the matter with you?
Just let me finish.
To have and to hold, and to be legally bound so that we may never be compelled to testify against each other in a court of law.
I'm sorry about what I said to your mom.
Forgiving her, it just...
came out.
Don't be.
You did the right thing.
I need to tell you something about Carl.
I lied to you.
Jack really is the father.
(Exhales)
Oh, my God.
Why would you do that to me?
I guess I felt like I needed to keep you on my side.
After everything we've been through?
Maybe because of it.
I know I haven't given you any reason to believe this.
I'm so sorry.
Me, too.
I knew you had feelings for Jack when I tricked him into believing I was you.
And now I have this incredible family.
(Sniffles) It's not fair.
You deserve better, and...
Jack deserves the truth.
Jack deserves happiness.
If you tell him the truth now, it'll only break his heart all over again.
(Emily) Over time, we commit acts with intentions, either good or bad, that require forgiveness.

(Giggles)
I think my family could've been happy here.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
It's okay.
Who knows?
Maybe David wouldn't have made the mistakes he made.
Maybe none of us would have.
Trust me.
Just as many mistakes are made here.
Do you think she really forgives me?
I think she wants to.
Just the woman I was looking for.
A quick raid of my research confirmed that you had a terrible scar from a burn you had suffered in a foster care fire... one that I couldn't help but notice is now missing.
I had it removed.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
From what part of your body?
(Chuckles)
Why do you care, Mason?
I think you and I both know the answer to that question, my dear.
You may be many things to many people... the latest, it would seem, a young mother to an infant boy.
But the daughter of Kara Wallace and David Clarke?
(Grunts)
That is one thing that you most definitely are not.
(Whistling "Strangers in the Night")
Love is a many splendored thing, and so is George Lopez!
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to take me out.
Tonight, more gorgeous guys will try and win a date with my beautiful ladies.
My challenge is to match the right girl with the right guy.
Okay, buckle up.
It's about to get foxy in here.
Bring on the girls!
How hot are these girls?
Okay, ladies, it's been four weeks for some of you, and I haven't you love yet.
But I'm hoping that tonight is the night.
Tonight!
Nicole, last week, right out of the box, you were in the final two.
I know.
Right?
Right?
And it didn't work out.
Now, here is what happened.
You've rejected a lot of dudes along the way.
Yes.
And then finally a guy rejected you.
How did that feel?
It definitely bruised my ego.
But you know, I'm one of 30 gorgeous girls, and we're all here to get a date tonight.
Ok.
Mindy... week five, sister.
I know.
I came close a few times.
You have come close.
I have come close.
But you threw me some curve balls.
What do I have to do to get you walking up those stairs arm in arm with a man?
Uh, find me the perfect man.
Does he have to have a job?
Yes!
I'll try my best.
I'll try my best.
Let's hear it for the girls.
Okay, you know how this works.
Each girl has a light on in front of them.
A single man will come down in the love lift, and if the girls like what they see, they keep their light on.
But if they don't like him, they turn their light off.
So if you're not turned on...
Turn off.
Everybody ready?
Whoo!
Ladies here comes your first boyfriend-to-be.
Listen to his music.
He chose it just for you.
Let the macaroni see the cheese.
Single man, reveal yourself.
Welcome.
Great to see you.
Nice to see you too.
Show the ladies what you got.
Hello, you show-stopping ladies.
My name is Shawn, and I am the showstopper from sterling heights, Michigan.
If he is not Mr. right, turn out your light.
18 lights are still on!
Let me dig a little deeper and see what's happening.
Chelsea, why did you turn your light off?
His shirt is as shiny as mine, George.
Wait a minute.
He's bold.
Woman like flashy guys with confidence.
There's too many dull, boring guys out there.
Why not show some flash, right?
Caitlin, now, I must say that I thought this guy was for you--I really did.
Oh, you don't think very highly of me.
Oh!
Kelli, why did you leave your light on?
I'm kind of into it.
Everyone's kinda taken aback by the shine, but I feel like I'm a little glitzy tonight, and we can shine and show off together.
We match.
I love it.
Nicole?
I'm a little surprised that your light is on.
I pictured you a different type.
What do you like?
Uh, he has really big feet.
All right.
That is a great start, showstopper.
18 ladies are still hot for Shawn.
But will they still be sizzling when we dig a little deeper in round two?
Ladies, remember, if you're turned off...
Turn off.
When I was growing up, I always wanted to be a lawyer.
I went to law school, but I gave up the career of a successful lawyer to become a student of the world.
The world is a book.
People that don't travel are just reading a page.
I love to party, I love expensive things, and I want a woman that can keep up with that.
We can share this fantasy lifestyle together and live out our dreams.
I'm the author of a self-help book.
It's called the showstopper lifestyle.
And part of that lifestyle is to surround myself with beautiful women.
I'm not sure if I can say I've actually been in love, and I'm not sure if I believe in that traditional concept.
I think that it's possible for a couple to be emotionally monogamous and physically polygamous.
If my girlfriend came up to me and said, "I want to sleep with other men,"
as long as you're open and honest, I think that's fine.
I'm just looking for a girl that will stay up with me and party all night and live out this adventurous lifestyle together.
All right!
Showstopper, that was close, baby.
There is just one light left on.
How do you feel about that?
Oh, my God.
Wait.
All it takes is one, right?
You're still in the game!
All right...
That's what I love about this show.
She was the last one to realize it.
She's, like, "I'm still on?"
Julia, I love a woman who is an independent thinker, who doesn't care what the other ladies think.
Who sees a shiny shirt and says, "yeah, okay."
Yeah.
Thank you.
Well, I think he has this kind of Aladdin vibe going on.
I can show her a whole new world.
Yeah, I can be your Jasmine.
We just gotta work on the polygamy thing.
Jennae, what do you say about that?
You saw the tape.
What do you say?
I did see the tape.
Yes.
Um, I just don't think he'd be happy with one.
I mean, from what he looks like, he wants to take all of us out.
I don't know.
What's wrong with that?
Okay, Katie Ann.
Yes.
You shouldn't have said those things out loud.
Wait a minute, like what?
Like what?
Polygamy and that
I could be with another guy.
Keep it secret, like most guys do?
Ah...
Oh.
I want to be your number one, not part of 50, sweetie.
I've always said you might not be always be the one, but you can be number one.
Do any guys in here agree with that thinking?
Okay, showstopper, just one light is on.
Julia, we're gonna give you one more chance to find out some more about Shawn.
Julia... don't get too excited.
If you're not turned on...
Turn off!
When people come to my party, they're gonna first see a shrine to myself.
And I think people-- oh!
What?
Wait a minute, this is a shock.
What happened?
We got a blackout.
How does this happen?
Julia...
What do you have to say for yourself?
Uh, a shrine to yourself?
I think you should have a shrine to me instead.
I can't let you leave here without some love.
Come on, man, give me a hug.
It's not you, it's them.
Come on.
Thank you.
Say good-bye to Shawn, everybody.
The showstopper is someone who minimizes worries and maximizes life experiences.
It's somebody who is open-minded, honest, and adventurous.
That's exactly what I am, and none of these ladies could handle it.
That didn't work out very well for the showstopper, but let's catch up with one of last week's dates.
I hope this one went a little better.
Take a look.
Trucker Phil chose Kelly b.
To ride shotgun on their date at the take me out resort.
I'm super excited to see Phil again.
I'm a little bit nervous because Phil didn't actually pick me--
I was the last one standing.
So we'll find out today if he likes me or not.
What's up?
Hello.
So glad to see you.
Wonderful to see you.
Seeing Kelly again was great.
She's just as beautiful as I remembered her and looking forward to spending the day with her.
This is crazy.
We sure are not on the ground anymore, that's for sure.
Oh, mama!
Where's my mama?
Kelly has a great sense of humor.
You never really know what's gonna come out of her mouth.
We seem to be having fun so far.
We'll see where the rest of the date goes.
So do you think your mom would freak out if you brung me home?
Oh, I don't think so.
Phil is a little laid-back, and I don't know,
I think he might think I'm, like, so weird.
Aah!
He's not really asking me a lot of questions, so I'm trying to get him to open up more to me.
So, like, if I was to ask your friends about you, what would they say?
Are you, like, a health-conscious eater?
What do you do for work?
My best friend, she's a rapper, so my job is to hype up the crowd.
All right, give me some hype, then.
You're like a little-- a little lil jon.
Yeah.
There's a little lil jon in you.
I'm like, yeah!
I'm like, yeah!
What?
Ooh!
Get this one, hey!
Get this one!
Get this!
I be like-
- Kelly was awesome, but I think we're two different people, and I don't think there's gonna be much of a romantic future there.
I might be too much for you, Phil.
I don't know if you can handle all of this.
I don't know.
Can you handle all of this?
At least they had fun.
Okay, I'm gonna bring out a new guy, and I'm telling you, girls, he's gonna knock your socks off when we come back on take me out.
What song would you ride down the love lift to?
Tell us on Twitter using mysoundtrack.
Welcome back to take me out.
Okay, brace yourself, girls.
The love lift is coming down, carrying my next fantastic guy.
And he chose the music just for you.
This dude don't even need music!
Let the oysters see the rockefeller.
Single man, reveal yourself.
Welcome to the show.
Thank you, George.
Appreciate it.
And he smells fantastic.
You're up.
What's up, ladies?
My name's kash, and I'm from bridgeport, West Virginia.
Ladies, if he's not out of sight, turn out your light.
Oh!
27 lights, kash!
Fantastic start.
Let me go and get the lowdown on the lights.
Jennae, you said, "bring me out a great guy,"
and your Uncle George brings you out kash, and-- when I saw you, you are most definitely a slice of perfection...
I mean, you're hot.
Thank you.
Thank you.
For once, someone too perfect.
I never thought I would see it.
A guy like you probably doesn't have nice abs.
Can I take a look, kash?
I mean... take a look.
Oh, he has enough cuts.
Yeah, that's-- he has enough cuts.
Turn my light on.
Okay, zaza.
Hey.
Break it down.
Hey zaza.
I'm so excited, I can't even talk right now.
But I think this says a lot.
I know.
I know.
Can I just write a check to take you out...
Kash?
All right, kash!
This is gonna be tough.
27 women have their lights on for kash.
But will they still want to cash in their love chips when they see round two?
Ladies, if you're not turned on...
Turn off.
So I'm a good ol' Southern country boy from West Virginia, and morals, values, and chivalry are very important to me.
I play multiple sports, but my biggest passion is my dream job-- to be a punter in the NFL.
I'm working hard for it every day.
I've got the drive and the passion, and that's what's gonna really push me through it.
So until I obtain my dream job of being a professional punter,
I've been modeling.
Anything from regular modeling to underwear modeling.
That doesn't change who I am or what I'm all about.
I'm proud to say that I am a mama's boy, and I talk to her at least three times a day.
Hey, mom, what's going on?
I miss you.
Oh, I miss you too.
It's still looking like the next time I come back,
I'll probably be single, you know.
So I'm still looking for that kind, generous, down-home girl to really spend the rest of my life with.
And I'm hoping that I can find her here tonight.
23 lights are on.
You're doing great, kash.
Thank you, George.
Let me go and find out what happened.
Mindy... oh, yes.
Why are you out?
Because he described the perfect woman, and it was, like, the opposite of everything I am.
I'm not down to earth.
I'm not homegrown.
I am not homegrown!
Let's be real.
Nina?
When you first came out, I was like,
"wow, he's perfect.
I hope he's a nice, wholesome guy."
And then that was the next package.
So I'm from the midwest, born and raised-- a good, wholesome girl, and you're just what I'm looking for.
Oh!
Thank you, Nina.
Anna?
I saw his abs, and I couldn't think beyond that.
Kash, I want to see your secret stash.
Oh!
I think kash might get a date.
It's gonna be a tough decision, but I think you're looking great.
This is gonna be really tough, George, really tough.
23 ladies still think kash is king.
But will he still be king when he bends over backwards to win their hearts?
Kash, take your position.
Okay, ladies, if you're turned off, turn off.
Kash, you got yourself a date!
11. 11.
Yeah, baby!
This is gonna be tough. 18 lights are still on.
Let me go and check in with the ladies.
Brooke, my man's athletic.
Why did you turn your light off?
Kash, I think you're absolutely adorable.
I'm just in my late 20s, and I don't really want to date the high school cheerleader.
So...
I need a man-- like, a man.
How old are you, kash?
26, George.
How old are you?
I'm older.
I'm 27.
27?
Oh, God, God.
That's way too old.
Go lie down.
Let me get you some oxygen.
Anna... yes.
I'm from New York, and in New York, we worry about our things getting stolen.
But you just stole my heart.
18 girls are in.
But now, kash, you have to narrow it down to just two when we come back on take me out!
Welcome back to take me out.
Whew!
Kash has 18 girls with their lights on, but now kash is gonna have to choose his favorite two girls.
The power... is in your hands.
Go and turn off the lights of the ladies that are gonna get sacked, and leave your favorite two all-stars with their lights on.
Kash!
Go and break some hearts, boy!
Who's going out?
Who's going out?
Erin is out.
Katie Ann is out.
Suki's out.
Oh!
Kassi's out.
Nicole w.
Is out.
Ire is out.
Who's it gonna be?
Oh...
The double!
Oh, Vanessa's out.
Sonja's still in.
You got a lot of lights left, kash.
Sheena's out.
Roxanne is out.
Five more.
Oh...
Kasia's out.
Jamie's out!
Three more.
Lisa's out.
Two more to turn off.
Nina's out.
One more.
Who is it gonna be?
Chelsea's out.
Kash!
Whew!
Kash, you have chosen Sonja and Anna.
Now, kash, you have to pick just one.
The girls know a lot about you, but you don't know much about them, so now you get to ask them one question, kash.
Make it a good one.
Okay, so, Sonja and Anna, what would y'all consider to be your most ideal romantic date, and why?
Sonja, let's go to you.
Um, I'm from Florida, so I've always loved the beach.
And I think a nice walk at sunset with a nice, little glass of wine and maybe some dessert would be really romantic.
And we could just talk and have a nice night.
Anna?
Well, I see you like to work out.
I was hoping you could teach me some moves.
And also, I don't know.
Something with whipped cream and cherries on top.
I don't know.
Okay, kash, you have a girl who wants to go for a nice walk, have a glass of wine.
And then you have a girl that wants to make a dessert out of you.
Kash will turn one off and take one out.
It's on one side or the other.
Who is it gonna be?
Oh!
It's kash and Sonja!
Well done!
Why did you pick Sonja?
She's just beautiful.
Okay.
I see it.
Do you love it?
I love it.
Your first date is going to be at the hacienda of happiness, the El dorado of romance.
Where are they going?
Take me out resort!
All right, you kids.
Sonja is really a beautiful girl, but what I'm really looking forward to is this date tomorrow, so I can get to really know her, not just from when I see her onstage.
I was giving him eyes the entire time.
At one point, I was like, "guys, I made five-second eye contact."
Last week, Aaron went head over heels for Jenny.
So were they walking in air, or did they crash back down to earth?
Let's find out.
Aaron turned Jenny's world upside-down when he chose her for a first date at the take me out resort.
I was a little nervous before I saw Aaron today.
I definitely think he's attractive, but I don't know what will happen, where it will go.
Hi.
Hey.
Jenny's personality is really great.
And when I saw her, she looked amazing.
I'm definitely looking forward to getting to know her a lot better.
Let's go.
All right.
Jenny looked amazing out on the waverunner.
She knew what she was doing, and she looked great while she was doing it.
Cheers.
Cheers.
To the beautiful lady.
Oh, thank you.
Aaron's a little bit quiet, which is a bad thing, but hopefully he opens up.
What do you do besides modeling?
Uh, that's about it.
I hang out.
I go the gym, play video games.
Play video games?
Yeah.
I'm a little bit of a video game nerd sometimes.
You're one of those?
Yeah.
Not too bad, but sometimes.
I was hoping that we would have a connection, maybe some basic conversation.
But I felt like I was watching paint dry.
But hey, you know, my guy's out there somewhere.
I'm not worried.
No!
Guys, word of advice, video games is not a first-date conversation.
Beep, beep, beep.
Okay.
We need another supermodel on our catwalk of beautiful women.
Give it up for Natasha, a singer from highland park, California!
The love lift is on its way with my next handsome hunk.
Listen to his music, girls.
He chose it just for you.
Let the holy... see the moly.
Single man, reveal yourself.
Smooth.
What's happenin'?
Welcome to the show, homey.
Go for it.
How you doing, ladies?
My name is Michael, and I'm from San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Girls, if you're not turned on...
Turn off!
20 lights are still on.
Let me go over here and find out what's happening.
Ire?
Well, he's got a lot of swag, and everything like that.
But I just have to say, you know, I like a man to be able to take me camping and all that.
And the last time I went camping, I didn't see a man wearing that kind of shirt.
Well, you might not have seen a man camping in that t-shirt, but I've never seen a girl camping in that dress, by the way.
There we go.
Natasha... brand-new to the show.
I'm in!
I am in it to win it.
I like my men like my coffee-- strong, dark, and keeps me up all night!
That's what I'm talking about!
He can roll those arms all over me!
She hit the ground running.
I'm out.
All right, Michael.
20 girls are liking what they see.
But they're about to find out more about the real you, and everything could change when we come back on take me out!
Welcome back to take me out.
Michael's starting out, hoping to impress my 30 ladies.
20 are still in, but they're about to learn a whole lot more about him!
Ladies, you know the drill.
If he doesn't have the clout, turn your light out.
I'm a real cool, laid-back guy.
Kind, you know, a sweetheart, friendly.
And, you know, some of my friends call me "rebel"
because I have tons of energy, and, like, I definitely can't put that to waste.
That's why I dance so much.
It's important for me to be a good role model for my brothers and sisters, because growing up, I didn't have that.
Michael is my son, and he's a great son.
I think he will be a great man.
Mike's like my little brother.
I've known him for many years.
Michael has no limits, and that's what I like about him.
He's not gonna let any obstacle stand in his way.
Life is definitely too short to worry about things you can't control.
So I focus on the important things.
I was born and raised in Puerto Rico and first person in my family to go to college.
I'm a full-time student focusing on criminal justice.
I like women of all ethnicity, all shapes and sizes.
I guess you could say I'm, like, the united nations of dating 'cause I'll find my queen, no matter where she's from.
Seven girls are still in.
Let me see what's happening.
Zaza, why is your light off?
The last person I was with--my ex-- he was going to law school,
I had a really bad experience.
He cheated on me, like, almost four years.
I'm done with that.
Why does he have to pay for your ex-boyfriend's mistakes?
Every--every time I'm-- come on!
Natasha, you kept your light on.
It's still on.
You know what really struck me about him was when he said that he loved women of all shapes and sizes.
And let's get real-
- I'm a big girl!
And you know what, men are always bragging about, "oh, I bench 250-
- I bench--"
bench me, honey.
You could bench me.
I like that.
I like that.
I like it.
Michael has seven girls thinking that he just might be the man of their dreams.
Ladies, you know the score.
If he's not Mr. right, turn out that light.
Michael dates a lot, yet he never spends a dime.
I was taught different ways and formulas to get what you want.
I used to work at the movie theaters, so I'm very cool with the managers.
I'll pick her up so that she never sees me, you know, getting the tickets for free.
Wait a minute, we got a blackout!
What?
Natasha, what's going on?
Honey, it takes a lot of money to look this cheap, and if he's not looking to buy a ticket, yeah, we're gonna have problems.
Mindy, what put you off?
I'm not asking for him to buy me a Mercedes, but a movie ticket is not that expensive.
Seriously!
Spend a little money.
Come on, give me some Latino love.
It's all good, baby.
All right?
Come on.
Give it up for Michael, everybody!
I'm not cheap, I just get a lot of free stuff.
It's not my fault I know a lot of people, but there is more than 30 girls out there.
You know, I'll be all right.
Now, last week, Kenny and Marisa set out for a date full of romance.
So did passion sing, or was it all choked up?
Let's find out.
Massage therapist Kenny rubbed Marisa the right way when he chose her for a date at the take me out resort.
I am feeling a little nervous, I have to say.
I really didn't think that Kenny was going to pick me.
Hello.
Hello.
How are you?
Marisa seems like a down-to-earth, genuine kind of girl.
And that's the kind of girl that I like.
So we're just gonna go ahead and sit.
Like that?
However you feel comfortable.
I was a little out of place when it came to the yoga.
We're gonna exhale.
We're gonna forward fold.
But she seemed to know what she was doing, so I was just following her lead.
Exhale and forward fold.
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Perfect.
When we bent forward, and he snuck a little kiss on the cheek,
I was not expecting him to come on so strong, but it was so incredibly adorable.
It just caught me off guard a little bit.
I'm feeling pretty good.
We had a great first part of the day, and I'm very excited to get to know him a little bit better.
So I'm dying to know about the show.
Mm-hmm.
What were you feeling out there?
Honestly, I didn't think that I had a chance in hell with you.
You had a tough job.
I can only imagine coming out of that love lift and, like, looking back at us.
30 just, like, completely different women, you know?
Yeah.
A lot of judging eyes on me.
Yeah.
Totally.
I didn't know what to think, but I finally met eyes with you at one point in there, and then-- mm-hmm.
And I don't know if you felt the same thing, but that's where I was looking at the rest of the show.
Yeah, we definitely-- yeah.
I feel good that she's into me, and I'm definitely into her too.
I'm glad I chose you.
I had a wonderful time tonight.
Absolutely.
It was so great getting to know you.
I think the date went really, really well, and I think it could be the beginning of something really, really nice.
I think I wanted to do this first.
Could that be a new relationship?
You saw it here first, people.
If you're loving the show, get involved with takemeout.
When we come back, another handsome hunk will be headed down the love lift on take me out.
Okay, ladies, at least for tonight, here comes your last chance for romance.
Check out his music.
He picked it for you.
Let the pork see the beans.
Single man, reveal yourself.
Welcome to the show, handsome.
Thanks for having me.
Go get 'em.
Hi, ladies.
My name's Davin.
I'm from clearwater, Florida.
Girls, if you're turned off, turn off.
Oh, yeah, baby!
30 lights are still on.
Let's find out what all the love is about.
Nicole, I am trying to get you up those stairs, arm in arm with a man.
Is this the man?
That one.
I hope so.
Yeah.
I mean, you brought out the "showstopper," and-- ho ho!
Oh!
And then you bring something like this and totally redeem yourself.
I saved the best for last.
Natasha?
Yep, my girls are at full attention, and those pants are tight enough to see that I've got a full salute!
You're doing fantastic.
30 lights are still on!
But round two is coming up.
Girls, if he's not Mr. right, turn out that light.
I'm a sleek dresser.
I speak well, and I'm always ready to meet and greet new people.
Why look good when you can look great?
As a businessman working for a fortune 500 company,
I think dressing slick is crucial.
You can't really leave the house looking like you just, you know, rolled out of bed.
In my life, I only surround myself with people that are generally successful.
'Cause that's one of the qualities I look for in anybody that I'm gonna have a relationship with, man or woman.
It's gonna work out great.
I look forward to it.
Rhythm is really important to me.
It's in my blood, it's in my culture.
A woman that can dance, that's a must.
You know, you can find me always on the dance floor.
I'm looking for a classy lady that's honest and can move on the dance floor.
I'm looking for a girl that's as hungry for life as I am.
22 girls are still in.
I actually am a little bit shocked, because you were dancing, and the girls want guys that can dance.
And then some lights went out.
Sydney.
Yes.
What didn't you like?
He was talking about being successful and a businessman at a fortune 500 company, and your light goes out.
You know, I'm kind of a hippie at heart, and sometimes I do wake up in the morning, and it looks like I just rolled out of bed.
And I just don't think he would like that.
So for his own good, I turned out my light.
Nicole?
Uh, what's your background?
I'm puerto rican.
Perfect.
Done.
Check, we're good.
You like-- you like latinos.
Yes!
All right, Davin, you got 22 girls that are still interested in going on a date with you.
But will that be the case after Davin shares a deep secret-- a dark secret-- in round three?
Girls, if he doesn't make you jump, give the button a thump.
I've been called a compulsive dater, and I have to be honest, I have cheated on women before.
When I cheated on my girlfriend in college, it was awful because I did think she was the one.
In turn, it ended up happening to me in my last relationship, and everything kind of came full circle.
I can't say that I'm the perfect guy, but I learned my lesson after getting cheated on.
Being honest has to be my number one priority, because without honesty and trust, there's no relationship that can be built.
Five girls are still on.
You got yourself a date!
You got a date!
Let's check in with the girls.
Brooke.
Oh, George.
Why did you turn your light off?
I dated a cheater before.
And just that word "cheat,"
um, I just can't do it again.
Once a cheater, always a cheater, so-- aw.
Nicole, what's going on?
I mean, come on!
Doesn't everyone cheat?
Hasn't everyone cheated at least one point in their life?
What?
That's your response?
That's your response?
I mean, everyone has their things.
Everyone has their things.
So you trust him.
I didn't say I trusted him, I just said that maybe I could trust him along the way.
Who knows?
Okay.
All right.
That was very interesting and therapeutic at the same time.
So, Davin, five girls are willing to look past your past to be part of your future!
But now it's time to narrow those five girls down to just two.
The power... is now in your hands.
You're going to turn out the lights of the girls you don't want to be with when we come back on take me out!
Welcome back to take me out.
Davin has five girls with their lights on.
But now he has to narrow those five down to just two.
Okay, go and turn off the lights of the girls who don't quite turn you on, and leave on your favorite two.
Who's it gonna be?
Jennae's out.
Two more to turn off.
Suki's out.
You need to turn one more off.
Oh!
It's 'cause I cheat.
It's 'cause I'm a cheater.
Davin, you've gone for kasia and for Nina.
They know a lot about you, but you don't know that much about them.
So now you get to ask them one question.
Make it a good one.
All right, ladies, you know I love music, and I love dancing.
So if you were to write a song about the both of us, what would the title be?
Okay, here we go.
Kasia?
Feel the rhythm.
Because--because, I mean... you have to have good rhythm when you're dancing, and a relationship has to have good rhythm and flow as well.
So...
Nina?
I'm gonna steal a lyric.
It's gonna be dreaming of you tonight.
So even if you don't pick me, you're gonna be in my thoughts.
Aww.
It is between kasia and Nina.
Go turn one off and take one out!
Davin!
Oh, man.
Who is it gonna be?
Davin, congratulations... with kasia.
What made you pick kasia?
I tend to like brunettes, and I guess I gotta keep it within the family, you know?
Okay.
All right.
We have kind of the same hair.
Well, you're off to a place to put the "o" in romance.
It's gorgeous and glamorous, just like you two.
Where is it?
Take me out resort.
All right, you two, you're out!
I mean, all the ladies were beautiful tonight.
It's just something about kasia.
I kept scanning the room, and I kept coming back to her.
I don't know if it was her dress or her lips.
She just had a beautiful smile and a great attitude.
I definitely almost locked him out when he said that he had cheated in the past.
Um, but I'm really glad I gave him the benefit of the doubt and kind of heard him out.
And I'm really excited for the date.
That was one busy night.
I made two new couples-- kash and Sonja...
Davin and kasia.
We'll find out whose hearts are still fluttering next week.
And more of America's finest fellows will be going all out to get a date with America's most beautiful belles.
We'll find that loving feeling once again next time on take me out.
Good night!
I'm continuing my quest to change the way we view ancient Rome.
The collapse of the republic shortly before the birth of Christ, unleashed a new era of imperial magnificence.
Rome's empire was built on the might of its legions and genius of its engineers.
We all know that.
But there was something else equally important.
The power of art.
And you can't understand the history of Rome until you understand its monuments.
Like Trajan's Column.
Emperors like Trajan were the masters of this new type of strident, declamatory art.
They transformed their public monuments into big brash billboards, boasting of their conquests.
But there was another side to Roman art.
The private world of the emperors who collected art overflowing with mythological fantasy, unimaginable cruelty, and red hot eroticism.
For all of those mad, bad and dangerous emperors of the first century AD, people like Caligula and Nero, art of the highest quality, offered a backcloth for their hedonistic debauchery.
To the modern eye, much of what we'll see is shocking and depraved, and it tells us much about the emperors and their many vices.
By dropping in on the emperors at home in their lost pleasure palaces, we'll see how art dominated their lives.
History always gives the wrong sense of the word - something in the past that's done and dusted.
But it's not - it's a beautiful unfolding story that's continuing.
This was an era of exuberance and of great artistic triumphs.
And one man presided over a cultural golden age, that crystallised the look of the Roman empire at its zenith, for ever more.
The emperor Hadrian.
The first emperor, Augustus had brought peace and prosperity to Rome after years of civil war.
He also killed off the republic, and replaced it with a new political and artistic vision for an imperial future.
The big question, was what would happen after his death?
It's something Augustus had planned for.
This is the Maison Carree, it's one of the best preserved Roman temples anywhere in the world.
And it was dedicated to Augustus's grandsons,
Gaius and Lucius Caesar, who'd been anointed as his heirs, but they died early, long before he did.
And you can see it's a stunning building in its own right.
But, despite its splendour, it isn't anywhere near Rome.
In fact, this was built in Nimes, in the South of France.
Just imagine the kind of message that buildings like this must have sent out to the people who lived in Roman colonies.
The Maison Carree is a gleaming marble-clad vision of the future.
All sorts of details of it proclaim a new era of peace and prosperity like these abundantly carved Corinthian capitals you can see at the tops of the columns.
And their lush acanthus foliage you can see scrolling right round the temples, sumptuous and very crisp, frieze.
The temple was also the beginning of something new, because above the entrance, you had the names of members of Augustus's family, emblazoned in big bronze letters, and today you can still see the holes where those letters were attached.
So the Maison Carree was the beginning of what would become essentially a cult that spread right across the empire with astonishing speed - honouring and celebrating the emperor and his dynasty.
After the death of Augustus in AD 14, temples like this, were decorated with statues of emperors as gods.
Augustus himself was deified by the senate.
And depicted as the most important god of them all, Jupiter.
It was the start of an imperial cult, which played an important role in uniting the empire that sprawled all the way across three continents, from Gaul in the North, to Asia Minor in the East, and Egypt in the South.
Augustus had created the Julio-Claudian dynasty.
Everything now depended on his successors, starting with his adopted son, Tiberius, Rome's second emperor.
When we think of Roman art, most of us think of galleries of busts and sculptures.
But in the late republic, in the early empire, there was another art form which was very exquisite and prized, actually more highly by the Romans themselves, which was the carving of gemstones, semi-precious stones.
And there's a piece here in the Biblioteque Nationale in Paris, which is the biggest gem to have survived from antiquity, and this is it.
It's known as the great cameo of France.
And as you can see, it is ginormous.
It's made of an Indian stone called sardonyx.
This is a layered semi-precious stone.
And this is a cameo which means it's been carved in relief, so the artist who's created it, has taken advantage of the different colours of the layers of the stone to achieve the effect of the brightness of the figures in the foreground,
versus the darkness of the background.
And there's a great deal of subtlety in-between as well.
And this piece shows in the centre, the emperor Tiberius enthroned as Jupiter.
Above him you can see his ancestors, there's Augustus, veiled with a crown, being taken up towards the gods.
And beneath him you see a bunch of barbarians huddled together, so there's a very clear demarcation between the enemy beneath, the Roman court in the middle, and their proximity to the world of the gods up above.
We know quite a lot about Tiberius, and the other 11 of the first 12 Caesars from this.
This is Seutonius, my granny first recommended this book to me, she loves it, and I always find that quite amusing because when you read it, it's so compelling because it feels like a red top expose of these different Caesars.
It's, to be honest, completely scabrous, scandal-filled salacious filth.
And we hear a little more about the kind of man that Tiberius was.
He was quite cruel, he was very cruel.
He was quite superior and proud, saturnine.
He wasn't the most affable person.
He had a load of pimples.
Next to Tiberius, as well, you can see his mother Livia.
Supposedly he quarrelled openly with Livia.
And, in fact, their quarrels were so intense and he was so upset by her overbearing presence in the politics of Rome, that eventually he left the city altogether and retired to a pleasure palace.
So this vision of domestic harmony and bliss, is really a far cry from the truth.
During the early years of the empire cameo carving enjoyed a boom and cameos were among Rome's most prized artistic treasures.
The artists were bigger names than sculptures and painters.
Ciro Accanito is a modern day cameo carver.
There was another side to Tiberius's taste in art, which we can revel in at a very special private place where he came to get away from his domineering mother.
Anyone who assumes that Roman art is the stuff of monochromatic marbles in boring old stuffy museums, needs to come here to this spectacular place, Sperlonga, which is 60 miles south of Rome, on the coast.
And it was once the setting for this luxurious seaside villa, where Tiberius used to come, and retreat from public life.
And back in the '50s there was an amazing archaeological discovery in a grotto just over there, which yields so much insight into how art was actually viewed by the Romans themselves.
Rather than seeing the pieces in museums, this place is all about the context of the art.
The centrepiece of Tiberius's villa here at Sperlonga, was this craggy grotto where Tiberius hosted what must have been these breathtaking dinner parties, banquets.
Imagine how spectacular they must have been with the sea crashing outside, and in here, a bunch of cosmopolitan guests, stuffing their faces.
And it's a famous location this, because Tiberius was almost killed here in this cave, when there was a rock fall.
In fact the story gets another outing in good old Seutonius, who talks about Tiberius's dinner party here at the cavern - spelunka in Latin - when some huge rocks fell from the roof, killed several guests in attendance close to him
and he miraculously survived.
And I imagine that many of those guests would have been a bit disappointed that he did survive because, by all accounts,
Tiberius was a very dour, cruel-hearted, cold-blooded emperor.
Supposedly one of Tiberius's ways to get off was that he trained little boys, whom he called his minnows - brilliant detail - to chase him while he went swimming and get between his legs to lick and nibble him.
Each to his own, I guess!
But the important point for us, aside from all of the colour in Seutonius, is that this cavern was an art gallery as well as a social space, and it shows how art was used socially.
Back in the '50s they salvaged around 7,000 scraps of marble statuary whilst they were excavating Tiberius's cavern.
And the most important have been meticulously reassembled here in the museum at the site, alongside these colossal recreations of the sculptural centrepieces of the grotto.
And this is a piece known as the Blinding Of Polyphemus.
It presents a scene from The Odyssey, in which Odysseus and his followers have become trapped in the cave of the cyclops Polyphemus, who's started eating some of the followers.
He had a couple for dinner one night, next morning he ate a couple more for breakfast.
Understandably, Odysseus wants to leave.
So he hatches a cunning plan, which is to get the cyclops drunk, so you can see one of Odysseus' followers is carrying a leather wine skin.
Polyphemus himself has been drinking a load of wine in his wine bowl, and it's just slipped from his fingers and he falls back in a drunken stupor on this rock, with his single cyclops eye closed, ready to be blinded
as Odysseus, with great drama, frenzy on his face, commands his followers to pick up a burning stake and shove it right into Polyphemus's eye.
What a wonderfully ironic piece to have for the middle of a banquet setting in a cavern.
You can't help but speculate that some of the guests who were in the cavern in real life, would have looked at this group and thought
"I'd really like to stick a stake of my own, right into Tiberius's eyes."
One person who wouldn't have been welcome at one of his raunchy cave parties was his mother, Livia.
She had a villa of her own at Prima Porta near Rome.
Her taste was somewhat more refined than her son's.
I really feel that this is one of the gentlest and most beautiful works of art to have survived from the Roman world.
And it's extraordinary to think it was painted 2,000 years ago for a windowless room, a triclinium or dining room in the house of Livia which would have been used as a refuge from the summer heat and what you see is this magical transporting woodland fantasy.
Oaks and laurels and pomegranates and quinces and cypresses, date palms.
There are poppies, there are cabbage roses.
And replete with all of these exotic songbirds which are luminescent in the foliage.
And the whole thing's been suffused with this beautiful greeny-blue murky, magical early morning mist so that the trees in the foreground, are so sharp you could practically lean over these fences and pluck the fruit off the bough and take a bite.
But in the distance, it's much more shadowy and indistinct which creates that sense of depth and a feeling of well-being really.
It makes you feel very happy and calm.
I want to dive in to this strange magical fantasy land on the other side of the fence.
Most of the paintings that survive from antiquity are frescoes.
That's because they're literally part of the walls.
The fresco is a technique in which you paint on the wall so for this we need to apply plaster made with sand and lime.
And on the top of this layer we paint with the pigments mixed with water only.
The pigment soaks into the pores of the plaster and hardens.
Pigment mixed with wax is used to paint the fine details.
I think the Romans were very natural painting.
In the houses, to decorate on the walls is fantastic.
Tiberius outlived his mother but by the time of his death, he'd withdrawn entirely into his own private world, with his minnows.
He was succeeded in AD 37 by his great nephew
Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, better known as Caligula.
Probably the most scandalous Roman emperor of all.
I've come to Lake Nemi just outside Rome, to investigate a story of depravity, modern day tomb raiders, and a lost masterpiece.
Caligula got his nickname because when he was growing up he spent a great deal of time with the Roman army.
And he used to have this miniaturised soldiers' uniform.
The soldiers had standard issue boots and the Latin word for boots is caligae, and the diminutive, is caligula, so it was quite an affectionate sweet name really, quite endearing imagining this little boy in his soldiers' outfit,
trying to be one of the big boys.
Of course it doesn't bear witness remotely, to the extent of his cruelty and debauchery.
And we get a very good sense of that from Seutonius.
You know, we think that Berlusconi had these debauched bunga bunga parties,
I tell you, he didn't have anything on these 1st Century AD emperors.
I mean the section on Caligula goes on and on.
Well, for one thing, when he was having dinner, he enjoyed breaking it up by having sex with his sisters, he was really into incest.
All three of his sisters had to sleep with him at regular intervals.
There was probably something actually wrong with him mentally.
He really enjoyed watching people being executed in a very slow fashion.
Apparently his familiar order,
"Make him feel that he is dying," soon became proverbial.
There's been a recent and exciting new twist in the story of Caligula.
Tomb raiders struck gold, or rather marble, near the lake shore.
Broken fragments of a rare statue of Caligula.
The police arrested the thieves as they tried to smuggle the statue to Switzerland, en route for Japan.
Their discovery confirms that Caligula did, in fact, have a palatial villa on Lake Nemi.
The statue's now safely installed in the museum, next to replicas of two of Caligula's ships.
The originals were salvaged from the lake in 1932, on the orders of Mussolini, only to be destroyed in a fire 12 years later.
Say this had been sold on the black market, how much would it have fetched?
We don't know for sure, that kind of sculpture have a lot of appeal so it's a thousand, over a million maybe.
A million euros?
Yes.
But it's so weathered and it's so fragmentary.
The antique market is like this, you know.
How excited did you feel, I mean this must be quite a rare discovery?
SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN
To me there's a contradiction that someone as debased as Caligula could represent himself as a god.
It's a paradox that runs right through Roman art and society.
On the one hand Rome is the last word in ancient civilisation, but at the same time it had a shocking blood lust and taste for cruelty that's played out in the artistic arena.
This is one of my favourite works that survived from antiquity.
It's the sculpture of what's called the Hanging Marsyas and Marsyas was a character from ancient myth.
He was a satyr who played the pan pipes, and he challenged the god Apollo who played a lyre, to a musical contest, and obviously that was a contest he was doomed to lose.
And as a result Apollo condemned him to be executed for the temerity of challenging him to this contest in the first place, by being flayed alive.
So here he is, his feet tied together, possibly his shoulders have already been dislocated, he's strung up, and we know about the Hanging Marsyas because about 60 copies of the sculpture from the Roman world have survived.
This one is particularly grizzly, because the marble that was used to carve it is known as pavonazzetto, it's a red streaked marble, you can see there's a violet crimson-ish tinge, to the stone,
which in a way prefigures the punishments about to be enacted.
All of the blood and guts and sinews and veins that would have been seen after the executioner started flaying Marsyas alive, is there already in that red sheen to the stone.
It's very gruesome.
This particular one was discovered in a garden in Rome, gardens belonging to a very wealthy man called Maecenas who was the patron of the poet Virgil.
And, in a sense, the hanging Marsyas gets right to the heart of Roman art, because it illustrates the whole conundrum about it.
How could such a gruesome scene of punishment, produce pleasure for the Romans, so that they would have things like this hanging up in their gardens?
Another stunning example of the Romans love of violence is the Farnese Bull, which was found in the Baths of Caracalla in Rome.
Astonishingly carved out of a single piece of marble, it shows the punishment of Dirce, a character from Greek mythology as she's tied to the horns of a bull, then gored to death.
Just what you want from a piece of public art.
Cruelty was one side of the coin, on the other, was no holds barred debauchery.
This can be seen in one of the most controversial works to have survived from ancient Rome.
So if ever you doubted that the past can be a foreign country, then the Warren Cup provides the proof.
It's a silver wine goblet, and it's very distinctive because it's decorated with these two scenes, really quite raunchy scenes celebrating gay sex.
I guess the thing that's proved controversial to modern people is just that the two scenes are quite eye-wateringly explicit.
So on one side on this side you've got a young man, who's holding a strap, and he's lowering himself onto an older bearded man.
You can see a small boy, slave, a peeping Tom, who's just poking his head round the door to watch the action.
On this side you've got two younger men, and one of them's entering the other from behind, and again you can you can just make out his silver testicles, which have been very lovingly picked out by whoever's made this work of art.
It's a really beautiful very high status object, but that's not really why this cups so interesting.
It's interesting to imagine how this was used socially.
What was the context for something like this?
Would it have raised eyebrows in the ancient Roman world?
We don't know, but presumably not.
Something like this must have been an erotic centrepiece for the sorts of lavish parties and banquets that would have been held by Tiberius at Sperlonga or Caligula at Lake Nemi.
You can readily imagine that downing a load of wine from this goblet, would really help get you in the mood for whatever Tiberius was expecting.
After Caligula had been murdered by his own soldiers, he was succeeded by Claudius, and now I'm on his trail.
I'd like to introduce you to my new best buddy.
Sergio here has brought me to Baia, which is just north of the Bay of Naples, because back in the '60s there was an extraordinary discovery when a big storm churned up the seabed, and people looking down through the surface of the sea,
suddenly glimpsed some, what looked like, classical statues.
And it began this huge period of marine archaeology, and they excavated here, something called a Nymphaeum, which was a sort of fantasy grotto if you like, part of a big pleasure villa complex that belonged to one of the emperors from the 1st Century AD, Claudius.
You can, in fact, see just above the cliff there, the remains of his villa.
And I thought before we actually go diving to explore his Nymphaeum, there's just time to have a look at Seutonius's
Twelve Caesars, because somewhere around here we learn about his... the way he looked, the way he behaved.
He was apparently quite tall, he was well built and handsome, but he had various strange ticks, he had this uncontrolled laugh, and this horrible habit that stuck in my imagination, under the stress of anger, he used to slobber at the mouth and run at the nose.
He had a stammer and a persistent nervous tick that grew so bad under emotional stress that his head would toss from side to side.
It's not really what you expect of someone who leads the Roman empire.
He also had quite lavish tastes, they all did really in the 1st Century AD, all the emperors.
He gave many splendid banquets usually in large venues, and at times invited no fewer than 600 guests.
And it's tempting to imagine that 2,000 years ago, here, beneath the waves, Claudius would have hosted some extraordinary parties.
Big banquets, lavish, opulent affairs with hundreds of guests visiting his Nymphaeum.
OK!
It's hard to believe but we're actually swimming through the lost world of a Roman emperor.
You can imagine carts trundling along the cobbled Roman road.
My favourite moment comes as we're swimming along and Sergio starts pushing away sand and stones from the sea bed.
Underneath is this beautiful red-stained marble flooring, that looks like a piece of delicious Italian bresaola.
It's the closest I'll ever come to uncovering real treasure.
It starts getting eerie as figures appear suddenly out of the blue.
This one is Dionysus.
The god of wine.
The statue's a copy, the original's now in a museum.
Next, we meet what's left of Odysseus, and one of his friends, carrying a wine skin ready to get Polyphemus drunk.
So this time, perhaps wisely,
Polyphemus hasn't stuck around to get another stake in his eye.
There are also members of Claudius's family, I get to say a quick hello to his mum, Antonia Minor, before coming up for air.
That was very, very magical.
That was cool, there was... oh God, I've come a bit like Claudius.
I've got a runny nose, I'm slobbering, but that was beautiful.
Really beautiful.
Claudius supposedly died after eating poisonous mushrooms, as Roman emperors do.
He was succeeded by his great nephew, the last of our mad, bad and dangerous emperors, Nero.
While the other emperors cultivated the arts,
Nero actually took to the stage and performed.
His passion for theatre can be seen in this villa, reputably owned by his wife Poppaea.
During Nero's rule, the arts became infused with all sorts of theatrical flourishes that blurred the borders between reality and illusion.
How rare, I mean, what sort of a find is this?
This is really an extraordinary find.
These second style paintings are the largest and most complete that have ever been found or associated with an atrium.
And in fact the whole ensemble of painted works of art here, is really unsurpassed.
Vitruvius tells us that one of the subjects that the wall paintings took were stage facades.
So there was probably a kind of cross fertilisation between theatrical painting, and domestic painting.
The theatre was hugely important and was made particularly important in the last days of this villa because Nero himself was a patron of the theatre.
He acted, he performed for the first time we're told by the Roman historians, in Naples, so in a sense it all became super respectable then.
What could be better than having the Emperor himself saying, yes, theatre is great and good.
Didn't he lock the doors so people couldn't escape when he was performing?
The ultimate captive audience!
One of the Roman historians says that his performances were so long and tedious, that people used to fake dying to be carried out, to be relieved of this tedious performance.
I wonder whether that's why you've got the closed doors?
Along the whole Eastern side of the villa is this enormous great swimming pool.
And not just for the swimming, but along that side of the villa, they built a number of reception rooms, pleasure rooms, rooms for dining, rooms for relaxation, rooms for, you know, enjoying the ambiance.
But then, as you turn, you see again and again and again, this series of apertures, each one with a garden, which had real flowers, real plants, real fountains on it.
And then along the walls of those rooms, you had painted flowers and gardens.
So in the middle of this there would have been a garden?
There would have been plants and probably some kind of a fountain.
The artists have replicated it.
You're looking at the real thing but you're actually looking at the unreal thing, and because this is enclosed space, you can't actually get into it.
Your mind's eye is being drawn into both the real world and the illusionistic imaginary world at the same time.
I love some of the details.
There's a tiny bird there.
But think how more evocative it would be when there were real birds flittering around here.
On a summer's day, while you were lounging by the pool.
Do you think this is a kind of Roman sensibility?
This double-edged thing between nature and artifice somehow?
That they liked being on the cusp?
They revelled in it.
They wrote about the delight in basically art imitating nature...
There IS a bird!
There's a bird indeed!
Sorry.
Bird has returned to its lair!
No, artifice and...
Art and artifice and life and nature constantly suffusing, intermingling.
Which is what we see here.
The garden, and then garden all around.
Real garden, painted garden.
Yeah.
Wonderful!
Nero's suicide in AD 68 signalled the end of a dynasty.
And for Rome, things could only get better.
To understand how it changed, we need to look at a very different kind of art.
The art of pomp and power.
The great Historian of ancient Rome, Edward Gibbon, once described the second century as,
"The period in the history of the world
"during which the condition of the human race
"was most happy and prosperous."
It was the golden age of the Roman empire.
The era of the good emperors.
People like Trajan and Hadrian and Antoninus Pius.
And also this man.
Marcus Aurelius.
Rome's 16th emperor, who ruled from 161-180 AD.
And this colossal gilt bronze portrait of him mounted on horseback is one of the great glories of Roman art.
It doesn't take much, though, to be awe-struck by the thunderous authority of this monster-sized masterpiece, because Marcus Aurelius is SO enormous.
He's a super-human.
He's far bigger in relation to his steed than any ordinary man.
And he feels like a commander of a race of giants, descended onto Earth, who can easily command our pygmy-like human realm.
I feel quite cowed looking up at him.
And immediately, this is an expression.
This is the creation of a supremely self-confident society.
You can feel that.
The thing about Roman art of the high empire is it's the sort of stuff that can only be produced by a totalitarian regime.
Colossal works pushed through by the will of one man.
And one innovation epitomises this.
The Triumphal Arch is one of Rome's greatest legacies to art.
Arches, they're such a prominent feature of modern cities.
Think of Marble Arch in London, Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
But they wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the ancient Romans, who decorated their monuments with historical reliefs, turning them into these enormous marble billboards, if you like, of imperial propaganda.
And this one is one of the greatest of all.
It's the Arch of Titus at the entrance of the Roman Forum.
It celebrates the crushing of the Jewish revolt by the emperor Vespasian and his son Titus in AD 70.
On the inside of the arch there are two stunning reliefs featuring Roman soldiers carrying the spoils of war from the temple in Jerusalem.
Including the sacred menorah or candelabrum.
The carvings are worn, but still dynamic.
This one, typically triumphalist, shows Titus accompanied by the goddesses Victoria and Roma.
Monumental arches sprung up all over the empire and became the artistic symbol of imperial Rome.
It may not look like much, but on the other side of this door, there's going to be an extraordinary Roman masterpiece and we're going to get a very special view.
So...
Buongiorno.
Alastair.
Grazie!
Well rehearsed!
OK, so we're going into a church.
What we're about to see is one man's bid for immortality.
Getting a bit out of breath!
Yeah, maybe this one.
HE TURNS KEY
Eccoci qui.
Ci troviamo sul terrazzo della cupola.
Prego...
I think that means "the terrace of the dome."
Somewhere around...well, up there.
So which way?
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Thank YOU!
This is going to be...
This really is going to be a good view, I think.
Oh, my God!
Look!
Check this out!
This really is genuinely an exciting moment!
Trajan's column was dedicated in AD 113, and it commemorates two successful campaigns that the emperor Trajan waged against the Dacians, a barbarian tribe from modern day Romania.
This is a magnificent view!
On the column itself there are 2,639 figures.
Trajan himself appears 59 times.
The other thing to remember about this column is that nothing like it had ever appeared before in the history of art.
So this is bona fide Roman, right to the bone.
I mean, this piece, Trajan's column,
That's how you do monumental sculpture.
Trajan's column was made by a team of sculptors from 29 different blocks of marble, each weighing up to 77 tonnes.
Whoever designed it was a real genius in the art of storytelling.
There are 155 scenes, that spiral up for 200 metres.
It's only when you see the scenes in close-up, that you really appreciate the full effect.
And the place to do that is the Museum of Roman Civilisation, which has a cast of the whole shebang.
So, Vito, this gallery really gives us a sense of just how monumental the column was, because you can see it stretches down, I guess, for 100 metres that way, and 100 metres back, and there's the frieze on either side.
It's amazing, yeah.
So this is the base of the column, and they've done it in sections that it takes us up, but it's quite a good opportunity to talk about the way that the narrative has been structured.
Well, it's a big narration.
It's an epic narration, 200 metres long.
And it's sort of a long movie about history with a capital H.
And it seems that, at the beginning, the Trajan column was in colour.
So it was in colour and 3D, we could say today.
As a matter of fact, we can notice that it there are some holes in many hands, like this, for example.
Here, the soldier was supposed to hold weapons, stuff like that, so it's contributed to give that three-dimensional effect.
In here, we can see by the way this is beautiful in terms of art.
Pure art.
Look at the composition of this, round circles.
What's happening here?
Here the Romans are defending themselves.
They're throwing stones against the Dacians, and the whole story is seen from the point of view of Decebalus.
He's the chief of the Dacians?
He's the chief of the Dacians.
"They're crazy," this Roman says.
Very angry here.
And he looks to the long shot, where many dramatic things are happening.
That feels like a cartoon!
He's going, "Oh, you pesky Romans!"
Yeah, exactly!
Sometimes it is a little ironical.
Sometimes, it's like a horror movie.
And later, you will see that Decebalus fights, and finally, he kills himself.
You know, not to be a prisoner.
You know, he kills himself.
You're giving away the ending of the film!
Oh, sorry!
But it's not a detective story!
The Roman soldiers try to catch him but he doesn't want to be caught, and he kills himself with a knife.
So this is the big climax.
The money shot.
Yeah, but after the big climax, the real ending of the movie, quote-unquote, will be the Dacian people slowly abandoning their land.
And then it fades to black.
The end.
After that, you see the sky and the moon.
Of course.
That's the technical, cinematical term.
It's a dissolve we're seeing there.
Yeah, exactly!
So far, we've seen two sides of Roman imperial art.
One, private and perverted.
The other, public and propagandist.
One emperor had a vision of how to bring these two together and create a coherent imperial vision, that would inspire loyalty as well as awe.
When Hadrian became emperor in AD 117, he inherited one of the mightiest empires that the world had ever seen, stretching all the way from the Scottish lowlands to the Sahara Desert, from the Atlantic Ocean to the river Euphrates.
By the time that he died, 21 years later, and you can see his majestic mausoleum behind me, he'd presided over an artistic renaissance that would shape our image of the Roman world forever.
Hadrian has a reputation as peace-loving emperor who set the Empire's borders in stone, with Hadrian's Wall in the North of Britain, and the limes in North Africa.
In portraits he wears a beard, supposedly to portray himself as a Greek-loving intellectual.
But he was more complex than that.
In other works, he's shown hunting, or as a military strong man, crushing the enemy underfoot.
During his rule, he undertook two grand tours and visited almost all his provinces in an attempt to promote stability.
It enabled him to create an inclusive and pan-imperial artistic style, influenced by the most distant corners of his empire.
And of all the monuments from this Hadrianic golden age, none bears his imprint more than this vast temple to all the gods.
The most miraculous achievement of Hadrian's architectural renaissance was the famous Pantheon in Rome.
At first sight, you see this temple facade, and it seems relatively conventional, if monumental.
There are one or two quite spectacular details, though, not least these enormous eight grey granite shaft columns here, supporting the facade.
And all of them are monolithic, which means they weren't constructed out of several different drums put on top of one another.
They are one piece of rock.
And they didn't even come from Italy.
They were hewn out of a quarry in the eastern desert of Egypt.
So here you have the emperor almost supernaturally snapping his fingers, and he can command the natural world and things are brought to Rome, suggesting Rome's mastery.
But that sense of majesty that's in the porch is just a mere appetizer, compared to what happens through the bronze doors in the main centre of the space.
I have visited the Pantheon once before, but I imagine that it doesn't matter how many times you come.
Nothing can lessen the extraordinary impact of entering this space which has this almost stupefying splendour.
You can see that every element bespeaks the majesty, the imperial might of ancient Rome.
The surfaces are covered with all sorts of coloured marbles, other stones, including porphyry, serpentine, that come from many different places in the empire.
Egypt, Tunisia...
But the real tour de force, the centrepiece of the rotunda, is up above.
This enormous, coffered, cast concrete dome.
Look, there's no doubt, of course, that this is an engineering marvel.
This is a feat of Roman architecture and building.
But it's more than that.
If feels like a big, bejewelled bauble.
This is a kind of electrifying arena where imperial spectacle would have been played out.
And it has this spiritual power.
A sense of a kind of proximity to some sort of divinity, up through there, through the infinity of the oculus, that makes it, for me, a work of art.
This is one enormous work of art.
It truly is one of the most spectacular treasures of ancient Rome.
Previous emperors had kept their passions private, but Hadrian realised that he could exploit his to win over his people.
In doing so he created one of the most intimate icons of art history.
This melancholic youth is someone very, very special indeed.
He's the last pagan god of antiquity who once gave Jesus Christ a run for his money.
And more portraits of this fellow have survived than of any other figure from the Roman world, bar Hadrian and Augustus, both emperors.
Around 100 marble images and counting, in fact.
In the Roman era, he enjoyed almost unparalleled posthumous celebrity, and his cult offered very vigorous competition to Christianity in the early years of the religion.
And yet today, most people haven't heard of him.
His name is Antinous, and his story, involving a grand affair of the heart on the part of an emperor, and also an unsolved mystery surrounding his death in the Nile, is totally spellbinding.
The love story between Hadrian and Antinous has all the makings of a Shakespearian tragedy.
The emperor doted on the beautiful young man from Bithynia, modern Turkey, and was left broken-hearted when he mysteriously drowned in the Nile.
He was only 19.
Hadrian built a new city close to where Antinous died and named it Antinopolis.
A cult worshipping the beautiful but tragic young man flourished there and spread around the empire.
I've come to the Louvre to meet Ernest Gill, a priest in the modern day cult of Antinous.
This is one of them.
Oh, this is one of my favourites.
Antinous Aristeos.
Aristeos is a totally forgotten god now, but he introduced farming to mortal human beings, and every farmer in ancient Rome knew exactly who this was.
He's holding a cluster of olives here and he's holding a rake or something, and has a farm hat on.
Before we go any further,
I just wanted to see whether I should be calling you Ernest, or Hernestus, because I've been told that that is your official title.
Yes, well, Hernestus is my priestly name.
You can call me Ernest.
That's fine.
Thank you.
You are a priest of the cult of Antinous.
Yes.
With a straight face, seriously?
Absolutely, absolutely.
He's always been, not so much worshipped, but admired, by homosexuals throughout history.
He's a gay icon.
He's a gay icon.
All the gay aristocrats in the 18th century wanted statues of Antinous.
And a cardinal in Rome, Cardinal Albani, had a huge villa full of Antinous statues and other things.
And he had a German friend of his who was an art collector,
Johann Joachim Winckelmann, who went out and would scour everything looking for Antinous statues, basically.
Winckelmann is known as the father of art history, so you're suggesting that we have Antinous to thank for the entire discipline of the history of art?
And it was rumoured that they were secretly priests of Antinous.
But throughout history it was sort of a coded way of saying,
HE WHISPERS "I'm one of these people,"
you know, without actually saying it.
"Oh, you have a lovely statue of Antinous." "Yes, indeed!"
And that sort of thing.
This really does remind me quite strongly of the pure Antinous, which is over here.
Let's have a look.
It's a bust of just Antinous, not as a farmer, not as Dionysus or Osiris.
This is him, and the most interesting part is the hair.
You can always tell exactly what this is based upon.
Doctoral theses have been written about the curl.
This curl goes this way, this curl goes that way,
That's how experts know,
"Ah, yes, that's a statue of Antinous."
And, I mean, do you feel when you look at this, he must have been a very beautiful youth?
To me, he always looks a little bit sulky.
He looks sulky, and that's another one of the great mysteries.
Why is he looking downward, and why is he looking somewhat melancholy?
Of course, homosexuals throughout the ages have said,
"Oh, yes, we understand.
He was misunderstood."
Well, here he is as the Egyptian god, Osiris.
Now, I know that he drowned in the Nile.
That's an Egyptian association.
But do you think there were any political implications for Hadrian to show Antinous dressing up as an Egyptian god?
Oh, absolutely, because Hadrian, as emperor, was also Pharaoh of Egypt.
There had been a terrible, terrible drought, and the Egyptians had been begging for a miracle.
And after Antinous died, the Nile rose up in a bountiful flood.
That was called his first miracle, and Hadrian was saying,
"Yes, of course.
Antinous has risen from the dead,
"just as Osiris rose."
So it was a canny way for Hadrian to ensure loyalty from his Egyptian subjects?
Yeah.
And I imagine that for you, this must be like confronting the holy of holies!
The Mondragone head that got Winckelmann so excited.
Absolutely!
It got all of Europe excited.
It is, of course, Antinous in the form of Dionysus or Bacchus.
It's so big!
I mean, it's just magnificent.
Is this your favourite one?
Mustn't tell the others, but it's one of my favourites, yes.
They're all magnificent.
Do you feel like you're tending a flame in a time of heathens?
Although, of course, he's a pagan god.
But you know what I mean?
No-one really knows about poor Antinous.
Yeah.
But more and more people are knowing about him, and I think that was Hadrian's goal, to create the perfect society based on Hellenistic principles of peace, learning, understanding.
And I think he's a very good god for the 21st century.
Hadrian had a flair for melding the private with the public,
And this vision culminated in a villa unlike any other.
It was at once a personal playground, and the political nerve centre of the Western world.
To call this place Hadrian's villa, in a sense, is just a total misnomer.
It's a red herring.
Because what was actually constructed, this sprawling complex here in the foothills of the Tiburtine mountains about 30-odd kilometres east of Rome, was just colossal.
The site has barely been excavated yet, but already, just from the known structures, there are 900 rooms and corridors.
The grounds would have extended for about 120 hectares.
There would have been hundreds, possibly even thousands of staff, who would have scurried around the site using these underground hidden passageways and corridors so that the visiting dignitaries from abroad and Rome's elite who came here for informal gatherings,
would never have had to encounter them.
And just over this drawbridge is one of the earliest structures on the site, which is known as the maritime theatre.
And this may have been Hadrian's private quarters.
And so you can imagine him following those extensive travels all around the empire, returning here to relax and recuperate.
But in Hadrian's day, this would have been sumptuously, lavishly decorated.
Every surface would have been covered with the finest quality mosaics and paintings and marble.
You can actually see where the marble was clad to the walls.
The holes would have taken the iron supports for the marble cladding.
The eye would have been dazzled and ravished by what was inside here.
There would have been phenomenal sculptures and the very best art that could possibly be acquired.
And it was surrounded by this canal, which doubled as a swimming pool, and was linked to a private bathing suite for Hadrian.
So it's very easy to be impressed by the grandeur of the Pantheon.
Of course.
But it's very formal, in a sense.
What you have here is something much more private, much more informal.
It's the material representation of Hadrian's character.
I like to think of this specific place as the epicentre of the Roman empire.
This was the fortress of Hadrian's mind.
The resting place, if you like, of his artistic soul.
Hadrian's villa was full of art inspired by masterpieces from around the empire.
This marble fawn is exquisite.
The doves of Sosos is one of the most celebrated mosaics from antiquity.
And these two centaurs, carved from a smoky grey marble, represent the highs and lows of love.
The perky young centaur contrasts with his sorrowful companion, perhaps reflecting Hadrian's grief for Antinous.
Hadrian recreated many of the artistic highlights from his grand tours.
As befits his nickname, Graeculus, or, "Greekling,"
he commissioned perfect copies of Greek statues.
Here, Rome meets Egypt.
The Tiber, this bearded river god, leans on Rome's iconic she-wolf.
And this is the Nile, resting on a sphinx.
All very symbolic of the wider empire.
The Egyptian theme is completed with this scary crocodile.
Carved from Cipollino marble, it brilliantly brings to life the croc's rough and scaly hide.
Many of Hadrian's finest sculptures adorn this magical pool.
A homage to the canal that cut through Northern Egypt from Alexandria to Canopus.
Since the death of Antinous, it was a corner of an empire that held a very special place in Hadrian's heart.
We know that Hadrian liked magnificence, but I feel that here, he surpassed himself by creating this spectacular setting, essentially for dinner parties.
We know he loved dinner parties, it says that in the ancient literature.
And imagine this long canal, a colonnaded extravaganza where guests would have been reclining in between the pillars, eating.
Apparently there was sometimes food actually in the middle of the canal that could have come over, controlled by slaves on little ships.
You pluck the food off.
And I like it, particularly at this point, because the pillars which elsewhere are just ordinary columns are replaced by these caryatids, which are an allusion to very famous statues that supported a building on the Athenian acropolis.
And on either side of these four caryatids, two drunken Silenae, this old soak character from ancient myth, with a pot belly and a beard, and he's a bit pissed, basically.
And I quite like the idea that that would help get you in the party spirit.
Here's the pillar.
Sprouting out of his head would be a load of grapes cascading down, like the top of a Corinthian capital.
And if you were a guest, you just had to look up there and there's your example for how to behave at a Roman dinner party.
The convivium that Hadrian loved.
Hadrian himself would have sat right at the end there.
In that semi-dome, which would have been covered with sparkling mosaics.
There was a podium in there with spaces for seven people.
And Hadrian would have come out, sat right in the centre, looked straight down this canal which goes for about 120-odd metres, and I think if you were a guest at one of those parties thrown by Hadrian here in the Canopus,
you must have felt like the most urbane, chic, glamorous person it would be possible to be.
As if you were at the very centre, not just of the world, but the whole universe.
Under Hadrian, the Roman empire stretched across three continents and Roman art was also at its zenith, because the great classical tradition which the Romans had inherited, and re-invigorated, by tailoring it to their own society,
was at its most stunning and urbane.
Roman culture was the envy of the known world.
And there are some traditionalists who suggest that the quality of Roman art from this period would never be surpassed.
There's definitely something in that argument, but it's not entirely true.
The aesthetic achievements under Hadrian are brilliant, but they're not the final chapter in the story of Roman art.
In the next episode, the empire strikes back.
How far-flung provinces transformed the look of Rome, and an obscure cult emerged, to seize the mantle of art history.

You have to dispose of how to do this anymore?
What do you say?
I do not want to get in trouble anywhere.
I would not get in trouble if I send secretly your letter?
Care for you, as if we were family.
Thanks, babe.
- When you come back?
- Monday.
Sure did your doctor that you can come here?
I had to see you, my baby.
I know you're okay.
What do they say?
They want to do more tests and go to the hospital.
Everything will be fine.
What are you doing here Saturday in?
I could not bear us away?
I wanted to see how I go the new one.
Came again the father of Emmy.
I will try to convince her to see him.
Hello, sir.
Glad to see you.
How are you today, Mrs. IZELA?
- In the race, Ntitzei.
- Your daughter is doing great.
Do not tell her I said that though.
I count the days to come my baby would cook.
I hope you invite me at that dinner.
Crazy it.
Playing child Petra with her father EMI.
The poor.
I can not believe even talking to her father.
- You saw Emi Scott?
- No.

She said her something happened.
Patience, right?
Miss Scott, your father came.

Well, listen to me.

Why not today?
- Solitaire play.
- Okay.
I'll say.
I know it is not easy to 're here.
But in two years did too many things.
Savvy in the group, go and school.
Remember what you told me when I came here?
"Do not think about how you fillings over the years ....
Just think .. how to fill Once you live "
Step-by-step.
- Hey.
- Sorry, I will not come.
Visitinghoursareover.
Okay, then.
Visiting hours are over.
What are you doing today, Miss Makavo?
"Well I am, Ntitzei.
What are you doing? "
It put me in isolation if you say this?
If you do not become a little more polite, your life closes the door.
I said maybe you liked it.
Is a film about the cave of Plato.
You do not ask.
"Ah, thanks, Ntitzei!
I promise I will not lose! "
If I lose the will to hang in isolation;
If you do, you disappoint me.
I borrow it because I have confidence.
This is more valuable from any movie.
Been here from their childhood, shackled ..
neck and legs, without being unable to move.
Could only to look ahead of them.
Imagine now be released from the shackles of someone incarcerated.
Will be forced to become familiar with the natural environment.
At the beginning you see more well the shadows.
Then you will see the reflection things on the water And then sees the same things.
Those on the sky it looks with the light of the moon.
Latter will be able to confront the sun in its own place.
Are the letters.
Thank you.
So it becomes.
We take care of the other one.
Hello.
Want your film?
When finished.
I talked to a professor you today.
I did not do anything bad.
"I did something bad," we say.
Anyway ..
He said he was impressed with your performance.
Well go, not only I read aloud.
The harder you work, the harder surrender.
- Socrates again said that?
- No.
A coach of rugby, Vince Lomparti.
- Kisa and Kerry, come find me later.
- Okay.
Thank you, girls.
- Can I ask you something?
- Why not?
Why can leave even and when there is no fire?
We only go out fires.
Make tree planting, clean streets walking.
Going to help when are natural disasters.
They become entitled.
If no mess when you close your 18 you can try to get into the group.
I do not know.
You have 90 days to think and I hope they do.
Put bet on yourself.
Come in, girls.
I just learned that in two weeks will become the parole hearing.
Finally.
In two weeks.
- Both?
- Yes, the same day.
Do not get ahead of ourselves.
Is not confirmed that they released.
- It is only the hearing.
- Understand it.
I come in half a minute.
I just wanted to thank you for what he has done, Ntitzei.
My mother needs me much now.
I know you're not the cuddling.
No need to thank me.
You did all the work yourself.
I'm going to get my mother to tell her the good news.
- Great new baby.
When?
- In two weeks.
I expect and how.
In only two weeks.
You're my baby.

- Why the hiding then?
Why paint my father?
You do not want?
Here you are.
're Happy now?
Here you are.
You're happy now?
Not the ripping.
In any photos I've seen my mother looks so real.
To buy it.
Her mother Terry gives her money, you nobody gives you.
Finish now.
Gather your things.
How many do you want?
-I want a butterfly.
- Butterfly?
You go out every day, not gonna be hard.
KISA is not well Cry to Terry.

Continue and help KISA.
I came Kisa.
You did.
Do not give me that again.
Good for you.
Thank you, Chief.
You did a good job.
- That was close, right?
- Yes.
Nobody jumped into the fire me.
Sisters are.
They say that when you go out, forget all girlfriends did inside.
I do not ever want to forget the Group 9.
Stop, do not be whiny, passing firefighters.
This is mine.
- How are the girls?
- A little troubled, but did not say it.
Ntitzei, Terri made divine "pass."
The Terry "put goals."
But I prayed in divine power, before me out.
- Is my hero.
- I totally agree.
Glad you came out unharmed.
Chief Kelly told me what happened.
- You did a heroic act.
- I had to stay alive Kisa.
After next week should to come to the hearing.
Come catch the butterfly needed Terri.

- As children do.
Maybe you'll get a new girl.
Such want to hear.

We tell her that sleeps.
We explained how the wants.
Finish.
It is not the same as I saw.
Like a cockroach with wings.
- All are different.
- There are crazy bugs in the countryside.
I've never been my countryside.
Think you come to Group 9.
Every day we are out.
- I do not think so.
- Why?
Can be trained in firefighting and help people.
- Not for me these.
- How do you know this?
How do you know after you have not tried.
You in the Ntitzei has omadarchissa.
He wants to help you.
Every weekend comes your mother to see you.
And what happened?
They tell you that you are not made to be a closed here.
Me but my whole life my say that I must be inside.
Do haggling with insects to buy paintings?
- Do not you speak to Carolyn.
- I do.
He is with me and not accept Payment by insects.
Then, get back the throttle you, Terry.
No, let's go.
You will find tough to others when they leave here.
Will be depressed and will do wrong choices.
To end up here again media is your choice.
We will not place unless allow you to be.
So just think?
If you think this, you have no idea about what we spend a few out there.
Let's talk then.
Forget it.
You can not just throw something and then give up the conversation.
You do not help and does not help the rest.
- Want to know how it really is?
- Tell me.
I know a girl here, then, drawn out stealing food to not die.
Her parents were both drunk from drugs, they forgot to feed.
A whole week.
Rubbish situation.
Would pass very difficult.
So we keep each other.
We have our own family and respected.
But we are not all the gang.
And what do you know them?
- Just my opinion really.
- Talking about something you do not know?
She may not know, but I know, Petra.
For some, can not you, why all know what pride do you say ..
For some, however, being in gang is a matter of protection.
Especially in neighborhoods where we live and someone is killed every day.
- Sit down.
- In my cell I go.
Come on.
We're not finished.
I finished.
What happened to your father EMI.
We talked as we say?
I'll help if we arrange I a meeting?
- To think about it?
- Certainly.
- How's your mother, Terry?
- The hospital is again.
Can not wait to get out of here, not like some of you!
Some?
- Probably meant ...
- Me, right?
To actually lives ..
Carolyn again?
Will finish high school while you're here.
Great success will be for you.
Everyone thinks that this the chick is smart.
But he was an accomplice a formula into robbery.
Reading a letter who wrote, too.
- "I do not care that I did it"
- Stop it.
We're here to help each other.
How we help you?
I said staring her homework, instead of writing letters to a type ..
... Who nailed.
I have not even finished the high school and I know that.
I read a lot.
All you read is the letters of the chick.
Like you're an irrelevant halfwit accomplice.
I read this in Plato's cave.
Look So your job.
Read Plato's Republic?
Yes, with the cave.
Oh yeah!
The thick book Terri carries with her wherever she goes.
What part did you like?
To hear the Terry.
No need to answer that.
I loved when the prisoner returned to his cave.
Told everyone the world over.
They thought it was crazy and laughed at him.
What stupid are they?
They said "Not thinking about look upward ...
Crazy ... why would and we from glow. "
You'd think that was actually not truly finished.
Next week at the same time.
Let the bad mood in your cells.
They can withstand many more than you think.
- And that, Socrates?
- My mother.
When hurt too.
Relax.
Read testimonials you and what you ask ... to answer with absolute sincerity.
Get here because you deserve.
Must do so responsibly.
We are ready.
Yes;
Not?
Yes.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
- Sit down, Miss IZELA.
- Good evening.
Well, all papers you are ready.
Have something to say?
I see.
Excuse me.
On the evening of March 3, before three years, it was the worst of my life.
Since then, that night became my daily nightmare.
Never mind.
Never mind.
I wish I could say that I knew the right thing.
But I knew the right thing.
Ought I had left without leaving.
The woman who was hit by a car and abandoned ..
....
Last night, on the street Magnolia .
Died.
This morning surveys continue and have a witness ..
.. Saw the car leaving the crime scene.
- Are you all right, Terry?
- Comes in a while, Mom.
Come on, it will be late for the school.
Go to work.
This is my car.
Go, miss.
A mistake there.
Did something baby.
I want to know that every day trying to make amends.
For the rest of my life, I will continue to rectify.
Has accomplished many things during distribution you here.
Completing certain courses university.
You did not use alcohol or drugs.
I see you recently become omadarchissa Team 9.
I see.
I can see no reason, however, to in earlier releases.
To ask others.
You, what do you think?
- I recommend that you released.
- Thank you.
I have been impressed with what did here.
Outside, however, forsaken the crime scene.
Yes, I made a terrible mistake.
Hit the victim, stopped and then left, leaving to die.
I was young and scared and silly.
We know how they react teens when fear.
I have 3 children.
This overcomes the limits being nobody scared and stupid.
You be interested in more what will happen to you if you got caught ..
.. To drive without a license.
Not interested in the woman bled to death because of you.
You're scaring me.
There is no university or firefighting training ..
.. Which is sufficient to calm down.
I refuse to be released.
Ntitzei, I do not like the psychological report.
Is unclear.
Mr. Lewis, you know that no hearing, the psychology of ..
Not a criterion ...
for questioning.
But now disputed.
I will report to specifically states that if you are in a similar case ..
.. The director is fully sure Miss IZELA not be done in the same way.
Deny her release.
If you correct a report, may be reviewed in 90 days.
Wait.
Can I say something, please.
Her mother is in the hospital and is too sick.
As a personal favor, I ask think again.
The decision has been taken.
It may come back in 90 days.
Enjoy your noon.
I need a favor.
I want to sell them at school.
I do not do it.
Your boy needs the money, do not want to disappoint him.
He was disappointed.
Never mind, birds and you kept the money.
Do not do it.
You can go to the toilet, will be easy.
You may not want to go out from here, but I want to.
You think so?
I have a poor family out of here.
Rely on me.
So, I must make what should I do.
Me too.
If I turn your back, Move in protective custody.
I did you any favors and you owe me.
Would apply to me or would bleed for me.
My hands feel the as if it will peel off.
Stop whining.
I wish xekollage to your mouth.
Why do plate and must to wash the bus?
All day we are struggling, Terry.
Not our fault you never left.
Emmy, go get some rest.
I'll do it myself.
All love to released.
I do not work but just you here.
Go wash, girls.
- Yes, but.
- Miss IZELA has it under control.

This is my job.
A good omadarchissa knows Watching her team.
My mother is the only wants my attention.
I just want to do a good job, to write a good report, go near her.
- Not interested in the report.
- The administration but interested.
I am interested Terri as a man.
Terri, however, not a good man.
You heard what I did.
Can I finish my job?
Where is Carolyn?
She put herself under monitoring protection.
Leave only trash.
You do your homework here and you go one hour in the yard.
For your protection, there will be none in the yard.
Your meals will get from here.
What a threat, Carolyn.?
- I'm fine.
- You're not.
Get off the tables.
Sit.
Whatever happens with Carolyn will stop now.
If you do not stop, as long as got here, I'll pass ...
Look at me.
Will spend the rest of the year you in solitary confinement.
Do you understand?
- Answer me.
- Yes, sir.
Wow, Ntitzei!
Afraid of now.
How are you?
I'm nervous.
Normal is this, but you're ready.
Remember what you learned in the group and continued to look at your goals.
Can I call her?
You better want.
Love, Emmy.
Each week we write.
- It
- I would not miss.
Kisa, came to pick you.
Group hug.
Group 9!
I just want to say that you should have you left now.
Kisa Daniels to you worth it.
Thanks for always watching out.
You will not get other girls in the group?
I look even files young girls.
Many who come taking medications.
Many have psychological problems or do violent acts.
Not quite balanced to enter the program.
Dwindle and we can go on like this program.
But the quality that counts, not quantity.
I'm serious.
What will you do now?
Thanks for your painting.
Will like butterflies in my mother.
I look forward to it the show.
Sorry I RELEASED.
All good.
- Really read the entire book?
- I saw the movie.
- Can I borrow on my own.
- My book is very difficult.
Do not reduce yourself.
I'm going to ask Ntitzei.
- Wait here awhile.
- Where else to go?
This is not the book of the cave.
Is a book about Socrates.
Writes his ideas, history and for his whole life.
The cave is only one of the stories have.
Hurry, girls.
How are you doing with the book?
I do not understand anything.
Then I read it again and again until you understand.
- I missed the point I was reading.
- Concentrate anymore.
If you catch offenders delivered him to be killed.
What does this mean?
That sometimes get angry with people who help us.
Did you understand that?
I got angry with you and Ntitzei.
Come on, critically, let him hear.
Let's bring someone drug if it is grated.
Otherwise, let the rub man I will give it.
You drink the hemlock now.
Yes, in a few pages ends the life of Socrates.
In three pages not we read anymore.
Sorry for the interruption.
Happy Birthday, Miss Makavo.
In made my wife.
Thank you.
Your birthday and you did not say?
And even closes 18.
This means that in 90 days can be tested for the group.
Who said I want?
You got something better to do?
Goes out surveillance.
If I participate, I will not need.
The team will look after you.
No returns.
What a shame.
We talk to you.
What are you doing?
What happened?
Your mother?
Gone?
Left.
He died alone.
Finish it, please.
Neither was the only one.
And the critics, when he could to restrain his tears, got up and followed.
At that time, Apollodorus crying nonstop ..
Burst out crying ... passionately.
This caused the heartbreaking to all of us.
Why not wear Terri the uniform of the team?
- You said something?
- No.
I hope you'll get better soon.
- I wanted to talk about the group.
- Okay.
I was thinking this too week.
I came to the decision to withdraw from the group.
Okay, but you want to tell me why?
I can not omadarchissa this time.
I understand.
You can come again when you're ready.
My mom ...
He knew what he was doing.
All he heard in court.
There he saw but with eyes who saw them.
Listen to me.
No matter what they saw.
Joined the team because they're the one who you are.
Helped Kisa because Being that you are.
Became part of the solution, not problem.
That's what I see.
Are you listening?
Waking up in the morning and do what you should do.
Every day.
But you go in your house your family.
I have nothing in my house anymore.
I can not find any more meaning.
What's the point then go to the team?
You promised that if I get back will help me.
- Go ahead, you can.
- I can not stand anymore.
Come on.
Translation by hearing * REMEDY *
Announce officially that became part of the Group 9.
It was amazing.
Congratulations, Miss Makavo.
- I heard that you went swimmingly.
- Something did.
I thought my parents would watch me out.
The only man who watches KISA is the Kisa.
You and Terry always forthcoming.
Should you decide for yourself, not others.
No price is too expensive For the privilege of being owner of yourself.
Looks like my dog.
You are too old now.
- I wish I knew if he lives.
- You can not know?
Stays with my father.
- It's good there?
- Why should not they?
I do not know.
Since there's speak imagined that ...
That something is wrong with my father?
No, I have the problem.
Did not hurt anyone.
Is what I thought too when printed fake checks.
I will not watch one large company and will not evlapta none.
If you're here though, you hurt someone.
When they came to arrest me, I saw the strongest man I knew ..
... to dissolve in front of me.
My father broke up.
And so its not xanamilas?
He raised me correctly, but I threw them all.
What he sees and barks?
What is it, boy?
Call for help.
We are on section of the Canyon.
The car is tottering.
We can not wait.

We just want to support the car ....
So ... come the rescue.

The nanny my singing.
Great voice the little girl.
I'm here with Dwayne Johnson advisor to the reformers.
We're very proud for Group 9.
Can you tell us more for girls who did the rescue?
They are amazing girls.
They work hard and try to entachtoun back into society.
I feel very proud.

For omadara says.
Miss Scott, come a little bit.

Saw you on the news and came up leading here, to see if you're okay.
Go see him.
We have visiting today.
I did however one exception.
Emmy, to tell you a little?
- To look at my work?
- I'm fine.
- Crying though.
- I do not cry.
You want to know why he stayed alive the child in the car?
His thought how the loved one.
If you have that you and it is true ..

Why I'm no longer his little girl.
I am a thief.

Sorry.
Never mind.
- I'll see you next week?
- Closes the appointment.
Hi, my little girl.
I'm very proud of you.
We were afraid the world because of our actions.
Scaring ourselves.
Sometimes, however, it needs only one person Who has a vision for the what we can be.
One woman died on the road because of me.
If the purpose of my imprisonment is my punishment ..
... Then, no fee will be several years in my life to repay ... .. what I did on that and her family.
Who do you think is the purpose then?
To know that all I do not look around me.
As much as I fear
as I'm heartbroken as misunderstood and alone I'm ...
Whatever I feel
At the end ... must take my responsibilities and do so correctly.
Today to deny me the release or six months, even time ..
I will not do anything anymore to impress you.
Simply this is me.
Tell her aunt to take care of you well.
We'll miss you.
It is unfair to leave before waking the girls.
You know that I'm not good with goodbyes.
You tell them?
Thanks for everything.
Goodbye, Miss IZELA.
With ball.
Terri at home spinning.
The Group Nine continues apace.
With men fighting the fire.
We do however with beauty.
Girls, there's fire.
Prepare to leave.

I'll pick up
Information, Sini Ketonen speaking
Do I Have to Take Care of Everything?
Oh no!
Hey, Jokke!
Get up!
No...
- Jokke, marriage!
- Good morning...
- And a kiss?
- A kiss?
Perhaps you'd rather get up and help?
Girls, put the dresses on.
Brush your teeth and comb your hair.
Take white socks on the 3rd shelf, behind the wool socks
Mom, we can't find the dresses!
Zip me up?
- You were trimming your beard?
- No, not trimming.
So where are they?
- And how about this?
- Dad, it's a nightie.
We can't find the dresses.
Do I have to take care of everything?
I just washed them, they're over there.
- Well, wear something.
- What, for example?
Whatever.
What you wear for holidays.
Jokke, where's the wedding present?
Better get a red tie.
Who took the present?
Are you going in a dirty shirt?
- Yeah, I mean no.
- Do I have to take care of everything?
- Taxi not answering...
- We'll take the tram...
What are you doing?
A new card, since we don't have a present.
Let's present this.
- This?
- Yes.
You've gone crazy...
We wore them for Lotta's birthday.
- Need help?
- I'll manage!
- Mom fell!
- Are you hurt?
Mom, your shoe's broken.
Nothing serious.
Faster, don't fall behind.
Go, go.
- Mom, who are they?
- No idea.
What's the date?
Blessed memory.
From Ketonen family.
We'll go to a marriage next week.
Mom, what are we going to do now?
Nothing.
We wanna kiss too.
Ms. Julian, sit!
You'll have your time.
I just can't believe you're even considering removing this man's ankle monitor!
That's our job.
Your job is to protect people from this psychopath.
Are you going to allow her to talk to him like that?
Both of you, shut up!
And, Ms. Julian, if you don't sit right now, I will toss you out of here.
You can finish,
Mr. Pelant.
Thank you.
I suppose I deserve whatever happens here today.
What I thought was a prank at the time turned out to be destructive to our government and a danger to the public.
I know now that computer hacking is a serious crime...
Actually sounds like he means it.
That's what I'm afraid of.
It says McCann Academy is willing to hire Mr. Pelant as a tutor and teaching assistant?
That's correct.
And they know about Mr. Pelant's criminal record?
They've seen everything.
They even read the transcripts of my trial.
I insisted on it.
I didn't want there to be any surprises.
I can assure you, I'm not the same person I was then.
He's right.
He's not a hacker anymore;
now he's a murderer.
Ms. Grover, this is outrageous.
What are you talking about, Ms. Julian?
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Mr. Pelant is a person of interest in two active murder investigations.
They have no proof.
This isn't a court of law.
We don't need proof.
That's why I like it.
But we have been compiling information.
The FBI has harassed my client all year.
I'm monitored 24 hours a day.
They know I never leave my house.
That ankle thing there says that you're home, but I don't believe it, pal.
Here's what we've compiled so far.
There are preliminary lab reports, as well as complex computer code written on remains.
If you want to free him after reading this, be my guest.
You can't keep him tethered to that ankle monitor just because they are on a fishing expedition.
Public safety is the parole board's number one consideration.
Mr. Pelant, we're going to deny your application until we analyze these files.
He has been a model prisoner.
It's okay.
I want them to feel secure.
Ain't that sweet?
What's that?
Someone changed my ringtone.
Whoa.
Mine, too.
A couple on an ATV found the remains.
What were they doing here?
Got lost.
Their GPS sent them east instead of west, and this is where they wound up.
I've never heard of a GPS reversing direction.
What is it?
Father Keyes.
We're all set for Christine's baptism on the 19th.
You're still okay if I do that?
Absolutely.
Sprinkling water on her forehead seems like an excellent way to counteract the sins she apparently committed prior to birth.
I take it you're still not going to the baptism?
Look, you know, we're at a murder scene here, not a religious debate, right?
Hey.
Welcome to the Hamilton National Wildlife Refuge.
Oh, it's not so refuge-y for this guy, is it?
Not much tissue left.
Eaten.
Victim is male.
No billows on the auricular surface, so age is late 30s.
Medial epicondyle appears to have been fractured.
Remodeling indicates that it happened about eight years ago.
Why does that matter?
It doesn't.
It's just...
it's a unique break.
Piophilidae eggs puts time of death at two days max.
Pio who?
All the internal organs are gone.
This was like Thanksgiving dinner for the animals out here.
Based on dentition and the species in the area, it was a... it was a pack of wolves.
Wolves?
Yes.
The break is 28 millimeters long, transecting the medial epicondyle and the trochlea.
Clothing remnant looks like polyester, and the waistband's elastic.
They're scrubs.
Scrubs, great.
So the victim was a doctor, right?
Yes, and a patient.
How do you know?
I set this break.
I know this man.
He's Ethan Sawyer.
Pelant...
Pelant killed my friend.

♪
The victim, Dr. Ethan Sawyer, was eaten by wolves?
Right.
The same Dr. Ethan Sawyer who was a delusional schizophrenic locked up in a high-security ward in a mental hospital?
Oh, come on, Sweets.
Obviously, he escaped.
Booth, has the victim been officially confirmed as Ethan Sawyer?
No, but Sawyer-- he goes missing from the loony bin, right?
And, so, you know, hey, Bones recognizes his broken elbow.
How'd she do that?
Well, because, you know, she's the one who set it.
They went to grad school together, they were friends, and, you know, he fell off a chairlift, and she's the one who set the bone.
What's the matter with you?
You're jumping to the conclusion that Pelant is involved.
I am not-- Look, he is involved.
Is this a hunch?
No.
He switched our ring tones to wolves.
The victim was eaten by wolves.
Ring tones won't hold up in court.
Tell you what, when you're ready to help, you come and find me, all right?
Until then, take a hike.
I am helping, Booth.
This is how I help.
To keep things in perspective, okay?
So how can I help?
Profile the killer, and match it to Pelant.
You're asking me to frame somebody, so, no, but what I can do is put together an objective profile.
If it matches Pelant, it matches.
It'll match;
Pelant did it.
These marks on the zygomatic are from teeth.
Two canines, their supporting third incisors, and this faint mark here is from a premolar.
Wolves?
Yes.
The pattern of tissue removal from multiple sites is consistent with simultaneous feeding.
How many animals?
Five or six.
They ingested approximately 70 pounds of soft tissue.
Dr. Brennan knew this guy?
Since grad school.
Guy was brilliant.
Specialized in artificial intelligence.
He modeled human behaviors mathematically.
No wonder he went crazy.
You can't really turn people into equations.
Oh.
What did I miss?
Yes, Cam?
There's hemorrhagic staining around approximately 50% of the bite marks.
Okay, what's that mean?
It means that Ethan was still alive when the wolves started to eat him.
You know what?
Wolves don't do that.
So it wasn't wolves?
More likely,
Ethan only appeared to be dead.
Paralyzed, you mean?
Nothing showed up on the initial tox screen.
We'll take another look.
Thanks, Cam.
You okay?
I have something
I have to tell you.
What do you mean?
Worse than being eaten alive?
I was conferring with Ethan on the Pelant case.
What do you-- in secret?
Yes.
Why?
Pelant is a mathematical genius, but Ethan was smarter.
You think that
Pelant killed Ethan because Ethan was helping you do math?
A normal person like you wouldn't understand how dangerous Ethan was to Pelant.
Yeah, I get it.
It takes a genius to know a genius.
But do you have any idea,
Bones, what a defense lawyer would do with the knowledge of you consulting with a paranoid schizophrenic?
It would be very bad for us.
Yeah.
Should we tell Caroline?
If we find Pelant had means and opportunity, then, you know, we'll tell Caroline about the motive.
Sometimes you got to work a little outside the system, Bones.
For a greater good.
I know, Booth.
That's why I didn't tell you about Ethan.
Right.
You have to let me go.
I have to take care of it.
Do you mean the baby?
It's a demon that looks like a baby, and it's hampering very important work.
I have to dispatch the demon!
Are you saying you have to kill it?
Yes!
Do you see any other way?
Poor Ethan.
Poor Ethan?
He was talking about our daughter.
Uh, please, we should talk out here.
Okay, Bones, let me get this straight.
Did he threaten her in front of you?
No.
Not directly.
I know he thought she was a threat, but...
And you don't think you should've told me that?
Ethan was confined to a secure facility.
I'm sorry, I didn't think it was necessary.
You said he escaped before.
Yes.
About a year ago.
But that's why he was moved to lockdown.
And this time, before he disappeared, let me guess, there was some sort of a computer glitch?
Yes.
Dr. Sawyer was accidentally transferred to an open ward.
- How did you know that?
- Open ward?
Meaning Ethan could have simply walked away?
That's correct.
Minimal supervision.
So you're absolutely positive he had no visitors?
None.
Absolutely.
Okay, when was the last time you visited him?
Two weeks ago.
He gave me an old mathematics book as a gift.
Visitors have to sign in, so it'll be in the records.
Great.
We're gonna need all the logs and security footage of the entrances and exits of this institution.
You got it.
Hey.
You find anything inconsistent with wolf attack?
No.
Yeah.
All the DNA I've found is lupine in nature.
Wolves killed him, but they didn't murder him.
Right.
So, Pelant fools his ankle monitor into thinking that he's at home, he lures our victim out of the loony bin, drugs him, and then leaves him for the wolves.
One thing I learned from Dr. Brennan:
gather evidence and follow it without bias.
That's right.
Yeah, yeah.
Pelant made a mistake, we're gonna find it.
He's not God.
Oh, crap.
Hey.
You need to stop what you're doing and come look at this.
Is something wrong, Angela?
So I scanned through the security footage from the loony bin, and...
That's the front door of the psychiatric facility where Ethan escaped from.
That's me.
I'm carrying the book that he gave me.
Yeah.
This-this is, this is time-stamped the night before Ethan Sawyer disappeared.
No, that's incorrect.
This footage was taken two weeks before that.
Which is when he gave me the book.
Sweetie, this-this is time-stamped.
Pelant must have hacked into the institute's security system.
I don't know how he could've altered this footage.
Look, I'm gonna break this thing down to the pixels to figure it out.
But, in the meantime, you're gonna need an alibi for this night.
I don't have one.
Yeah, you do.
You were at the Founding Fathers drinking a Bitter Canadian with me.
We were talking about Christine's christening.
You're trying to help me.
Yeah.
I mean, you wouldn't kill anybody.
I believe under certain circumstances
I most certainly would kill.
Like someone thinking your daughter is a demon, and threatening to kill her?
Oh, my God.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
I wasn't there, Booth.
Security footage says 7:14.
Right?
That's four hours unaccounted for before you got home.
That's plenty of time to abduct and murder Ethan, and then make it back before 11:00.
Don't say it like that.
Like what?
Like it's not you that we're talking about.
I didn't do it, Booth.
That doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter, Bones.
You're on that video.
I'll be fine, Booth...
Christine is asleep.
Angela will be able to tell that the video has been altered.
Hey, is everything okay?
Which is what she hasn't done so far.
And since Ethan threatened Christine, that gives you motive and opportunity, okay?
Can you ignore evidence like that?
'Cause I sure as hell can't.
This-this guy, Pelant, he's framing you.
It would seem so.
Yes.
He is.
All the evidence is now pointing to her as the killer.
Weren't you getting close to nailing this guy?
Yes, and Ethan was helping.
Yeah.
Ethan was helping.
Look what happened to him.
Honey, you need a plan.
We can handle this, Max.
Well, you haven't so far.
Everyone at the Jeffersonian is working on this, Dad.
We will find evidence that links all of this to Pelant.
Right, and if you don't?
Max.
Please.
Thank you so much for putting Christine to bed.
We really appreciate that, all right?
But we can handle this.
Sure, sure.
Listen...
I'm sorry, I...
If you need anything, baby...
Looks like some kind of puncture.
Dr. Brennan didn't see this when she went over the X-rays?
No.
I was surprised, too.
It's pretty obvious when you compare the films to the actual bone.
Maybe she thought it was another bite mark from the wolves.
No, look at the enlarged image.
I think it's the tip of a needle.
I'm sure she thought it was another bite mark.
Can you hand me the rotary saw?
Mosquito forceps.
It's definitely a hypodermic needle.
Could there be trace of the drug inside the tip?
Maybe.
Okay...
Give that to Dr. Hodgins.
I don't think you did it.
You know that, right?
I wouldn't blame you.
It's a reasonable assumption.
Can you stop being like that?
Okay?
It's not reasonable.
Not for me.
Do you want me to come to Christine's christening?
You don't have to worry about that now.
I don't want Pelant to change our lives.
That would be the worst.
Then, you know what?
Let's not change.
Look, you don't have to come.
Religion's my thing.
You're really okay with that?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I appreciate you asking.
You know, let's just not change our lives for this guy.
All right?
Look, I love you the way you are, Bones.

Dr. Brennan!
You're here early.
I'm...
I missed the needle puncture to the C7.
I don't want to miss anything else.
It's not like you.
Why do you think you missed it?
I don't know.
Perhaps because the victim was someone
I cared very much about.
Why do you think I missed it?
Not because you're the murderer.
I don't think that.
I really don't.
Everyone should be able to make mistakes, even you.
Should we?
There's a faint cut mark here.
About a centimeter long.
It's perfectly straight, no irregularities.
I missed that.
Perhaps you're the murderer.
There's another one to the humerus.
These were not caused by wolves.
Which means they were caused by the killer, right?
Why make cuts if you know that wolves will be eating him?
Would you like me to see if there are other similar cuts?
No.
I can do it.
Thank you.
There was a trace in the tip of the hypodermic:
D-tubocurarine.
It's a neuromuscular blocking agent better know are curare.
It was used in anesthesia in the '40s.
It leaves the system quickly, which is why it didn't show up on the tox screen.
Okay.
Well, where would somebody get their hands on that now?
They would have to distill it themselves.
From what?
Chondrodendron tomentosum.
Is it easy to get a hold of?
Not really.
I mean, I had two of them, but...
Two weeks ago, Dr. Brennan asked me if she could have one.
What?
She said she was studying some-some tribe in western Colombia that used it to poison the tips of their arrows.
Look, I-I know we don't want to go there, but...
Stop.
Brennan didn't do this.
Yeah, I've studied Dr. Brennan for years.
Her cold and logical demeanor is a carefully constructed facade designed to protect a very sensitive psyche.
Someone threatened her kid.
We can't just ignore that.
Why are you even bringing that up?
Dr. Brennan trained him that way.
Don't be subjective, don't make assumptions, question everything.
We do have to be objective, Angela.
And thorough, and we have to do everything by the book, because if Dr. Brennan does end up being a suspect, our work has to be above reproach.
It was Pelant.
That doesn't mean we stop doing our job, Angie.
Seriously?
This is crazy.
We all know it was Pelant!
Booth!
Booth.
Whoa, slow down.
Hey, hey.
You gotta do something.
Slow down.
What?
Why are you here?
The evidence is piling up against Brennan.
She's on the video, and-and he threatened her kid, and the poison is from a plant that she borrowed from Hodgins.
She didn't do it!
I know, but... the evidence is going another way.
I'm the one who decides where the evidence goes and when.
Look, what we need to figure out is how to counteract the evidence against the evidence.
Meaning what?
We gotta find a way to prove that Pelant put Brennan on that video.
All right.
I'll do that.
Booth.
He's got me, Booth.
Pelant!
Where?
At his place.
He didn't see my phone.
I'm locked in the...
Bones?
Bones?
What...?
Hey, hey.
What is it?
Don't worry about it.
Just get back and do your job!
Hey, you can't come in here.
Where the hell is she?
Aah!
Ow!
Who?
Who?
Brennan.
Brennan.
Where is she?
She called me.
Where is she?
I don't know!
Bones!
Where are you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I swear, I don't know!
Bones, where are you?
I swear, there's no one here.
Where is she?
She's not here.
Where is she?
I'm alone!
Are you always alone?
Always alone.
Ow!
I'm always alone!
You're always alone?
Listen really clear.
You understand me?
I swear to God, if you touched her,
I will kill you.
I broke the monitor.
The police are going to come.
Any minute...
She called, all right?
She called.
She said she was here.
Are you sure about that?
Maybe you should call her.
Just to check.
Bones.
Bones!
Are you there?
Where are you?
Are you at home?
Did you call me?
I'll see you at home.
Yeah, you son of a...
What in God's name did you hope to accomplish?
I told you, I got a call from Bones, saying that Pelant had her.
There's no record of you receiving such a call.
Of course there's not.
All right?
He got me.
So you're saying
Pelant made this happen.
Yes, Pelant made it all happen.
He's must've gotten Bones's voice from a bunch of cell phone calls, and just mashed them together.
It gets worse.
Okay.
What's worse than nothing?
Pelant's lawyer found out what you did, and went straight to the parole board, claiming harassment.
Flynn...
All right.
They let him go?
Yes.
And they got you removed from the case.
And got Dr. Brennan removed from the case.
Right.
So Pelant got exactly what he wanted.
There is no one left to take him down.
No offense, Flynn.
I don't want to take over your case, Seeley.
It wasn't my idea.
You want to work a desk with pay, or go home on full suspension?
I'll go home.
What?
Pelant is out in the world, okay?
What if he shows up at my house?
Then you shoot him through the eyeball.
Yeah, that reminds me-
- I gotta take your gun and badge.
Rules is rules, cher.
There's nothing I can do.
You run this down the way you see fit, Flynn.
Oh, one last thing-- a little advice.
With a guy like Pelant, nothing is the way it seems.
Great.
I'll remember that.
So this is the last thing that Brennan looked at before she was removed from the case.
All the victim's wounds?
Yes.
Can you remove the damage done by the wolves?
Sure.
That's weird.
There's a pattern.
Does it mean anything?
Well, if Pelant did this, then it could be one of his weird codes.
Like, introducing a virus into the program?
You think so?
It's what he does-- turn it off.
No, wait, no, I know this pattern.
This has nothing to do with computer viruses.
Superimpose the arterial system.
Remove the veins.
Can you enlarge the areas where the nicks were found?
Whoa.
All those marks cross minor arteries.
Pelant cut them.
The wolves were drawn by the scent of blood.
This proves murder, right?
I mean this guy just didn't wander into the woods and drink some poison and wait to be eaten by wolves.
They certainly weren't self-inflicted.
Dr. Saroyan!
What are you going to do?
I am going to report this to Special Agent Flynn.
Cam, they're gonna think that Brennan did this.
Because Pelant has no background or training in anatomy or the circulatory system.
I know.
Do you have to?
Yes, it is my job.
So, what?
So Pelant wins.
Yes.
Today, Pelant wins.
I thought Cam told you not to contact me.
I don't care much about what Cam says these days, okay?
Listen, I'm looking into the e-mail exchange between you and Ethan to see how Pelant accessed them.
How?
You said they were all encrypted.
Yeah, I don't know.
That's why I'm looking into every computer trail that leads back to Pelant.
Thanks, Angela.
Yeah.
I'm just being selfish.
If you go to jail, I don't have anybody to go to baby group with.
Now, I need all the passwords that you've used within the past year.
Your profile says the killer is hyper-rational, deliberate and exacting.
That's correct.
When I read Pelant's transcript...
Would you describe Dr. Brennan as hyper-rational, deliberate and exacting?
My profile fits Pelant.
Yeah, I understand that's what you'd like, but please answer the question.
You have to answer, cher.
That description could be applied to Dr. Brennan.
Thank you.
In certain situations.
You also posit that the killer had a compromised childhood because of abandonment.
Yes.
Pelant's parents divorced when he was young.
He was close with his father, which he rarely saw after--
Wasn't Dr. Brennan actually abandoned by her father?
It's not that simple.
He returned...
18 years later.
The other psychologist who reviewed your report said that would actually be worse.
Look...
I know Dr. Brennan.
She's a good person.
She's compassionate and empathetic, and a wonderful mother.
And how far would that wonderful, hyper-rational mother go to protect her child, Dr. Sweets?
No, I know her.
She didn't kill him.
The Bureau will be using an outside consultant for all future profiling on this case.
I'm sure you understand.
So I'm off the case.
Come on, you gotta be kidding me.
Can't Caroline appeal this?
I mean, come on...
Sweets, you of all people, know more about this case than anyone.
Okay, great.
So Sweets just got kicked off the case.
Agent Flynn accused him of being too close to you.
That seems like a reasonable decision from that perspective.
Can we stop being so reasonable, please?
Hey, hey...
I think I got something here.
Look at this.
What is it?
I hacked into his credit card bill, his phone bill and his library card.
Okay, you're hacking the hacker?
Yeah... there's something kind of poetic about it, right?
So, according to his library records,
Pelant reads a lot.
That makes sense.
He was confined, and the library delivers to shut-ins.
No, I mean he reads a lot a lot.
They delivered and picked up over 80 books within the past three months.
Wow!
No one reads that much.
I do.
Well, no one is you, Bones.
Okay, do me a favor.
Pull up his cable bill.
I want to see how many pay- per-view movies he's ordered.
Wow.
A lot.
Even you couldn't watch all these movies, and read all those books, sweetie.
We have to get the books that were delivered.
Pack that up.
Just get over there.
Sorry for the interruption.
I have a warrant to search Dr. Brennan's home and vehicle.
Hah!
Course you do.
Right.
Oh!
Uh, not so fast.
This is "914." We're 941.
This warrant's not for us.
It's a technicality.
Well, courts, they operate on technicalities.
Come on, Flynn.
You know that.
I mean...
You find something, which you won't, it won't be admissible.
I can be back in two hours with another warrant for the house but her Prius is parked on the street, and the license plate matches the one on the warrant.
Give me the keys.
Um...
We lost them.
We'll tow it.
Fine.
Knock yourself out.
And I mean that.
Thanks for stopping by...
Flynn.
Pack up all the stuff that we have on Pelant.
Angela, get to the library, okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Get to the library, check out all the books that he checked out.
There's got to be a reason why he picked out those books.
Hey, so, I found these...
What is wrong?
Are you okay?
Well...
the FBI sent over hair samples from
Dr. Brennan's trunk.
God...
I looked at it a hundred times.
I want a different result but it...
It's a match for the victim.
The hair belongs to Ethan Sawyer.
Cam...
Wha...
What are you gonna do?
Well, I'm gonna get myself together and I'm gonna do the right thing.
Which is...?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry but either you believe in the system, or you don't.
And I do.
I'm not supposed to be here.
This doesn't sound good.
It's not good, cher.
There's too much evidence piling up.
Oh, come on.
You know she didn't do it.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have put that wrong address on the search warrant.
I don't know what you're talking about, cher.
She doesn't have a choice, Booth.
It doesn't matter what she believes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure this will work out, but for now,
I've got to get an arrest warrant.
This is a nightmare.
It'll take me a few hours, if I drag my heels right, so you'll have time to get your affairs in order and say good-bye.
Thank you.
Now you're thanking her?
Baby's crying.
You don't think I wouldn't give anything to have this turn out differently?
I'll call when I get the warrant, so Dr. Brennan can turn herself in.
It'll go better that way.
Cher, I'm sorry.
Hey.
Anything?
Hey.
Uh...
Look, I know you're trying to be helpful and concerned but...
No, I'm not trying to be helpful and concerned.
I just want to know how Pelant communicates with Skynet before he comes after me.
It's got something to do with these books.
Well...
Angie, some of these aren't even in English.
I know.
I-I'm trying to search for some kind of pattern-- titles, publication dates, subjects, binding methods--
Nobody's gonna believe Brennan but us.
When we stop looking, it's over.
I know.
Hey, what if you arranged the titles in the order in which he checked them out.
Angie, then you can...
You-You did that already.
Of course.
I love you.
I love you.
Hey, you two.
Dad.
We're both home today.
You don't have to watch Christine.
I'm not here about Christine.
How much time does Tempe have?
Before they arrest her?
No, before her first gray hair.
Come on, we gotta figure out what our moves are.
Caroline says that I should turn myself in before the arrest warrant can be executed.
You gotta make a run for it, honey-- now.
Slow down, Max.
You been thinking about this for days!
What, me being a fugitive?
Look, I have been thinking about it, all right?
Only problem is, that's gonna make us look more guilty.
You want to work inside the system.
I am the system, Max.
No, computers are the system.
And this son of a bitch runs computers.
And the minute they have Tempe in custody, she is part of the system.
Your only chance is to get off the grid!
Honey...
Honey, think about it logically, okay?
The minute he has you, he will never let you go.
Look what he did to that crazy smart friend of yours.
We will be fine, Max.
No, you won't.
You two don't understand what happens when the system turns on you.
I do.
You okay?
We should have Christine christened before I'm arrested.
We?
You mean... both of us.
You're gonna come?
Yes.
What?
What's going on?
Ethan was tracking Pelant's thought process mathematically.
Ethan was trying to send me a mathematical message.
You see, he inscribed it with a quotation from Alexander Pope.
"Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night.
God said, 'Let Newton be,' and all was light."
So, what, that's the message?
Definitely.
Okay, what-- about math and light?
Can we get into Ethan's room at the Psychiatric Institute?
No, we can't.
No, but Hodges can.
What are we looking for?
Brennan said it would have to be a message written within a triangle.
Something about Newton.
The first thing we do is we find three things that form a triangle.
Well, three things always form a triangle.
You, me, the desk-- that's a triangle.
Brennan seems pretty certain that there is a message here.
Ethan Sawyer was hallucinating.
He could have left it in the air.
Yeah, well, the pencil would have to be imaginary, too.
Patients aren't allowed anything sharper than their fingers.
Wait.
Uh, hand me the ALS.
Come on.
Come on.
Found something.
Oh, that is so creepy.
He left a message in his own saliva.
Saliva.
Oh, good choice.
Smart.
Is it computer code?
I have no idea.
I've never seen symbols like it before.
Ethan must have invented it himself.
Well, yeah.
Well, then, what good is it?
And what good are all the library books?
I've learned that sometimes you have to step back and see the big picture.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm not seeing the big picture here.
In fact, I'm not seeing any picture, actually.
The answer is in that code.
Knowing Ethan, it's computer code.
Wait.
Where do books and computers cross?
Uh, I have to go.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Angela?
I just want to say... thank you for believing in me.
You don't have to thank somebody who loves you for believing in you, honey.
I love you, too.
All right.
Take a minute.
Forget about everything except Booth and Christine.
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah.

Hey.
Listen.
I think I know how he did it.
How who did what?
Pelant.
He-he used library books to insert mini-programs-- really viruses.
How?
The library has a centralized materials automated handling system.
Each book is independently coded, and Pelant just substituted his own code.
The library scans the book, and it uploads the code to the Internet?
Yeah.
You think this is enough to keep Brennan from being arrested?
A theory?
No.
And also,
I couldn't help if I wanted.
I'm off the case, too.
Unless you can prove
Pelant used his library books to transfer money from Dr. Brennan's account into mine.
Oh, my God.
I hope Cam is happy.
If she had just kept things to herself, we wouldn't be in this position.
Angela, you listen to me on this subject.
All of us did what Pelant expected, except for Cam.
Because of her, you squints are all still in this, which Pelant fears above all else.
As long as the Jeffersonian stays in the game, the good guys live to fight another day.
My opinion, Cam Saroyan is the hero of this story so far.
You hear what I'm saying, cher?
Yeah.
Okay.
Tell you what, I'll go get the car, all right?
Okay.
Booth?
Yeah.
What is it?
I love you, Booth.
I don't want you to think that Christine is the only reason we're together.
It's going to be okay.
All right?
All right.
I'll be right back.
I'll go get the car.
All right?
Be right back.
Hey.
Come on, let's go.
We gotta go.
Perfect.
Now, drive as far as you can without getting exhausted.
Don't stop at any chain restaurants or motels.
You already told me this.
Pay cash.
You took all my credit cards already.
Well, I'll get you some fake I.D.'s-- hey, I'm right about this.
Trust me.
Now, wait for me where we said.
If I... if I'm not there...
Three days later, the next place.
I remember.
Okay, get in, get in.
Let's go.
Go.
Go.
Thanks, Dad.
Bones?
Bones!
Hey!
Bones!
Hey!
Hey!
It's the way it had to go.
What the...?
Where are they going?
Well, if you know, you'd be an accomplice.
Accomplice?
That's my family, you understand?
I should be with them.
You want to hit me.
I know, I know.
I understand.
Go ahead.
I know how to be a fugitive a lot better than you.
What am I supposed to do?
You stay in the system.
You stay alive.
I'll make sure Tempe stays out of the system.
I'm going to get my family back.
You tell Bones that.
Then you get that bastard.
You'll bring your family home.
I'll keep her safe.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Ms. Julian, sit!
You'll have your time.
I just can't believe you're even considering removing this man's ankle monitor!
That's our job.
Your job is to protect people from this psychopath.
Are you going to allow her to talk to him like that?
Both of you, shut up!
And, Ms. Julian, if you don't sit right now, I will toss you out of here.
You can finish,
Mr. Pelant.
Thank you.
I suppose I deserve whatever happens here today.
What I thought was a prank at the time turned out to be destructive to our government and a danger to the public.
I know now that computer hacking is a serious crime...
Actually sounds like he means it.
That's what I'm afraid of.
It says McCann Academy is willing to hire Mr. Pelant as a tutor and teaching assistant?
That's correct.
And they know about Mr. Pelant's criminal record?
They've seen everything.
They even read the transcripts of my trial.
I insisted on it.
I didn't want there to be any surprises.
I can assure you, I'm not the same person I was then.
He's right.
He's not a hacker anymore;
now he's a murderer.
Ms. Grover, this is outrageous.
What are you talking about, Ms. Julian?
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Mr. Pelant is a person of interest in two active murder investigations.
They have no proof.
This isn't a court of law.
We don't need proof.
That's why I like it.
But we have been compiling information.
The FBI has harassed my client all year.
I'm monitored 24 hours a day.
They know I never leave my house.
That ankle thing there says that you're home, but I don't believe it, pal.
Here's what we've compiled so far.
There are preliminary lab reports, as well as complex computer code written on remains.
If you want to free him after reading this, be my guest.
You can't keep him tethered to that ankle monitor just because they are on a fishing expedition.
Public safety is the parole board's number one consideration.
Mr. Pelant, we're going to deny your application until we analyze these files.
He has been a model prisoner.
It's okay.
I want them to feel secure.
Ain't that sweet?
What's that?
Someone changed my ringtone.
Whoa.
Mine, too.
A couple on an ATV found the remains.
What were they doing here?
Got lost.
Their GPS sent them east instead of west, and this is where they wound up.
I've never heard of a GPS reversing direction.
What is it?
Father Keyes.
We're all set for Christine's baptism on the 19th.
You're still okay if I do that?
Absolutely.
Sprinkling water on her forehead seems like an excellent way to counteract the sins she apparently committed prior to birth.
I take it you're still not going to the baptism?
Look, you know, we're at a murder scene here, not a religious debate, right?
Hey.
Welcome to the Hamilton National Wildlife Refuge.
Oh, it's not so refuge-y for this guy, is it?
Not much tissue left.
Eaten.
Victim is male.
No billows on the auricular surface, so age is late 30s.
Medial epicondyle appears to have been fractured.
Remodeling indicates that it happened about eight years ago.
Why does that matter?
It doesn't.
It's just...
it's a unique break.
Piophilidae eggs puts time of death at two days max.
Pio who?
All the internal organs are gone.
This was like Thanksgiving dinner for the animals out here.
Based on dentition and the species in the area, it was a... it was a pack of wolves.
Wolves?
Yes.
The break is 28 millimeters long, transecting the medial epicondyle and the trochlea.
Clothing remnant looks like polyester, and the waistband's elastic.
They're scrubs.
Scrubs, great.
So the victim was a doctor, right?
Yes, and a patient.
How do you know?
I set this break.
I know this man.
He's Ethan Sawyer.
Pelant...
Pelant killed my friend.

♪
The victim, Dr. Ethan Sawyer, was eaten by wolves?
Right.
The same Dr. Ethan Sawyer who was a delusional schizophrenic locked up in a high-security ward in a mental hospital?
Oh, come on, Sweets.
Obviously, he escaped.
Booth, has the victim been officially confirmed as Ethan Sawyer?
No, but Sawyer-- he goes missing from the loony bin, right?
And, so, you know, hey, Bones recognizes his broken elbow.
How'd she do that?
Well, because, you know, she's the one who set it.
They went to grad school together, they were friends, and, you know, he fell off a chairlift, and she's the one who set the bone.
What's the matter with you?
You're jumping to the conclusion that Pelant is involved.
I am not-- Look, he is involved.
Is this a hunch?
No.
He switched our ring tones to wolves.
The victim was eaten by wolves.
Ring tones won't hold up in court.
Tell you what, when you're ready to help, you come and find me, all right?
Until then, take a hike.
I am helping, Booth.
This is how I help.
To keep things in perspective, okay?
So how can I help?
Profile the killer, and match it to Pelant.
You're asking me to frame somebody, so, no, but what I can do is put together an objective profile.
If it matches Pelant, it matches.
It'll match;
Pelant did it.
These marks on the zygomatic are from teeth.
Two canines, their supporting third incisors, and this faint mark here is from a premolar.
Wolves?
Yes.
The pattern of tissue removal from multiple sites is consistent with simultaneous feeding.
How many animals?
Five or six.
They ingested approximately 70 pounds of soft tissue.
Dr. Brennan knew this guy?
Since grad school.
Guy was brilliant.
Specialized in artificial intelligence.
He modeled human behaviors mathematically.
No wonder he went crazy.
You can't really turn people into equations.
Oh.
What did I miss?
Yes, Cam?
There's hemorrhagic staining around approximately 50% of the bite marks.
Okay, what's that mean?
It means that Ethan was still alive when the wolves started to eat him.
You know what?
Wolves don't do that.
So it wasn't wolves?
More likely,
Ethan only appeared to be dead.
Paralyzed, you mean?
Nothing showed up on the initial tox screen.
We'll take another look.
Thanks, Cam.
You okay?
I have something
I have to tell you.
What do you mean?
Worse than being eaten alive?
I was conferring with Ethan on the Pelant case.
What do you-- in secret?
Yes.
Why?
Pelant is a mathematical genius, but Ethan was smarter.
You think that
Pelant killed Ethan because Ethan was helping you do math?
A normal person like you wouldn't understand how dangerous Ethan was to Pelant.
Yeah, I get it.
It takes a genius to know a genius.
But do you have any idea,
Bones, what a defense lawyer would do with the knowledge of you consulting with a paranoid schizophrenic?
It would be very bad for us.
Yeah.
Should we tell Caroline?
If we find Pelant had means and opportunity, then, you know, we'll tell Caroline about the motive.
Sometimes you got to work a little outside the system, Bones.
For a greater good.
I know, Booth.
That's why I didn't tell you about Ethan.
Right.
You have to let me go.
I have to take care of it.
Do you mean the baby?
It's a demon that looks like a baby, and it's hampering very important work.
I have to dispatch the demon!
Are you saying you have to kill it?
Yes!
Do you see any other way?
Poor Ethan.
Poor Ethan?
He was talking about our daughter.
Uh, please, we should talk out here.
Okay, Bones, let me get this straight.
Did he threaten her in front of you?
No.
Not directly.
I know he thought she was a threat, but...
And you don't think you should've told me that?
Ethan was confined to a secure facility.
I'm sorry, I didn't think it was necessary.
You said he escaped before.
Yes.
About a year ago.
But that's why he was moved to lockdown.
And this time, before he disappeared, let me guess, there was some sort of a computer glitch?
Yes.
Dr. Sawyer was accidentally transferred to an open ward.
- How did you know that?
- Open ward?
Meaning Ethan could have simply walked away?
That's correct.
Minimal supervision.
So you're absolutely positive he had no visitors?
None.
Absolutely.
Okay, when was the last time you visited him?
Two weeks ago.
He gave me an old mathematics book as a gift.
Visitors have to sign in, so it'll be in the records.
Great.
We're gonna need all the logs and security footage of the entrances and exits of this institution.
You got it.
Hey.
You find anything inconsistent with wolf attack?
No.
Yeah.
All the DNA I've found is lupine in nature.
Wolves killed him, but they didn't murder him.
Right.
So, Pelant fools his ankle monitor into thinking that he's at home, he lures our victim out of the loony bin, drugs him, and then leaves him for the wolves.
One thing I learned from Dr. Brennan:
gather evidence and follow it without bias.
That's right.
Yeah, yeah.
Pelant made a mistake, we're gonna find it.
He's not God.
Oh, crap.
Hey.
You need to stop what you're doing and come look at this.
Is something wrong, Angela?
So I scanned through the security footage from the loony bin, and...
That's the front door of the psychiatric facility where Ethan escaped from.
That's me.
I'm carrying the book that he gave me.
Yeah.
This-this is, this is time-stamped the night before Ethan Sawyer disappeared.
No, that's incorrect.
This footage was taken two weeks before that.
Which is when he gave me the book.
Sweetie, this-this is time-stamped.
Pelant must have hacked into the institute's security system.
I don't know how he could've altered this footage.
Look, I'm gonna break this thing down to the pixels to figure it out.
But, in the meantime, you're gonna need an alibi for this night.
I don't have one.
Yeah, you do.
You were at the Founding Fathers drinking a Bitter Canadian with me.
We were talking about Christine's christening.
You're trying to help me.
Yeah.
I mean, you wouldn't kill anybody.
I believe under certain circumstances
I most certainly would kill.
Like someone thinking your daughter is a demon, and threatening to kill her?
Oh, my God.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
I wasn't there, Booth.
Security footage says 7:14.
Right?
That's four hours unaccounted for before you got home.
That's plenty of time to abduct and murder Ethan, and then make it back before 11:00.
Don't say it like that.
Like what?
Like it's not you that we're talking about.
I didn't do it, Booth.
That doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter, Bones.
You're on that video.
I'll be fine, Booth...
Christine is asleep.
Angela will be able to tell that the video has been altered.
Hey, is everything okay?
Which is what she hasn't done so far.
And since Ethan threatened Christine, that gives you motive and opportunity, okay?
Can you ignore evidence like that?
'Cause I sure as hell can't.
This-this guy, Pelant, he's framing you.
It would seem so.
Yes.
He is.
All the evidence is now pointing to her as the killer.
Weren't you getting close to nailing this guy?
Yes, and Ethan was helping.
Yeah.
Ethan was helping.
Look what happened to him.
Honey, you need a plan.
We can handle this, Max.
Well, you haven't so far.
Everyone at the Jeffersonian is working on this, Dad.
We will find evidence that links all of this to Pelant.
Right, and if you don't?
Max.
Please.
Thank you so much for putting Christine to bed.
We really appreciate that, all right?
But we can handle this.
Sure, sure.
Listen...
I'm sorry, I...
If you need anything, baby...
Looks like some kind of puncture.
Dr. Brennan didn't see this when she went over the X-rays?
No.
I was surprised, too.
It's pretty obvious when you compare the films to the actual bone.
Maybe she thought it was another bite mark from the wolves.
No, look at the enlarged image.
I think it's the tip of a needle.
I'm sure she thought it was another bite mark.
Can you hand me the rotary saw?
Mosquito forceps.
It's definitely a hypodermic needle.
Could there be trace of the drug inside the tip?
Maybe.
Okay...
Give that to Dr. Hodgins.
I don't think you did it.
You know that, right?
I wouldn't blame you.
It's a reasonable assumption.
Can you stop being like that?
Okay?
It's not reasonable.
Not for me.
Do you want me to come to Christine's christening?
You don't have to worry about that now.
I don't want Pelant to change our lives.
That would be the worst.
Then, you know what?
Let's not change.
Look, you don't have to come.
Religion's my thing.
You're really okay with that?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I appreciate you asking.
You know, let's just not change our lives for this guy.
All right?
Look, I love you the way you are, Bones.

Dr. Brennan!
You're here early.
I'm...
I missed the needle puncture to the C7.
I don't want to miss anything else.
It's not like you.
Why do you think you missed it?
I don't know.
Perhaps because the victim was someone
I cared very much about.
Why do you think I missed it?
Not because you're the murderer.
I don't think that.
I really don't.
Everyone should be able to make mistakes, even you.
Should we?
There's a faint cut mark here.
About a centimeter long.
It's perfectly straight, no irregularities.
I missed that.
Perhaps you're the murderer.
There's another one to the humerus.
These were not caused by wolves.
Which means they were caused by the killer, right?
Why make cuts if you know that wolves will be eating him?
Would you like me to see if there are other similar cuts?
No.
I can do it.
Thank you.
There was a trace in the tip of the hypodermic:
D-tubocurarine.
It's a neuromuscular blocking agent better know are curare.
It was used in anesthesia in the '40s.
It leaves the system quickly, which is why it didn't show up on the tox screen.
Okay.
Well, where would somebody get their hands on that now?
They would have to distill it themselves.
From what?
Chondrodendron tomentosum.
Is it easy to get a hold of?
Not really.
I mean, I had two of them, but...
Two weeks ago, Dr. Brennan asked me if she could have one.
What?
She said she was studying some-some tribe in western Colombia that used it to poison the tips of their arrows.
Look, I-I know we don't want to go there, but...
Stop.
Brennan didn't do this.
Yeah, I've studied Dr. Brennan for years.
Her cold and logical demeanor is a carefully constructed facade designed to protect a very sensitive psyche.
Someone threatened her kid.
We can't just ignore that.
Why are you even bringing that up?
Dr. Brennan trained him that way.
Don't be subjective, don't make assumptions, question everything.
We do have to be objective, Angela.
And thorough, and we have to do everything by the book, because if Dr. Brennan does end up being a suspect, our work has to be above reproach.
It was Pelant.
That doesn't mean we stop doing our job, Angie.
Seriously?
This is crazy.
We all know it was Pelant!
Booth!
Booth.
Whoa, slow down.
Hey, hey.
You gotta do something.
Slow down.
What?
Why are you here?
The evidence is piling up against Brennan.
She's on the video, and-and he threatened her kid, and the poison is from a plant that she borrowed from Hodgins.
She didn't do it!
I know, but... the evidence is going another way.
I'm the one who decides where the evidence goes and when.
Look, what we need to figure out is how to counteract the evidence against the evidence.
Meaning what?
We gotta find a way to prove that Pelant put Brennan on that video.
All right.
I'll do that.
Booth.
He's got me, Booth.
Pelant!
Where?
At his place.
He didn't see my phone.
I'm locked in the...
Bones?
Bones?
What...?
Hey, hey.
What is it?
Don't worry about it.
Just get back and do your job!
Hey, you can't come in here.
Where the hell is she?
Aah!
Ow!
Who?
Who?
Brennan.
Brennan.
Where is she?
She called me.
Where is she?
I don't know!
Bones!
Where are you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I swear, I don't know!
Bones, where are you?
I swear, there's no one here.
Where is she?
She's not here.
Where is she?
I'm alone!
Are you always alone?
Always alone.
Ow!
I'm always alone!
You're always alone?
Listen really clear.
You understand me?
I swear to God, if you touched her,
I will kill you.
I broke the monitor.
The police are going to come.
Any minute...
She called, all right?
She called.
She said she was here.
Are you sure about that?
Maybe you should call her.
Just to check.
Bones.
Bones!
Are you there?
Where are you?
Are you at home?
Did you call me?
I'll see you at home.
Yeah, you son of a...
What in God's name did you hope to accomplish?
I told you, I got a call from Bones, saying that Pelant had her.
There's no record of you receiving such a call.
Of course there's not.
All right?
He got me.
So you're saying
Pelant made this happen.
Yes, Pelant made it all happen.
He's must've gotten Bones's voice from a bunch of cell phone calls, and just mashed them together.
It gets worse.
Okay.
What's worse than nothing?
Pelant's lawyer found out what you did, and went straight to the parole board, claiming harassment.
Flynn...
All right.
They let him go?
Yes.
And they got you removed from the case.
And got Dr. Brennan removed from the case.
Right.
So Pelant got exactly what he wanted.
There is no one left to take him down.
No offense, Flynn.
I don't want to take over your case, Seeley.
It wasn't my idea.
You want to work a desk with pay, or go home on full suspension?
I'll go home.
What?
Pelant is out in the world, okay?
What if he shows up at my house?
Then you shoot him through the eyeball.
Yeah, that reminds me-
- I gotta take your gun and badge.
Rules is rules, cher.
There's nothing I can do.
You run this down the way you see fit, Flynn.
Oh, one last thing-- a little advice.
With a guy like Pelant, nothing is the way it seems.
Great.
I'll remember that.
So this is the last thing that Brennan looked at before she was removed from the case.
All the victim's wounds?
Yes.
Can you remove the damage done by the wolves?
Sure.
That's weird.
There's a pattern.
Does it mean anything?
Well, if Pelant did this, then it could be one of his weird codes.
Like, introducing a virus into the program?
You think so?
It's what he does-- turn it off.
No, wait, no, I know this pattern.
This has nothing to do with computer viruses.
Superimpose the arterial system.
Remove the veins.
Can you enlarge the areas where the nicks were found?
Whoa.
All those marks cross minor arteries.
Pelant cut them.
The wolves were drawn by the scent of blood.
This proves murder, right?
I mean this guy just didn't wander into the woods and drink some poison and wait to be eaten by wolves.
They certainly weren't self-inflicted.
Dr. Saroyan!
What are you going to do?
I am going to report this to Special Agent Flynn.
Cam, they're gonna think that Brennan did this.
Because Pelant has no background or training in anatomy or the circulatory system.
I know.
Do you have to?
Yes, it is my job.
So, what?
So Pelant wins.
Yes.
Today, Pelant wins.
I thought Cam told you not to contact me.
I don't care much about what Cam says these days, okay?
Listen, I'm looking into the e-mail exchange between you and Ethan to see how Pelant accessed them.
How?
You said they were all encrypted.
Yeah, I don't know.
That's why I'm looking into every computer trail that leads back to Pelant.
Thanks, Angela.
Yeah.
I'm just being selfish.
If you go to jail, I don't have anybody to go to baby group with.
Now, I need all the passwords that you've used within the past year.
Your profile says the killer is hyper-rational, deliberate and exacting.
That's correct.
When I read Pelant's transcript...
Would you describe Dr. Brennan as hyper-rational, deliberate and exacting?
My profile fits Pelant.
Yeah, I understand that's what you'd like, but please answer the question.
You have to answer, cher.
That description could be applied to Dr. Brennan.
Thank you.
In certain situations.
You also posit that the killer had a compromised childhood because of abandonment.
Yes.
Pelant's parents divorced when he was young.
He was close with his father, which he rarely saw after--
Wasn't Dr. Brennan actually abandoned by her father?
It's not that simple.
He returned...
18 years later.
The other psychologist who reviewed your report said that would actually be worse.
Look...
I know Dr. Brennan.
She's a good person.
She's compassionate and empathetic, and a wonderful mother.
And how far would that wonderful, hyper-rational mother go to protect her child, Dr. Sweets?
No, I know her.
She didn't kill him.
The Bureau will be using an outside consultant for all future profiling on this case.
I'm sure you understand.
So I'm off the case.
Come on, you gotta be kidding me.
Can't Caroline appeal this?
I mean, come on...
Sweets, you of all people, know more about this case than anyone.
Okay, great.
So Sweets just got kicked off the case.
Agent Flynn accused him of being too close to you.
That seems like a reasonable decision from that perspective.
Can we stop being so reasonable, please?
Hey, hey...
I think I got something here.
Look at this.
What is it?
I hacked into his credit card bill, his phone bill and his library card.
Okay, you're hacking the hacker?
Yeah... there's something kind of poetic about it, right?
So, according to his library records,
Pelant reads a lot.
That makes sense.
He was confined, and the library delivers to shut-ins.
No, I mean he reads a lot a lot.
They delivered and picked up over 80 books within the past three months.
Wow!
No one reads that much.
I do.
Well, no one is you, Bones.
Okay, do me a favor.
Pull up his cable bill.
I want to see how many pay- per-view movies he's ordered.
Wow.
A lot.
Even you couldn't watch all these movies, and read all those books, sweetie.
We have to get the books that were delivered.
Pack that up.
Just get over there.
Sorry for the interruption.
I have a warrant to search Dr. Brennan's home and vehicle.
Hah!
Course you do.
Right.
Oh!
Uh, not so fast.
This is "914." We're 941.
This warrant's not for us.
It's a technicality.
Well, courts, they operate on technicalities.
Come on, Flynn.
You know that.
I mean...
You find something, which you won't, it won't be admissible.
I can be back in two hours with another warrant for the house but her Prius is parked on the street, and the license plate matches the one on the warrant.
Give me the keys.
Um...
We lost them.
We'll tow it.
Fine.
Knock yourself out.
And I mean that.
Thanks for stopping by...
Flynn.
Pack up all the stuff that we have on Pelant.
Angela, get to the library, okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Get to the library, check out all the books that he checked out.
There's got to be a reason why he picked out those books.
Hey, so, I found these...
What is wrong?
Are you okay?
Well...
the FBI sent over hair samples from
Dr. Brennan's trunk.
God...
I looked at it a hundred times.
I want a different result but it...
It's a match for the victim.
The hair belongs to Ethan Sawyer.
Cam...
Wha...
What are you gonna do?
Well, I'm gonna get myself together and I'm gonna do the right thing.
Which is...?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry but either you believe in the system, or you don't.
And I do.
I'm not supposed to be here.
This doesn't sound good.
It's not good, cher.
There's too much evidence piling up.
Oh, come on.
You know she didn't do it.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have put that wrong address on the search warrant.
I don't know what you're talking about, cher.
She doesn't have a choice, Booth.
It doesn't matter what she believes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure this will work out, but for now,
I've got to get an arrest warrant.
This is a nightmare.
It'll take me a few hours, if I drag my heels right, so you'll have time to get your affairs in order and say good-bye.
Thank you.
Now you're thanking her?
Baby's crying.
You don't think I wouldn't give anything to have this turn out differently?
I'll call when I get the warrant, so Dr. Brennan can turn herself in.
It'll go better that way.
Cher, I'm sorry.
Hey.
Anything?
Hey.
Uh...
Look, I know you're trying to be helpful and concerned but...
No, I'm not trying to be helpful and concerned.
I just want to know how Pelant communicates with Skynet before he comes after me.
It's got something to do with these books.
Well...
Angie, some of these aren't even in English.
I know.
I-I'm trying to search for some kind of pattern-- titles, publication dates, subjects, binding methods--
Nobody's gonna believe Brennan but us.
When we stop looking, it's over.
I know.
Hey, what if you arranged the titles in the order in which he checked them out.
Angie, then you can...
You-You did that already.
Of course.
I love you.
I love you.
Hey, you two.
Dad.
We're both home today.
You don't have to watch Christine.
I'm not here about Christine.
How much time does Tempe have?
Before they arrest her?
No, before her first gray hair.
Come on, we gotta figure out what our moves are.
Caroline says that I should turn myself in before the arrest warrant can be executed.
You gotta make a run for it, honey-- now.
Slow down, Max.
You been thinking about this for days!
What, me being a fugitive?
Look, I have been thinking about it, all right?
Only problem is, that's gonna make us look more guilty.
You want to work inside the system.
I am the system, Max.
No, computers are the system.
And this son of a bitch runs computers.
And the minute they have Tempe in custody, she is part of the system.
Your only chance is to get off the grid!
Honey...
Honey, think about it logically, okay?
The minute he has you, he will never let you go.
Look what he did to that crazy smart friend of yours.
We will be fine, Max.
No, you won't.
You two don't understand what happens when the system turns on you.
I do.
You okay?
We should have Christine christened before I'm arrested.
We?
You mean... both of us.
You're gonna come?
Yes.
What?
What's going on?
Ethan was tracking Pelant's thought process mathematically.
Ethan was trying to send me a mathematical message.
You see, he inscribed it with a quotation from Alexander Pope.
"Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night.
God said, 'Let Newton be,' and all was light."
So, what, that's the message?
Definitely.
Okay, what-- about math and light?
Can we get into Ethan's room at the Psychiatric Institute?
No, we can't.
No, but Hodges can.
What are we looking for?
Brennan said it would have to be a message written within a triangle.
Something about Newton.
The first thing we do is we find three things that form a triangle.
Well, three things always form a triangle.
You, me, the desk-- that's a triangle.
Brennan seems pretty certain that there is a message here.
Ethan Sawyer was hallucinating.
He could have left it in the air.
Yeah, well, the pencil would have to be imaginary, too.
Patients aren't allowed anything sharper than their fingers.
Wait.
Uh, hand me the ALS.
Come on.
Come on.
Found something.
Oh, that is so creepy.
He left a message in his own saliva.
Saliva.
Oh, good choice.
Smart.
Is it computer code?
I have no idea.
I've never seen symbols like it before.
Ethan must have invented it himself.
Well, yeah.
Well, then, what good is it?
And what good are all the library books?
I've learned that sometimes you have to step back and see the big picture.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm not seeing the big picture here.
In fact, I'm not seeing any picture, actually.
The answer is in that code.
Knowing Ethan, it's computer code.
Wait.
Where do books and computers cross?
Uh, I have to go.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Angela?
I just want to say... thank you for believing in me.
You don't have to thank somebody who loves you for believing in you, honey.
I love you, too.
All right.
Take a minute.
Forget about everything except Booth and Christine.
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah.

Hey.
Listen.
I think I know how he did it.
How who did what?
Pelant.
He-he used library books to insert mini-programs-- really viruses.
How?
The library has a centralized materials automated handling system.
Each book is independently coded, and Pelant just substituted his own code.
The library scans the book, and it uploads the code to the Internet?
Yeah.
You think this is enough to keep Brennan from being arrested?
A theory?
No.
And also,
I couldn't help if I wanted.
I'm off the case, too.
Unless you can prove
Pelant used his library books to transfer money from Dr. Brennan's account into mine.
Oh, my God.
I hope Cam is happy.
If she had just kept things to herself, we wouldn't be in this position.
Angela, you listen to me on this subject.
All of us did what Pelant expected, except for Cam.
Because of her, you squints are all still in this, which Pelant fears above all else.
As long as the Jeffersonian stays in the game, the good guys live to fight another day.
My opinion, Cam Saroyan is the hero of this story so far.
You hear what I'm saying, cher?
Yeah.
Okay.
Tell you what, I'll go get the car, all right?
Okay.
Booth?
Yeah.
What is it?
I love you, Booth.
I don't want you to think that Christine is the only reason we're together.
It's going to be okay.
All right?
All right.
I'll be right back.
I'll go get the car.
All right?
Be right back.
Hey.
Come on, let's go.
We gotta go.
Perfect.
Now, drive as far as you can without getting exhausted.
Don't stop at any chain restaurants or motels.
You already told me this.
Pay cash.
You took all my credit cards already.
Well, I'll get you some fake I.D.'s-- hey, I'm right about this.
Trust me.
Now, wait for me where we said.
If I... if I'm not there...
Three days later, the next place.
I remember.
Okay, get in, get in.
Let's go.
Go.
Go.
Thanks, Dad.
Bones?
Bones!
Hey!
Bones!
Hey!
Hey!
It's the way it had to go.
What the...?
Where are they going?
Well, if you know, you'd be an accomplice.
Accomplice?
That's my family, you understand?
I should be with them.
You want to hit me.
I know, I know.
I understand.
Go ahead.
I know how to be a fugitive a lot better than you.
What am I supposed to do?
You stay in the system.
You stay alive.
I'll make sure Tempe stays out of the system.
I'm going to get my family back.
You tell Bones that.
Then you get that bastard.
You'll bring your family home.
I'll keep her safe.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Ms. Julian, sit!
You'll have your time.
I just can't believe you're even considering removing this man's ankle monitor!
That's our job.
Your job is to protect people from this psychopath.
Are you going to allow her to talk to him like that?
Both of you, shut up!
And, Ms. Julian, if you don't sit right now, I will toss you out of here.
You can finish,
Mr. Pelant.
PELANT:
Thank you.
I suppose I deserve whatever happens here today.
What I thought was a prank at the time turned out to be destructive to our government and a danger to the public.
I know now that computer hacking is a serious crime... (whispers):
Actually sounds like he means it.
That's what I'm afraid of.
It says McCann Academy is willing to hire Mr. Pelant as a tutor and teaching assistant?
That's correct.
And they know about Mr. Pelant's criminal record?
They've seen everything.
They even read the transcripts of my trial.
I insisted on it.
I didn't want there to be any surprises.
I can assure you, I'm not the same person I was then.
CAROLINE:
He's right.
He's not a hacker anymore;
now he's a murderer.
Ms. Grover, this is outrageous.
What are you talking about, Ms. Julian?
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Mr. Pelant is a person of interest in two active murder investigations.
They have no proof.
This isn't a court of law.
We don't need proof.
That's why I like it.
But we have been compiling information.
LAWYER:
The FBI has harassed my client all year.
PELANT:
I'm monitored 24 hours a day.
They know I never leave my house.
That ankle thing there says that you're home, but I don't believe it, pal.
BRENNAN:
Here's what we've compiled so far.
There are preliminary lab reports, as well as complex computer code written on remains.
If you want to free him after reading this, be my guest.
LAWYER:
You can't keep him tethered to that ankle monitor just because they are on a fishing expedition.
Public safety is the parole board's number one consideration.
Mr. Pelant, we're going to deny your application until we analyze these files.
He has been a model prisoner.
It's okay.
I want them to feel secure.
Ain't that sweet?
(wolf howling) What's that?
Someone changed my ringtone.
(dogs barking) Whoa.
Mine, too.
A couple on an ATV found the remains.
What were they doing here?
Got lost.
Their GPS sent them east instead of west, and this is where they wound up.
I've never heard of a GPS reversing direction.
(cell phone chimes)
What is it?
Father Keyes.
We're all set for Christine's baptism on the 19th.
You're still okay if I do that?
Absolutely.
Sprinkling water on her forehead seems like an excellent way to counteract the sins she apparently committed prior to birth.
I take it you're still not going to the baptism?
Look, you know, we're at a murder scene here, not a religious debate, right?
Hey.
Welcome to the Hamilton National Wildlife Refuge.
Oh, it's not so refuge-y for this guy, is it?
Not much tissue left.
Eaten.
Victim is male.
No billows on the auricular surface, so age is late 30s.
Medial epicondyle appears to have been fractured.
Remodeling indicates that it happened about eight years ago.
Why does that matter?
It doesn't.
It's just...
it's a unique break.
Piophilidae eggs puts time of death at two days max.
Pio who?
All the internal organs are gone.
This was like Thanksgiving dinner for the animals out here.
Based on dentition and the species in the area, it was a... it was a pack of wolves.
Wolves?
Yes.
The break is 28 millimeters long, transecting the medial epicondyle and the trochlea.
Clothing remnant looks like polyester, and the waistband's elastic.
They're scrubs.
Scrubs, great.
So the victim was a doctor, right?
Yes, and a patient.
How do you know?
I set this break.
I know this man.
He's Ethan Sawyer.
Pelant...
Pelant killed my friend.

(metal detector beeps)
The victim, Dr. Ethan Sawyer, was eaten by wolves?
Right.
The same Dr. Ethan Sawyer who was a delusional schizophrenic locked up in a high-security ward in a mental hospital?
Oh, come on, Sweets.
Obviously, he escaped.
Booth, has the victim been officially confirmed as Ethan Sawyer?
No, but Sawyer-- he goes missing from the loony bin, right?
And, so, you know, hey, Bones recognizes his broken elbow.
How'd she do that?
Well, because, you know, she's the one who set it.
They went to grad school together, they were friends, and, you know, he fell off a chairlift, and she's the one who set the bone.
What's the matter with you?
You're jumping to the conclusion that Pelant is involved.
I am not-- Look, he is involved.
Is this a hunch?
No.
He switched our ring tones to wolves.
The victim was eaten by wolves.
Ring tones won't hold up in court.
Tell you what, when you're ready to help, you come and find me, all right?
Until then, take a hike.
I am helping, Booth.
This is how I help.
To keep things in perspective, okay?
So how can I help?
Profile the killer, and match it to Pelant.
You're asking me to frame somebody, so, no, but what I can do is put together an objective profile.
If it matches Pelant, it matches.
It'll match;
Pelant did it.
(sighs)
These marks on the zygomatic are from teeth.
Two canines, their supporting third incisors, and this faint mark here is from a premolar.
Wolves?
Yes.
The pattern of tissue removal from multiple sites is consistent with simultaneous feeding.
How many animals?
Five or six.
They ingested approximately 70 pounds of soft tissue.
Dr. Brennan knew this guy?
Since grad school.
Guy was brilliant.
Specialized in artificial intelligence.
He modeled human behaviors mathematically.
No wonder he went crazy.
You can't really turn people into equations.
Oh.
What did I miss?
(speed dials)
(cell phone ringing)
Yes, Cam?
There's hemorrhagic staining around approximately 50% of the bite marks.
Okay, what's that mean?
It means that Ethan was still alive when the wolves started to eat him.
You know what?
Wolves don't do that.
So it wasn't wolves?
More likely,
Ethan only appeared to be dead.
Paralyzed, you mean?
Nothing showed up on the initial tox screen.
We'll take another look.
Thanks, Cam.
(sighs)
You okay?
I have something
I have to tell you.
What do you mean?
Worse than being eaten alive?
I was conferring with Ethan on the Pelant case.
What do you-- in secret?
Yes.
Why?
Pelant is a mathematical genius, but Ethan was smarter.
You think that
Pelant killed Ethan because Ethan was helping you do math?
A normal person like you wouldn't understand how dangerous Ethan was to Pelant.
Yeah, I get it.
It takes a genius to know a genius.
But do you have any idea,
Bones, what a defense lawyer would do with the knowledge of you consulting with a paranoid schizophrenic?
It would be very bad for us.
Yeah.
Should we tell Caroline?
If we find Pelant had means and opportunity, then, you know, we'll tell Caroline about the motive.
Sometimes you got to work a little outside the system, Bones.
For a greater good.
I know, Booth.
That's why I didn't tell you about Ethan.
Right.
SAWYER:
You have to let me go.
I have to take care of it.
NOBLE:
Do you mean the baby?
It's a demon that looks like a baby, and it's hampering very important work.
I have to dispatch the demon!
Are you saying you have to kill it?
Yes!
Do you see any other way?
Poor Ethan.
Poor Ethan?
He was talking about our daughter.
Uh, please, we should talk out here.
BOOTH:
Okay, Bones, let me get this straight.
Did he threaten her in front of you?
No.
Not directly.
I know he thought she was a threat, but...
And you don't think you should've told me that?
Ethan was confined to a secure facility.
I'm sorry, I didn't think it was necessary.
You said he escaped before.
Yes.
About a year ago.
But that's why he was moved to lockdown.
And this time, before he disappeared, let me guess, there was some sort of a computer glitch?
Yes.
Dr. Sawyer was accidentally transferred to an open ward.
How did you know that?
BRENNAN:
Open ward?
Meaning Ethan could have simply walked away?
That's correct.
Minimal supervision.
So you're absolutely positive he had no visitors?
None.
Absolutely.
Okay, when was the last time you visited him?
Two weeks ago.
He gave me an old mathematics book as a gift.
Visitors have to sign in, so it'll be in the records.
Great.
We're gonna need all the logs and security footage of the entrances and exits of this institution.
You got it.
HODGES:
Hey.
You find anything inconsistent with wolf attack?
No.
Yeah.
All the DNA I've found is lupine in nature.
Wolves killed him, but they didn't murder him.
Right.
So, Pelant fools his ankle monitor into thinking that he's at home, he lures our victim out of the loony bin, drugs him, and then leaves him for the wolves.
One thing I learned from Dr. Brennan:
gather evidence and follow it without bias.
That's right.
Yeah, yeah.
Pelant made a mistake, we're gonna find it.
He's not God.
Oh, crap.
MONTENEGRO:
Hey.
You need to stop what you're doing and come look at this.
Is something wrong, Angela?
So I scanned through the security footage from the loony bin, and...
BRENNAN:
That's the front door of the psychiatric facility where Ethan escaped from.
That's me.
I'm carrying the book that he gave me.
Yeah.
This-this is, this is time-stamped the night before Ethan Sawyer disappeared.
No, that's incorrect.
This footage was taken two weeks before that.
Which is when he gave me the book.
Sweetie, this-this is time-stamped.
Pelant must have hacked into the institute's security system.
I don't know how he could've altered this footage.
Look, I'm gonna break this thing down to the pixels to figure it out.
But, in the meantime, you're gonna need an alibi for this night.
I don't have one.
Yeah, you do.
You were at the Founding Fathers drinking a Bitter Canadian with me.
We were talking about Christine's christening.
You're trying to help me.
Yeah.
I mean, you wouldn't kill anybody.
I believe under certain circumstances
I most certainly would kill.
Like someone thinking your daughter is a demon, and threatening to kill her?
Oh, my God.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
I wasn't there, Booth.
Security footage says 7:14.
Right?
That's four hours unaccounted for before you got home.
That's plenty of time to abduct and murder Ethan, and then make it back before 11:00.
Don't say it like that.
Like what?
Like it's not you that we're talking about.
I didn't do it, Booth.
That doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter, Bones.
You're on that video.
I'll be fine, Booth...
Christine is asleep.
Angela will be able to tell that the video has been altered.
Hey, is everything okay?
Which is what she hasn't done so far.
And since Ethan threatened Christine, that gives you motive and opportunity, okay?
Can you ignore evidence like that?
'Cause I sure as hell can't.
This-this guy, Pelant, he's framing you.
It would seem so.
BOOTH:
Yes.
He is.
All the evidence is now pointing to her as the killer.
Weren't you getting close to nailing this guy?
Yes, and Ethan was helping.
Yeah.
Ethan was helping.
Look what happened to him.
Honey, you need a plan.
We can handle this, Max.
Well, you haven't so far.
BRENNAN:
Everyone at the Jeffersonian is working on this, Dad.
We will find evidence that links all of this to Pelant.
Right, and if you don't?
BOOTH:
Max.
Please.
Thank you so much for putting Christine to bed.
We really appreciate that, all right?
But we can handle this.
MAX:
Sure, sure.
Listen...
I'm sorry, I...
If you need anything, baby...
(sighs)
Looks like some kind of puncture.
Dr. Brennan didn't see this when she went over the X-rays?
No.
I was surprised, too.
It's pretty obvious when you compare the films to the actual bone.
Maybe she thought it was another bite mark from the wolves.
No, look at the enlarged image.
I think it's the tip of a needle.
I'm sure she thought it was another bite mark.
Can you hand me the rotary saw?
Mosquito forceps.
It's definitely a hypodermic needle.
Could there be trace of the drug inside the tip?
Maybe.
Okay...
Give that to Dr. Hodgins.
I don't think you did it.
You know that, right?
I wouldn't blame you.
It's a reasonable assumption.
Can you stop being like that?
Okay?
It's not reasonable.
Not for me.
Do you want me to come to Christine's christening?
You don't have to worry about that now.
I don't want Pelant to change our lives.
That would be the worst.
Then, you know what?
Let's not change.
Look, you don't have to come.
Religion's my thing.
You're really okay with that?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I appreciate you asking.
You know, let's just not change our lives for this guy.
All right?
Look, I love you the way you are, Bones.

BRAY:
Dr. Brennan!
You're here early.
I'm...
I missed the needle puncture to the C7.
I don't want to miss anything else.
It's not like you.
Why do you think you missed it?
I don't know.
Perhaps because the victim was someone
I cared very much about.
Why do you think I missed it?
Not because you're the murderer.
I don't think that.
I really don't.
Everyone should be able to make mistakes, even you.
Should we?
There's a faint cut mark here.
About a centimeter long.
It's perfectly straight, no irregularities.
I missed that.
Perhaps you're the murderer.
There's another one to the humerus.
These were not caused by wolves.
Which means they were caused by the killer, right?
Why make cuts if you know that wolves will be eating him?
Would you like me to see if there are other similar cuts?
No.
I can do it.
Thank you.
HODGINS:
There was a trace in the tip of the hypodermic:
D-tubocurarine.
It's a neuromuscular blocking agent better know are curare.
It was used in anesthesia in the '40s.
It leaves the system quickly, which is why it didn't show up on the tox screen.
Okay.
Well, where would somebody get their hands on that now?
They would have to distill it themselves.
From what?
Chondrodendron tomentosum.
Is it easy to get a hold of?
Not really.
I mean, I had two of them, but...
Two weeks ago, Dr. Brennan asked me if she could have one.
What?
She said she was studying some-some tribe in western Colombia that used it to poison the tips of their arrows.
Look, I-I know we don't want to go there, but...
Stop.
Brennan didn't do this.
Yeah, I've studied Dr. Brennan for years.
Her cold and logical demeanor is a carefully constructed facade designed to protect a very sensitive psyche.
Someone threatened her kid.
We can't just ignore that.
Why are you even bringing that up?
Dr. Brennan trained him that way.
Don't be subjective, don't make assumptions, question everything.
We do have to be objective, Angela.
And thorough, and we have to do everything by the book, because if Dr. Brennan does end up being a suspect, our work has to be above reproach.
It was Pelant.
That doesn't mean we stop doing our job, Angie.
Seriously?
This is crazy.
We all know it was Pelant!
Booth!
Booth.
Whoa, slow down.
Hey, hey.
You gotta do something.
Slow down.
What?
Why are you here?
The evidence is piling up against Brennan.
She's on the video, and-and he threatened her kid, and the poison is from a plant that she borrowed from Hodgins.
She didn't do it!
I know, but... the evidence is going another way.
I'm the one who decides where the evidence goes and when.
Look, what we need to figure out is how to counteract the evidence against the evidence.
Meaning what?
We gotta find a way to prove that Pelant put Brennan on that video.
All right.
I'll do that.
(cell phone rings)
Booth.
BRENNAN:
He's got me, Booth.
Pelant!
Where?
At his place.
He didn't see my phone.
I'm locked in the... (click)
Bones?
Bones?
What...?
Hey, hey.
What is it?
Don't worry about it.
Just get back and do your job!
(jaunty piano music plays)
Hey, you can't come in here.
Where the hell is she?
Aah!
Ow!
Who?
Who?
Brennan.
Brennan.
Where is she?
She called me.
Where is she?
I don't know!
Bones!
Where are you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I swear, I don't know!
Bones, where are you?
I swear, there's no one here.
Where is she?
She's not here.
Where is she?
I'm alone!
Are you always alone?
Always alone.
Ow!
I'm always alone!
You're always alone?
Listen really clear.
You understand me?
I swear to God, if you touched her,
I will kill you.
I broke the monitor.
The police are going to come.
Any minute...
She called, all right?
She called.
She said she was here.
Are you sure about that?
Maybe you should call her.
Just to check.
(phone speed dialing)
Bones.
Bones!
Are you there?
Where are you?
Are you at home?
Did you call me?
I'll see you at home.
(phone beeps off)
Yeah, you son of a...
What in God's name did you hope to accomplish?
I told you, I got a call from Bones, saying that Pelant had her.
There's no record of you receiving such a call.
Of course there's not.
All right?
He got me.
So you're saying
Pelant made this happen.
Yes, Pelant made it all happen.
He's must've gotten Bones's voice from a bunch of cell phone calls, and just mashed them together.
It gets worse.
Okay.
What's worse than nothing?
Pelant's lawyer found out what you did, and went straight to the parole board, claiming harassment.
Flynn...
All right.
They let him go?
Yes.
And they got you removed from the case.
And got Dr. Brennan removed from the case.
Right.
So Pelant got exactly what he wanted.
There is no one left to take him down.
No offense, Flynn.
I don't want to take over your case, Seeley.
It wasn't my idea.
You want to work a desk with pay, or go home on full suspension?
BOOTH:
I'll go home.
What?
Pelant is out in the world, okay?
What if he shows up at my house?
Then you shoot him through the eyeball.
Yeah, that reminds me-
- I gotta take your gun and badge.
CAROLINE:
Rules is rules, cher.
There's nothing I can do.
You run this down the way you see fit, Flynn.
Oh, one last thing-- a little advice.
With a guy like Pelant, nothing is the way it seems.
Great.
I'll remember that.
So this is the last thing that Brennan looked at before she was removed from the case.
All the victim's wounds?
Yes.
Can you remove the damage done by the wolves?
MONTENEGRO:
Sure.
That's weird.
There's a pattern.
Does it mean anything?
MONTENEGRO:
Well, if Pelant did this, then it could be one of his weird codes.
Like, introducing a virus into the program?
You think so?
It's what he does-- turn it off.
No, wait, no, I know this pattern.
This has nothing to do with computer viruses.
Superimpose the arterial system.
Remove the veins.
Can you enlarge the areas where the nicks were found?
BRAY:
Whoa.
All those marks cross minor arteries.
Pelant cut them.
The wolves were drawn by the scent of blood.
This proves murder, right?
I mean this guy just didn't wander into the woods and drink some poison and wait to be eaten by wolves.
They certainly weren't self-inflicted.
BRAY:
Dr. Saroyan!
What are you going to do?
I am going to report this to Special Agent Flynn.
Cam, they're gonna think that Brennan did this.
Because Pelant has no background or training in anatomy or the circulatory system.
I know.
Do you have to?
Yes, it is my job.
So, what?
So Pelant wins.
Yes.
Today, Pelant wins.
BRENNAN:
I thought Cam told you not to contact me.
I don't care much about what Cam says these days, okay?
Listen, I'm looking into the e-mail exchange between you and Ethan to see how Pelant accessed them.
How?
You said they were all encrypted.
Yeah, I don't know.
That's why I'm looking into every computer trail that leads back to Pelant.
Thanks, Angela.
Yeah.
I'm just being selfish.
If you go to jail, I don't have anybody to go to baby group with.
Now, I need all the passwords that you've used within the past year.
Your profile says the killer is hyper-rational, deliberate and exacting.
That's correct.
When I read Pelant's transcript...
Would you describe Dr. Brennan as hyper-rational, deliberate and exacting?
My profile fits Pelant.
Yeah, I understand that's what you'd like, but please answer the question.
You have to answer, cher.
That description could be applied to Dr. Brennan.
Thank you.
In certain situations.
You also posit that the killer had a compromised childhood because of abandonment.
Yes.
Pelant's parents divorced when he was young.
He was close with his father, which he rarely saw after--
Wasn't Dr. Brennan actually abandoned by her father?
It's not that simple.
He returned...
18 years later.
The other psychologist who reviewed your report said that would actually be worse.
Look...
I know Dr. Brennan.
She's a good person.
She's compassionate and empathetic, and a wonderful mother.
And how far would that wonderful, hyper-rational mother go to protect her child, Dr. Sweets?
No, I know her.
She didn't kill him.
The Bureau will be using an outside consultant for all future profiling on this case.
I'm sure you understand.
So I'm off the case.
Come on, you gotta be kidding me.
Can't Caroline appeal this?
I mean, come on...
Sweets, you of all people, know more about this case than anyone.
Okay, great.
So Sweets just got kicked off the case.
Agent Flynn accused him of being too close to you.
That seems like a reasonable decision from that perspective.
Can we stop being so reasonable, please?
MONTENEGRO:
Hey, hey...
I think I got something here.
Look at this.
What is it?
I hacked into his credit card bill, his phone bill and his library card.
Okay, you're hacking the hacker?
Yeah... there's something kind of poetic about it, right?
So, according to his library records,
Pelant reads a lot.
That makes sense.
He was confined, and the library delivers to shut-ins.
No, I mean he reads a lot a lot.
They delivered and picked up over 80 books within the past three months.
Wow!
No one reads that much.
I do.
Well, no one is you, Bones.
Okay, do me a favor.
Pull up his cable bill.
I want to see how many pay- per-view movies he's ordered.
MONTENEGRO:
Wow.
A lot.
Even you couldn't watch all these movies, and read all those books, sweetie.
We have to get the books that were delivered.
(doorbell rings)
Pack that up.
Just get over there.
Sorry for the interruption.
I have a warrant to search Dr. Brennan's home and vehicle.
Hah!
Course you do.
Right.
Oh!
Uh, not so fast.
This is "914." We're 941.
This warrant's not for us.
It's a technicality.
Well, courts, they operate on technicalities.
Come on, Flynn.
You know that.
I mean... (chuckles)
You find something, which you won't, it won't be admissible.
I can be back in two hours with another warrant for the house but her Prius is parked on the street, and the license plate matches the one on the warrant.
Give me the keys.
Um...
We lost them.
We'll tow it.
Fine.
Knock yourself out.
And I mean that.
Thanks for stopping by...
Flynn.
Pack up all the stuff that we have on Pelant.
Angela, get to the library, okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Get to the library, check out all the books that he checked out.
There's got to be a reason why he picked out those books.
HODGINS:
Hey, so, I found these...
What is wrong?
Are you okay?
Well... (clears throat) the FBI sent over hair samples from
Dr. Brennan's trunk.
(heavy sigh) God...
I looked at it a hundred times.
I want a different result but it...
It's a match for the victim.
The hair belongs to Ethan Sawyer.
Cam...
Wha...
What are you gonna do?
Well, I'm gonna get myself together and I'm gonna do the right thing.
Which is...?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry but either you believe in the system, or you don't.
And I do.
I'm not supposed to be here.
(groans) This doesn't sound good.
It's not good, cher.
There's too much evidence piling up.
Oh, come on.
You know she didn't do it.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have put that wrong address on the search warrant.
I don't know what you're talking about, cher.
She doesn't have a choice, Booth.
It doesn't matter what she believes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure this will work out, but for now,
I've got to get an arrest warrant.
This is a nightmare.
It'll take me a few hours, if I drag my heels right, so you'll have time to get your affairs in order and say good-bye.
Thank you.
Now you're thanking her?
(Christine crying) Baby's crying.
You don't think I wouldn't give anything to have this turn out differently?
I'll call when I get the warrant, so Dr. Brennan can turn herself in.
It'll go better that way.
Cher, I'm sorry.
Hey.
Anything?
Hey.
Uh...
Look, I know you're trying to be helpful and concerned but...
No, I'm not trying to be helpful and concerned.
I just want to know how Pelant communicates with Skynet before he comes after me.
It's got something to do with these books.
Well...
Angie, some of these aren't even in English.
I know.
I-I'm trying to search for some kind of pattern-- titles, publication dates, subjects, binding methods--
Nobody's gonna believe Brennan but us.
When we stop looking, it's over.
I know.
Hey, what if you arranged the titles in the order in which he checked them out.
Angie, then you can...
You-You did that already.
Of course.
I love you.
I love you.
Hey, you two.
Dad.
We're both home today.
You don't have to watch Christine.
I'm not here about Christine.
How much time does Tempe have?
Before they arrest her?
No, before her first gray hair.
Come on, we gotta figure out what our moves are.
Caroline says that I should turn myself in before the arrest warrant can be executed.
You gotta make a run for it, honey-- now.
Slow down, Max.
You been thinking about this for days!
What, me being a fugitive?
Look, I have been thinking about it, all right?
Only problem is, that's gonna make us look more guilty.
You want to work inside the system.
I am the system, Max.
No, computers are the system.
And this son of a bitch runs computers.
And the minute they have Tempe in custody, she is part of the system.
Your only chance is to get off the grid!
Honey...
Honey, think about it logically, okay?
The minute he has you, he will never let you go.
Look what he did to that crazy smart friend of yours.
We will be fine, Max.
No, you won't.
You two don't understand what happens when the system turns on you.
I do.
You okay?
We should have Christine christened before I'm arrested.
We?
You mean... both of us.
You're gonna come?
Yes.
What?
What's going on?
Ethan was tracking Pelant's thought process mathematically.
Ethan was trying to send me a mathematical message.
You see, he inscribed it with a quotation from Alexander Pope.
"Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night.
God said, 'Let Newton be,' and all was light."
So, what, that's the message?
Definitely.
Okay, what-- about math and light?
Can we get into Ethan's room at the Psychiatric Institute?
No, we can't.
(sighs) No, but Hodges can.
(sighs) What are we looking for?
Brennan said it would have to be a message written within a triangle.
Something about Newton.
The first thing we do is we find three things that form a triangle.
Well, three things always form a triangle.
You, me, the desk-- that's a triangle.
Brennan seems pretty certain that there is a message here.
Ethan Sawyer was hallucinating.
He could have left it in the air.
Yeah, well, the pencil would have to be imaginary, too.
Patients aren't allowed anything sharper than their fingers.
Wait.
Uh, hand me the ALS.
Come on.
Come on.
Found something.
(gasps)
Oh, that is so creepy.
He left a message in his own saliva.
Saliva.
Oh, good choice.
Smart.
BRENNAN:
Is it computer code?
I have no idea.
I've never seen symbols like it before.
Ethan must have invented it himself.
Well, yeah.
Well, then, what good is it?
And what good are all the library books?
I've learned that sometimes you have to step back and see the big picture.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm not seeing the big picture here.
In fact, I'm not seeing any picture, actually.
The answer is in that code.
Knowing Ethan, it's computer code.
Wait.
Where do books and computers cross?
Uh, I have to go.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Angela?
I just want to say... thank you for believing in me.
You don't have to thank somebody who loves you for believing in you, honey.
I love you, too.
All right.
Take a minute.
Forget about everything except Booth and Christine.
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah.

Hey.
Listen.
I think I know how he did it.
How who did what?
Pelant.
He-he used library books to insert mini-programs-- really viruses.
How?
The library has a centralized materials automated handling system.
Each book is independently coded, and Pelant just substituted his own code.
The library scans the book, and it uploads the code to the Internet?
Yeah.
You think this is enough to keep Brennan from being arrested?
A theory?
No.
And also,
I couldn't help if I wanted.
I'm off the case, too.
Unless you can prove
Pelant used his library books to transfer money from Dr. Brennan's account into mine.
Oh, my God.
I hope Cam is happy.
If she had just kept things to herself, we wouldn't be in this position.
Angela, you listen to me on this subject.
All of us did what Pelant expected, except for Cam.
Because of her, you squints are all still in this, which Pelant fears above all else.
As long as the Jeffersonian stays in the game, the good guys live to fight another day.
My opinion, Cam Saroyan is the hero of this story so far.
You hear what I'm saying, cher?
Yeah.
(sighs)
Okay.
Tell you what, I'll go get the car, all right?
Okay.
Booth?
Yeah.
What is it?
I love you, Booth.
I don't want you to think that Christine is the only reason we're together.
It's going to be okay.
All right?
All right.
I'll be right back.
I'll go get the car.
All right?
Be right back.
(Christine cooing)
(whistles) Hey.
Come on, let's go.
We gotta go.
Perfect.
Now, drive as far as you can without getting exhausted.
Don't stop at any chain restaurants or motels.
You already told me this.
Pay cash.
You took all my credit cards already.
Well, I'll get you some fake I.D.'s-- hey, I'm right about this.
Trust me.
Now, wait for me where we said.
If I... if I'm not there...
Three days later, the next place.

Okay, get in, get in.
Let's go.
Go.
Go.

Bones?
Bones!
Hey!
Bones!
Hey!
Hey!
MAX:
It's the way it had to go.
What the...?
Where are they going?
Well, if you know, you'd be an accomplice.
Accomplice?
That's my family, you understand?
I should be with them.
You want to hit me.
I know, I know.
I understand.
Go ahead.
I know how to be a fugitive a lot better than you.
What am I supposed to do?
You stay in the system.
You stay alive.
I'll make sure Tempe stays out of the system.
I'm going to get my family back.
You tell Bones that.
Then you get that bastard.
You'll bring your family home.
I'll keep her safe.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Ms. Julian, sit!
You'll have your time.
I just can't believe you're even considering removing this man's ankle monitor!
That's our job.
Your job is to protect people from this psychopath.
Are you going to allow her to talk to him like that?
Both of you, shut up!
And, Ms. Julian, if you don't sit right now, I will toss you out of here.
You can finish,
Mr. Pelant.
PELANT:
Thank you.
I suppose I deserve whatever happens here today.
What I thought was a prank at the time turned out to be destructive to our government and a danger to the public.
I know now that computer hacking is a serious crime... (whispers):
Actually sounds like he means it.
That's what I'm afraid of.
It says McCann Academy is willing to hire Mr. Pelant as a tutor and teaching assistant?
That's correct.
And they know about Mr. Pelant's criminal record?
They've seen everything.
They even read the transcripts of my trial.
I insisted on it.
I didn't want there to be any surprises.
I can assure you, I'm not the same person I was then.
CAROLINE:
He's right.
He's not a hacker anymore;
now he's a murderer.
Ms. Grover, this is outrageous.
What are you talking about, Ms. Julian?
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Mr. Pelant is a person of interest in two active murder investigations.
They have no proof.
This isn't a court of law.
We don't need proof.
That's why I like it.
But we have been compiling information.
LAWYER:
The FBI has harassed my client all year.
PELANT:
I'm monitored 24 hours a day.
They know I never leave my house.
That ankle thing there says that you're home, but I don't believe it, pal.
BRENNAN:
Here's what we've compiled so far.
There are preliminary lab reports, as well as complex computer code written on remains.
If you want to free him after reading this, be my guest.
LAWYER:
You can't keep him tethered to that ankle monitor just because they are on a fishing expedition.
Public safety is the parole board's number one consideration.
Mr. Pelant, we're going to deny your application until we analyze these files.
He has been a model prisoner.
It's okay.
I want them to feel secure.
Ain't that sweet?
(wolf howling) What's that?
Someone changed my ringtone.
(dogs barking) Whoa.
Mine, too.
A couple on an ATV found the remains.
What were they doing here?
Got lost.
Their GPS sent them east instead of west, and this is where they wound up.
I've never heard of a GPS reversing direction.
(cell phone chimes)
What is it?
Father Keyes.
We're all set for Christine's baptism on the 19th.
You're still okay if I do that?
Absolutely.
Sprinkling water on her forehead seems like an excellent way to counteract the sins she apparently committed prior to birth.
I take it you're still not going to the baptism?
Look, you know, we're at a murder scene here, not a religious debate, right?
Hey.
Welcome to the Hamilton National Wildlife Refuge.
Oh, it's not so refuge-y for this guy, is it?
Not much tissue left.
Eaten.
Victim is male.
No billows on the auricular surface, so age is late 30s.
Medial epicondyle appears to have been fractured.
Remodeling indicates that it happened about eight years ago.
Why does that matter?
It doesn't.
It's just...
it's a unique break.
Piophilidae eggs puts time of death at two days max.
Pio who?
All the internal organs are gone.
This was like Thanksgiving dinner for the animals out here.
Based on dentition and the species in the area, it was a... it was a pack of wolves.
Wolves?
Yes.
The break is 28 millimeters long, transecting the medial epicondyle and the trochlea.
Clothing remnant looks like polyester, and the waistband's elastic.
They're scrubs.
Scrubs, great.
So the victim was a doctor, right?
Yes, and a patient.
How do you know?
I set this break.
I know this man.
He's Ethan Sawyer.
Pelant...
Pelant killed my friend.

(metal detector beeps)
The victim, Dr. Ethan Sawyer, was eaten by wolves?
Right.
The same Dr. Ethan Sawyer who was a delusional schizophrenic locked up in a high-security ward in a mental hospital?
Oh, come on, Sweets.
Obviously, he escaped.
Booth, has the victim been officially confirmed as Ethan Sawyer?
No, but Sawyer-- he goes missing from the loony bin, right?
And, so, you know, hey, Bones recognizes his broken elbow.
How'd she do that?
Well, because, you know, she's the one who set it.
They went to grad school together, they were friends, and, you know, he fell off a chairlift, and she's the one who set the bone.
What's the matter with you?
You're jumping to the conclusion that Pelant is involved.
I am not-- Look, he is involved.
Is this a hunch?
No.
He switched our ring tones to wolves.
The victim was eaten by wolves.
Ring tones won't hold up in court.
Tell you what, when you're ready to help, you come and find me, all right?
Until then, take a hike.
I am helping, Booth.
This is how I help.
To keep things in perspective, okay?
So how can I help?
Profile the killer, and match it to Pelant.
You're asking me to frame somebody, so, no, but what I can do is put together an objective profile.
If it matches Pelant, it matches.
It'll match;
Pelant did it.
(sighs)
These marks on the zygomatic are from teeth.
Two canines, their supporting third incisors, and this faint mark here is from a premolar.
Wolves?
Yes.
The pattern of tissue removal from multiple sites is consistent with simultaneous feeding.
How many animals?
Five or six.
They ingested approximately 70 pounds of soft tissue.
Dr. Brennan knew this guy?
Since grad school.
Guy was brilliant.
Specialized in artificial intelligence.
He modeled human behaviors mathematically.
No wonder he went crazy.
You can't really turn people into equations.
Oh.
What did I miss?
(speed dials)
(cell phone ringing)
Yes, Cam?
There's hemorrhagic staining around approximately 50% of the bite marks.
Okay, what's that mean?
It means that Ethan was still alive when the wolves started to eat him.
You know what?
Wolves don't do that.
So it wasn't wolves?
More likely,
Ethan only appeared to be dead.
Paralyzed, you mean?
Nothing showed up on the initial tox screen.
We'll take another look.
Thanks, Cam.
(sighs)
You okay?
I have something
I have to tell you.
What do you mean?
Worse than being eaten alive?
I was conferring with Ethan on the Pelant case.
What do you-- in secret?
Yes.
Why?
Pelant is a mathematical genius, but Ethan was smarter.
You think that
Pelant killed Ethan because Ethan was helping you do math?
A normal person like you wouldn't understand how dangerous Ethan was to Pelant.
Yeah, I get it.
It takes a genius to know a genius.
But do you have any idea,
Bones, what a defense lawyer would do with the knowledge of you consulting with a paranoid schizophrenic?
It would be very bad for us.
Yeah.
Should we tell Caroline?
If we find Pelant had means and opportunity, then, you know, we'll tell Caroline about the motive.
Sometimes you got to work a little outside the system, Bones.
For a greater good.
I know, Booth.
That's why I didn't tell you about Ethan.
Right.
SAWYER:
You have to let me go.
I have to take care of it.
NOBLE:
Do you mean the baby?
It's a demon that looks like a baby, and it's hampering very important work.
I have to dispatch the demon!
Are you saying you have to kill it?
Yes!
Do you see any other way?
Poor Ethan.
Poor Ethan?
He was talking about our daughter.
Uh, please, we should talk out here.
BOOTH:
Okay, Bones, let me get this straight.
Did he threaten her in front of you?
No.
Not directly.
I know he thought she was a threat, but...
And you don't think you should've told me that?
Ethan was confined to a secure facility.
I'm sorry, I didn't think it was necessary.
You said he escaped before.
Yes.
About a year ago.
But that's why he was moved to lockdown.
And this time, before he disappeared, let me guess, there was some sort of a computer glitch?
Yes.
Dr. Sawyer was accidentally transferred to an open ward.
How did you know that?
BRENNAN:
Open ward?
Meaning Ethan could have simply walked away?
That's correct.
Minimal supervision.
So you're absolutely positive he had no visitors?
None.
Absolutely.
Okay, when was the last time you visited him?
Two weeks ago.
He gave me an old mathematics book as a gift.
Visitors have to sign in, so it'll be in the records.
Great.
We're gonna need all the logs and security footage of the entrances and exits of this institution.
You got it.
HODGES:
Hey.
You find anything inconsistent with wolf attack?
No.
Yeah.
All the DNA I've found is lupine in nature.
Wolves killed him, but they didn't murder him.
Right.
So, Pelant fools his ankle monitor into thinking that he's at home, he lures our victim out of the loony bin, drugs him, and then leaves him for the wolves.
One thing I learned from Dr. Brennan:
gather evidence and follow it without bias.
That's right.
Yeah, yeah.
Pelant made a mistake, we're gonna find it.
He's not God.
Oh, crap.
MONTENEGRO:
Hey.
You need to stop what you're doing and come look at this.
Is something wrong, Angela?
So I scanned through the security footage from the loony bin, and...
BRENNAN:
That's the front door of the psychiatric facility where Ethan escaped from.
That's me.
I'm carrying the book that he gave me.
Yeah.
This-this is, this is time-stamped the night before Ethan Sawyer disappeared.
No, that's incorrect.
This footage was taken two weeks before that.
Which is when he gave me the book.
Sweetie, this-this is time-stamped.
Pelant must have hacked into the institute's security system.
I don't know how he could've altered this footage.
Look, I'm gonna break this thing down to the pixels to figure it out.
But, in the meantime, you're gonna need an alibi for this night.
I don't have one.
Yeah, you do.
You were at the Founding Fathers drinking a Bitter Canadian with me.
We were talking about Christine's christening.
You're trying to help me.
Yeah.
I mean, you wouldn't kill anybody.
I believe under certain circumstances
I most certainly would kill.
Like someone thinking your daughter is a demon, and threatening to kill her?
Oh, my God.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
I wasn't there, Booth.
Security footage says 7:14.
Right?
That's four hours unaccounted for before you got home.
That's plenty of time to abduct and murder Ethan, and then make it back before 11:00.
Don't say it like that.
Like what?
Like it's not you that we're talking about.
I didn't do it, Booth.
That doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter, Bones.
You're on that video.
I'll be fine, Booth...
Christine is asleep.
Angela will be able to tell that the video has been altered.
Hey, is everything okay?
Which is what she hasn't done so far.
And since Ethan threatened Christine, that gives you motive and opportunity, okay?
Can you ignore evidence like that?
'Cause I sure as hell can't.
This-this guy, Pelant, he's framing you.
It would seem so.
BOOTH:
Yes.
He is.
All the evidence is now pointing to her as the killer.
Weren't you getting close to nailing this guy?
Yes, and Ethan was helping.
Yeah.
Ethan was helping.
Look what happened to him.
Honey, you need a plan.
We can handle this, Max.
Well, you haven't so far.
BRENNAN:
Everyone at the Jeffersonian is working on this, Dad.
We will find evidence that links all of this to Pelant.
Right, and if you don't?
BOOTH:
Max.
Please.
Thank you so much for putting Christine to bed.
We really appreciate that, all right?
But we can handle this.
MAX:
Sure, sure.
Listen...
I'm sorry, I...
If you need anything, baby...
(sighs)
Looks like some kind of puncture.
Dr. Brennan didn't see this when she went over the X-rays?
No.
I was surprised, too.
It's pretty obvious when you compare the films to the actual bone.
Maybe she thought it was another bite mark from the wolves.
No, look at the enlarged image.
I think it's the tip of a needle.
I'm sure she thought it was another bite mark.
Can you hand me the rotary saw?
Mosquito forceps.
It's definitely a hypodermic needle.
Could there be trace of the drug inside the tip?
Maybe.
Okay...
Give that to Dr. Hodgins.
I don't think you did it.
You know that, right?
I wouldn't blame you.
It's a reasonable assumption.
Can you stop being like that?
Okay?
It's not reasonable.
Not for me.
Do you want me to come to Christine's christening?
You don't have to worry about that now.
I don't want Pelant to change our lives.
That would be the worst.
Then, you know what?
Let's not change.
Look, you don't have to come.
Religion's my thing.
You're really okay with that?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I appreciate you asking.
You know, let's just not change our lives for this guy.
All right?
Look, I love you the way you are, Bones.
Okay?

BRAY:
Dr. Brennan!
You're here early.
I'm...
I missed the needle puncture to the C7.
I don't want to miss anything else.
It's not like you.
Why do you think you missed it?
I don't know.
Perhaps because the victim was someone
I cared very much about.
Why do you think I missed it?
Not because you're the murderer.
I don't think that.
I really don't.
Everyone should be able to make mistakes, even you.
Should we?
There's a faint cut mark here.
About a centimeter long.
It's perfectly straight, no irregularities.
I missed that.
Perhaps you're the murderer.
There's another one to the humerus.
These were not caused by wolves.
Which means they were caused by the killer, right?
Why make cuts if you know that wolves will be eating him?
Would you like me to see if there are other similar cuts?
No.
I can do it.
Thank you.
HODGINS:
There was a trace in the tip of the hypodermic:
D-tubocurarine.
It's a neuromuscular blocking agent better know are curare.
It was used in anesthesia in the '40s.
It leaves the system quickly, which is why it didn't show up on the tox screen.
Okay.
Well, where would somebody get their hands on that now?
They would have to distill it themselves.
From what?
Chondrodendron tomentosum.
Is it easy to get a hold of?
Not really.
I mean, I had two of them, but...
Two weeks ago, Dr. Brennan asked me if she could have one.
What?
She said she was studying some-some tribe in western Colombia that used it to poison the tips of their arrows.
Look, I-I know we don't want to go there, but...
Stop.
Brennan didn't do this.
Yeah, I've studied Dr. Brennan for years.
Her cold and logical demeanor is a carefully constructed facade designed to protect a very sensitive psyche.
Someone threatened her kid.
We can't just ignore that.
Why are you even bringing that up?
Dr. Brennan trained him that way.
Don't be subjective, don't make assumptions, question everything.
We do have to be objective, Angela.
And thorough, and we have to do everything by the book, because if Dr. Brennan does end up being a suspect, our work has to be above reproach.
It was Pelant.
That doesn't mean we stop doing our job, Angie.
Seriously?
This is crazy.
We all know it was Pelant!
Booth!
Booth.
Whoa, slow down.
Hey, hey.
You gotta do something.
Slow down.
What?
Why are you here?
The evidence is piling up against Brennan.
She's on the video, and-and he threatened her kid, and the poison is from a plant that she borrowed from Hodgins.
She didn't do it!
I know, but... the evidence is going another way.
I'm the one who decides where the evidence goes and when.
Look, what we need to figure out is how to counteract the evidence against the evidence.
Meaning what?
We gotta find a way to prove that Pelant put Brennan on that video.
All right.
I'll do that.
(cell phone rings)
Booth.
BRENNAN:
He's got me, Booth.
Pelant!
Where?
At his place.
He didn't see my phone.
I'm locked in the... (click)
Bones?
Bones?
What...?
Hey, hey.
What is it?
Don't worry about it.
Just get back and do your job!
(jaunty piano music plays)
Hey, you can't come in here.
Where the hell is she?
Aah!
Ow!
Who?
Who?
Brennan.
Brennan.
Where is she?
She called me.
Where is she?
I don't know!
Bones!
Where are you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I swear, I don't know!
Bones, where are you?
I swear, there's no one here.
Where is she?
She's not here.
Where is she?
I'm alone!
Are you always alone?
Always alone.
Ow!
I'm always alone!
You're always alone?
Listen really clear.
You understand me?
I swear to God, if you touched her,
I will kill you.
I broke the monitor.
The police are going to come.
Any minute...
She called, all right?
She called.
She said she was here.
Are you sure about that?
Maybe you should call her.
Just to check.
(phone speed dialing)
Bones.
Bones!
Are you there?
Where are you?
Are you at home?
Did you call me?
I'll see you at home.
(phone beeps off)
Yeah, you son of a...
What in God's name did you hope to accomplish?
I told you, I got a call from Bones, saying that Pelant had her.
There's no record of you receiving such a call.
Of course there's not.
All right?
He got me.
So you're saying
Pelant made this happen.
Yes, Pelant made it all happen.
He's must've gotten Bones's voice from a bunch of cell phone calls, and just mashed them together.
It gets worse.
Okay.
What's worse than nothing?
Pelant's lawyer found out what you did, and went straight to the parole board, claiming harassment.
Flynn...
All right.
They let him go?
Yes.
And they got you removed from the case.
And got Dr. Brennan removed from the case.
Right.
So Pelant got exactly what he wanted.
There is no one left to take him down.
No offense, Flynn.
I don't want to take over your case, Seeley.
It wasn't my idea.
You want to work a desk with pay, or go home on full suspension?
BOOTH:
I'll go home.
What?
Pelant is out in the world, okay?
What if he shows up at my house?
Then you shoot him through the eyeball.
Yeah, that reminds me-
- I gotta take your gun and badge.
CAROLINE:
Rules is rules, cher.
There's nothing I can do.
You run this down the way you see fit, Flynn.
Oh, one last thing-- a little advice.
With a guy like Pelant, nothing is the way it seems.
Great.
I'll remember that.
So this is the last thing that Brennan looked at before she was removed from the case.
All the victim's wounds?
Yes.
Can you remove the damage done by the wolves?
MONTENEGRO:
Sure.
That's weird.
There's a pattern.
Does it mean anything?
MONTENEGRO:
Well, if Pelant did this, then it could be one of his weird codes.
Like, introducing a virus into the program?
You think so?
It's what he does-- turn it off.
No, wait, no, I know this pattern.
This has nothing to do with computer viruses.
Superimpose the arterial system.
Remove the veins.
Can you enlarge the areas where the nicks were found?
BRAY:
Whoa.
All those marks cross minor arteries.
Pelant cut them.
The wolves were drawn by the scent of blood.
This proves murder, right?
I mean this guy just didn't wander into the woods and drink some poison and wait to be eaten by wolves.
They certainly weren't self-inflicted.
BRAY:
Dr. Saroyan!
What are you going to do?
I am going to report this to Special Agent Flynn.
Cam, they're gonna think that Brennan did this.
Because Pelant has no background or training in anatomy or the circulatory system.
I know.
Do you have to?
Yes, it is my job.
So, what?
So Pelant wins.
Yes.
Today, Pelant wins.
BRENNAN:
I thought Cam told you not to contact me.
I don't care much about what Cam says these days, okay?
Listen, I'm looking into the e-mail exchange between you and Ethan to see how Pelant accessed them.
How?
You said they were all encrypted.
Yeah, I don't know.
That's why I'm looking into every computer trail that leads back to Pelant.
Thanks, Angela.
Yeah.
I'm just being selfish.
If you go to jail, I don't have anybody to go to baby group with.
Now, I need all the passwords that you've used within the past year.
Your profile says the killer is hyper-rational, deliberate and exacting.
That's correct.
When I read Pelant's transcript...
Would you describe Dr. Brennan as hyper-rational, deliberate and exacting?
My profile fits Pelant.
Yeah, I understand that's what you'd like, but please answer the question.
You have to answer, cher.
That description could be applied to Dr. Brennan.
Thank you.
In certain situations.
You also posit that the killer had a compromised childhood because of abandonment.
Yes.
Pelant's parents divorced when he was young.
He was close with his father, which he rarely saw after--
Wasn't Dr. Brennan actually abandoned by her father?
It's not that simple.
He returned...
18 years later.
The other psychologist who reviewed your report said that would actually be worse.
Look...
I know Dr. Brennan.
She's a good person.
She's compassionate and empathetic, and a wonderful mother.
And how far would that wonderful, hyper-rational mother go to protect her child, Dr. Sweets?
No, I know her.
She didn't kill him.
The Bureau will be using an outside consultant for all future profiling on this case.
I'm sure you understand.
So I'm off the case.
Come on, you gotta be kidding me.
Can't Caroline appeal this?
I mean, come on...
Sweets, you of all people, know more about this case than anyone.
Okay, great.
So Sweets just got kicked off the case.
Agent Flynn accused him of being too close to you.
That seems like a reasonable decision from that perspective.
Can we stop being so reasonable, please?
MONTENEGRO:
Hey, hey...
I think I got something here.
Look at this.
What is it?
I hacked into his credit card bill, his phone bill and his library card.
Okay, you're hacking the hacker?
Yeah... there's something kind of poetic about it, right?
So, according to his library records,
Pelant reads a lot.
That makes sense.
He was confined, and the library delivers to shut-ins.
No, I mean he reads a lot a lot.
They delivered and picked up over 80 books within the past three months.
Wow!
No one reads that much.
I do.
Well, no one is you, Bones.
Okay, do me a favor.
Pull up his cable bill.
I want to see how many pay- per-view movies he's ordered.
MONTENEGRO:
Wow.
A lot.
Even you couldn't watch all these movies, and read all those books, sweetie.
We have to get the books that were delivered.
(doorbell rings)
Pack that up.
Just get over there.
Sorry for the interruption.
I have a warrant to search Dr. Brennan's home and vehicle.
Hah!
Course you do.
Right.
Oh!
Uh, not so fast.
This is "914." We're 941.
This warrant's not for us.
It's a technicality.
Well, courts, they operate on technicalities.
Come on, Flynn.
You know that.
I mean... (chuckles)
You find something, which you won't, it won't be admissible.
I can be back in two hours with another warrant for the house but her Prius is parked on the street, and the license plate matches the one on the warrant.
Give me the keys.
Um...
We lost them.
We'll tow it.
Fine.
Knock yourself out.
And I mean that.
Thanks for stopping by...
Flynn.
Pack up all the stuff that we have on Pelant.
Angela, get to the library, okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Get to the library, check out all the books that he checked out.
There's got to be a reason why he picked out those books.
HODGINS:
Hey, so, I found these...
What is wrong?
Are you okay?
Well... (clears throat) the FBI sent over hair samples from
Dr. Brennan's trunk.
(heavy sigh) God...
I looked at it a hundred times.
I want a different result but it...
It's a match for the victim.
The hair belongs to Ethan Sawyer.
Cam...
Wha...
What are you gonna do?
Well, I'm gonna get myself together and I'm gonna do the right thing.
Which is...?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry but either you believe in the system, or you don't.
And I do.
I'm not supposed to be here.
(groans) This doesn't sound good.
It's not good, cher.
There's too much evidence piling up.
Oh, come on.
You know she didn't do it.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have put that wrong address on the search warrant.
I don't know what you're talking about, cher.
She doesn't have a choice, Booth.
It doesn't matter what she believes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure this will work out, but for now,
I've got to get an arrest warrant.
This is a nightmare.
It'll take me a few hours, if I drag my heels right, so you'll have time to get your affairs in order and say good-bye.
Thank you.
Now you're thanking her?
(Christine crying) Baby's crying.
You don't think I wouldn't give anything to have this turn out differently?
I'll call when I get the warrant, so Dr. Brennan can turn herself in.
It'll go better that way.
Cher, I'm sorry.
Hey.
Anything?
Hey.
Uh...
Look, I know you're trying to be helpful and concerned but...
No, I'm not trying to be helpful and concerned.
I just want to know how Pelant communicates with Skynet before he comes after me.
It's got something to do with these books.
Well...
Angie, some of these aren't even in English.
I know.
I-I'm trying to search for some kind of pattern-- titles, publication dates, subjects, binding methods--
Nobody's gonna believe Brennan but us.
When we stop looking, it's over.
I know.
Hey, what if you arranged the titles in the order in which he checked them out.
Angie, then you can...
You-You did that already.
Of course.
I love you.
I love you.
Hey, you two.
Dad.
We're both home today.
You don't have to watch Christine.
I'm not here about Christine.
How much time does Tempe have?
Before they arrest her?
No, before her first gray hair.
Come on, we gotta figure out what our moves are.
Caroline says that I should turn myself in before the arrest warrant can be executed.
You gotta make a run for it, honey-- now.
Slow down, Max.
You been thinking about this for days!
What, me being a fugitive?
Look, I have been thinking about it, all right?
Only problem is, that's gonna make us look more guilty.
You want to work inside the system.
I am the system, Max.
No, computers are the system.
And this son of a bitch runs computers.
And the minute they have Tempe in custody, she is part of the system.
Your only chance is to get off the grid!
Honey...
Honey, think about it logically, okay?
The minute he has you, he will never let you go.
Look what he did to that crazy smart friend of yours.
We will be fine, Max.
No, you won't.
You two don't understand what happens when the system turns on you.
I do.
You okay?
We should have Christine christened before I'm arrested.
We?
You mean... both of us.
You're gonna come?
Yes.
What?
What's going on?
Ethan was tracking Pelant's thought process mathematically.
Ethan was trying to send me a mathematical message.
You see, he inscribed it with a quotation from Alexander Pope.
"Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night.
God said, 'Let Newton be,' and all was light."
So, what, that's the message?
Definitely.
Okay, what-- about math and light?
Can we get into Ethan's room at the Psychiatric Institute?
No, we can't.
(sighs) No, but Hodges can.
(sighs) What are we looking for?
Brennan said it would have to be a message written within a triangle.
Something about Newton.
The first thing we do is we find three things that form a triangle.
Well, three things always form a triangle.
You, me, the desk-- that's a triangle.
Brennan seems pretty certain that there is a message here.
Ethan Sawyer was hallucinating.
He could have left it in the air.
Yeah, well, the pencil would have to be imaginary, too.
Patients aren't allowed anything sharper than their fingers.
Wait.
Uh, hand me the ALS.
Come on.
Come on.
Found something.
(gasps)
Oh, that is so creepy.
He left a message in his own saliva.
Saliva.
Oh, good choice.
Smart.
BRENNAN:
Is it computer code?
I have no idea.
I've never seen symbols like it before.
Ethan must have invented it himself.
Well, yeah.
Well, then, what good is it?
And what good are all the library books?
I've learned that sometimes you have to step back and see the big picture.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm not seeing the big picture here.
In fact, I'm not seeing any picture, actually.
The answer is in that code.
Knowing Ethan, it's computer code.
Wait.
Where do books and computers cross?
Uh, I have to go.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Angela?
I just want to say... thank you for believing in me.
You don't have to thank somebody who loves you for believing in you, honey.
I love you, too.
All right.
Take a minute.
Forget about everything except Booth and Christine.
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah.

Hey.
Listen.
I think I know how he did it.
How who did what?
Pelant.
He-he used library books to insert mini-programs-- really viruses.
How?
The library has a centralized materials automated handling system.
Each book is independently coded, and Pelant just substituted his own code.
The library scans the book, and it uploads the code to the Internet?
Yeah.
You think this is enough to keep Brennan from being arrested?
A theory?
No.
And also,
I couldn't help if I wanted.
I'm off the case, too.
Unless you can prove
Pelant used his library books to transfer money from Dr. Brennan's account into mine.
Oh, my God.
I hope Cam is happy.
If she had just kept things to herself, we wouldn't be in this position.
Angela, you listen to me on this subject.
All of us did what Pelant expected, except for Cam.
Because of her, you squints are all still in this, which Pelant fears above all else.
As long as the Jeffersonian stays in the game, the good guys live to fight another day.
My opinion, Cam Saroyan is the hero of this story so far.
You hear what I'm saying, cher?
Yeah.
(sighs)
Okay.
Tell you what, I'll go get the car, all right?
Okay.
Booth?
Yeah.
What is it?
I love you, Booth.
I don't want you to think that Christine is the only reason we're together.
It's going to be okay.
All right?
All right.
I'll be right back.
I'll go get the car.
All right?
Be right back.
(Christine cooing)
(whistles) Hey.
Come on, let's go.
We gotta go.
Perfect.
Now, drive as far as you can without getting exhausted.
Don't stop at any chain restaurants or motels.
You already told me this.
Pay cash.
You took all my credit cards already.
Well, I'll get you some fake I.D.'s-- hey, I'm right about this.
Trust me.
Now, wait for me where we said.
If I... if I'm not there...
Three days later, the next place.

Okay, get in, get in.
Let's go.
Go.

MAX:
It's the way it had to go.
What the...?
Where are they going?
Well, if you know, you'd be an accomplice.
Accomplice?
That's my family, you understand?
I should be with them.
You want to hit me.
I know, I know.
I understand.
Go ahead.
I know how to be a fugitive a lot better than you.
What am I supposed to do?
You stay in the system.
You stay alive.
I'll make sure Tempe stays out of the system.
I'm going to get my family back.
You tell Bones that.
Then you get that bastard.
You'll bring your family home.
I'll keep her safe.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Ms. Julian, sit!
You'll have your time.
I just can't believe you're even considering removing this man's ankle monitor!
That's our job.
Your job is to protect people from this psychopath.
Are you going to allow her to talk to him like that?
Both of you, shut up!
And, Ms. Julian, if you don't sit right now, I will toss you out of here.
You can finish,
Mr. Pelant.
Thank you.
I suppose I deserve whatever happens here today.
What I thought was a prank at the time turned out to be destructive to our government and a danger to the public.
I know now that computer hacking is a serious crime...
Actually sounds like he means it.
That's what I'm afraid of.
It says McCann Academy is willing to hire Mr. Pelant as a tutor and teaching assistant?
That's correct.
And they know about Mr. Pelant's criminal record?
They've seen everything.
They even read the transcripts of my trial.
I insisted on it.
I didn't want there to be any surprises.
I can assure you, I'm not the same person I was then.
He's right.
He's not a hacker anymore;
now he's a murderer.
Ms. Grover, this is outrageous.
What are you talking about, Ms. Julian?
I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Mr. Pelant is a person of interest in two active murder investigations.
They have no proof.
This isn't a court of law.
We don't need proof.
That's why I like it.
But we have been compiling information.
The FBI has harassed my client all year.
I'm monitored 24 hours a day.
They know I never leave my house.
That ankle thing there says that you're home, but I don't believe it, pal.
Here's what we've compiled so far.
There are preliminary lab reports, as well as complex computer code written on remains.
If you want to free him after reading this, be my guest.
You can't keep him tethered to that ankle monitor just because they are on a fishing expedition.
Public safety is the parole board's number one consideration.
Mr. Pelant, we're going to deny your application until we analyze these files.
He has been a model prisoner.
It's okay.
I want them to feel secure.
Ain't that sweet?
What's that?
Someone changed my ringtone.
Whoa.
Mine, too.
A couple on an ATV found the remains.
What were they doing here?
Got lost.
Their GPS sent them east instead of west, and this is where they wound up.
I've never heard of a GPS reversing direction.
What is it?
Father Keyes.
We're all set for Christine's baptism on the 19th.
You're still okay if I do that?
Absolutely.
Sprinkling water on her forehead seems like an excellent way to counteract the sins she apparently committed prior to birth.
I take it you're still not going to the baptism?
Look, you know, we're at a murder scene here, not a religious debate, right?
Hey.
Welcome to the Hamilton National Wildlife Refuge.
Oh, it's not so refuge-y for this guy, is it?
Not much tissue left.
Eaten.
Victim is male.
No billows on the auricular surface, so age is late 30s.
Medial epicondyle appears to have been fractured.
Remodeling indicates that it happened about eight years ago.
Why does that matter?
It doesn't.
It's just...
it's a unique break.
Piophilidae eggs puts time of death at two days max.
Pio who?
All the internal organs are gone.
This was like Thanksgiving dinner for the animals out here.
Based on dentition and the species in the area, it was a... it was a pack of wolves.
Wolves?
Yes.
The break is 28 millimeters long, transecting the medial epicondyle and the trochlea.
Clothing remnant looks like polyester, and the waistband's elastic.
They're scrubs.
Scrubs, great.
So the victim was a doctor, right?
Yes, and a patient.
How do you know?
I set this break.
I know this man.
He's Ethan Sawyer.
Pelant...
Pelant killed my friend.

♪
The victim, Dr. Ethan Sawyer, was eaten by wolves?
Right.
The same Dr. Ethan Sawyer who was a delusional schizophrenic locked up in a high-security ward in a mental hospital?
Oh, come on, Sweets.
Obviously, he escaped.
Booth, has the victim been officially confirmed as Ethan Sawyer?
No, but Sawyer-- he goes missing from the loony bin, right?
And, so, you know, hey, Bones recognizes his broken elbow.
How'd she do that?
Well, because, you know, she's the one who set it.
They went to grad school together, they were friends, and, you know, he fell off a chairlift, and she's the one who set the bone.
What's the matter with you?
You're jumping to the conclusion that Pelant is involved.
I am not-- Look, he is involved.
Is this a hunch?
No.
He switched our ring tones to wolves.
The victim was eaten by wolves.
Ring tones won't hold up in court.
Tell you what, when you're ready to help, you come and find me, all right?
Until then, take a hike.
I am helping, Booth.
This is how I help.
To keep things in perspective, okay?
So how can I help?
Profile the killer, and match it to Pelant.
You're asking me to frame somebody, so, no, but what I can do is put together an objective profile.
If it matches Pelant, it matches.
It'll match;
Pelant did it.
These marks on the zygomatic are from teeth.
Two canines, their supporting third incisors, and this faint mark here is from a premolar.
Wolves?
Yes.
The pattern of tissue removal from multiple sites is consistent with simultaneous feeding.
How many animals?
Five or six.
They ingested approximately 70 pounds of soft tissue.
Dr. Brennan knew this guy?
Since grad school.
Guy was brilliant.
Specialized in artificial intelligence.
He modeled human behaviors mathematically.
No wonder he went crazy.
You can't really turn people into equations.
Oh.
What did I miss?
Yes, Cam?
There's hemorrhagic staining around approximately 50% of the bite marks.
Okay, what's that mean?
It means that Ethan was still alive when the wolves started to eat him.
You know what?
Wolves don't do that.
So it wasn't wolves?
More likely,
Ethan only appeared to be dead.
Paralyzed, you mean?
Nothing showed up on the initial tox screen.
We'll take another look.
Thanks, Cam.
You okay?
I have something
I have to tell you.
What do you mean?
Worse than being eaten alive?
I was conferring with Ethan on the Pelant case.
What do you-- in secret?
Yes.
Why?
Pelant is a mathematical genius, but Ethan was smarter.
You think that
Pelant killed Ethan because Ethan was helping you do math?
A normal person like you wouldn't understand how dangerous Ethan was to Pelant.
Yeah, I get it.
It takes a genius to know a genius.
But do you have any idea,
Bones, what a defense lawyer would do with the knowledge of you consulting with a paranoid schizophrenic?
It would be very bad for us.
Yeah.
Should we tell Caroline?
If we find Pelant had means and opportunity, then, you know, we'll tell Caroline about the motive.
Sometimes you got to work a little outside the system, Bones.
For a greater good.
I know, Booth.
That's why I didn't tell you about Ethan.
Right.
You have to let me go.
I have to take care of it.
Do you mean the baby?
It's a demon that looks like a baby, and it's hampering very important work.
I have to dispatch the demon!
Are you saying you have to kill it?
Yes!
Do you see any other way?
Poor Ethan.
Poor Ethan?
He was talking about our daughter.
Uh, please, we should talk out here.
Okay, Bones, let me get this straight.
Did he threaten her in front of you?
No.
Not directly.
I know he thought she was a threat, but...
And you don't think you should've told me that?
Ethan was confined to a secure facility.
I'm sorry, I didn't think it was necessary.
You said he escaped before.
Yes.
About a year ago.
But that's why he was moved to lockdown.
And this time, before he disappeared, let me guess, there was some sort of a computer glitch?
Yes.
Dr. Sawyer was accidentally transferred to an open ward.
- How did you know that?
- Open ward?
Meaning Ethan could have simply walked away?
That's correct.
Minimal supervision.
So you're absolutely positive he had no visitors?
None.
Absolutely.
Okay, when was the last time you visited him?
Two weeks ago.
He gave me an old mathematics book as a gift.
Visitors have to sign in, so it'll be in the records.
Great.
We're gonna need all the logs and security footage of the entrances and exits of this institution.
You got it.
Hey.
You find anything inconsistent with wolf attack?
No.
Yeah.
All the DNA I've found is lupine in nature.
Wolves killed him, but they didn't murder him.
Right.
So, Pelant fools his ankle monitor into thinking that he's at home, he lures our victim out of the loony bin, drugs him, and then leaves him for the wolves.
One thing I learned from Dr. Brennan:
gather evidence and follow it without bias.
That's right.
Yeah, yeah.
Pelant made a mistake, we're gonna find it.
He's not God.
Oh, crap.
Hey.
You need to stop what you're doing and come look at this.
Is something wrong, Angela?
So I scanned through the security footage from the loony bin, and...
That's the front door of the psychiatric facility where Ethan escaped from.
That's me.
I'm carrying the book that he gave me.
Yeah.
This-this is, this is time-stamped the night before Ethan Sawyer disappeared.
No, that's incorrect.
This footage was taken two weeks before that.
Which is when he gave me the book.
Sweetie, this-this is time-stamped.
Pelant must have hacked into the institute's security system.
I don't know how he could've altered this footage.
Look, I'm gonna break this thing down to the pixels to figure it out.
But, in the meantime, you're gonna need an alibi for this night.
I don't have one.
Yeah, you do.
You were at the Founding Fathers drinking a Bitter Canadian with me.
We were talking about Christine's christening.
You're trying to help me.
Yeah.
I mean, you wouldn't kill anybody.
I believe under certain circumstances
I most certainly would kill.
Like someone thinking your daughter is a demon, and threatening to kill her?
Oh, my God.
This is bad.
This is very bad.
I wasn't there, Booth.
Security footage says 7:14.
Right?
That's four hours unaccounted for before you got home.
That's plenty of time to abduct and murder Ethan, and then make it back before 11:00.
Don't say it like that.
Like what?
Like it's not you that we're talking about.
I didn't do it, Booth.
That doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter, Bones.
You're on that video.
I'll be fine, Booth...
Christine is asleep.
Angela will be able to tell that the video has been altered.
Hey, is everything okay?
Which is what she hasn't done so far.
And since Ethan threatened Christine, that gives you motive and opportunity, okay?
Can you ignore evidence like that?
'Cause I sure as hell can't.
This-this guy, Pelant, he's framing you.
It would seem so.
Yes.
He is.
All the evidence is now pointing to her as the killer.
Weren't you getting close to nailing this guy?
Yes, and Ethan was helping.
Yeah.
Ethan was helping.
Look what happened to him.
Honey, you need a plan.
We can handle this, Max.
Well, you haven't so far.
Everyone at the Jeffersonian is working on this, Dad.
We will find evidence that links all of this to Pelant.
Right, and if you don't?
Max.
Please.
Thank you so much for putting Christine to bed.
We really appreciate that, all right?
But we can handle this.
Sure, sure.
Listen...
I'm sorry, I...
If you need anything, baby...
Looks like some kind of puncture.
Dr. Brennan didn't see this when she went over the X-rays?
No.
I was surprised, too.
It's pretty obvious when you compare the films to the actual bone.
Maybe she thought it was another bite mark from the wolves.
No, look at the enlarged image.
I think it's the tip of a needle.
I'm sure she thought it was another bite mark.
Can you hand me the rotary saw?
Mosquito forceps.
It's definitely a hypodermic needle.
Could there be trace of the drug inside the tip?
Maybe.
Okay...
Give that to Dr. Hodgins.
I don't think you did it.
You know that, right?
I wouldn't blame you.
It's a reasonable assumption.
Can you stop being like that?
Okay?
It's not reasonable.
Not for me.
Do you want me to come to Christine's christening?
You don't have to worry about that now.
I don't want Pelant to change our lives.
That would be the worst.
Then, you know what?
Let's not change.
Look, you don't have to come.
Religion's my thing.
You're really okay with that?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I appreciate you asking.
You know, let's just not change our lives for this guy.
All right?
Look, I love you the way you are, Bones.
Okay?

Dr. Brennan!
You're here early.
I'm...
I missed the needle puncture to the C7.
I don't want to miss anything else.
It's not like you.
Why do you think you missed it?
I don't know.
Perhaps because the victim was someone
I cared very much about.
Why do you think I missed it?
Not because you're the murderer.
I don't think that.
I really don't.
Everyone should be able to make mistakes, even you.
Should we?
There's a faint cut mark here.
About a centimeter long.
It's perfectly straight, no irregularities.
I missed that.
Perhaps you're the murderer.
There's another one to the humerus.
These were not caused by wolves.
Which means they were caused by the killer, right?
Why make cuts if you know that wolves will be eating him?
Would you like me to see if there are other similar cuts?
No.
I can do it.
Thank you.
There was a trace in the tip of the hypodermic:
D-tubocurarine.
It's a neuromuscular blocking agent better know are curare.
It was used in anesthesia in the '40s.
It leaves the system quickly, which is why it didn't show up on the tox screen.
Okay.
Well, where would somebody get their hands on that now?
They would have to distill it themselves.
From what?
Chondrodendron tomentosum.
Is it easy to get a hold of?
Not really.
I mean, I had two of them, but...
Two weeks ago, Dr. Brennan asked me if she could have one.
What?
She said she was studying some-some tribe in western Colombia that used it to poison the tips of their arrows.
Look, I-I know we don't want to go there, but...
Stop.
Brennan didn't do this.
Yeah, I've studied Dr. Brennan for years.
Her cold and logical demeanor is a carefully constructed facade designed to protect a very sensitive psyche.
Someone threatened her kid.
We can't just ignore that.
Why are you even bringing that up?
Dr. Brennan trained him that way.
Don't be subjective, don't make assumptions, question everything.
We do have to be objective, Angela.
And thorough, and we have to do everything by the book, because if Dr. Brennan does end up being a suspect, our work has to be above reproach.
It was Pelant.
That doesn't mean we stop doing our job, Angie.
Seriously?
This is crazy.
We all know it was Pelant!
Booth!
Booth.
Whoa, slow down.
Hey, hey.
You gotta do something.
Slow down.
What?
Why are you here?
The evidence is piling up against Brennan.
She's on the video, and-and he threatened her kid, and the poison is from a plant that she borrowed from Hodgins.
She didn't do it!
I know, but... the evidence is going another way.
I'm the one who decides where the evidence goes and when.
Look, what we need to figure out is how to counteract the evidence against the evidence.
Meaning what?
We gotta find a way to prove that Pelant put Brennan on that video.
All right.
I'll do that.
Booth.
He's got me, Booth.
Pelant!
Where?
At his place.
He didn't see my phone.
I'm locked in the...
Bones?
Bones?
What...?
Hey, hey.
What is it?
Don't worry about it.
Just get back and do your job!
Hey, you can't come in here.
Where the hell is she?
Aah!
Ow!
Who?
Who?
Brennan.
Brennan.
Where is she?
She called me.
Where is she?
I don't know!
Bones!
Where are you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I swear, I don't know!
Bones, where are you?
I swear, there's no one here.
Where is she?
She's not here.
Where is she?
I'm alone!
Are you always alone?
Always alone.
Ow!
I'm always alone!
You're always alone?
Listen really clear.
You understand me?
I swear to God, if you touched her,
I will kill you.
I broke the monitor.
The police are going to come.
Any minute...
She called, all right?
She called.
She said she was here.
Are you sure about that?
Maybe you should call her.
Just to check.
Bones.
Bones!
Are you there?
Where are you?
Are you at home?
Did you call me?
I'll see you at home.
Yeah, you son of a...
What in God's name did you hope to accomplish?
I told you, I got a call from Bones, saying that Pelant had her.
There's no record of you receiving such a call.
Of course there's not.
All right?
He got me.
So you're saying
Pelant made this happen.
Yes, Pelant made it all happen.
He's must've gotten Bones's voice from a bunch of cell phone calls, and just mashed them together.
It gets worse.
Okay.
What's worse than nothing?
Pelant's lawyer found out what you did, and went straight to the parole board, claiming harassment.
Flynn...
All right.
They let him go?
Yes.
And they got you removed from the case.
And got Dr. Brennan removed from the case.
Right.
So Pelant got exactly what he wanted.
There is no one left to take him down.
No offense, Flynn.
I don't want to take over your case, Seeley.
It wasn't my idea.
You want to work a desk with pay, or go home on full suspension?
I'll go home.
What?
Pelant is out in the world, okay?
What if he shows up at my house?
Then you shoot him through the eyeball.
Yeah, that reminds me-
- I gotta take your gun and badge.
Rules is rules, cher.
There's nothing I can do.
You run this down the way you see fit, Flynn.
Oh, one last thing-- a little advice.
With a guy like Pelant, nothing is the way it seems.
Great.
I'll remember that.
So this is the last thing that Brennan looked at before she was removed from the case.
All the victim's wounds?
Yes.
Can you remove the damage done by the wolves?
Sure.
That's weird.
There's a pattern.
Does it mean anything?
Well, if Pelant did this, then it could be one of his weird codes.
Like, introducing a virus into the program?
You think so?
It's what he does-- turn it off.
No, wait, no, I know this pattern.
This has nothing to do with computer viruses.
Superimpose the arterial system.
Remove the veins.
Can you enlarge the areas where the nicks were found?
Whoa.
All those marks cross minor arteries.
Pelant cut them.
The wolves were drawn by the scent of blood.
This proves murder, right?
I mean this guy just didn't wander into the woods and drink some poison and wait to be eaten by wolves.
They certainly weren't self-inflicted.
Dr. Saroyan!
What are you going to do?
I am going to report this to Special Agent Flynn.
Cam, they're gonna think that Brennan did this.
Because Pelant has no background or training in anatomy or the circulatory system.
I know.
Do you have to?
Yes, it is my job.
So, what?
So Pelant wins.
Yes.
Today, Pelant wins.
I thought Cam told you not to contact me.
I don't care much about what Cam says these days, okay?
Listen, I'm looking into the e-mail exchange between you and Ethan to see how Pelant accessed them.
How?
You said they were all encrypted.
Yeah, I don't know.
That's why I'm looking into every computer trail that leads back to Pelant.
Thanks, Angela.
Yeah.
I'm just being selfish.
If you go to jail, I don't have anybody to go to baby group with.
Now, I need all the passwords that you've used within the past year.
Your profile says the killer is hyper-rational, deliberate and exacting.
That's correct.
When I read Pelant's transcript...
Would you describe Dr. Brennan as hyper-rational, deliberate and exacting?
My profile fits Pelant.
Yeah, I understand that's what you'd like, but please answer the question.
You have to answer, cher.
That description could be applied to Dr. Brennan.
Thank you.
In certain situations.
You also posit that the killer had a compromised childhood because of abandonment.
Yes.
Pelant's parents divorced when he was young.
He was close with his father, which he rarely saw after--
Wasn't Dr. Brennan actually abandoned by her father?
It's not that simple.
He returned...
18 years later.
The other psychologist who reviewed your report said that would actually be worse.
Look...
I know Dr. Brennan.
She's a good person.
She's compassionate and empathetic, and a wonderful mother.
And how far would that wonderful, hyper-rational mother go to protect her child, Dr. Sweets?
No, I know her.
She didn't kill him.
The Bureau will be using an outside consultant for all future profiling on this case.
I'm sure you understand.
So I'm off the case.
Come on, you gotta be kidding me.
Can't Caroline appeal this?
I mean, come on...
Sweets, you of all people, know more about this case than anyone.
Okay, great.
So Sweets just got kicked off the case.
Agent Flynn accused him of being too close to you.
That seems like a reasonable decision from that perspective.
Can we stop being so reasonable, please?
Hey, hey...
I think I got something here.
Look at this.
What is it?
I hacked into his credit card bill, his phone bill and his library card.
Okay, you're hacking the hacker?
Yeah... there's something kind of poetic about it, right?
So, according to his library records,
Pelant reads a lot.
That makes sense.
He was confined, and the library delivers to shut-ins.
No, I mean he reads a lot a lot.
They delivered and picked up over 80 books within the past three months.
Wow!
No one reads that much.
I do.
Well, no one is you, Bones.
Okay, do me a favor.
Pull up his cable bill.
I want to see how many pay- per-view movies he's ordered.
Wow.
A lot.
Even you couldn't watch all these movies, and read all those books, sweetie.
We have to get the books that were delivered.
Pack that up.
Just get over there.
Sorry for the interruption.
I have a warrant to search Dr. Brennan's home and vehicle.
Hah!
Course you do.
Right.
Oh!
Uh, not so fast.
This is "914." We're 941.
This warrant's not for us.
It's a technicality.
Well, courts, they operate on technicalities.
Come on, Flynn.
You know that.
I mean...
You find something, which you won't, it won't be admissible.
I can be back in two hours with another warrant for the house but her Prius is parked on the street, and the license plate matches the one on the warrant.
Give me the keys.
Um...
We lost them.
We'll tow it.
Fine.
Knock yourself out.
And I mean that.
Thanks for stopping by...
Flynn.
Pack up all the stuff that we have on Pelant.
Angela, get to the library, okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Get to the library, check out all the books that he checked out.
There's got to be a reason why he picked out those books.
Hey, so, I found these...
What is wrong?
Are you okay?
Well...
the FBI sent over hair samples from
Dr. Brennan's trunk.
God...
I looked at it a hundred times.
I want a different result but it...
It's a match for the victim.
The hair belongs to Ethan Sawyer.
Cam...
Wha...
What are you gonna do?
Well, I'm gonna get myself together and I'm gonna do the right thing.
Which is...?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry but either you believe in the system, or you don't.
And I do.
I'm not supposed to be here.
This doesn't sound good.
It's not good, cher.
There's too much evidence piling up.
Oh, come on.
You know she didn't do it.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have put that wrong address on the search warrant.
I don't know what you're talking about, cher.
She doesn't have a choice, Booth.
It doesn't matter what she believes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure this will work out, but for now,
I've got to get an arrest warrant.
This is a nightmare.
It'll take me a few hours, if I drag my heels right, so you'll have time to get your affairs in order and say good-bye.
Thank you.
Now you're thanking her?
Baby's crying.
You don't think I wouldn't give anything to have this turn out differently?
I'll call when I get the warrant, so Dr. Brennan can turn herself in.
It'll go better that way.
Cher, I'm sorry.
Hey.
Anything?
Hey.
Uh...
Look, I know you're trying to be helpful and concerned but...
No, I'm not trying to be helpful and concerned.
I just want to know how Pelant communicates with Skynet before he comes after me.
It's got something to do with these books.
Well...
Angie, some of these aren't even in English.
I know.
I-I'm trying to search for some kind of pattern-- titles, publication dates, subjects, binding methods--
Nobody's gonna believe Brennan but us.
When we stop looking, it's over.
I know.
Hey, what if you arranged the titles in the order in which he checked them out.
Angie, then you can...
You-You did that already.
Of course.
I love you.
I love you.
Hey, you two.
Dad.
We're both home today.
You don't have to watch Christine.
I'm not here about Christine.
How much time does Tempe have?
Before they arrest her?
No, before her first gray hair.
Come on, we gotta figure out what our moves are.
Caroline says that I should turn myself in before the arrest warrant can be executed.
You gotta make a run for it, honey-- now.
Slow down, Max.
You been thinking about this for days!
What, me being a fugitive?
Look, I have been thinking about it, all right?
Only problem is, that's gonna make us look more guilty.
You want to work inside the system.
I am the system, Max.
No, computers are the system.
And this son of a bitch runs computers.
And the minute they have Tempe in custody, she is part of the system.
Your only chance is to get off the grid!
Honey...
Honey, think about it logically, okay?
The minute he has you, he will never let you go.
Look what he did to that crazy smart friend of yours.
We will be fine, Max.
No, you won't.
You two don't understand what happens when the system turns on you.
I do.
You okay?
We should have Christine christened before I'm arrested.
We?
You mean... both of us.
You're gonna come?
Yes.
What?
What's going on?
Ethan was tracking Pelant's thought process mathematically.
Ethan was trying to send me a mathematical message.
You see, he inscribed it with a quotation from Alexander Pope.
"Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night.
God said, 'Let Newton be,' and all was light."
So, what, that's the message?
Definitely.
Okay, what-- about math and light?
Can we get into Ethan's room at the Psychiatric Institute?
No, we can't.
No, but Hodges can.
What are we looking for?
Brennan said it would have to be a message written within a triangle.
Something about Newton.
The first thing we do is we find three things that form a triangle.
Well, three things always form a triangle.
You, me, the desk-- that's a triangle.
Brennan seems pretty certain that there is a message here.
Ethan Sawyer was hallucinating.
He could have left it in the air.
Yeah, well, the pencil would have to be imaginary, too.
Patients aren't allowed anything sharper than their fingers.
Wait.
Uh, hand me the ALS.
Come on.
Come on.
Found something.
Oh, that is so creepy.
He left a message in his own saliva.
Saliva.
Oh, good choice.
Smart.
Is it computer code?
I have no idea.
I've never seen symbols like it before.
Ethan must have invented it himself.
Well, yeah.
Well, then, what good is it?
And what good are all the library books?
I've learned that sometimes you have to step back and see the big picture.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm not seeing the big picture here.
In fact, I'm not seeing any picture, actually.
The answer is in that code.
Knowing Ethan, it's computer code.
Wait.
Where do books and computers cross?
Uh, I have to go.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Angela?
I just want to say... thank you for believing in me.
You don't have to thank somebody who loves you for believing in you, honey.
I love you, too.
All right.
Take a minute.
Forget about everything except Booth and Christine.
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah.

Hey.
Listen.
I think I know how he did it.
How who did what?
Pelant.
He-he used library books to insert mini-programs-- really viruses.
How?
The library has a centralized materials automated handling system.
Each book is independently coded, and Pelant just substituted his own code.
The library scans the book, and it uploads the code to the Internet?
Yeah.
You think this is enough to keep Brennan from being arrested?
A theory?
No.
And also,
I couldn't help if I wanted.
I'm off the case, too.
Unless you can prove
Pelant used his library books to transfer money from Dr. Brennan's account into mine.
Oh, my God.
I hope Cam is happy.
If she had just kept things to herself, we wouldn't be in this position.
Angela, you listen to me on this subject.
All of us did what Pelant expected, except for Cam.
Because of her, you squints are all still in this, which Pelant fears above all else.
As long as the Jeffersonian stays in the game, the good guys live to fight another day.
My opinion, Cam Saroyan is the hero of this story so far.
You hear what I'm saying, cher?
Yeah.
Okay.
Tell you what, I'll go get the car, all right?
Okay.
Booth?
Yeah.
What is it?
I love you, Booth.
I don't want you to think that Christine is the only reason we're together.
It's going to be okay.
All right?
All right.
I'll be right back.
I'll go get the car.
All right?
Be right back.
Hey.
Come on, let's go.
We gotta go.
Perfect.
Now, drive as far as you can without getting exhausted.
Don't stop at any chain restaurants or motels.
You already told me this.
Pay cash.
You took all my credit cards already.
Well, I'll get you some fake I.D.'s-- hey, I'm right about this.
Trust me.
Now, wait for me where we said.
If I... if I'm not there...
Three days later, the next place.
I remember.
Okay, get in, get in.
Let's go.
Go.
Go.
Thanks, Dad.
Bones?
Bones!
Hey!
Bones!
Hey!
Hey!
It's the way it had to go.
What the...?
Where are they going?
Well, if you know, you'd be an accomplice.
Accomplice?
That's my family, you understand?
I should be with them.
You want to hit me.
I know, I know.
I understand.
Go ahead.
I know how to be a fugitive a lot better than you.
What am I supposed to do?
You stay in the system.
You stay alive.
I'll make sure Tempe stays out of the system.
I'm going to get my family back.
You tell Bones that.
Then you get that bastard.
You'll bring your family home.
I'll keep her safe.

Previously on "666 Park Avenue"...
Nice digs.
We have an interview.
Henry Martin, Jane Van Veen.
For the manager position.
Welcome.
Mr. Doran likes to approve every tenant himself.
Obviously, whatever you guys said won him over.
She's how we get Henry.
What happened to the previous manager?
Why would anybody ever want to leave this?
I'm Louise.
I think you met my husband Brian.
Kind of nerdy cute.
Hey, honey, come meet my new assistant.
Brian, this is Alexis.
Can you believe it?
She lives right across the street, actually.
Washer number three is leaking.
Anything else I should know?
Well, there's a thief in the building.
I'll keep an eye out.
I like your necklace.
It's not right what you do.
What I do is fulfill needs.
Oh!
Oh, my God.
Aah!
You signed a binding contract.
Now it's time to settle up.
Aah!

Wait.
I-I don't understand.
Barlow used to live here, now he doesn't.
It's not that complicated.
No, I mean, why didn't he tell me he was moving out?
Well, you've been here, like, a week.
Why would he tell you anything?
Because I'm the new manager.
I'm supposed to get told.
And besides, people don't just up and move like that.
I mean, there's paperwork to fill out, I-I-I think.
Mr. Doran took care of the paperwork.
He and Barlow, they got close after the guy's wife took her high dive off bellevue.
This right here, this is just a... it's a favor for him, all right?
Sure.
Great.
Where's all this being shipped?
Vegas.
Help me, uh, count the boxes.
Sure.
What'd you get?
Uh, 23.
Me, too.
I got a lot of work to do on this place.
Gotta resurface the floors, redo the kitchen...
Install new fixtures, and we should really look at some of those sconces as w... yeah.
Now?
Sconces.
All right.
I'll be down in a minute.
The, uh, party planner and her entourage have arrived.
It's gonna be quite the soiree tonight at the Dorans.
I'm looking forward to it.
Hmm.
Oh, sorry, Tony.
You weren't invited?
Oh, no, actually, I, uh, I got a prior engagement.
Oh.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Of course.
All right.
Take it easy.
Aah!
Aah!
Hey.
Tony, Barlow's apartment, there are birds in the walls.
Uh, it's an old building.
Probably lots of things in the walls.
They flew right out of the wall and broke through a window upstairs.
We gotta call an exterminator.
This is serious.
Yeah, yeah, look, look, I got one elevator down, and it's making my life miserable.
I need it fixed today.
Yeah, yeah, it's the one that almost ate that lady.
Yeah, that one.
All right.
I sent Louise flowers from all of us, by the way.
Of course you did.
This is the exterminator we use.
You're the resident manager, you call.
Thanks, Tony.
I'll take care of it.
You know, Tony, uh, by the way,
I didn't take the job from you, okay?
Mr. Doran hired us.
Oh, I know that, Jane.
Thanks.
Oh, Nona, hey.
What's up?
You mentioned that there's a thief in the building.
I... well, it looks like I'm the latest victim.
Oh, no.
Yeah, uh, my...
my grandmother's necklace.
It's irreplaceable.
I'll keep an eye out.
Thanks.
Hey, Jane.
Don't mess with the birds.
They're part of the Drake.
Hey.
Just talked to the doctor a... here.
What are you doing?
Let me help.
All right.
Let me help.
I'm not an invalid, Brian.
No, but you're still on the mend.
Mending is really boring.
You gotta stop complaining.
You know, the doctor thinks that you only have to be here a few more nights.
What?
That is not a long time for a girl that got crushed by an elevator.
And...
Honestly, babe, uh, a collapsed lung and a concussion are really serious.
So are some of the bills we have.
I can't get out there and land a job until I get out of here.
You still have that one gig.
Actually, they said they weren't gonna hire me again.
That's ridiculous, Lou.
You were in an accident.
Oh, they know.
They sent those.
Look, they're vindictive fashionistas who were inconvenienced.
Yeah, it sucks.
Actually, will you get the nurse?
My Vicodin's wearing off.
Yeah, sure.
I'm back.
Alexis, thank God.
Oh, thank you.
Now this is how you save a life.
How are you?
Uh, I'm fine.
Is that stuff from our apartment?
Almost forgot.
Here you go.
Here's your key.
I'm late.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Whoa.
Wow.
You look stunning.
Hey, thanks for getting the wine.
Of course, of course.
So you wouldn't believe this guy in the wine shop.
He was trying to push an $800 bottle of wine on me.
Have you ever heard of Chateau Monique?
No.
Yeah, well, he couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it either.
But you'll be happy to know,
I held firm on a bottle of Merlot for 20 bucks.
That's what the Dorans use in their salad dressing.
I'm gonna hop in the shower.
I'm funny.
How was your day?
What, you didn't get my text?
The one about you being attacked by birds?
That wasn't an autocorrect mistake?
No.
I got, like, tippi hedren attacked.
They flew right out of the wall of an apartment upstairs.
It was crazy.
And I still can't figure out where they came from.
Did you provoke 'em?
No, I didn't provoke them.
I know how you are, Jane.
Get in the shower.
I love you.
Mwah.
Jane, Henry, there you are.
I'm sorry we're late.
It's my fault.
Oh, Olivia, this is amazing.
Here.
Uh, for you and Gavin.
Oh, how thoughtful.
Help yourself to a drink.
The bar is straight ahead.
Uh, Adriana.
E-excuse me.
I love your dress.
Uh, what do you want to drink?
Uh, something with vodka, please.
Okay.
Uh, Henry, this is Danielle.
She lives in the building.
Hey.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.
The Sushi's excellent, by the way.
Oh, yeah?
I was just telling your lovely wife... oh.
Um...
Not your wife?
Yes, lovely.
Uh, no, not married.
Oh, well, not yet.
I can tell Henry is a keeper.
Well, I like to think so.
Thank you, darling.
Thank you.
Go on in, take a look.
32 stories tall, just off the West Side highway at 43rd street... condos and office space.
Looks impressive.
It will be.
It's just a steel frame now.
These guys are in some kind of financing squeeze.
They're desperate to get out.
The Alpern development group.
You probably heard about it.
Alpern, yeah, it sounds familiar.
I'm picking this project up for a song... lands, construction costs, air rights... all of it.
Uh, if... if you don't mind me asking, what's a song go for these days?
$100 million.
That stays between us.
Uh, yeah, of course.
Hey.
There you are.
I was just inside talking to Gavin.
Whew.
Mm-hmm.
Wow.
Yeah.
Can you believe this view?
I could get used to it.
Hmm.
Well, enjoy it while you can.
We turn back into pumpkins at midnight.
You've met our new building managers?
Oh, hi, Gavin.
You caught me staring.
Yes, they're very nice.
Mm.
You here with someone?
Like a date?
No.
I find that hard to believe.
It's not for lack of trying.
Mm.
"Finding love makes it worth the pain of searching for it."
Someone said that to me once.
They never tried Internet dating.
Mm.
Actually, I'm going out with someone tomorrow night.
Magic could happen...
In theory.
There's a restaurant in the flatiron district that's very romantic.
I'll call the maitre d'.
He'll take care of you and your gentleman.
That's nice, Gavin.
Thanks.
Never hurts to stack the deck.
Henry.
Hmm?
I think I left the clothes in the dryer.
Why not tomorrow?
Because there's a thief in the building.

I got 15 minutes to get downtown.
Have you seen my black socks anywhere, babe?
Yeah, did you check the, uh, laundry basket?
Um, I... did I?
Of course.
You know, I'm thinking red is a really nice contrast with the green skin tone you have going on this morning.
Yeah, well, for the record, I feel much worse on the inside.
Mm.
All right.
I love you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to mention, I, uh, kind of invited the Dorans to dinner tomorrow night.
I'm sorry.
You kind of what?
Look, Jane, it's not like we can afford to take 'em out.
And you're an amazing cook, Jane.
Oh, Henry, I have to cook for billionaires?
Fine.
If you want me to cancel, I will.
I'll just tell 'em I was drunk.
You so totally owe me.
I so totally owe you.
I hate to, but I'm gonna late.
You're the best.
One elevator is still down.
We're just waiting on final inspection.
Well, use the freight elevator if you're in a hurry.
Yeah.
All right.
Have a good day.
15 calls, same question.
Hey, Tony, uh, you ever hear about a murder that happened at the Drake?
A murder?
Um...
Uh, no, no.
There's been a few suicides over the years, and a bunch of...
bunch of accidents.
You know, one guy... one guy actually fell out his own window.
Idiot.
But, uh...
But no murders that I can recollect, no.
Oh.
Why do you want to know about a murder?
J-just wondering.
You're kind of creepy, aren't you?
What?
No.
Yeah, you are.
I can tell.
Your guy's here.
I'm the exterminator.
No kidding.
Want to take a look?
It's an old ventilation shaft.
Wow.
It's not on any of the drawings I have.
This kind of brick here... part of the original construction.
Look down.
Oh, my God.
There's hundreds of them.
Starlings.
Biggest nesting murmuration I've ever seen in a building.
What?
Murmuration.
It's what you call starlings.
Collectively, I mean.
You know, like, uh, a gaggle of geese, a kit of pigeons, a murder of crows.
There's lots of names for birds.
My personal favorite... an exaltation of larks.
That should keep 'em in the hole.
So, uh, what do you think?
Can you get rid of 'em?
Shouldn't be a problem.
I'll kill 'em all.
Jane, hey.
Brian, hey, uh, we're having a small ventilation issue in the building.
Uh, we're checking apartments on every floor.
Can we...
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Great.
Do what you gotta do.
There's a couple of birds stuck in an air shaft.
It's nothing.
Oh.
You good?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
So, uh, so how's Louise feeling?
Uh, bored to death.
You know, but other than that, better.
Good.
I'm gonna visit tomorrow.
She'd love the company.
You know, Brian, your apartment is... is so cool.
I love the photographs.
Yeah, that's all Lou.
She's got the style.
My contribution is the, uh, messy area... there.
So how's the play coming?
I-I thought I closed those curtains.
Mm.
Yeah, lots of, uh, lots of distractions, huh?
Uh, I-I, uh,
I keep them closed when I... when I write.
Looks good here.
Wall's solid.
Okay.
Uh, Brian, thanks for everything.
Sure.
Okay.
All right.
Uh, see you around.
Oh.
If they ventilated down this far, the air shaft should be behind this wall.
Yeah, except there's no way to access it.
There is.
Someone covered up a door right here.
A door?
Hey, you ever consider, whoever covered this door with concrete might have had a good reason to do it?
There could be a lot of reasons.
I still want you to demo that wall.

Let me buy you a consolation drink.
You were right.
It's...
it's very romantic here.
It's not a good place to sit alone.
Alone seems to be a running theme in my life lately.
I'm having a drink with a friend.
Come and join us.
I'm gonna go home.
Well... he was hoping to meet you.
One drink.
One drink.
Hi there.
Frank Alpern.
Danielle.
Pleasure to meet you.
You too.
Join us for a drink?
Sure.
You gonna kill the birds?
Jeez.
You scared me.
You shouldn't be doing that.
Uh...
I'm just helping 'em find a new home.
You're gonna make them upset.
You know, uh,
I don't usually work with an audience.
Whatever.
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much for getting me lunch.
You're welcome.
Uh, so you're, uh, you're feeling better?
Better.
Honestly, it could've been so much worse.
I mean, if Brian hadn't been there...
I-I know.
I mean, you're lucky, I guess.
They ever figure out what happened?
Uh, well, we had the elevators inspected yesterday.
Um... but they couldn't find anything wrong.
All the safety mechanisms seem to be working.
So what does that mean?
Clearly, there's an issue.
I-I'm gonna talk to Gavin about it.
That thing was possessed.
I swear, it felt like it was trying to kill me.
Someone else is gonna get hurt, Jane.
It's gonna happen.
What's this?
A... a lawyer?
He's a personal injury attorney.
He thinks I have a real case.
You're gonna sue Gavin?
I'm strongly considering it.
I'm missing out on work.
I've...
I've lost a lot of money because of this accident.
I don't know.
We have some serious bills.
I-I'm sorry, Louise.
I-I probably shouldn't get in the middle of this.
Uh...
Right.
Anyway, I should probably go.
Um, I gotta go to the grocery store then home to cook dinner, so...
Oh, just you and Henry tonight, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, just me and, uh, me and Henry.
Sweet.
Oh!
God, I'm sorry.
Oops.
Where are you guys off to all dressed up?
Oh, someone has a big night out.
It's an excuse to go shopping.
I kind of met someone last night.
Well, that's great.
I'll let you know what happens.
When you see what she's gonna be wearing,
I'll tell you what's gonna happen.
Fingers crossed.
Nona?
"1956."
What the hell?
"The victim, Edward Paxton,
"a longtime resident of the Drake,
"was found murdered in his home.
The killer remains at large."
Hey, babe.
Hey, the Dorans are gonna be here any minute.
Uh, start chopping.
Did you get my text?
Um, yes.
So, yeah, what, you... you had a dream someone was murdered at the Drake, and it came true?
No.
Well, yes.
Okay, I-I found an article about a guy who was killed here in 1956.
And it turns out it was the same guy that was in my dream.
But I had the dream before I read about it.
Explain that to me.
Memory is unreliable, and our brain mixes things up all the time.
Nope, not mine and not about that.
Okay, so you're clairvoyant.
So answer me this... am I getting fired?
Okay, what?
I shouldn't even be telling you this.
It... it sounds like you should be telling me this.
Okay, so the other night when we were at the Dorans,
Gavin showed me this building that he's buying.
It's $100 million.
Oh, my God.
They're gonna hate my pot roast.
Babe, focus.
Sorry.
What?
Okay, so I found out at work that the building sits right next to an old industrial lot.
It turns out that lot has soil levels of arsenic and chromium that are off the charts.
What does that mean?
What it... it means, it's a toxic wasteland.
So if Gavin closes the deal with the, um...
Oh, with the...
with the Alpern group,
I mean, he's screwed.
Like he's $100-million screwed.
Well, then you gotta tell him, Henry.
Yeah, babe, I have to tell him, and then the leak gets traced back to me, and I'm done, and we're back in Indiana.
Okay, what are you gonna do?
I-I don't know.
I'm gonna pretend I know nothing about what I know for the next two hours, and then quietly freak out after they leave.
Maybe inviting them over wasn't such a good idea.
Hi, Gavin.
Hi.
Welcome.
Come on in.
Please.
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.
Something smells delicious.
Mwah.
Mm.
For you.
Oh, Gavin, thank you so much.
Henry.
Chateau Monique.
Mm-hmm.
Our favorite.
What the hell are you looking at?
Oh, knock it off.
Damn it!
Ah!
Aah!
Get off me.
Oh.
Oh!
What the hell are you doing?
Get outta here.
You closed the curtains.
I wanted to see you.
How did you get in here?
You know how.
Made a key.
You've been watching me from your window.
I know you want me.
You need to leave.
Right now.
Really?
Yeah.
I want you to leave.
Jane, you are an amazing cook.
Mm.
Oh, thank you.
I know pot roast screams '50s housewife, but I've never had a complaint.
There's nothing wrong with being a little old-fashioned.
This is delicious.
Mm.
You should tell them who taught you how to cook.
Would I know the chef?
Probably not.
Uh, it was my grandmother.
Uh, I always helped her cook Sunday night dinner growing up.
Uh, she was convinced that cooking a proper roast would help me find a proper husband, so...
You want to talk about old-fashioned...
Well, it would've worked on me.
Speaking of husbands, what are your plans together?
Well, uh, sure.
E-eventually.
Right?
How long have you two been together?
Mm.
What is it...
Uh...
Like four... uh, almost five years.
Yeah, five years.
You know, it's something we've... we've talked about, but we're...
Not in any rush.
Oh, I wouldn't wait too long.
Men like Henry get snatched up pretty quickly in this city.
It's a jungle out there.
No, that's not true.
Come on.
I'm serious.
He was jealous.
He did not just keep forgetting to bring my drink.
Jealous and passive-aggressive?
Well... maybe he was just a bad waiter.
Nah.
I saw the way he was looking at you.
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
Well...
What way was that?
Kind of like I am right now.
So what happens now?
Do you want me?
Tell me.
I want you.
So Jane discovered an interesting bit of history today about the Drake.
Is that right?
Yeah, apparently, there was a... murder in the building back in, uh, 1956.
Did you know about this?
Well, I'm old, but I'm not that old.
That was long before my time at the Drake.
Uh, the victim was a man named Edward Paxton.
They never caught his killer.
Sounds terrible.
Where did you get this paper?
This looks like an original copy.
Oh, uh, at the... the library.
Oh.
Fascinating.
I love a murder mystery.
It happened at the Drake.
Where exactly?
Uh, apartment 7g.
Who's in that apartment, honey?
Our friend Danielle Tyler.
Oh.
Mm.
Mm.
Henry.
Hmm?
Sometimes, like...
With the birds in the walls and...
That door I keep seeing...
I know it sounds crazy, but...
I feel like the building's trying to tell me something.
I don't know what it is yet.
Wait.
I hear it.
It's saying good night.
Good night.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
I gotta get home.
Please stay with me tonight.
Don't.
I thought we were both gonna be adults here.
What does that mean?
It means, my wife is gonna kill me if I don't get home tonight.
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.
You knew what the deal was.
I never took off my wedding ring.
You didn't have one.
I looked.
I did.
I know I did.
Right.
Look...
I gotta go.
No.

Gavin.
Please help me.
I don't...
I don't know what happened.
Looks to me like Frank Alpern got what he deserved.
What?
He was a cheat.
Tried to screw me over in a deal that he knew was bad.
Oh.
And what he did to you, leading you on like that...
I don't blame you for getting upset.
On the contrary.
I was counting on it.
But I-I didn't kill Frank.
It's the price we pay for the thing we want the most.
I didn't kill him.
Do you remember Edward, your first love?
Told you he was in love with another woman.
He broke your heart.
Oh.
And Carlos...
Who betrayed you the same way?
No, oh, it's not...
And Michael...
Oh, no.
Who used you?

No, it...

No, no.

No.

Oh, come.
Shh.
Shh.
I'll take care of the mess.
And when you wake up in the morning,
I promise you, you'll feel like a brand-new woman.
Mr. Doran.
Morning, Gavin.
Good morning.
I thought you would be interested to know that we closed the deal with the Alpern group late last night.
Congratulations.
Although I can't imagine anyone wanting to live there given how toxic the lot next door is.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
Look, Gavin, I c...
I couldn't say anything.
I wanted to, but, uh... you did the right thing.
You're not upset?
That you didn't abuse your position to curry favor with me?
The world is full of temptations, Henry.
People with integrity are rare.
Well, I'm still sorry, for what it's worth.
No hard feelings.
I flipped the property this morning to a Chinese investor before the news broke.
I cleared $20 million.
You had an ace up your sleeve?
I always do.
All right.
Well, I, uh, I better get to work.
Enjoy the day.
It's gonna be a hot one.
Guess you were right.
I knew he wouldn't bite.
He's a stand-up kid.
So he passed your little test.
Mm-hmm.
He's perfect.
He's a boy scout, Gavin.
No, no.
He is going to be a hero.
Mm.
Bye.
Oh, you're gonna end up putting me in the hospital, Lou.
I'm not getting back on that elevator.
Brian, why are all the curtains drawn?
It's like a cave in here.
No, let me help you.
I don't want you to strain yourself.
Is there mail?
Yeah.
Oh.
Wow.
All this?
I was only gone a few days.
Bills, bills, more bills.
What's this?
Hmm?
Who's it from?
It's from, uh, Gavin Doran.
An apology.
Guess he knows I'm gonna sue his ass.
Honey.
Hmm?
Gavin just gave us $300,000.
I'm feeling better already.
That's great.
His supervisor suggests we look for him at the bottom of whiskey bottle.
Great.
That's helpful.
Yeah.
I'll find you another exterminator.
Thank you.
That's not necessary, Tony.
Those birds never bothered anyone before.
Have the wall in Barlow's apartment closed up.
Just leave them alone?
They've probably been nesting there for 50 years.
The Drake is their home, too.
Oh, well, then, I'll, uh,
I'll take it off my list.
I-I should probably get back to work, though.
But thanks, Gavin.
Mm.
And, Jane, you might want to take care of that mess down in the basement.
Oh, okay.
I'll...
I'll get on that.
Good morning, Jane.
Danielle, hey.
How was your, uh, your date last night?
Go figure.
He canceled.
Oh, I'm sorry.
His loss.
That's right.
Anyway, I gotta run.
Can we, uh, can we catch up later?
Sure.
Great.
Tell Henry I say hi.
She's sweet.
Mm-hmm.
Lucky to have found someone like Henry.
"Finding love makes it worth the pain of searching for it."
I think I've heard that before, somewhere.
Mm-hmm.
I hope it's true.
Somebody?
Aah!
Previously on "666 Park Avenue"...
Nice digs.
We have an interview.
Henry Martin, Jane Van Veen.
For the manager position.
Welcome.
Mr. Doran likes to approve every tenant himself.
Obviously, whatever you guys said won him over.
She's how we get Henry.
What happened to the previous manager?
(Jane) Why would anybody ever want to leave this?
I'm Louise.
I think you met my husband Brian.
Kind of nerdy cute.
(Louise) Hey, honey, come meet my new assistant.
Brian, this is Alexis.
Can you believe it?
She lives right across the street, actually.
Washer number three is leaking.
Anything else I should know?
Well, there's a thief in the building.
I'll keep an eye out.
I like your necklace.
It's not right what you do.
What I do is fulfill needs.
Oh!
Oh, my God.
Aah!
(Gavin) You signed a binding contract.
Now it's time to settle up.
Aah!

Wait.
I-I don't understand.
Barlow used to live here, now he doesn't.
It's not that complicated.
No, I mean, why didn't he tell me he was moving out?
Well, you've been here, like, a week.
Why would he tell you anything?
Because I'm the new manager.
I'm supposed to get told.
And besides, people don't just up and move like that.
I mean, there's paperwork to fill out, I-I-I think.
Mr. Doran took care of the paperwork.
He and Barlow, they got close after the guy's wife took her high dive off bellevue.
This right here, this is just a... it's a favor for him, all right?
Sure.
Great.
(Lock clicks)
(Jangles keys)
Where's all this being shipped?
Vegas.
Help me, uh, count the boxes.
Sure.
What'd you get?
Uh, 23.
Me, too.
I got a lot of work to do on this place.
Gotta resurface the floors, redo the kitchen...
(Cell phone buzzing)
Install new fixtures, and we should really look at some of those sconces as w... yeah.
Now?
(Whispers) Sconces.
All right.
I'll be down in a minute.
The, uh, party planner and her entourage have arrived.
It's gonna be quite the soiree tonight at the Dorans.
I'm looking forward to it.
Hmm.
Oh, sorry, Tony.
You weren't invited?
Oh, no, actually, I, uh, I got a prior engagement.
Oh.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Of course.
All right.
Take it easy.

Hey.
Tony, Barlow's apartment, there are birds in the walls.
Uh, it's an old building.
Probably lots of things in the walls.
They flew right out of the wall and broke through a window upstairs.
We gotta call an exterminator.
This is serious.
Yeah, yeah, look, look, I got one elevator down, and it's making my life miserable.
I need it fixed today.
Yeah, yeah, it's the one that almost ate that lady.
Yeah, that one.
All right.
(Receiver clatters)
I sent Louise flowers from all of us, by the way.
Of course you did.
(Thuds)
This is the exterminator we use.
You're the resident manager, you call.
Thanks, Tony.
I'll take care of it.
You know, Tony, uh, by the way,
I didn't take the job from you, okay?
Mr. Doran hired us.
Oh, I know that, Jane.
Thanks.
Oh, Nona, hey.
What's up?
You mentioned that there's a thief in the building.
I... well, it looks like I'm the latest victim.
Oh, no.
Yeah, uh, my...
my grandmother's necklace.
It's irreplaceable.
I'll keep an eye out.
Thanks.
Hey, Jane.
Don't mess with the birds.
They're part of the Drake.
Hey.
Just talked to the doctor a... here.
What are you doing?
Let me help.
All right.
Let me help.
(Exhales)
I'm not an invalid, Brian.
No, but you're still on the mend.
Mending is really boring.
You gotta stop complaining.
You know, the doctor thinks that you only have to be here a few more nights.
What?
That is not a long time for a girl that got crushed by an elevator.
And...
Honestly, babe, uh, a collapsed lung and a concussion are really serious.
So are some of the bills we have.
I can't get out there and land a job until I get out of here.
You still have that one gig.
Actually, they said they weren't gonna hire me again.
That's ridiculous, Lou.
You were in an accident.
Oh, they know.
They sent those.
Look, they're vindictive fashionistas who were inconvenienced.
Yeah, it sucks.
Actually, will you get the nurse?
My Vicodin's wearing off.
Yeah, sure.
I'm back.
Alexis, thank God.
Oh, thank you.
Now this is how you save a life.
(Chuckles)
How are you?
Uh, I'm fine.
Is that stuff from our apartment?
Almost forgot.
Here you go.
Here's your key.
(Door opens)
(Henry) I'm late.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Whoa.
Wow.
You look stunning.
Hey, thanks for getting the wine.
Of course, of course.
So you wouldn't believe this guy in the wine shop.
He was trying to push an $800 bottle of wine on me.
Have you ever heard of Chateau Monique?
No.
Yeah, well, he couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it either.
But you'll be happy to know,
I held firm on a bottle of Merlot for 20 bucks.
That's what the Dorans use in their salad dressing.
(Laughs) I'm gonna hop in the shower.
I'm funny.
How was your day?
What, you didn't get my text?
The one about you being attacked by birds?
That wasn't an autocorrect mistake?
(Laughs) No.
I got, like, tippi hedren attacked.
They flew right out of the wall of an apartment upstairs.
It was crazy.
And I still can't figure out where they came from.
Did you provoke 'em?
No, I didn't provoke them.
I know how you are, Jane.
Get in the shower.
I love you.
(Jazz orchestra playing)
(Indistinct conversations continue)
(Music continues)
Mwah.
Jane, Henry, there you are.
I'm sorry we're late.
It's my fault.
Oh, Olivia, this is amazing.
Here.
Uh, for you and Gavin.
Oh, how thoughtful.
Help yourself to a drink.
The bar is straight ahead.
Uh, Adriana.
E-excuse me.
I love your dress.
Uh, what do you want to drink?
Uh, something with vodka, please.
Okay.
(Laughs)
(Indistinct conversations continue)
(Laughs)
Uh, Henry, this is Danielle.
She lives in the building.
Hey.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.
The Sushi's excellent, by the way.
Oh, yeah?
I was just telling your lovely wife... oh.
Um...
Not your wife?
(Laughs)
Yes, lovely.
Uh, no, not married.
Oh, well, not yet.
I can tell Henry is a keeper.
Well, I like to think so.
Thank you, darling.
Thank you. (Laughs)
(Music continues)
(Indistinct conversations continue)
Go on in, take a look.
32 stories tall, just off the West Side highway at 43rd street... condos and office space.
Looks impressive.
It will be.
It's just a steel frame now.
These guys are in some kind of financing squeeze.
They're desperate to get out.
The Alpern development group.
You probably heard about it.
Alpern, yeah, it sounds familiar.
I'm picking this project up for a song... lands, construction costs, air rights... all of it.
Uh, if... if you don't mind me asking, what's a song go for these days?
$100 million.
(Exhales)
That stays between us.
Uh, yeah, of course.
(Laughter)
(Indistinct conversations continue)
(Music continues)
Hey.
There you are.
I was just inside talking to Gavin.
Whew.
Mm-hmm.
Wow.
Yeah.
Can you believe this view?
I could get used to it.
Hmm.
Well, enjoy it while you can.
We turn back into pumpkins at midnight.
(Music continues)
(Indistinct conversations continue)
You've met our new building managers?
Oh, hi, Gavin.
(Chuckles)
You caught me staring.
Yes, they're very nice.
Mm.
You here with someone?
Like a date?
No.
I find that hard to believe.
It's not for lack of trying.
Mm.
"Finding love makes it worth the pain of searching for it."
Someone said that to me once.
They never tried Internet dating.
(Chuckles)
Mm.
Actually, I'm going out with someone tomorrow night.
Magic could happen...
In theory.
There's a restaurant in the flatiron district that's very romantic.
I'll call the maitre d'.
He'll take care of you and your gentleman.
That's nice, Gavin.
Thanks.
Never hurts to stack the deck.
(Clinks)
Henry.
Hmm?
I think I left the clothes in the dryer.
Why not tomorrow?
Because there's a thief in the building.

You know, I'm thinking red is a really nice contrast with the green skin tone you have going on this morning.
Yeah, well, for the record, I feel much worse on the inside.
Mm.
All right.
I love you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to mention, I, uh, kind of invited the Dorans to dinner tomorrow night.
I'm sorry.
You kind of what?
Look, Jane, it's not like we can afford to take 'em out.
And you're an amazing cook, Jane.
Oh, Henry, I have to cook for billionaires?
Fine.
If you want me to cancel, I will.
I'll just tell 'em I was drunk.
You so totally owe me.
I so totally owe you.
I hate to, but I'm gonna late.
You're the best.
One elevator is still down.
We're just waiting on final inspection.
(Clears throat)
Well, use the freight elevator if you're in a hurry.
Yeah.
All right.
Have a good day.
(Receiver clatters) 15 calls, same question.
Hey, Tony, uh, you ever hear about a murder that happened at the Drake?
A murder?
Um...
Uh, no, no.
There's been a few suicides over the years, and a bunch of...
bunch of accidents.
You know, one guy... one guy actually fell out his own window.
Idiot.
But, uh...
But no murders that I can recollect, no.
Oh.
Why do you want to know about a murder?
J-just wondering.
You're kind of creepy, aren't you?
What?
No.
Yeah, you are.
I can tell.
Your guy's here.
(Telephone rings)
I'm the exterminator.
No kidding.
(Man) Want to take a look?
It's an old ventilation shaft.
Wow.
It's not on any of the drawings I have.
This kind of brick here... part of the original construction.
Look down.
(Squawking)
Oh, my God.
There's hundreds of them.
(Squawking continues)
(Sighs)
Starlings.
Biggest nesting murmuration I've ever seen in a building.
What?
Murmuration.
It's what you call starlings.
Collectively, I mean.
You know, like, uh, a gaggle of geese, a kit of pigeons, a murder of crows.
There's lots of names for birds.
My personal favorite... an exaltation of larks.
That should keep 'em in the hole.
So, uh, what do you think?
Can you get rid of 'em?
Shouldn't be a problem.
I'll kill 'em all.
(Keyboard keys clicking)
(Chair wheels squeak)
(Curtain rings clatter)
(Knock on door)
Jane, hey.
Brian, hey, uh, we're having a small ventilation issue in the building.
Uh, we're checking apartments on every floor.
Can we...
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Great.
Do what you gotta do.
There's a couple of birds stuck in an air shaft.
It's nothing.
Oh.
You good?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
So, uh, so how's Louise feeling?
Uh, bored to death.
You know, but other than that, better.
Good.
I'm gonna visit tomorrow.
She'd love the company.
You know, Brian, your apartment is... is so cool.
I love the photographs.
Yeah, that's all Lou.
She's got the style.
My contribution is the, uh, messy area... there.
So how's the play coming?
I-I thought I closed those curtains.
Mm.
Yeah, lots of, uh, lots of distractions, huh?
Uh, I-I, uh,
I keep them closed when I... when I write.
Looks good here.
Wall's solid.
Okay.
Uh, Brian, thanks for everything.
Sure.
Okay.
All right.
Uh, see you around.
(Door closes)
Oh.
(Clatters)
If they ventilated down this far, the air shaft should be behind this wall.
Yeah, except there's no way to access it.
There is.
Someone covered up a door right here.
A door?
Hey, you ever consider, whoever covered this door with concrete might have had a good reason to do it?
There could be a lot of reasons.
I still want you to demo that wall.

Jeez. (Pants) You scared me.
You shouldn't be doing that.

I'm just helping 'em find a new home.
You're gonna make them upset.

I don't usually work with an audience.
Whatever.

Thank you so much for getting me lunch.
(Laughs) You're welcome.
Uh, so you're, uh, you're feeling better?
Better.
Honestly, it could've been so much worse.
I mean, if Brian hadn't been there...
I-I know.
I mean, you're lucky, I guess.
They ever figure out what happened?
Uh, well, we had the elevators inspected yesterday.
Um... but they couldn't find anything wrong.
All the safety mechanisms seem to be working.
So what does that mean?
Clearly, there's an issue.
I-I'm gonna talk to Gavin about it.
That thing was possessed.
I swear, it felt like it was trying to kill me.
Someone else is gonna get hurt, Jane.
It's gonna happen.
What's this?
A... a lawyer?
He's a personal injury attorney.
He thinks I have a real case.
You're gonna sue Gavin?
I'm strongly considering it.
I'm missing out on work.
I've...
I've lost a lot of money because of this accident.
I don't know.
We have some serious bills.
I-I'm sorry, Louise.
I-I probably shouldn't get in the middle of this.
Uh...
Right.
Anyway, I should probably go.
Um, I gotta go to the grocery store then home to cook dinner, so...
Oh, just you and Henry tonight, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, just me and, uh, me and Henry.
Sweet.
(Elevator bell dings)
(Olivia speaks indistinctly) Oh!
God, I'm sorry. (Laughs)
Oops. (Laughs)
Where are you guys off to all dressed up?
Oh, someone has a big night out.
It's an excuse to go shopping.
(Laughs) I kind of met someone last night.
Well, that's great.

I'll tell you what's gonna happen.

"1956."
What the hell?
"The victim, Edward Paxton,
"a longtime resident of the Drake,
"was found murdered in his home.
The killer remains at large."
(Door opens and closes)
Hey, babe.
Hey, the Dorans are gonna be here any minute.
Uh, start chopping.
Did you get my text?
Um, yes.
So, yeah, what, you... you had a dream someone was murdered at the Drake, and it came true?
No.
Well, yes.
Okay, I-I found an article about a guy who was killed here in 1956.
And it turns out it was the same guy that was in my dream.
But I had the dream before I read about it.
Explain that to me.
Memory is unreliable, and our brain mixes things up all the time.
Nope, not mine and not about that.
(Grinds)
Okay, so you're clairvoyant.
So answer me this... am I getting fired?
Okay, what?
(Sighs)
I shouldn't even be telling you this.
It... it sounds like you should be telling me this.
Okay, so the other night when we were at the Dorans,
Gavin showed me this building that he's buying.
It's $100 million.
Oh, my God.
They're gonna hate my pot roast.
Babe, focus.
Sorry.
What?
Okay, so I found out at work that the building sits right next to an old industrial lot.
It turns out that lot has soil levels of arsenic and chromium that are off the charts.
What does that mean?
What it... it means, it's a toxic wasteland.
So if Gavin closes the deal with the, um... (Snaps fingers)
Oh, with the...
with the Alpern group,
I mean, he's screwed.
Like he's $100-million screwed.
Well, then you gotta tell him, Henry.
Yeah, babe, I have to tell him, and then the leak gets traced back to me, and I'm done, and we're back in Indiana.
Okay, what are you gonna do?
I-I don't know.
I'm gonna pretend I know nothing about what I know for the next two hours, and then quietly freak out after they leave.
Maybe inviting them over wasn't such a good idea.
(Knock on door)
(Jane) Hi.
Hi, Gavin.
Hi.
Welcome.
Come on in.
Please.
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.
Something smells delicious.
Mwah.
Mm.

Oh, Gavin, thank you so much.
Henry.

You closed the curtains.
I wanted to see you.
How did you get in here?
You know how.
(Jangles)
Made a key.
You've been watching me from your window.
I know you want me.
You need to leave.
Right now.
Really?
(Chuckles)
Yeah.
I want you to leave.
Jane, you are an amazing cook.
(Jane) Mm.
Oh, thank you.
I know pot roast screams '50s housewife, but I've never had a complaint.
There's nothing wrong with being a little old-fashioned.
This is delicious.
Mm.
You should tell them who taught you how to cook.
(Olivia) Would I know the chef?
Probably not.
Uh, it was my grandmother.
Uh, I always helped her cook Sunday night dinner growing up.
Uh, she was convinced that cooking a proper roast would help me find a proper husband, so...
You want to talk about old-fashioned...
Well, it would've worked on me.
Speaking of husbands, what are your plans together?
Well, uh, sure.
E-eventually.
Right?
How long have you two been together?
Mm.
What is it...
Uh...
Like four... uh, almost five years.
Yeah, five years.
You know, it's something we've... we've talked about, but we're...
Not in any rush.
Oh, I wouldn't wait too long.
Men like Henry get snatched up pretty quickly in this city.
It's a jungle out there.
(Henry and Jane chuckle)
♪
(Laughs)
No, that's not true.
Come on.
I'm serious.
He was jealous.
He did not just keep forgetting to bring my drink.
Jealous and passive-aggressive?
Well... maybe he was just a bad waiter.
Nah.
I saw the way he was looking at you.
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
Well... (Laughs) What way was that?
Kind of like I am right now.
So what happens now?
(Both moaning and panting)
Do you want me?
Tell me.
(Pants) I want you.
(Frank moans)
So Jane discovered an interesting bit of history today about the Drake.
Is that right?
Yeah, apparently, there was a... murder in the building back in, uh, 1956.
Did you know about this?
Well, I'm old, but I'm not that old.
(Chuckles) That was long before my time at the Drake.
Uh, the victim was a man named Edward Paxton.
They never caught his killer.
Sounds terrible.
Where did you get this paper?
This looks like an original copy.
Oh, uh, at the... the library.
(Chuckles)
Oh.
Fascinating.
I love a murder mystery.
(Olivia) It happened at the Drake.
Where exactly?
Uh, apartment 7g.
Who's in that apartment, honey?
Our friend Danielle Tyler.
Oh.
Mm.
Mm.
Henry.
Hmm?
Sometimes, like...
With the birds in the walls and...
That door I keep seeing...
I know it sounds crazy, but...
I feel like the building's trying to tell me something.
I don't know what it is yet.
Wait.
I hear it.
It's saying good night.
(Chuckles)
Good night.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
I gotta get home.
Please stay with me tonight.
Don't.
I thought we were both gonna be adults here.
What does that mean?
It means, my wife is gonna kill me if I don't get home tonight.
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.
You knew what the deal was.
I never took off my wedding ring.
You didn't have one.
I looked.
I did.
I know I did.
Right.
Look... (Sighs)

Morning, Gavin.
Good morning.
I thought you would be interested to know that we closed the deal with the Alpern group late last night.
Congratulations.
Although I can't imagine anyone wanting to live there given how toxic the lot next door is.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
Look, Gavin, I c...
I couldn't say anything.
I wanted to, but, uh... you did the right thing.
You're not upset?
That you didn't abuse your position to curry favor with me?
The world is full of temptations, Henry.
People with integrity are rare.
Well, I'm still sorry, for what it's worth.
No hard feelings.
I flipped the property this morning to a Chinese investor before the news broke.
I cleared $20 million.
You had an ace up your sleeve?
I always do.
All right.
Well, I, uh, I better get to work.
Enjoy the day.
It's gonna be a hot one.
Guess you were right.
I knew he wouldn't bite.
He's a stand-up kid.
So he passed your little test.
Mm-hmm.
He's perfect.
He's a boy scout, Gavin.
No, no.
He is going to be a hero.
Mm.
Bye.
Oh, you're gonna end up putting me in the hospital, Lou.
I'm not getting back on that elevator.
Brian, why are all the curtains drawn?
It's like a cave in here.
No, let me help you.
(Sighs) I don't want you to strain yourself.
Is there mail?
Yeah.
Oh.
Wow.
All this?
I was only gone a few days.
Bills, bills, more bills.
What's this?
Hmm?
Who's it from?
It's from, uh, Gavin Doran.
An apology.
Guess he knows I'm gonna sue his ass.
Honey.
Hmm?
Gavin just gave us $300,000.
I'm feeling better already.
(Laughs)
(Laughs)
(People speaking indistinctly)
That's great.
(Receiver clatters)
His supervisor suggests we look for him at the bottom of whiskey bottle.
(Chuckles) Great.
That's helpful.
Yeah.
I'll find you another exterminator.
Thank you.
That's not necessary, Tony.
Those birds never bothered anyone before.
Have the wall in Barlow's apartment closed up.
Just leave them alone?
They've probably been nesting there for 50 years.
The Drake is their home, too.
Oh, well, then, I'll, uh,
I'll take it off my list.
I-I should probably get back to work, though.
But thanks, Gavin.
Mm.
And, Jane, you might want to take care of that mess down in the basement.
Oh, okay.
I'll...
I'll get on that.
(Elevator bell dings)
Good morning, Jane.
Danielle, hey.
How was your, uh, your date last night?
Go figure.
He canceled.
Oh, I'm sorry.
His loss.
That's right.
Anyway, I gotta run.
Can we, uh, can we catch up later?
Sure.
Great.
(Elevator doors open)
Tell Henry I say hi.
(Ding)
(Elevator doors close)
She's sweet.
Mm-hmm.
Lucky to have found someone like Henry.
"Finding love makes it worth the pain of searching for it."
I think I've heard that before, somewhere.
Mm-hmm.
I hope it's true. (Laughs)
(Hinges squeak)
(Object clatters)
Somebody?
(Hinges squeak)
Aah!
Previously on 666 Park Avenue...
Nice digs.
We have an interview.
Henry Martin, Jane Van Veen.
For the manager position.
Welcome.
Mr. Doran likes to approve every tenant himself.
Obviously, whatever you guys said won him over.
She's how we get Henry.
What happened to the previous manager?
Why would anybody ever want to leave this?
I'm Louise.
I think you met my husband Brian.
Kind of nerdy cute.
Hey, honey, come meet my new assistant.
Brian, this is Alexis.
Can you believe it?
She lives right across the street, actually.
Washer number three is leaking.
Anything else I should know?
Well, there's a thief in the building.
I'll keep an eye out.
I like your necklace.
It's not right what you do.
What I do is fulfill needs.
Oh!
Oh, my God.
Aah!
You signed a binding contract.
Now it's time to settle up.
Aah!
[ Patsy Cline's "You belong to me" playing ] * bom, bom, bom, bom * * see the pyramids along the Nile * * bom, bom, bom, bom *

Wait.
I-I don't understand.
Barlow used to live here, now he doesn't.
It's not that complicated.
No, I mean, why didn't he tell me he was moving out?
Well, you've been here, like, a week.
Why would he tell you anything?
Because I'm the new manager.
I'm supposed to get told.
And besides, people don't just up and move like that.
I mean, there's paperwork to fill out, I-I-I think.
Mr. Doran took care of the paperwork.
He and Barlow, they got close after the guy's wife took her high dive off Bellevue.
This right here, this is just a... it's a favor for him, all right?
Sure.
Great.
Where's all this being shipped?
Vegas.
Help me, uh, count the boxes.
Sure.
What'd you get?
Uh, 23.
Me, too.
I got a lot of work to do on this place.
Gotta resurface the floors, redo the kitchen...
Install new fixtures, and we should really look at some of those sconces as w... yeah.
Now?
Sconces.
All right.
I'll be down in a minute.
The, uh, party planner and her entourage have arrived.
It's gonna be quite the soiree tonight at the Dorans.
I'm looking forward to it.
Hmm.
Oh, sorry, Tony.
You weren't invited?
Oh, no, actually, I, uh, I got a prior engagement.
Oh.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Of course.
All right.
Take it easy.
Aah!
Aah! 1x02 Murmurations
Hey.
Tony, Barlow's apartment, there are birds in the walls.
Uh, it's an old building.
Probably lots of things in the walls.
They flew right out of the wall and broke through a window upstairs.
We gotta call an exterminator.
This is serious.
Yeah, yeah, look, look, I got one elevator down, and it's making my life miserable.
I need it fixed today.
Yeah, yeah, it's the one that almost ate that lady.
Yeah, that one.
All right.
I sent Louise flowers from all of us, by the way.
Of course you did.
This is the exterminator we use.
You're the resident manager, you call.
Thanks, Tony.
I'll take care of it.
You know, Tony, uh, by the way,
I didn't take the job from you, okay?
Mr. Doran hired us.
Oh, I know that, Jane.
Thanks.
Oh, Nona, hey.
What's up?
You mentioned that there's a thief in the building.
I... well, it looks like I'm the latest victim.
Oh, no.
Yeah, uh, my...
my grandmother's necklace.
It's irreplaceable.
I'll keep an eye out.
Thanks.
Hey, Jane.
Don't mess with the birds.
They're part of the Drake.
Hey.
Just talked to the doctor a... here.
What are you doing?
Let me help.
All right.
Let me help.
I'm not an invalid, Brian.
No, but you're still on the mend.
Mending is really boring.
You gotta stop complaining.
You know, the doctor thinks that you only have to be here a few more nights.
What?
That is not a long time for a girl that got crushed by an elevator.
And...
Honestly, babe, uh, a collapsed lung and a concussion are really serious.
So are some of the bills we have.
I can't get out there and land a job until I get out of here.
You still have that one gig.
Actually, they said they weren't gonna hire me again.
That's ridiculous, Lou.
You were in an accident.
Oh, they know.
They sent those.
Look, they're vindictive fashionistas who were inconvenienced.
Yeah, it sucks.
Actually, will you get the nurse?
My Vicodin's wearing off.
Yeah, sure.
I'm back.
Alexis, thank God.
Oh, thank you.
Now this is how you save a life.
How are you?
Uh, I'm fine.
Is that stuff from our apartment?
Almost forgot.
Here you go.
Here's your key.
I'm late.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Whoa.
Wow.
You look stunning.
Hey, thanks for getting the wine.
Of course, of course.
So you wouldn't believe this guy in the wine shop.
He was trying to push an $800 bottle of wine on me.
Have you ever heard of Chateau Monique?
No.
Yeah, well, he couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it either.
But you'll be happy to know,
I held firm on a bottle of Merlot for 20 bucks.
That's what the Dorans use in their salad dressing.
I'm gonna hop in the shower.
I'm funny.
How was your day?
What, you didn't get my text?
The one about you being attacked by birds?
That wasn't an autocorrect mistake?
No.
I got, like, Tippi Hedren attacked.
They flew right out of the wall of an apartment upstairs.
It was crazy.
And I still can't figure out where they came from.
Did you provoke 'em?
No, I didn't provoke them.
I know how you are, Jane.
Get in the shower.
I love you.
Mwah.
Jane, Henry, there you are.
I'm sorry we're late.
It's my fault.
Oh, Olivia, this is amazing.
Here.
Uh, for you and Gavin.
Oh, how thoughtful.
Help yourself to a drink.
The bar is straight ahead.
Uh, Adriana.
E-excuse me.
I love your dress.
Uh, what do you want to drink?
Uh, something with vodka, please.
Okay.
Uh, Henry, this is Danielle.
She lives in the building.
Hey.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.
The Sushi's excellent, by the way.
Oh, yeah?
I was just telling your lovely wife... oh.
Um...
Not your wife?
Yes, lovely.
Uh, no, not married.
Oh, well, not yet.
I can tell Henry is a keeper.
Well, I like to think so.
Thank you, darling.
Thank you.
Go on in, take a look.
32 stories tall, just off the West Side highway at 43rd street... condos and office space.
Looks impressive.
It will be.
It's just a steel frame now.
These guys are in some kind of financing squeeze.
They're desperate to get out.
The Alpern development group.
You probably heard about it.
Alpern, yeah, it sounds familiar.
I'm picking this project up for a song... lands, construction costs, air rights... all of it.
Uh, if... if you don't mind me asking, what's a song go for these days?
$100 million.
That stays between us.
Uh, yeah, of course.
Hey.
There you are.
I was just inside talking to Gavin.
Whew.
Mm-hmm.
Wow.
Yeah.
Can you believe this view?
I could get used to it.
Hmm.
Well, enjoy it while you can.
We turn back into pumpkins at midnight.
You've met our new building managers?
Oh, hi, Gavin.
You caught me staring.
Yes, they're very nice.
Mm.
You here with someone?
Like a date?
No.
I find that hard to believe.
It's not for lack of trying.
Mm.
"Finding love makes it worth the pain of searching for it."
Someone said that to me once.
They never tried Internet dating.
Mm.
Actually, I'm going out with someone tomorrow night.
Magic could happen...
In theory.
There's a restaurant in the flatiron district that's very romantic.
I'll call the Maître d'.
He'll take care of you and your gentleman.
That's nice, Gavin.
Thanks.
Never hurts to stack the deck.
Henry.
Hmm?
I think I left the clothes in the dryer.
Why not tomorrow?
Because there's a thief in the building.
Hello?
[ The Flamingos ] * Are the stars out * * shoo-bop, shoo-bop * * tonight?
* * doo-wop, shoo-bop *

Oh, my God.
I got 15 minutes to get downtown.
Have you seen my black socks anywhere, babe?
Yeah, did you check the, uh, laundry basket?
Um, I... did I?
Of course.
You know, I'm thinking red is a really nice contrast with the green skin tone you have going on this morning.
Yeah, well, for the record, I feel much worse on the inside.
Mm.
All right.
I love you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to mention, I, uh, kind of invited the Dorans to dinner tomorrow night.
I'm sorry.
You kind of what?
Look, Jane, it's not like we can afford to take 'em out.
And you're an amazing cook, Jane.
Oh, Henry, I have to cook for billionaires?
Fine.
If you want me to cancel, I will.
I'll just tell 'em I was drunk.
You so totally owe me.
I so totally owe you.
I hate to, but I'm gonna late.
You're the best.
One elevator is still down.
We're just waiting on final inspection.
Well, use the freight elevator if you're in a hurry.
Yeah.
All right.
Have a good day.
15 calls, same question.
Hey, Tony, uh, you ever hear about a murder that happened at the Drake?
A murder?
Um...
Uh, no, no.
There's been a few suicides over the years, and a bunch of...
bunch of accidents.
You know, one guy... one guy actually fell out his own window.
Idiot.
But, uh...
But no murders that I can recollect, no.
Oh.
Why do you want to know about a murder?
J-just wondering.
You're kind of creepy, aren't you?
What?
No.
Yeah, you are.
I can tell.
Your guy's here.
I'm the exterminator.
No kidding.
Want to take a look?
It's an old ventilation shaft.
Wow.
It's not on any of the drawings I have.
This kind of brick here... part of the original construction.
Look down.
Oh, my God.
There's hundreds of them.
Starlings.
Biggest nesting murmuration I've ever seen in a building.
What?
Murmuration.
It's what you call starlings.
Collectively, I mean.
You know, like, uh, a gaggle of geese, a kit of pigeons, a murder of crows.
There's lots of names for birds.
My personal favorite... an exaltation of larks.
That should keep 'em in the hole.
So, uh, what do you think?
Can you get rid of 'em?
Shouldn't be a problem.
I'll kill 'em all.
Jane, hey.
Brian, hey, uh, we're having a small ventilation issue in the building.
Uh, we're checking apartments on every floor.
Can we...
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Great.
Do what you gotta do.
There's a couple of birds stuck in an air shaft.
It's nothing.
Oh.
You good?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
So, uh, so how's Louise feeling?
Uh, bored to death.
You know, but other than that, better.
Good.
I'm gonna visit tomorrow.
She'd love the company.
You know, Brian, your apartment is... is so cool.
I love the photographs.
Yeah, that's all Lou.
She's got the style.
My contribution is the, uh, messy area... there.
So how's the play coming?
I-I thought I closed those curtains.
Mm.
Yeah, lots of, uh, lots of distractions, huh?
Uh, I-I, uh,
I keep them closed when I... when I write.
Looks good here.
Wall's solid.
Okay.
Uh, Brian, thanks for everything.
Sure.
Okay.
All right.
Uh, see you around.
Oh.
If they ventilated down this far, the air shaft should be behind this wall.
Yeah, except there's no way to access it.
There is.
Someone covered up a door right here.
A door?
Hey, you ever consider, whoever covered this door with concrete might have had a good reason to do it?
There could be a lot of reasons.
I still want you to demo that wall.
Let me grab my tools.
[ New Alley Corp ] * play me *
* Baby, don't stop now * * we're taken in this far *
Excuse me.
Check, please.
* Love is like music, a magical union * * that trills and moves * * let's lose our restrain *
Let me buy you a consolation drink.
You were right.
It's...
it's very romantic here.
It's not a good place to sit alone.
Alone seems to be a running theme in my life lately.
I'm having a drink with a friend.
Come and join us.
I'm gonna go home.
Well... he was hoping to meet you.
One drink.
One drink.
Hi there.
Frank Alpern.
Danielle.
Pleasure to meet you.
You too.
Join us for a drink?
Sure.
You gonna kill the birds?
Jeez.
You scared me.
You shouldn't be doing that.
Uh...
I'm just helping 'em find a new home.
You're gonna make them upset.
You know, uh,
I don't usually work with an audience.
Whatever.
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much for getting me lunch.
You're welcome.
Uh, so you're, uh, you're feeling better?
Better.
Honestly, it could've been so much worse.
I mean, if Brian hadn't been there...
I-I know.
I mean, you're lucky, I guess.
They ever figure out what happened?
Uh, well, we had the elevators inspected yesterday.
Um... but they couldn't find anything wrong.
All the safety mechanisms seem to be working.
So what does that mean?
Clearly, there's an issue.
I-I'm gonna talk to Gavin about it.
That thing was possessed.
I swear, it felt like it was trying to kill me.
Someone else is gonna get hurt, Jane.
It's gonna happen.
What's this?
A... a lawyer?
He's a personal injury attorney.
He thinks I have a real case.
You're gonna sue Gavin?
I'm strongly considering it.
I'm missing out on work.
I've...
I've lost a lot of money because of this accident.
I don't know.
We have some serious bills.
I-I'm sorry, Louise.
I-I probably shouldn't get in the middle of this.
Uh...
Right.
Anyway, I should probably go.
Um, I gotta go to the grocery store then home to cook dinner, so...
Oh, just you and Henry tonight, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, just me and, uh, me and Henry.
Sweet.
Oh!
God, I'm sorry.
Oops.
Where are you guys off to all dressed up?
Oh, someone has a big night out.
It's an excuse to go shopping.
I kind of met someone last night.
Well, that's great.
I'll let you know what happens.
When you see what she's gonna be wearing,
I'll tell you what's gonna happen.
Fingers crossed.
Nona?
"1956."
What the hell?
"The victim, Edward Paxton,
"a longtime resident of the Drake,
"was found murdered in his home.
The killer remains at large."
Hey, babe.
Hey, the Dorans are gonna be here any minute.
Uh, start chopping.
Did you get my text?
Um, yes.
So, yeah, what, you... you had a dream someone was murdered at the Drake, and it came true?
No.
Well, yes.
Okay, I-I found an article about a guy who was killed here in 1956.
And it turns out it was the same guy that was in my dream.
But I had the dream before I read about it.
Explain that to me.
Memory is unreliable, and our brain mixes things up all the time.
Nope, not mine and not about that.
Okay, so you're clairvoyant.
So answer me this... am I getting fired?
Okay, what?
I shouldn't even be telling you this.
It... it sounds like you should be telling me this.
Okay, so the other night when we were at the Dorans,
Gavin showed me this building that he's buying.
It's $100 million.
Oh, my God.
They're gonna hate my pot roast.
Babe, focus.
Sorry.
What?
Okay, so I found out at work that the building sits right next to an old industrial lot.
It turns out that lot has soil levels of arsenic and chromium that are off the charts.
What does that mean?
What it... it means, it's a toxic wasteland.
So if Gavin closes the deal with the, um...
Oh, with the...
with the Alpern group,
I mean, he's screwed.
Like he's $100-million screwed.
Well, then you gotta tell him, Henry.
Yeah, babe, I have to tell him, and then the leak gets traced back to me, and I'm done, and we're back in Indiana.
Okay, what are you gonna do?
I-I don't know.
I'm gonna pretend I know nothing about what I know for the next two hours, and then quietly freak out after they leave.
Maybe inviting them over wasn't such a good idea.
Hi.
Hi, Gavin.
Hi.
Welcome.
Come on in.
Please.
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.
Something smells delicious.
Mwah.
Mm.
For you.
Oh, Gavin, thank you so much.
Henry.
Chateau Monique.
Mm-hmm.
Our favorite.
What the hell are you looking at?
Oh, knock it off.
Damn it!
Ah!
Aah!
Get off me.
Oh.
Oh!
What the hell are you doing?
Get outta here.
You closed the curtains.
I wanted to see you.
How did you get in here?
You know how.
Made a key.
You've been watching me from your window.
I know you want me.
You need to leave.
Right now.
Really?
Yeah.
I want you to leave.
Jane, you are an amazing cook.
Mm.
Oh, thank you.
I know pot roast screams '50s housewife, but I've never had a complaint.
There's nothing wrong with being a little old-fashioned.
This is delicious.
Mm.
You should tell them who taught you how to cook.
Would I know the chef?
Probably not.
Uh, it was my grandmother.
Uh, I always helped her cook Sunday night dinner growing up.
Uh, she was convinced that cooking a proper roast would help me find a proper husband, so...
You want to talk about old-fashioned...
Well, it would've worked on me.
Speaking of husbands, what are your plans together?
Well, uh, sure.
E-eventually.
Right?
How long have you two been together?
Mm.
What is it...
Uh...
Like four... uh, almost five years.
Yeah, five years.
You know, it's something we've... we've talked about, but we're...
Not in any rush.
Oh, I wouldn't wait too long.
Men like Henry get snatched up pretty quickly in this city.
It's a jungle out there.
No, that's not true.
Come on.
I'm serious.
He was jealous.
He did not just keep forgetting to bring my drink.
Jealous and passive-aggressive?
Well... maybe he was just a bad waiter.
Nah.
I saw the way he was looking at you.
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
Well...
What way was that?
Kind of like I am right now.
So what happens now?
Do you want me?
Tell me.
I want you.
So Jane discovered an interesting bit of history today about the Drake.
Is that right?
Yeah, apparently, there was a... murder in the building back in, uh, 1956.
Did you know about this?
Well, I'm old, but I'm not that old.
That was long before my time at the Drake.
Uh, the victim was a man named Edward Paxton.
They never caught his killer.
Sounds terrible.
Where did you get this paper?
This looks like an original copy.
Oh, uh, at the... the library.
Oh.
Fascinating.
I love a murder mystery.
It happened at the Drake.
Where exactly?
Uh, apartment 7g.
Who's in that apartment, honey?
Our friend Danielle Tyler.
Oh.
Mm.
Mm.
Henry.
Hmm?
Sometimes, like...
With the birds in the walls and...
That door I keep seeing...
I know it sounds crazy, but...
I feel like the building's trying to tell me something.
I don't know what it is yet.
Wait.
I hear it.
It's saying good night.
Good night.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
I gotta get home.
Please stay with me tonight.
Don't.
I thought we were both gonna be adults here.
What does that mean?
It means, my wife is gonna kill me if I don't get home tonight.
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.
You knew what the deal was.
I never took off my wedding ring.
You didn't have one.
I looked.
I did.
I know I did.
Right.
Look...
I gotta go.
No.
Frank.
[ The Flamingos ] * My love must be a kind * * of blind love *
* I can't see anyone * * but you * * shoo-bop, shoo-bop * * doo-wop, shoo-bop *
Eddie?
I loved you so much.
Aah!
Oh!
Gavin.
Please help me.
I don't...
I don't know what happened.
Looks to me like Frank Alpern got what he deserved.
What?
He was a cheat.
Tried to screw me over in a deal that he knew was bad.
Oh.
And what he did to you, leading you on like that...
I don't blame you for getting upset.
On the contrary.
I was counting on it.
But I-I didn't kill Frank.
It's the price we pay for the thing we want the most.
I didn't kill him.
Do you remember Edward, your first love?
Told you he was in love with another woman.
He broke your heart.
Oh.
And Carlos...
Who betrayed you the same way?
No, oh, it's not...
And Michael...
Oh, no.
Who used you?
And Dominick?
No, it...
And all the others...
No, no.
Through the years?
No.
It's not true.
It's not true.
Oh, come.
Shh.
Shh.
I'll take care of the mess.
And when you wake up in the morning,
I promise you, you'll feel like a brand-new woman.
Mr. Doran.
Morning, Gavin.
Good morning.
I thought you would be interested to know that we closed the deal with the Alpern group late last night.
Congratulations.
Although I can't imagine anyone wanting to live there given how toxic the lot next door is.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
Look, Gavin, I c...
I couldn't say anything.
I wanted to, but, uh... you did the right thing.
You're not upset?
That you didn't abuse your position to curry favor with me?
The world is full of temptations, Henry.
People with integrity are rare.
Well, I'm still sorry, for what it's worth.
No hard feelings.
I flipped the property this morning to a Chinese investor before the news broke.
I cleared $20 million.
You had an ace up your sleeve?
I always do.
All right.
Well, I, uh, I better get to work.
Enjoy the day.
It's gonna be a hot one.
Guess you were right.
I knew he wouldn't bite.
He's a stand-up kid.
So he passed your little test.
Mm-hmm.
He's perfect.
He's a boy scout, Gavin.
No, no.
He is going to be a hero.
Mm.
Bye.
Oh, you're gonna end up putting me in the hospital, Lou.
I'm not getting back on that elevator.
Brian, why are all the curtains drawn?
It's like a cave in here.
No, let me help you.
I don't want you to strain yourself.
Is there mail?
Yeah.
Oh.
Wow.
All this?
I was only gone a few days.
Bills, bills, more bills.
What's this?
Hmm?
Who's it from?
It's from, uh, Gavin Doran.
An apology.
Guess he knows I'm gonna sue his ass.
Honey.
Hmm?
Gavin just gave us $300,000.
I'm feeling better already.
That's great.
His supervisor suggests we look for him at the bottom of whiskey bottle.
Great.
That's helpful.
Yeah.
I'll find you another exterminator.
Thank you.
That's not necessary, Tony.
Those birds never bothered anyone before.
Have the wall in Barlow's apartment closed up.
Just leave them alone?
They've probably been nesting there for 50 years.
The Drake is their home, too.
Oh, well, then, I'll, uh,
I'll take it off my list.
I-I should probably get back to work, though.
But thanks, Gavin.
Mm.
And, Jane, you might want to take care of that mess down in the basement.
Oh, okay.
I'll...
I'll get on that.
Good morning, Jane.
Danielle, hey.
How was your, uh, your date last night?
Go figure.
He canceled.
Oh, I'm sorry.
His loss.
That's right.
Anyway, I gotta run.
Can we, uh, can we catch up later?
Sure.
Great.
Tell Henry I say hi.
She's sweet.
Mm-hmm.
Lucky to have found someone like Henry.
"Finding love makes it worth the pain of searching for it."
I think I've heard that before, somewhere.
Mm-hmm.
I hope it's true.
Somebody?
Aah!
Previously on "666 Park Avenue"...
Nice digs.
We have an interview.
Henry Martin, Jane Van Veen.
For the manager position.
Welcome.
Mr. Doran likes to approve every tenant himself.
Obviously, whatever you guys said won him over.
She's how we get Henry.
What happened to the previous manager?
Why would anybody ever want to leave this?
I'm Louise.
I think you met my husband Brian.
Kind of nerdy cute.
Hey, honey, come meet my new assistant.
Brian, this is Alexis.
Can you believe it?
She lives right across the street, actually.
Washer number three is leaking.
Anything else I should know?
Well, there's a thief in the building.
I'll keep an eye out.
I like your necklace.
It's not right what you do.
What I do is fulfill needs.
Oh!
Oh, my God.
Aah!
You signed a binding contract.
Now it's time to settle up.
Aah!

Wait.
I-I don't understand.
Barlow used to live here, now he doesn't.
It's not that complicated.
No, I mean, why didn't he tell me he was moving out?
Well, you've been here, like, a week.
Why would he tell you anything?
Because I'm the new manager.
I'm supposed to get told.
And besides, people don't just up and move like that.
I mean, there's paperwork to fill out, I-I-I think.
Mr. Doran took care of the paperwork.
He and Barlow, they got close after the guy's wife took her high dive off bellevue.
This right here, this is just a... it's a favor for him, all right?
Sure.
Great.
Where's all this being shipped?
Vegas.
Help me, uh, count the boxes.
Sure.
What'd you get?
Uh, 23.
Me, too.
I got a lot of work to do on this place.
Gotta resurface the floors, redo the kitchen...
Install new fixtures, and we should really look at some of those sconces as w... yeah.
Now?
Sconces.
All right.
I'll be down in a minute.
The, uh, party planner and her entourage have arrived.
It's gonna be quite the soiree tonight at the Dorans.
I'm looking forward to it.
Hmm.
Oh, sorry, Tony.
You weren't invited?
Oh, no, actually, I, uh, I got a prior engagement.
Oh.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Of course.
All right.
Take it easy.
Aah!
Aah!
Hey.
Tony, Barlow's apartment, there are birds in the walls.
Uh, it's an old building.
Probably lots of things in the walls.
They flew right out of the wall and broke through a window upstairs.
We gotta call an exterminator.
This is serious.
Yeah, yeah, look, look, I got one elevator down, and it's making my life miserable.
I need it fixed today.
Yeah, yeah, it's the one that almost ate that lady.
Yeah, that one.
All right.
I sent Louise flowers from all of us, by the way.
Of course you did.
This is the exterminator we use.
You're the resident manager, you call.
Thanks, Tony.
I'll take care of it.
You know, Tony, uh, by the way,
I didn't take the job from you, okay?
Mr. Doran hired us.
Oh, I know that, Jane.
Thanks.
Oh, Nona, hey.
What's up?
You mentioned that there's a thief in the building.
I... well, it looks like I'm the latest victim.
Oh, no.
Yeah, uh, my...
my grandmother's necklace.
It's irreplaceable.
I'll keep an eye out.
Thanks.
Hey, Jane.
Don't mess with the birds.
They're part of the Drake.
Hey.
Just talked to the doctor a... here.
What are you doing?
Let me help.
All right.
Let me help.
I'm not an invalid, Brian.
No, but you're still on the mend.
Mending is really boring.
You gotta stop complaining.
You know, the doctor thinks that you only have to be here a few more nights.
What?
That is not a long time for a girl that got crushed by an elevator.
And...
Honestly, babe, uh, a collapsed lung and a concussion are really serious.
So are some of the bills we have.
I can't get out there and land a job until I get out of here.
You still have that one gig.
Actually, they said they weren't gonna hire me again.
That's ridiculous, Lou.
You were in an accident.
Oh, they know.
They sent those.
Look, they're vindictive fashionistas who were inconvenienced.
Yeah, it sucks.
Actually, will you get the nurse?
My Vicodin's wearing off.
Yeah, sure.
I'm back.
Alexis, thank God.
Oh, thank you.
Now this is how you save a life.
How are you?
Uh, I'm fine.
Is that stuff from our apartment?
Almost forgot.
Here you go.
Here's your key.
I'm late.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Whoa.
Wow.
You look stunning.
Hey, thanks for getting the wine.
Of course, of course.
So you wouldn't believe this guy in the wine shop.
He was trying to push an $800 bottle of wine on me.
Have you ever heard of Chateau Monique?
No.
Yeah, well, he couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it either.
But you'll be happy to know,
I held firm on a bottle of Merlot for 20 bucks.
That's what the Dorans use in their salad dressing.
I'm gonna hop in the shower.
I'm funny.
How was your day?
What, you didn't get my text?
The one about you being attacked by birds?
That wasn't an autocorrect mistake?
No.
I got, like, tippi hedren attacked.
They flew right out of the wall of an apartment upstairs.
It was crazy.
And I still can't figure out where they came from.
Did you provoke 'em?
No, I didn't provoke them.
I know how you are, Jane.
Get in the shower.
I love you.
Mwah.
Jane, Henry, there you are.
I'm sorry we're late.
It's my fault.
Oh, Olivia, this is amazing.
Here.
Uh, for you and Gavin.
Oh, how thoughtful.
Help yourself to a drink.
The bar is straight ahead.
Uh, Adriana.
E-excuse me.
I love your dress.
Uh, what do you want to drink?
Uh, something with vodka, please.
Okay.
Uh, Henry, this is Danielle.
She lives in the building.
Hey.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.
The Sushi's excellent, by the way.
Oh, yeah?
I was just telling your lovely wife... oh.
Um...
Not your wife?
Yes, lovely.
Uh, no, not married.
Oh, well, not yet.
I can tell Henry is a keeper.
Well, I like to think so.
Thank you, darling.
Thank you.
Go on in, take a look.
32 stories tall, just off the West Side highway at 43rd street... condos and office space.
Looks impressive.
It will be.
It's just a steel frame now.
These guys are in some kind of financing squeeze.
They're desperate to get out.
The Alpern development group.
You probably heard about it.
Alpern, yeah, it sounds familiar.
I'm picking this project up for a song... lands, construction costs, air rights... all of it.
Uh, if... if you don't mind me asking, what's a song go for these days?
$100 million.
That stays between us.
Uh, yeah, of course.
Hey.
There you are.
I was just inside talking to Gavin.
Whew.
Mm-hmm.
Wow.
Yeah.
Can you believe this view?
I could get used to it.
Hmm.
Well, enjoy it while you can.
We turn back into pumpkins at midnight.
You've met our new building managers?
Oh, hi, Gavin.
You caught me staring.
Yes, they're very nice.
Mm.
You here with someone?
Like a date?
No.
I find that hard to believe.
It's not for lack of trying.
Mm.
"Finding love makes it worth the pain of searching for it."
Someone said that to me once.
They never tried Internet dating.
Mm.
Actually, I'm going out with someone tomorrow night.
Magic could happen...
In theory.
There's a restaurant in the flatiron district that's very romantic.
I'll call the maitre d'.
He'll take care of you and your gentleman.
That's nice, Gavin.
Thanks.
Never hurts to stack the deck.
Henry.
Hmm?
I think I left the clothes in the dryer.
Why not tomorrow?
Because there's a thief in the building.

I got 15 minutes to get downtown.
Have you seen my black socks anywhere, babe?
Yeah, did you check the, uh, laundry basket?
Um, I... did I?
Of course.
You know, I'm thinking red is a really nice contrast with the green skin tone you have going on this morning.
Yeah, well, for the record, I feel much worse on the inside.
Mm.
All right.
I love you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to mention, I, uh, kind of invited the Dorans to dinner tomorrow night.
I'm sorry.
You kind of what?
Look, Jane, it's not like we can afford to take 'em out.
And you're an amazing cook, Jane.
Oh, Henry, I have to cook for billionaires?
Fine.
If you want me to cancel, I will.
I'll just tell 'em I was drunk.
You so totally owe me.
I so totally owe you.
I hate to, but I'm gonna late.
You're the best.
One elevator is still down.
We're just waiting on final inspection.
Well, use the freight elevator if you're in a hurry.
Yeah.
All right.
Have a good day.
15 calls, same question.
Hey, Tony, uh, you ever hear about a murder that happened at the Drake?
A murder?
Um...
Uh, no, no.
There's been a few suicides over the years, and a bunch of...
bunch of accidents.
You know, one guy... one guy actually fell out his own window.
Idiot.
But, uh...
But no murders that I can recollect, no.
Oh.
Why do you want to know about a murder?
J-just wondering.
You're kind of creepy, aren't you?
What?
No.
Yeah, you are.
I can tell.
Your guy's here.
I'm the exterminator.
No kidding.
Want to take a look?
It's an old ventilation shaft.
Wow.
It's not on any of the drawings I have.
This kind of brick here... part of the original construction.
Look down.
Oh, my God.
There's hundreds of them.
Starlings.
Biggest nesting murmuration I've ever seen in a building.
What?
Murmuration.
It's what you call starlings.
Collectively, I mean.
You know, like, uh, a gaggle of geese, a kit of pigeons, a murder of crows.
There's lots of names for birds.
My personal favorite... an exaltation of larks.
That should keep 'em in the hole.
So, uh, what do you think?
Can you get rid of 'em?
Shouldn't be a problem.
I'll kill 'em all.
Jane, hey.
Brian, hey, uh, we're having a small ventilation issue in the building.
Uh, we're checking apartments on every floor.
Can we...
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Great.
Do what you gotta do.
There's a couple of birds stuck in an air shaft.
It's nothing.
Oh.
You good?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
So, uh, so how's Louise feeling?
Uh, bored to death.
You know, but other than that, better.
Good.
I'm gonna visit tomorrow.
She'd love the company.
You know, Brian, your apartment is... is so cool.
I love the photographs.
Yeah, that's all Lou.
She's got the style.
My contribution is the, uh, messy area... there.
So how's the play coming?
I-I thought I closed those curtains.
Mm.
Yeah, lots of, uh, lots of distractions, huh?
Uh, I-I, uh,
I keep them closed when I... when I write.
Looks good here.
Wall's solid.
Okay.
Uh, Brian, thanks for everything.
Sure.
Okay.
All right.
Uh, see you around.
Oh.
If they ventilated down this far, the air shaft should be behind this wall.
Yeah, except there's no way to access it.
There is.
Someone covered up a door right here.
A door?
Hey, you ever consider, whoever covered this door with concrete might have had a good reason to do it?
There could be a lot of reasons.
I still want you to demo that wall.

Let me buy you a consolation drink.
You were right.
It's...
it's very romantic here.
It's not a good place to sit alone.
Alone seems to be a running theme in my life lately.
I'm having a drink with a friend.
Come and join us.
I'm gonna go home.
Well... he was hoping to meet you.
One drink.
One drink.
Hi there.
Frank Alpern.
Danielle.
Pleasure to meet you.
You too.
Join us for a drink?
Sure.
You gonna kill the birds?
Jeez.
You scared me.
You shouldn't be doing that.
Uh...
I'm just helping 'em find a new home.
You're gonna make them upset.
You know, uh,
I don't usually work with an audience.
Whatever.
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much for getting me lunch.
You're welcome.
Uh, so you're, uh, you're feeling better?
Better.
Honestly, it could've been so much worse.
I mean, if Brian hadn't been there...
I-I know.
I mean, you're lucky, I guess.
They ever figure out what happened?
Uh, well, we had the elevators inspected yesterday.
Um... but they couldn't find anything wrong.
All the safety mechanisms seem to be working.
So what does that mean?
Clearly, there's an issue.
I-I'm gonna talk to Gavin about it.
That thing was possessed.
I swear, it felt like it was trying to kill me.
Someone else is gonna get hurt, Jane.
It's gonna happen.
What's this?
A... a lawyer?
He's a personal injury attorney.
He thinks I have a real case.
You're gonna sue Gavin?
I'm strongly considering it.
I'm missing out on work.
I've...
I've lost a lot of money because of this accident.
I don't know.
We have some serious bills.
I-I'm sorry, Louise.
I-I probably shouldn't get in the middle of this.
Uh...
Right.
Anyway, I should probably go.
Um, I gotta go to the grocery store then home to cook dinner, so...
Oh, just you and Henry tonight, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, just me and, uh, me and Henry.
Sweet.
Oh!
God, I'm sorry.
Oops.
Where are you guys off to all dressed up?
Oh, someone has a big night out.
It's an excuse to go shopping.
I kind of met someone last night.
Well, that's great.
I'll let you know what happens.
When you see what she's gonna be wearing,
I'll tell you what's gonna happen.
Fingers crossed.
Nona?
"1956."
What the hell?
"The victim, Edward Paxton,
"a longtime resident of the Drake,
"was found murdered in his home.
The killer remains at large."
Hey, babe.
Hey, the Dorans are gonna be here any minute.
Uh, start chopping.
Did you get my text?
Um, yes.
So, yeah, what, you... you had a dream someone was murdered at the Drake, and it came true?
No.
Well, yes.
Okay, I-I found an article about a guy who was killed here in 1956.
And it turns out it was the same guy that was in my dream.
But I had the dream before I read about it.
Explain that to me.
Memory is unreliable, and our brain mixes things up all the time.
Nope, not mine and not about that.
Okay, so you're clairvoyant.
So answer me this... am I getting fired?
Okay, what?
I shouldn't even be telling you this.
It... it sounds like you should be telling me this.
Okay, so the other night when we were at the Dorans,
Gavin showed me this building that he's buying.
It's $100 million.
Oh, my God.
They're gonna hate my pot roast.
Babe, focus.
Sorry.
What?
Okay, so I found out at work that the building sits right next to an old industrial lot.
It turns out that lot has soil levels of arsenic and chromium that are off the charts.
What does that mean?
What it... it means, it's a toxic wasteland.
So if Gavin closes the deal with the, um...
Oh, with the...
with the Alpern group,
I mean, he's screwed.
Like he's $100-million screwed.
Well, then you gotta tell him, Henry.
Yeah, babe, I have to tell him, and then the leak gets traced back to me, and I'm done, and we're back in Indiana.
Okay, what are you gonna do?
I-I don't know.
I'm gonna pretend I know nothing about what I know for the next two hours, and then quietly freak out after they leave.
Maybe inviting them over wasn't such a good idea.
Hi.
Hi, Gavin.
Hi.
Welcome.
Come on in.
Please.
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.
Something smells delicious.
Mwah.
Mm.
For you.
Oh, Gavin, thank you so much.
Henry.
Chateau Monique.
Mm-hmm.
Our favorite.
What the hell are you looking at?
Oh, knock it off.
Damn it!
Ah!
Aah!
Get off me.
Oh.
Oh!
What the hell are you doing?
Get outta here.
You closed the curtains.
I wanted to see you.
How did you get in here?
You know how.
Made a key.
You've been watching me from your window.
I know you want me.
You need to leave.
Right now.
Really?
Yeah.
I want you to leave.
Jane, you are an amazing cook.
Mm.
Oh, thank you.
I know pot roast screams '50s housewife, but I've never had a complaint.
There's nothing wrong with being a little old-fashioned.
This is delicious.
Mm.
You should tell them who taught you how to cook.
Would I know the chef?
Probably not.
Uh, it was my grandmother.
Uh, I always helped her cook Sunday night dinner growing up.
Uh, she was convinced that cooking a proper roast would help me find a proper husband, so...
You want to talk about old-fashioned...
Well, it would've worked on me.
Speaking of husbands, what are your plans together?
Well, uh, sure.
E-eventually.
Right?
How long have you two been together?
Mm.
What is it...
Uh...
Like four... uh, almost five years.
Yeah, five years.
You know, it's something we've... we've talked about, but we're...
Not in any rush.
Oh, I wouldn't wait too long.
Men like Henry get snatched up pretty quickly in this city.
It's a jungle out there.
No, that's not true.
Come on.
I'm serious.
He was jealous.
He did not just keep forgetting to bring my drink.
Jealous and passive-aggressive?
Well... maybe he was just a bad waiter.
Nah.
I saw the way he was looking at you.
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
Well...
What way was that?
Kind of like I am right now.
So what happens now?
Do you want me?
Tell me.
I want you.
So Jane discovered an interesting bit of history today about the Drake.
Is that right?
Yeah, apparently, there was a... murder in the building back in, uh, 1956.
Did you know about this?
Well, I'm old, but I'm not that old.
That was long before my time at the Drake.
Uh, the victim was a man named Edward Paxton.
They never caught his killer.
Sounds terrible.
Where did you get this paper?
This looks like an original copy.
Oh, uh, at the... the library.
Oh.
Fascinating.
I love a murder mystery.
It happened at the Drake.
Where exactly?
Uh, apartment 7g.
Who's in that apartment, honey?
Our friend Danielle Tyler.
Oh.
Mm.
Mm.
Henry.
Hmm?
Sometimes, like...
With the birds in the walls and...
That door I keep seeing...
I know it sounds crazy, but...
I feel like the building's trying to tell me something.
I don't know what it is yet.
Wait.
I hear it.
It's saying good night.
Good night.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
I gotta get home.
Please stay with me tonight.
Don't.
I thought we were both gonna be adults here.
What does that mean?
It means, my wife is gonna kill me if I don't get home tonight.
Come on.
Don't look at me like that.
You knew what the deal was.
I never took off my wedding ring.
You didn't have one.
I looked.
I did.
I know I did.
Right.
Look...
I gotta go.
No.

Oh!
Gavin.
Please help me.
I don't...
I don't know what happened.
Looks to me like Frank Alpern got what he deserved.
What?
He was a cheat.
Tried to screw me over in a deal that he knew was bad.
Oh.
And what he did to you, leading you on like that...
I don't blame you for getting upset.
On the contrary.
I was counting on it.
But I-I didn't kill Frank.
It's the price we pay for the thing we want the most.
I didn't kill him.
Do you remember Edward, your first love?
Told you he was in love with another woman.
He broke your heart.
Oh.
And Carlos...
Who betrayed you the same way?
No, oh, it's not...
And Michael...
Oh, no.
Who used you?
And Dominick?
No, it...
And all the others...
No, no.

No.

It's not true.
Oh, come.
Shh.
Shh.
I'll take care of the mess.
And when you wake up in the morning,
I promise you, you'll feel like a brand-new woman.
Mr. Doran.
Morning, Gavin.
Good morning.
I thought you would be interested to know that we closed the deal with the Alpern group late last night.
Congratulations.
Although I can't imagine anyone wanting to live there given how toxic the lot next door is.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
Look, Gavin, I c...
I couldn't say anything.
I wanted to, but, uh... you did the right thing.
You're not upset?
That you didn't abuse your position to curry favor with me?
The world is full of temptations, Henry.
People with integrity are rare.
Well, I'm still sorry, for what it's worth.
No hard feelings.
I flipped the property this morning to a Chinese investor before the news broke.
I cleared $20 million.
You had an ace up your sleeve?
I always do.
All right.
Well, I, uh, I better get to work.
Enjoy the day.
It's gonna be a hot one.
Guess you were right.
I knew he wouldn't bite.
He's a stand-up kid.
So he passed your little test.
Mm-hmm.
He's perfect.
He's a boy scout, Gavin.
No, no.
He is going to be a hero.
Mm.
Bye.
Oh, you're gonna end up putting me in the hospital, Lou.
I'm not getting back on that elevator.
Brian, why are all the curtains drawn?
It's like a cave in here.
No, let me help you.
I don't want you to strain yourself.
Is there mail?
Yeah.
Oh.
Wow.
All this?
I was only gone a few days.
Bills, bills, more bills.
What's this?
Hmm?
Who's it from?
It's from, uh, Gavin Doran.
An apology.
Guess he knows I'm gonna sue his ass.
Honey.
Hmm?
Gavin just gave us $300,000.
I'm feeling better already.
That's great.
His supervisor suggests we look for him at the bottom of whiskey bottle.
Great.
That's helpful.
Yeah.
I'll find you another exterminator.
Thank you.
That's not necessary, Tony.
Those birds never bothered anyone before.
Have the wall in Barlow's apartment closed up.
Just leave them alone?
They've probably been nesting there for 50 years.
The Drake is their home, too.
Oh, well, then, I'll, uh,
I'll take it off my list.
I-I should probably get back to work, though.
But thanks, Gavin.
Mm.
And, Jane, you might want to take care of that mess down in the basement.
Oh, okay.
I'll...
I'll get on that.
Good morning, Jane.
Danielle, hey.
How was your, uh, your date last night?
Go figure.
He canceled.
Oh, I'm sorry.
His loss.
That's right.
Anyway, I gotta run.
Can we, uh, can we catch up later?
Sure.
Great.
Tell Henry I say hi.
She's sweet.
Mm-hmm.
Lucky to have found someone like Henry.
"Finding love makes it worth the pain of searching for it."
I think I've heard that before, somewhere.
Mm-hmm.
I hope it's true.
Somebody?
Aah!
Someone said that death might end a life, but for the survivor, the relationship struggles on, seeking resolution it may never find.
I suppose we should have guessed that the death of one of us would bring us back together, but none of us are under any illusion that time heals.
Ms Pugh?
Ewan Fleming, Gibson and Parks, Solicitors.
It was they who raised the alarm.
The police broke down the door, bit of a make do and mend job, I'm afraid.
Once the post-mortem confirmed death as natural causes, the police got in a company to disinfect the place.
As executor of the will, you'll need to settle the charge from the estate.
The chemicals, when they sanitised it.
Under the terms of the will, you and the other legatees can dispose of any personal items as you choose.
Are they coming today, too?
Mmm.
Is it right you all lived together?
"Former flatmates", it says in the will.
We lost touch... over the years.
When probate is complete, the flat will be sold, all debts discharged, after which, the estate will be divided between you and the others.
Drop them off at your convenience.
How long was it, before they found the...
Two weeks.
Joy of city life, eh?
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
Thanks, bye.
Next six!
The old man bought the lease.
Cheaper than shelling out on rent, which makes me a landlord.
As a paid-up member of the "all property is theft" club, the joke is on me.
A shared one, three guineas a week, needs decorating and shit, like the others.
The other single, fiver a week.
And the double is across the hall.
Which one are you again?
Charlotte Pugh.
I like.
I'm not about to lay a load of crap about cleaning rotas on you, just set out a kind of modus operandi about living here.
We have a chance to challenge the status quo, prove there's an alternative socio-economic model to live by other than the nuclear bloody family, by sharing our labour, our energy, our resources.
Like a commune?
Works for them in China.
Didn't they abolish landlords in China?
Execute them?
Your name?
Harper.
Alan.
Alan.
That's OK, thanks.
OK, see what I'm trying to say, Alan, is, what's the point in social mobility if we just carry the same tired old values around with us, you know?
So what we do is we construct a model of living based on equality, based on the welfare of the group, rather than the selfish needs of the individual.
Up to, and including, sex.
Aren't all relationships just another form of ownership?
What is he on about?
Eliminate the exclusivity of couples, you eliminate jealousy and all the corrosive shit which goes with it, so we make a rule.
No sleeping with the same person, flatmates included, on more than three consecutive nights.
What sort of godless set up are you running here?
I want no part of it, frankly.
Better out than in, as they say.
Let's take a vote.
All those in favour of the godless set up, as outlined?
OK.
Great.
Message received.
Over and out.
I'll let you know.
Send up the next lot, will you?
'Since his stroke, the silent vigil for Churchill's recovery continues 'as the whole country prays for him 'in this, his darkest hour.
'His defiant vow, "We shall never surrender"
'has never been more apt.'
Amen to that, eh?
The girl who owns the flat you saw, is she at your college, too?
What does it matter?
If I was one of the chosen few I'd have heard by now.
Susan Reynolds from Girl Guides.
She has a flat in Marble Arch.
Her mother says she's looking for someone to share with.
She's an air hostess now.
She'll be away half the time.
You'd have the place to yourself.
Where's the fun in that, eh?
The point is to be near college for her studies, isn't it?
Doesn't preclude her having a bit of fun, does it?
I didn't say it did.
Leave space for the crumble.
Mum's OK about this, isn't she?
If I do move out?
Nothing stays the same.
She has to face that, like the rest of us.
We only have one life, after all.
Hello.
Hello.
'First US combat troupes deployed in Vietnam have...'
'All day long there's been a sort of pilgrimage to Sir Winston's house.
'Families have come in from the country, young couples...'
No, sorry, no, north, the signal comes from Alexandra Palace.
Damned thing isn't thickening.
That's it.
Everyone, this is Lilly.
Lilly, everyone.
Hiya.
Lilly's studying painting at...
Where was it?
Hornsey College of Art.
I'm Jay.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Charlotte.
Hi.
Come and get it.
You know what, I've just clocked it!
I've just clocked it!
I've just clocked why he's chosen us.
Jack, why he's chosen us, in particular.
We're his guinea pigs!
His what?
Exactly.
His socio-economic mix.
Think about it, he's got the class thing covered, hasn't he?
Race, you know, and you.
He's got the professions covered... computing, medicine, English, law, art and...
Psychology.
Yeah, and that.
So he's hand-picked every one of us, to conduct his social experiment.
Well, I'm not sure anybody is quite that cynical.
Do you want to bet?
Cheers.
Jack?
Grubs up!
Hold it in, don't exhale.
It's crap what they say, how it's an escape from reality.
You know when you get the feeling life is utterly bloody futile?
You light up, it lifts you up.
Instead of looking into the abyss, you're standing on the edge of the world.
You're invincible.
Feel anything yet?
How about this?
Is that part of your social experiment, too?
It's about being in the moment.
Seeing where it takes you.
It's quite a drop.
Be careful.
Oh, I will be.
You know the way.
Lilly.
God, is it really 20 years?
I don't believe it.
Anyone else here yet?
Uh, no.
I'm going to make a start in the kitchen, so maybe you could do one of the bedrooms, upstairs?
Is that where it happened?
Mmm.
Charlie?
There's not been a day when I haven't regretted what I did to you.
Not a day.
Bloody hell!
Wish we'd never started the damn thing!
It's supposed to be smooth like a mirror, give an illusion of bloody space.
Right, I'll see you later!
Good luck with it!
Bye, love.
Bye.
Where do you reckon it is she goes every evening?
Library, she says.
Maybe it's confession.
Do you know what her mother told her?
That periods are called the curse, because it's God's curse on us for Eve eating the apple.
So much for your benign deity.
You been seeing anyone since coming to London?
You?
How about back home?
Only a few local lads, from school and that, you know.
No-one special.
So you didn't...
Do it with any of them?
Go the whole way?
The first time was my 16th birthday present to myself.
I couldn't wait to get it out the way, see what the fuss was about.
You?
A girl in my class at the high school.
In the middle of her O-levels, she suddenly drops out of school, drops out of sight.
I had this Saturday job at the local supermarket, on the till.
There was always this endless queue of women with their kids, stretching back as far as the eye could see.
They all looked so... tired.
One day, I looked up, she was one of them.
Pushing a pram.
There but for the grace of a benign deity...
Still, all good things are worth waiting for, eh?
Then again, maybe I'll die chaste and virginal, like Orla.
It may not be worth the wait, love.
Trust me, it's just not the big deal everyone says it is.
Rent time, girls.
Oh, hold on, I left my bag downstairs.
Cheers.
Thank you.
Thing about your benign deity...
It works in mysterious ways.
Thanks.
Derivative, vacuous, pointless.
You want to paint by numbers, go do it in someone else's class, better yet, go work it out in a gym.
Is that what you call "constructive criticism"?
If it's any comfort, I'd not put myself out unless I thought you had something going for you, would I?
Please, God, say you're not falling for that crap.
This is the one place a woman can take her clothes off and become invisible.
Sitting there all day, you see things, hear things.
You won't be the first notch on his belt, dear... or the last.
Could be your heating element... or the capacitor and, if it is, I'm wasting my time.
Here she is!
Mum, Dad.
We came down to pay our respects to Mr Churchill.
Near on 300 people there were.
Some had stood there all night.
That's unusual.
He'll pull through yet.
He's nowt if he's not a fighter.
This is Victor, he's on a law scholarship from Jamaica.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
You never said you were sharing with a...
With lads.
We need to talk, love.
Is there somewhere we can...
No, no, look, I've got things I need to do upstairs.
So I'll...
It was very nice meeting you both.
Don't jump down our throats.
Just hear us out.
It's your Aunt Helen.
She's, erm, she's broke her hip.
She needs somebody to help her out in the shop.
And she says if you, if you come back, she'll train you up and when the time comes, she'll sign the lease over to you.
It's the only drapery in Heaton - guaranteed custom, regular clients.
Set you up for life, a place like that.
If I did that secretarial course you said I could go to art college, that were the deal.
You can still do your art and such on Sundays, can't you?
There's no future in it, love.
It's never going to put food on the table, is it?
It's not for the likes of us.
When the novelty of it wears off, and it will, you'll wake up, see the world as it is, not as you wish it to be.
It may be too late.
You'll have burnt your boats.
Bridges.
It's burning bridges.
And they're mine to burn.
When I was at school, my mam and dad used to go on at us,
"You've opportunities we never had.
"Work hard, get your exams, get ahead."
It was all fine while I was doing my degree up in Newcastle, but when I moved down here for me post grad, it was a whole different tune.
"Newcastle wasn't good enough for me anymore.
"Now that I lived down here, I was above them all."
They thought I was leaving them all behind.
They were right.
'In the four hours since the last bulletin 'there has been no further deterioration.'
'It was about an hour and a half ago that Lord Moran,
'Sir Winston's personal physician came out...'
'and the essay, The Personal Is Political, do you think that means liberation for women lies in our personal experience?
'
'It means we'll only realise our potential 'if we transform our relationships with men.
'The contraceptive pill has given us the freedom 'to explore sexual intimacy, without fear of pregnancy.
'But so long as it's only available to married women, the rest of us, 'the majority of us, are denied that freedom.
'And if our sexuality is stifled, so is our potential.'
Orla?
'I started off in the hotel kitchen,' dishwasher and dogsbody.
Now I've graduated to the heady heights of chambermaid.
You have a grant, don't you, like the rest of us?
Most of it goes back home.
You have to eat too, Orla.
They can't expect you to just...
They don't expect it.
I choose to do it.
In Belfast, if you're a Catholic...
Six years my father's been without work.
My mum holds down two cleaning jobs and it's not enough, with four wee ones to feed.
Don't be worrying about me, I'll get by.
How?
Slinking around eating our scraps?
I don't want the others knowing, Jay.
I embarrass them enough as it is.
I don't always feel I belong here.
Don't give away too much of yourself, Orla.
There'll be nothing left for the rest of us.
Night.
Night.
Morning.
Morning.
That tea dead?
Any chance someone can cover my shift cooking tonight?
I'm late on an assignment.
I can, if it helps.
You're a saint, Victor, so you are.
All right.
Are you done?
Yes, thank you.
You don't have to do that, Victor.
Wait on us.
Just doing me share.
Have you heard?
Did you hear?
'It's said that Sir Winston died.
Churchill's died... 'shortly after 8.00 this morning.
'Parliament will meet tomorrow to authorise a state funeral, 'the first held for a commoner in this country.'
Some commoner, with his title and his country pile.
'For a generation, he led his people through the darkness of war.
'He was an inspiration, rallying them to victory...'
God, what bollocks!
Show a bit of bloody respect.
What do you want?
A chorus of Rule Britannia?
We'd be in a damn sorry state without him.
Tell that to people in the East End and Coventry.
When the Germans invaded Belgium, did he order them to bomb the Panzers?
No, no.
He sent them to bomb innocent civilian German cities and he calls Coventry in "The Blitz war crimes".
Call that heroism, if you want.
Me, I call it hypocrisy.
You know what they say, takes one to know one.

Do you know what, Jack?
What?
I have never, never met anyone so full of pre-digested crap as you are.
Victor, give it a bloody rest!
Slavery is over, haven't you heard?
You are a truly unique human being, Jack.
One of a kind.
Victor?
He's right, I'm full of crap.
It's like Malcolm X said, man...
"No-one will give you equality, you have to take it."
I'm sorry, I lost the plot.
Am I proud of it?
No.
Will it happen again?
Almost certainly.
What's the thing in The Third Man, Harry Lime says,
"If one of those dots stopped moving for ever, what would you feel?"
If you feel nothing, what does that say about you, about your humanity?
Or is all altruism just self-serving bullshit?
It's because you feel, you get so angry.
That's the proof of it, surely.
Married how long?
Six months.
And your husband agrees to you taking oral contraception?
It's my decision, not his.
You wouldn't credit how many girls come here wearing a curtain ring from Woolworths, hoping to get the contraceptive pill.
They must think I'm a bloody halfwit.
We need to talk about your mother, Charlotte.
She's...
She's suffering.
It's the change.
She's just not coping with it.
She seems fine when we talk on the phone.
She doesn't want to be a burden, you know how she is.
It's the empty nest thing.
Keeps saying her life is over.
I've got so much going on at work.
I'm home all hours and...
So...
I thought, perhaps, if you could come home, just for a couple months, until she's through it.
Why me?
Why can't Adam or Peter move back?
Your brothers have their careers to think of, don't they?
You can commute, like you did your first term, can't you?
It wasn't so bad, was it?
I'll lose my room at the flat.
You can get another room later, once we've sorted your mother out.
If I thought I could meet her needs, then I would.
But I can't, not in this.
If you think that's easy to admit, think again.
Will you be going home at all this year?
Well, erm, my scholarship barely pays for my fees and my maintenance, so sadly, no.
You know all Jack's talk about poverty and inequality...
He knows nothing of them.
They are theoretical to him.
It's all just a way of him parading his radical credentials.
Dad!
It's 6.00 somewhere in the world.
Can you stay the night?
I've a lecture first thing.
Dad will be sorry to miss you.
He's home late, some panic at work.
This is a nice surprise.
Out of the blue.
I saw Daddy in London the other day, actually.
He was with someone.
From work?
Who knows?
I was with someone, too.
A boy.
It's not just girls sharing the flat.
It's boys, too.
And one is your boyfriend?
No.
I just... thought you should know.
Why the secrecy?
Or do you think I am so stuck in the dark ages I can't deal with it?
I used to blame the war for stealing my youth.
Then your father, for stealing my future.
I never blamed myself, naturally.
Someone, somewhere, is out there living the life I should have had, because I gave it away to the first man I met.
Hello?
Jack Walsh about?
Who wants to know?
His father.
He's just getting up.
On my way to the funeral.
I should have known he'd be dead to the world.
Churchill's funeral?
Mmm-hmm.
Hoping to get there myself later.
Can I get you a cup of tea?
If there's a cup free from infection.
5,000 at the rehearsal yesterday.
More heads of state clogging up Westminster than us bloody MPs.
Oh... you're an MP?
For my sins.
Wilson was sandbagging De Gaulle over dinner last night, about producing some Anglo-French supersonic airliner, so he claims.
Softening him up about the Common Market, more like.
Best of British with that one.
Thank God for Gallic obduracy, I say.
Ah, good morning.
We were just talking about Churchill.
I assume it's a vain hope you'll come with me to the funeral?
God, all that xenophobic pomp?
My stomach couldn't take it.
As you've no doubt you will have already observed, Alan, my son's respect is reserved for malodorous dictators, like Fidel Castro and Ho Chi Minh.
Pleasure meeting you, sir.
You, too, son.
Your mother ran into Mr Bradfield at the bank last week.
He tells me you're overdrawn again.
He's no right discussing it with you.
He's the manager and I am your guarantor.
That gives him the right.
Blame it on the cost of living in London.
You did choose to forego your place at Balliol.
Spare me the dreaming spires litany again...
Balliol would have opened doors for you, just as it did for me.
Doors which you have voluntarily elected to slam closed.
Debts are like children, begot in pleasure, bought forth in pain.
Courtesy of my son, I seem to have a spare ticket.
It's a reserved seat at St Paul's, for family and friends, if you're interested?
If you're sure, sir?
We could grab a bite at my club on the way.
And it's Edward.
Morning.
Morning.
Posh car.
So what are you, an earl, the right honourable someone?
My father and I, our disappointment in each other is mutual.
And terminal.
Join the club.
Best leave me to my own devices, Charlotte.
Daddy?
Someone's birthday?
House warming.
Hardly the best taste, today of all days.
Or that, either.
When did you start doing that?
Why are you here, Daddy?
I was up for the funeral, thought we might get something to eat.
Oh, is what's-her-name not available, then?
What?
The tart in the mini skirt I saw you kissing.
And don't insult me by telling me it was nothing.
I know what I saw.
Tell me, all the work trips over the years, all the late nights at the office, is she the first?
Or the 21st?
It's not like that.
What is it like?
She was my age, Daddy!
Younger, even!
I'm human, Charlotte.
I made a mistake.
Have some compassion, can't you?
Compassion?
Where was yours when you tried to talk me into moving back home, so you could shag your way around bloody London?
!
Whatever I've done, I'm still your father.
I deserve some damn respect!
Respect!
There's a word!
We'll do this some other time.
Tell me, Daddy, what do you think?
Is it too short?
Too sluttish?
But I'm your daughter, aren't I?
Different rules apply.
From now on, I make my own rules.
Fun day?
Aye.
Happy pill?
Huge personal sacrifice, but since it's you...
Orla!
Orla, please, let me in!
Let me in, Orla!
Orla, open the door.
You can't tell anyone, Orla!
Please not a word, promise me.
It'll finish me if you do.
Fuck.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck me.
What's the deal on that?
We'll never get equality in the boardroom until we get it in the bedroom, will we?
You know how long I've waited to meet someone like you?
I mean, finally...
Finally, a girl who doesn't confuse a bit of uncomplicated sex with the romantic crap about commitment and love.
I'd like a pound for every time
I've been sucked into that particular hell.
Bloody hell, I'm famished, aren't you?
Victor!
Charlotte?
She's at her folks tonight.
Doesn't it ever get to you, the way he goes with other girls?
Live dangerously, it's New Year's Eve!
Happy New Year!
It'll be all right, Orla.
We'll make it all right.
Show your abhorrence for American aggression in Vietnam!
Make a stand, for once.
Ho Chi Minh!
Ho Chi Minh!
Dan?
Yeah.
My dad's gone crazy.
He knows about us.
How the hell did he find out?
You sent him a text meant for me.
There's a room at ours.
I trusted you.
You're finished here.
Get your things.
You're my dad.
I'll be there for you and the baby.
xx
I don't know if I'm gonna keep it.
You're loaded and I want my share.
I want you to be my dad.
You haven't earned it yet.
Ho!
Ho!
Huh...
Bring it on.
Bring it on!
What are you up to?
Just sorting out some photos and stuff I don't need.
What brought this on?
Oh, my God.
Is that you?
Was that haircut fashionable?
Give me that.
Did they have scissors then?
At least I didn't have imaginary friends
Searing wit.
Cutting sarcasm.
What do you want, Max?
Did you talk to Dan?
Have you decided what...
Have you been to the hospital?
I had an abortion last week.
I was gonna tell you, but...
I dunno.
I decided to do it on my own.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
Sorry I didn't tell you.
I understand.
It's up to you, right?
I did the right thing.
Look at the mess my life is in.
It was the only decision.
Of course it was.
You didn't have to go through it on your own.
I know.
It was...
It was just easier that way.
Call that a kick?
Come on.
We're in.
Where is he?
I don't know but this place is weird.
Come on, then.
Let's just see what he wants.
No!
Well, look at this.
Finally have someone living here who actually buys food.
Better than that
- I am making us all Sunday lunch.
That's a result.
Max...
Oh, my God, they are so shagging.
They're not, actually.
See the way he jumps every time she claps?
Poor old Max is stuck in the friends zone.
Nothing is going to happen but it doesn't stop him hoping.
Well, what about me and you?
Or are we pretending that didn't happen?
No.
We're cool.
We are?
You've been avoiding me since we screwed each other's brains out and I wouldn't want things to be awkward now we're flatmates.
Fair enough.
Neither do I.
I'm here whenever you want me.
What does that mean?
Look, I'm having a shit time, I've got no money and my parents have disowned me because they think I'm a slut.
I don't need mind games with guys like you.
I need friends.
Like proper friends.
Think you can manage that?
Yeah.
Good.
It was a vicar, definitely.
He was scared, terrified.
But it wasn't in the asylum, it was in a church.
There are no churches here.
But what if the patients used to go to one near here?
Maybe one of them died here.
There's a church nearby.
You're not wasting time.
The quicker we act, the quicker solve things.
Then maybe no one gets hurt this time.
Don't you dare be late for lunch.
Yes, Mum.
Where did he say?
Somewhere in this building.
What is he doing here?
God knows.
Have I got something to show you two?
Why the hell did you ask us to come here, you nutter?
Can I help you?
Um, yeah, we were just looking for a venue for our wedding.
How lovely.
Hm.
We are a rather popular spot.
You could be looking at least a year's wait.
That is a shame.
We really like it, don't we?
We just have received a cancellation that's a mere two months away.
That sounds perfect.
I just need to have a word with my fiance.
What the hell are you doing?
Just trying to get him on side.
This isn't the place.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Oh.
What are we gonna do about...
I'm sorry, Max, I don't love you any more.
I'm leaving you for Benjy.
The wedding's off.
I mean, I always knew something was going on with her and Benjy.
The local asylum patients used to come here?
No, no, never.
But then, they had their own chapel.
Thank you.
I read this place was haunted but I didn't know there was a chapel.
It's perfect.
For what?
For conducting the rite of blasphemy!
And you wonder why people think you're a bit odd.
I don't care what people think.
Yes, you do.
Good to see you again.
It's been a while.
Come on, you nut job.
Let's get out of here.
No, no, I'm staying here.
I'm gonna perform the ritual, film it, stick it on the internet and prove the existence of evil.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
I seriously think there's something in here.
Just ignore him as a wind-up merchant.
I'm for real.
Come on, all this satanic stuff, sticking two fingers up to your dad.
The vicar is dead and he hasn't gone to heaven because it doesn't exist.
No.
See?
There's definitely something in here.
That's enough.
The joke is over.
Come on, let's just go.
No, I'm not going anywhere.
Alright, I'll stay with you.
What?
I'm not going down those freaky corridors on my own.
Hey, hey, chill.
Yeah?
Let's stay here and do the ritual together.
Come on.
This... is going to be fun.
It's about time we had a chat.
Hardly said a word to me all week.
Why don't we go for a beer?
We're just about to eat.
Oh.
Well, maybe another time.
You know what, why don't you join us?
Now we know there's a chapel here, it can't be hard to find.
I'm glad we got out of that one.
We could've ended up married.
That wouldn't have been such a bad thing.
Yeah, it would.
I think it's amazing how easy it was.
We totally had that vicar fooled.
We'd have a lovely wedding.
You in a white dress, frills, little bridesmaids running around.
I was supposed to be married not that long ago.
You're better off without him.
Max...
It's true.
I've never met the guy but he refused to stand by you when you really needed him.
That's a bit unfair.
Is it?
He thought I was losing my mind.
Not everyone is as open-minded about the supernatural as you are.
I would never have left you, no matter what you were going through.
You'll make a lovely husband one day.
You can have your big naff wedding on one condition.
Yeah, what's that?
I can be a bridesmaid.
And wear one of those big, pink, horrible, cheesy dresses.
Deal?
Deal.
Well, it's completely inedible.
You don't need to tell me.
No.
No, it's not bad.
Well, this is cosy.
I'm sorry.
If I sent a text to your father, it was an accident.
I never meant for him to find out.
Do you realise the situation I'm in?
How could I have been so stupid?
I'd like to help.
If you let me look after you...
This isn't the '50s.
Jesus.
That's not what I meant.
Just... if you wanted to move in.
Yeah.
That would really please my parents.
Anyway, she's happy here, aren't you, Keira?
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.
Please come and join us before I kill someone.
We'd love to but...
Uh.
You're joining us, now.
We'll have to look later.
That was Keira's first roast dinner.
You'd never have known.
Alright, give it a rest.
I know it was foul.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Who asked you?
Keira, come on.
Maybe things have changed.
Maybe you should accept that.
Er...
What have you two been up to?
Went for a walk, didn't we?
Must have been a long walk.
Yes, it was a lovely walk.
It was up a hill... and then we ran into your friend Benjy.
Oh, yeah, Benjy!
I see you haven't told them.
No, I haven't.
You haven't told people about your illegitimate Asian son.
We need to go and find that chapel, remember?
You're not exactly in a hurry.
I'm ready to tell the world when you are
Well, I'm not.
Not yet.
I thought you wanted this.
Don't rush me.
This is complicated stuff.
It's going to take a while.
Did you invite me in just to embarrass me?
I'll see you in the office tomorrow.
Have a good day.
Right, let's chill until the sun sets, then we begin.
You don't really want to do this, do you?
You just wanted us here.
And you came, didn't you?
Did you hear that?
If you're trying to scare us, you're doing a pretty shit job.
I dunno.
It's nothing.
That bloke was right.
This place is weird.
There's something here.
Don't you want to help me prove it?
Will you stop talking like that?
Look.
See, it's just an old font.
Big deal.
Yeah?
That's where they used to baptise babies.
Poor bastards.
Stop it, Liam.
You're giving me the creeps.
Trust me, this is our one chance...
You don't believe it yourself.
You're such a wind-up merchant.
There's evil in the world.
Where do you think it lives?
Places like this
I think it lives in your head.
You won't say that once I've summoned the spirit.
Yep, whatever, weirdo.
Shit!
Right, we gonna do this, or what?
I don't know what we're looking for.
A stained glass window or a steeple.
I don't know.
Um...
Listen...
I just got an errand to run.
Yeah?
Mex!
Five minutes.
Promise.
OK, you've completely lost it.
I'm having no part of this.
Au contraire, mon capitan!
So you're gonna upload it to all the geeks on the internet.
What are you trying to prove?
That religion is a lie.
That the Bible is propaganda.
You know what, if God does exist, he's a manipulative bastard that lets human beings drown in tsunamis, perish in tornados, get murdered, and languish in poverty.
And what for?
What for?
Nothing.
There is no God!
There is just evil and malevolence.
And what is what we're here to celebrate.
All of us.
Aren't we?
Liam...
Let's go home, yeah?
If you do it with me, yeah.
No way, I'm not doing this!
Oh...
Did the nasty ghost scare you?
There is no ghost.
Then you've got nothing to worry about.
Come on, man.
Simple.
We just recite the Lord's Prayer in negative.
Our Dark Lord, who art in hell.
Our Dark Lord, who art in hell.
Our Dark Lord, who art in hell.
Hideous be thy name.
I'm sorry, I can't...
Hideous be thy name.
Thy will be done.
Thy torment come.
Say it!
Alright.
Thy will be done, thy torment come.
In hell, as there is no heaven.
Give us...
You're going to get yourself killed.
It's not funny any more!
What the hell was that?
!
We are done here.
We're leaving!
Alright.
You bloody idiot!
I got what I wanted.
I got it on film.
You are out of your mind.
Come on, we did it.
Do you know what I mean?
Told you he'd try something even if we tried.
You don't know what you're messing with.
This is totally not funny.
Alright, I'm done.
We're cool.
Let's have another beer, smoke another spliff.
Give me that.
You alright, Taylor?
You look like you've seen a ghost, mate.
Come on, let's go home.
What is it?
!
I need a piss.
Go an have one, then.
Unless you're too scared.
I think your boyfriend is scared.
What are we going to do with you, Liam?
I'm having a piss.
Why don't you get lost?
You're not on shift tonight.
I know.
So, what are you doing here?
You meeting someone?
Silver bullet.
You knew I was looking to shut that blog down!
You knew it affected business!
You work here!
And you're making fun of me!
That's not how it was.
I'm not interested!
You have three days to get your stuff and you're out.
I'm not the only one with secrets.
Yeah?
Let me get this straight.
You talked Warren into thinking you're his son?
This is about money.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
You've no right listening to private conversations.
I wasn't listening.
I was by the door and you've got a loud voice.
I mean, Jesus, what are you up to?
It's true.
He is my father.
Of course he's not.
How could he be?
He just is, alright.
He had a fling with my mum.
Sorry to point out the obvious but you don't look like each other.
You're a totally different colour.
Wow.
I know it's hard for you in your cosy white world to understand but you can have parents of different races.
My mum was Asian.
My father, as it turns out, is not.
So you've always known about this.
My mum died last year.
She told me at the end.
I always thought my dad was my dad.
Turned out he wasn't.
Maybe no bad thing.
He's a scumbag anyway.
God, this is massive.
How come you wanted to find Warren?
I dunno.
I just wanted to know who he was.
Then sometimes I want to take everything he has.
I want him to pay for what he did.
I'm not a psychiatrist but it doesn't sound terribly healthy.
Yeah, I can see that.
I'm not sure what I'm really doing half the time.
I've done some pretty mental stuff.
Look...
Don't tell anyone.
Not yet.
Yeah.
"You're gonna get yourself killed!"
Uh-uh.
My head's spinning.
I think we've been rumbled.
Good, cos we need to get out of here.
You look really beautiful.
Oh, shut up.
You do.
You always look beautiful.
Hey, stay here a minute.
Don't move.
Don't move.
No, I'm being serious.
I really don't like this place.
What happened to you?
You used to be so much fun.
Liam.
He's tamed you.
We were 17...
and we needed to grow up.
Did we?
This isn't about me and you know it.
It is.
Our Father...
Spirit's returned.
Stop the games.
It's not me.
Who art in heaven...
Liam, make it stop.
Taylor should be back by now.
Taylor!
Hallowed is your name...
Taylor...
Taylor!
Taylor!
Taylor!
Where are you?
Our Father, who art in heaven
We've got trespassers.
I found them on Twitter.
Have you just seen something?
Look.
What are they up to?
What's the essay?
The Oedipus Complex in a post-Freudian society.
Sorry I asked.
No, it's fascinating.
Oedipus was this guy who killed his dad
- Yeah.
I know who Oedipus was.
Is this you pretending to be my friend?
I'm not pretending.
Really?
I don't think a friend would have humiliated me the way you did.
Why did you invite him in?
You know how things are between us.
What happened to you not playing games?
It wasn't...
I saw your face.
You were loving it.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
I was just trying to get at Warren.
I don't know why.
You can't stand him, can you?
It's complicated.
Yeah, tell me about it.
I don't know what to do about him.
Do you like him?
I did.
I thought I did.
Now it's all got so... weird.
I know it is.
Come on, it's ridiculous, right?
It's got to stop.
I need to tell him it's over, don't I?
I should probably get going.
I've an essay to write tonight.
Come on, stay for a bit.
No, really I can't.
Sorry.
Ellie's got that same B on her shoulder.
What did you say?
What did you say?
Your tattoo.
She's got the same one.
I mean, it's fainter but it's the same design.
Oh!
Why would you say something like that?
Let go of me!
Who told you to say that?
!
You're hurting me!
What the hell's wrong with you?
Just leave me alone.
All of you!
Is this the place?
The chaplain saw something he shouldn't have.
I wonder if that's why he was killed.
What did he see?
I don't know.
Come on.
A black mass.
I hope we're not too late.
I'm really stoned.
Where is Taylor?
Did you hear that?
I...
I'm just...
I'm just really stoned.
No, it's not in your head.
It's real.
Will you stop talking like that?
What's happening to us?
Why did you bring us here?
What happened to your dad, it was awful.
But it's been a year and you need to move on.
Screw you.
Liam, what's that smoke?
Our Father...
I knew we shouldn't have come here.
We shouldn't have walked into that chapel.
It was wrong.
Who are you?
Come out.
Come on.
Stop it, stop it.
I'm not scared!
Religion's bullshit!
My dad claimed to be a man of the cloth but he beat me so hard I had bruises on my legs for three months!
I was seven years old when he started!
Seven years old!
Liam, your father said sorry before he died.
He begged you.
He can go to hell!
Come on!
We've lost him.
What was that?
Taylor?
What is that?
Jesus!
Taylor!
Oh, my God.
Your mouth...
Who did this to you?
They're here.
Shh.
Oh, my God.
His mouth's sewn up.
Don't move.
I'm gonna cut you free.
Nice and gently.
Nice and gently.
Trust me.
Shh.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Shh.
Just keep still.
Whose idea was this?
Do you know what this place is?
Of course.
I read all about it.
Are you the guy that runs it?
OK, last one.
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
Look at what you've done!
I...
Warren?
Who did this to you?
What did you do in the chapel?
Nothing.
This isn't a game.
You're all in danger, alright?
It's haunted, isn't it?
That priest.
Come on, let's go.
Well, come on!
No, I'm not going anywhere.
Liam, please.
You started this.
You have to stop it!
I'm not scared.
There is not God.
There is no God!
Max!
Please!
What are you doing?
It's what they did in The Exorcist.
Don't be stupid.
You have to stop it.
You started the black magic.
The ghost just needs to know you're wrong.
I believe!
I believe in the Lord!
I believe in the Lord!
Why did you do it?
Why did you come here?
Just think!
Think!
He just needs to know you're sorry.
It was your dad.
It was your dad.
You've got to move on.
Forgive him.
Dad, Dad...
I-I...
I know you're sorry.
I just wish you were here so I could tell you.
I forgive you.
Are you OK?
You're safe.
You're OK.
Leave.
Get out of here and don't come back.
Let's get out of here.
..in the name of the Father, the Son...
Joseph took a child, a baby.
That's why the chaplain was murdered.
So Joseph sewed up his mouth to keep him quiet.
He must have kept the baby until she was a girl.
That's why I keep seeing Eve.
That's why she's so scared of him.
But why are you having visions?
The ghost is gone.
No, he hasn't.
Oh, no.
No, no.
Joseph...
Joseph!
Why did you start that blog up again?
Honestly.
Um...
I was pissed off at you and Dan.
Max, I don't belong to you.
I know.
I just thought maybe we'd...
Things are better as they are, OK?
Yeah.
You're probably right.
Ellie?
Ellie?
What did you see?
I saw it through her eyes.
I know who Eve is.
Who?
Me.
I spent the first years of my life kept in a cage by a twisted sadist!
Wouldn't you want to run?
He's lost his mind.
I need to be sure what I saw.
You're braver than that.
Am I?
He was an evil man.
He's come back for revenge.
Max!
There's these tunnels under the building.
Ellie's in danger.
You've got to call the police.
Did you know who she was when she got here?
Do you want to save her?
No!
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
WILL: ...$223 billion, putting an edge on the current fight on Capitol Hill about how deeply to cut this year's spending, along with projections that it would bring the debt ceiling...
Excuse me.
The deficit to $1.6 trillion, ensuring that the debt ceiling will be hit during this fiscal year.
That's News Night.
Thanks for washing us...
Watching us.
Let me get out of here.
Will McAvoy is coming up with The Capitol Report from Washington.
I'm Terry...
No.
- MACKENZIE:
Wow.
- That's not true.
End the broadcast.
- I'm Will McAvoy.
- Attaboy
Terry Smith is coming up, mercifully, with The Capitol Report from Washington.
- Good night.
- (MUSIC PLAYING)
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm fine.
"Thank you for washing us"?
Think people noticed?
I do.
Stand here on this spot.
- What are you doing?
- Administering an eye exam.
- Excellent.
- Read the top line.
- E.
- Next line.
I don't know why people think there's a problem with health care in this country.
- Our current system is fine.
- Next line.
L-G.
The next line, R-T-Z.
The Greek letter for pi, then geometric symbol for congruent, and something off the table of natural elements.
Great, put your tie back on and get in the studio so we can retape that for the West Coast.
What's the problem?
I didn't get much sleep last night.
- How much is not much?
- None.
Seriously?
I went to bed at midnight, didn't fall asleep.
Is this the first time that's happened?
- No.
- Is it the second time?
I'm having a little bout with insomnia.
Have you tried Ambien?
I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the Triborough Bridge eating scrambled eggs in my pajamas.
(IMITATING GROUCHO MARX) How those eggs got into my pajamas I'll never know.
You shouldn't do Groucho.
But seriously, you need to sleep or you're gonna forget to thank people for washing us.
I'm seeing my guy tomorrow at 10:00.
- Who's your guy?
- Abe.
- Who's Abe?
- Dr. Habib.
You're still seeing Abe?
That's wonderful, Will.
Everyone could use a little therapy.
And you a lot more than most.
I'm glad you're doing that.
Well...
You've been skipping appointments?
- Sometimes.
- When was the last time you saw him?
- What's today, the 12th?
- Yeah.
- About four years ago.
- Why did you stop seeing him?
- I've kept the appointments.
- What does that mean?
I have an appointment every Wednesday at 10:00.
- I just don't go.
- You've been paying him for four years?
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Thank God.
I have a business manager who does that.
Why don't you read a magazine?
No, I've already read that issue of Cat Fancy cover to cover and I'm saving American Stamp Collectorforalongplaneride.
All right.
Why not just go to your regular doctor?
When I go to my internist, he asks me questions.
It's a half-hour interview before he puts on a stethoscope.
- What kinds of questions?
- I don't know.
"How you feeling"?
Asshole.
Here, read Vegan Health.
- Will?
- Yeah.
I'm Jack Habib.
Come on in.
- Are you Abe's son?
- I am.
Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Come on in.
- Is your dad inside?
No.
I can wait out here.
My father died two years ago and I took his practice.
Come on in.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Wait, what?
Will, I'm Dr. Jacob Habib, son of Dr. Abraham Habib.
My father passed away and his patients now see me.
You've been paying me for two years.
Come on in.
How old are you?
(CHUCKLES) I'm 29.
- (LAUGHS)
- Shut up.
Can you write prescriptions?
Yeah.
Let's go.
I'll be two minutes.
So if you're 29...
Don't try to count backwards.
I did everything early.
So unless you're certain you've got a Doogie Howser joke I haven't heard, why don't we just assume it was hilarious and move on?
- Okay.
- So what's going on?
I need something to help me sleep.
- Why?
- I can't sleep.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Any recent change in diet?
I haven't changed my diet since college.
- You should.
- I invented a new sandwich.
Scrambled eggs, bacon, and melted cheese on toast.
I make two of them every night before I get into bed.
You invented an Egg McMuffin.
Getting enough exercise?
I have to scramble the eggs.
And other than that?
No.
Look, any kind of sleeping pill will do.
Sure.
- Just talk a little bit?
- Oh, God, please, let's not.
- You're still taking Effexor?
- No.
- Clonazepam?
- No.
- Ativan?
- No.
Four years ago, you were on 135mg of Effexor plus Clonazepam and Ativan at bedtime.
I'm not anymore.
- Why is that?
- I was cured.
These are all antianxiety medications.
And I have no more anxiety.
Except for not being able to sleep.
Right, so if you'll just give me a prescription for...
Yeah, I'm going to.
- Just a few more questions.
- Okay.
Any extra stress at work?
Extra stress?
- Yeah.
- No.
- No extra stress?
- No.
- One more question.
- Sure.
What are you fucking around with me for?
- I'm sorry?
- What are you fucking around with me for?
I just asked if there's any extra stress at work,
- and you say...
- There isn't.
There isn't.
- What about the death threat?
- You know about that?
Anyone who reads a newspaper knows about that.
- It's truly not a big deal.
- No?
Jack, can I get the prescription?
Just tell me how a death threat isn't a big deal.
I used to be a criminal prosecutor.
And I'm telling you nobody who's serious about killing you sends you a note beforehand to warn you.
The gentleman who is with you in the waiting room, he's a bodyguard, right?
Yeah, but you shouldn't...
That's the...
Our insurance company makes that decision.
Based on what?
They have experts who determine whether a cret is threadible...
Threat is credible.
And why do they think the threat is credible?
Nine questions ago, you said one more question.
Why do they think the threat is credible?
Because I changed the rules of the comment section of our website.
That's all.
I changed the rules of the comment section.
As always, or at least since Monday, we end our show with your own viewer comments on our website.
So let's see what we have tonight.
LollypopLollypop says, "30 more seconds
"and you would have had that self-loathing hypocrite in tears."
That...
That was absolutely not my intention.
SurrendrDorothee said, "Your Log Cabin closet case
"hit the Uncle Tom Daily Double,
"a traitor to his race and a traitor to his sexual orientation."
Don't blow a gasket.
He's plainly not a closet case.
He's openly gay.
I also think he showed a lot of courage coming on the show.
Certainly more courage than it takes to post an anonymous comment on a website.
Terry Smith's coming up from Washington with The Capitol Report.
I'm Will McAvoy.
Good night.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
MAN:
We're out.
- Neal!
- Believe me, those were the best two we had.
Why didn't we just hit him in the head with a shovel?
- We've got to talk about what just happened.
- I'm trying to.
Not the website.
We've gotta talk about what happened on the air.
- I don't wanna talk.
- Were you outside your body?
I don't want to talk about it.
- I want to talk about the website.
- The website's not the problem right now.
It's my problem right now.
We're putting up these comments...
- We've heard this before.
- But we're still doing it.
It's a trade with Reese.
The page views offset the ratings drop.
Is there any way of knowing if LollypopLollypop is 10 years old?
Or a basset hound?
The reason basset hounds have such long ears is so they can waft up the scent when they're hunting.
- Is there any way of knowing?
- No.
Is there any way of knowing if LollypopLollypop
- and SurrendrDorothee are the same person?
- No.
Who posts comments on the Internet more, people who are content or people who are incontent?
- MACKENZIE:
Discontent.
- What?
It's discontent, not incontent.
- It's about 30-to-1 incontent.
- Discontent.
Final question.
In your wildest dreams, can you imagine Walter Cronkite saying "LollypopLollypop"
as many times as I have in the last 10 minutes?
Not unless he was in an a cappella doo-wop group, no.
He wasn't.
Here's what I'd love.
You want to join the discussion, fine.
I want to know your name, age, occupation,
- and level of education.
- Oh, God.
The thing about the Internet is it's a populist tool.
Populists have names, too.
William Jennings Bryan, Will Rogers, me.
- Will.
- Unless you're Deep Throat or in the Witness Protection Program, anonymity is cowardice.
You're in a mob.
You're lobbing smack from the cheap seats.
Don't we have bigger fish to fry than the...
Yes, but we can fry more than one fish at a time.
And how could we possibly verify someone's name,
- age, occupation, and level of education?
- Neal?
We implement a third-party verification service.
All you had to say was, "We can't,"
- and the conversation would have been over.
- So it is possible?
It's what the IRS uses when you're filing online.
Talk to me, Tonto.
- I can do it if you want.
- I want.
Won't the result be that nobody posts comments on our website anymore?
First of all, oh no.
What will we do without feedback from SurrendrDorothee?
And second, the result will be our website will ghettoize every other website.
The result will be civility in the public square and a triumph of populism.
I'm going to single-handedly fix the Internet.
- What could possibly go wrong?
- MACKENZIE:
Will!
- What?
- We have to talk about what just happened.
No, we don't.
We're just gonna move on.
And when did you get the death threat?
I don't know.
A day after the mosque interview.
WOMAN:
We know that an Islamic trend is to build large mosques on the cherished sites of conquered lands.
- You're talking about Cordoba.
- That's exactly right.
When Muslims conquered Cordoba, Spain, they tore down churches and synagogues and put mosques in their place.
Ms. Greer, Muslims conquered Cordoba in the year 712.
Do you think we can call something that last happened in the 8th century a trend?
She'll say, "Why does it have to be at Ground Zero?"
Anyone being honest about the prospect of a mosque being built so close to Ground Zero would say it instinctually feels wrong.
Is it legal?
Of course it is.
Is it wrong?
Of course it is.
It should be built somewhere where the 9/11 families don't have to feel the agony of having a shrine to their loved ones stomped upon.
All over America we're seeing the influence of creeping Islam.
We are?
What about those who would impose Sharia law?
Women can be stoned to death for committing adultery.
No, they can't.
Actual laws are the only laws that are enforceable, including the one that says you can't create religious laws.
And the US is in no more danger of coming under Sharia law than it is the rules of Fight Club.
Let me ask you something.
Muslims the world over are fighting a civil war over the direction Islam is taking.
Are you going to be stationed at the door of that mosque to turn radicals away?
Can you guarantee that the current imam is going to be the same imam 10 years from now?
It's worth pointing out that it's not a mosque.
It's a community center.
I'm not sure why you think that makes it better.
What business does a community center have in the religion business?
And then pivot to the larger point.
I want the art and graphics reviewed three times before air.
WILL:
Ms. Greer, you mentioned creeping Islam.
Are you concerned about creeping Christianity?
(CHUCKLES) Only that it's not creeping fast enough.
Okay, here are some things done on American soil in the name of Christianity.
The Ku Klux Klan burned down black churches, raped women, murdered civil rights workers, murdered children, and terrorized communities for over a century.
The neo-Nazis all acted and continue to act in the name of white Christian supremacy.
The Army of God fatally attacks abortion clinics and doctors across the country.
The Covenant, The Sword, and The Arm of the Lord targets local police and federal agents.
The federal building in Oklahoma City, the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, and the successful assassinations of Martin Luther King,
John F. Kennedy,
John Lennon, and Abraham Lincoln, all perpetrated by Christians.
Ms. Greer, we weren't attacked by Muslims.
We were attacked by sociopaths.
And I, for one, would join you in protesting a community center for the criminally insane.
But no one is suggesting building one.
Here's the thing about the Japanese.
Where we tend to hype things up, they go the other direction.
You think they're lowballing Fukushima?
I don't know anything about nuclear reactors, and I'm not at all involved in this story.
I'm just saying I wouldn't take their word for it it's a level five.
Excuse me, Will.
There's a comment on your website you need to see.
Now I get to say who is it from?
What do they do?
It's serious.
From about 25 minutes ago.
DON: "Fucking sand niggers should get herded and slaughtered.
"I've got a bullet for you, too.
You think I'm fucking around?
"2 Hudson Street, 27."
- ls 2 Hudson 27...
- It's my address and apartment number.

It wasn't written by an English professor, and it wasn't written by Alice Cynkar.
How much effort does it take to scam the new system?
You've got to want it pretty bad.
Millie, it's MacKenzie.
Would you tell him we're coming right up, please?
They could have stolen her password.
- How hard is that?
- Hard.
We implemented complex password requirements on the site because we knew it was catnip for some sophomore at MIT.
It would take an average computer 57 days to get in.
And that's with someone who knows what they're doing.
How many days has the new system been up?
- Three.
- Jesus.
- Will...
- Everybody relax.
Neal just said it.
It's a college kid pledging a frat.
MACKENZIE:
With a death threat?
No.
Charlie, I want a body on him until this guy's in handcuffs.
- No way.
- CHARLIE:
You're not gonna have a choice.
- The insurance company makes that call.
- Come on.
Listen to me.
This goes to AWM security right now.
Security's got to show it to the insurance company.
And that's going to trigger some kind of protection.
Wouldn't it make more sense for me just to wear a different disguise every day?
One more thing.
BOTH:
There's gonna be a tabloid story.
- Good.
Yeah.
- What did I do?
Is it possible Maggie filed a complaint with HR saying that you created a hostile work environment?
No, it's not possible.
Maggie wouldn't complain if her hair was on fire.
Someone else did on her behalf.
And it was a while ago before you got here.
Thanks.
Would you excuse us for a second?
Sure.
Why don't we try to fully investigate the anatomy of these stories?
- No, we're gonna fully investigate Will.
- Of course.
I want you to assign a team to do opposition research on Will.
Let's call it Operation Involuntary Colonoscopy.
I just want to know what the next tabloid story is before it happens.
You won't be able to pin nothing on me, Mugsy.
'Cause I've lived my life straight as the Kingston Trio.
I'm not fucking around!
You know, when you're grumpier than I am, we've switched roles.
Ask him what's the current state of the reactors.
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)
(MAN SPEAKING JAPANESE ON SPEAKER)
What did he say?
- What did he say?
- His daughter's on the diving team.
They came in second at regionals.
- Did he understand the question?
- Did you?
I haven't spoken to him in two years.
We're catching up.
How does a company like TEPCO not have a spokesperson who speaks English?
- I don't know.
- What is the current state of the reactors?
Tanaka-san... (SPEAKING JAPANESE)
(TANAKA RESPONDING)
Units one and three have had explosions due to hydrogen buildup.
They're currently stable, but they're not safe to enter.
KENDRA:
What are they doing to contain the situation?
(SLOAN SPEAKING JAPANESE)
(TANAKA RESPONDING)
- What's going on with Will?
- Internal security is handling it.
But I have to give you a rotten assignment.
- You got gum in your hair again?
- No.
Yes, but I got it out.
I need you to do opposition research on Will.
- Seriously?
- About a year ago, somebody filed a complaint with HR on your behalf.
I know what that was.
Will didn't do anything wrong.
- This is ridiculous.
- I know, but Charlie wants to know what else is out there so he can...
- Will knows we're doing this?
- Of course.
- And he's okay with it?
- No, he hates it.
- Fantastic.
- Go to work.
- Have you done this before?
- Yeah.
Where do we start?
Tell me about the complaint.
There was a desk producer who saw Will yell at me about something.
- What?
- Doesn't matter.
What?
Doesn't matter.
- I mixed up Georgia the state with...
- No.
- Yes, Georgia the country.
- And this was...
- Yup.
This isn't about me.
- ...during the invasion?
You thought the Russians invaded Atlanta?
In retrospect, it seems farfetched.
But that wasn't what he was actually mad about.
The wife of a board member died and Will asked me to send flowers.
I wrote on the card, "I'm so sorry about your loss.
LOL."
- LOL?
- I thought it meant "lots of love."
How are you still working here?
I dodge bullets.
Here comes a bullet.
Boom!
I'm over here.
Ping!
Here comes another bullet.
Boom!
I'm over here.
Ask him if TEPCO's gonna try to keep the reactors going.
Tanaka-san... (SPEAKING JAPANESE)
(TANAKA RESPONDING)
They're classified at level five and they think they'll be able to get the reactor going.
Guys, do me a favor and let us have a minute?
Daisuke, the others have left the room and I'm alone now.
I understand.
Do you still want to stand by your statement that the reactor's going to stay at level 5?
That is the statement that I made.
Daisuke, are people in the area in more danger than you're telling us?
I'm not an expert in this field.
I'm just a spokesperson for TEPCO.
Have you heard anyone talk about the radiation exceeding level 5?
Daisuke, we've known each other a long time.
Anybody know where Sloan Sabbith is?
Sloan!
She's on the phone.
All right, she's off the phone.
Here are the notes.
It's gonna go to level seven.
- Holy shit.
- You got a minute?
Fukushima's a lot worse than they're telling you.
- I need you to fill in for Elliot tonight.
- This is what the Japanese do.
They...
Wait, what?
- I need you to fill in for Elliot at 10:00.
- Why?
His 5-year-old's having a tonsillectomy today.
Elliot's gonna spend the night in the hospital with her.
- Was it an emergency?
- No, it was scheduled a week ago.
And you're just getting around to this now?
I...
- Forgot?
- Yes.
You have a staff.
They can write these things down.
They can, but I have to remember to tell them to.
So what do you say?
You're my first and only choice.
- What about Jerome?
- He's in Bermuda.
- Kathy?
- It's her parents' 50th anniversary.
- Taylor?
- Bronchitis.
- So...
- Yes, you were my fourth and only choice.
I can't host Elliot's show.
Don't be ridiculous.
You host your own show at 4:00.
- About financial news.
- You're expanding.
Come on.
I gained four freaking pounds.
No, professor.
- Right, expanding.
- Yeah.
- No, I'm not doing it.
- Your copy will be written for you to approve.
You've got Marco Rubio, Sandra Bernhard...
Sandra Bernhard's been dead for 100 years.
- That's Sarah Bernhardt.
- She'd be a good guest.
- I hate my life.
- Hmm?
Nothing.
And the spokesperson for TEPCO.
- I just got off the phone with him.
- See?
You're perfect.
I was just doing a favor for these guys.
I don't know anything...
Thank God my first five choices weren't available.
I thought there were only three.
Let's not get caught up in the math.
If you want a wardrobe change after the 4:00, we have Gucci ready to send over some choices.
- Gucci?
- A whole rack of choices.
Your copy will be ready for your approval after 9:00 along with your questions, and I will be in your ear the whole time.
Except for Fukushima, you're mostly throwing to packages.
They've been lowballing the radiation levels.
I'd take their word for it.
The Japanese have some experience with radiation.
You think that's something...
That is not something you should mention on the air.
- Oh, God.
- Mr. Will McAvoy.
You're not here to do my taxes, right?
My name's Lonny Church.
Mr. Horn at AWM Security told you I'd be here at this time.
I'll tell you right now I'm gonna hate this.
I'll tell you now I'm not gonna care.
- Let's go in my office for a minute.
- Sure.
It's not a real threat.
I don't make that decision.
Lonny Church?
Did you play college football?
Yes, I did.
Defensive tackle.
- Started three years for Clemson.
- And then?
Got drafted in the eighth round by the Bengals.
- And then?
- Got cut five weeks into training camp.
Excellent.
Joined the Army, became an MP.
- Where were you deployed?
- New Jersey.
You see a lot of action in New Jersey?
See a lot of action in your studio?
I'll be doing the jokes, okay?
- After you were discharged?
- Honorably.
I joined Blue North Security.
Who else's body have you guarded?
- We don't talk about that.
- Okay.
Kanye.
It was awesome.
Are you armed?
I secure my weapon in a gun safe when I come in the building.
Keep it there.
I really don't want an armed guard.
Maybe if you were drafted in the first four rounds, I'd feel safer.
- Mr. McAvoy...
- You can call me Will.
Yeah, I was gonna do that anyway.
I know you're used to being the boss.
But you're not anymore.
At least for a little while.
How long?
Until my colleagues chase down the source of the threat or, of course, if you've been successfully assassinated.
- A joke?
- What'd you think?
It was all right.
How does this work?
I pick you up at your home in the morning and escort you to your office.
Then I pick you up at your office at night and escort you to your home.
I'm with you any place that's an unsecured area.
What's an unsecured area?
Any place that isn't your home or your office.
I'm single.
What about a date?
I don't think we should get romantically involved.
- You get one joke a day.
- (KNOCKING)
- Come on in.
- I say that.
- I'm sorry.
You got a second?
- Yeah.
I'll leave you.
Sloan, this is Lonny.
You'll see him around.
- Good to meet you.
- Wow.
- Can I tap your chest?
- Sure.
(LAUGHS) Holy cow.
- Have you felt his pecs?
- No, I haven't yet.
I'll be downstairs.
So I'm hosting Elliot's show tonight.
I know.
I'm the one who suggested you.
You really think I can do it?
No, I have no idea.
So we're gonna find out.
All right.
Well, your exuberant confidence notwithstanding,
- I have the spokesperson...
- From TEPCO, I know.
He just told me, off the record, that reactor three is causing what is a level seven, not a level five, radiation leak.
What's the trick to getting him to say it on the record?
There is no trick.
You just don't stop until he tells the truth.
What do you mean you don't stop?
I mean you don't stop.
Sloan, I watch your show at 4:00 and you're brilliant.
But you let guests say things that I know you know aren't true.
And then you just move on.
Ask the damn follow-up and then demonstrate with facts how the guest is lying.
You can't just sit there and be a facilitator for whatever bullshit the guest wants to feed your viewers.
They're not coming on to plug a movie.
It's not Jimmy Kimmel.
You knowingly, passively, allow someone to lie on your air, and maybe you're not a drug dealer, but you're sure as hell the guy who drives the dealer around in your car.
So maybe you'll get it, maybe you won't.
Show me something.
- Got it.
- Do you?
Yeah.
WILL:
I just...
I don't know.
I was in a bad mood.
WILL:
Honestly, I was just trying to motivate her.
She's the last person who needs motivation,
- so it just ended up...
- Scaring her.
I hate that people are scared of me.
- I absolutely hate it.
- Why?
Why do I hate when people are scared of me?
For the same reason everybody does.
Everybody doesn't.
Some people like it.
Most people don't care.
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't like it.
And I'm pretty sure I scared Sloan because she's a veteran reporter who's never done anything like what she did.
What's the condition of each reactor?
(TRANSLATOR SPEAKING JAPANESE)
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)
- All six reactors are in stable condition.
- Great, let's wrap up.
SLOAN:
What about the partial meltdown at reactor three?
- Wrap up for me.
- (SPEAKING JAPANESE)
Excuse me, that's not what I asked.
I'm asking him specifically about the core damage at reactor three.
- What's happening?
- (SPEAKING JAPANESE)
We know of no core damage at any of the reactors.
That's not what Mr. Tanaka just said.
He said, "Our engineers can't get close enough to confirm that."
Please translate exactly what I'm asking and exactly what Mr. Tanaka is answering, including what I'm saying now, because I want him to be aware that he's being misrepresented.
Miss Sabbith, I am translating.
He is not being...
Ask him if he believes the radiation levels are going to a seven.
Please, please, don't go rogue.
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)
TRANSLATOR:
The radiation was categorized at level four and then recategorized at level five.
And that's where it should remain.
Ma'am, he didn't say that's where it should remain.
You did.
Furthermore, he told me...
You know what?
I'm just gonna...
Tanaka-san... (SPEAKING JAPANESE)
And now we're doing the broadcast in Japanese.
"We'll be right back after this." Just say that.
Say it in English.
Did she just...
Put me back!
Mr. Tanaka, your company had this incident rated at level four, then adjusted to level five.
How confident are you that that'll be the highest level we see?
At least we're back to English.
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)
At this point, we see no reason that level will need future escalation.
Well, that's simply not what Mr. Tanaka told me on the phone earlier today.
- No, no.
- When I spoke with him earlier, he said there's enough evidence to raise the level to seven.
- Go back to Japanese.
- And now he's not saying it, so I am.
- Oh, my God!
- So there it is.
The Fukushima nuclear power plant is saying that the level four radiation leak that was raised to level five has a chance of being raised to level seven, which is the difference between life and gruesome death.
We'll be back after this with Sarah Bernhardt.
Sandra Bernhard, you idiot!
What the hell does it matter?
- Okay...
- 'Sup?
Okay, I know we were on sketchy ground ethically and linguistically, but...
Whatever you're gonna say, save it for another 10 seconds.
What happens in 10 seconds?
Just hang on for another five seconds and know that we've all been there at one point or another.
What happens in five seconds?
What in the name of holy fuck were you thinking about?
First, let me say that Don was not responsible for that.
Yeah, when you severed communication with the EP, you pretty much absolved him of responsibility.
But that doesn't make the cut of the top three calamities
- that just occurred.
- Charlie...
I, along with most people who don't live in Japan, am not fluent in Japanese, so I have to ask.
Did you just make up statements for somebody we had live on our air?
- I didn't make them up.
- About a deadly radiation leak?
I didn't make them up.
He told me the reactor was going to a seven.
When?
Tonight?
I'm asking honestly because there was a portion of the broadcast that turned into a Kurosawa movie.
These things are measured on a scale of zero to seven.
Five is Three Mile Island, seven is Chernobyl.
On air, did he say the reactors were going to seven?
He said it to me in the preinterview.
And then the company stuck an interpreter next to him, and I think her job was more than interpreting because she wasn't accurately translating...
We don't report what you think, Sloan.
The guy said all six reactors are stable.
The Japanese are a deferential people.
It's very hard for them to explain when they've done something wrong.
I don't give a shit, Madame Butterfly!
And right now the Japanese, who are reading an online report of your report, are fleeing from their fucking homes.
Now tell me what he said tonight on air.
He said the reactors were at five.
But you said he said they would move to seven.
I made it clear he said that during the preinterview.
First of all, let's not kid ourselves.
There was nothing that was clear about that interview.
He said it to me, and he said it to a conference room full of staffers.
- The staffers weren't there.
- The staffers were not there.
I sent them out so we could speak privately and off...
No, finish that sentence.
Off the record.
Good luck trying to get a source to talk to you off the record again.
You have no value to me as a reporter now.
- Charlie!
- And I have to suspend you.
- DON:
Come on.
- What?
I have to suspend you while we bring in outside investigators to comb through every report you've filed in the last two years to find out what other shit you made up.
I didn't make anything up.
I would never make anything up.
I know that and you know that and he knows that, but why the hell should anyone else know that?
You're suspended with pay until I figure out...
- They were lying about a public safety issue.
- You're suspended with...
I don't want the goddamn pay!
Don't front off with me, girl!
- Don't call me girl, sir.
- Hey!
Everybody calm the fuck down.
Sarah Bernhardt was a turn-of-the-century stage and film actress from France.
Sandra Bernhard is a...
I don't know what the hell.
There's no way she does that if I hadn't given her my awesome pep talk.
JACK:
Are you close with Sloan?
- Are we close?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- Just asking.
You seem very protective.
We didn't used to be.
But she's become...
I don't know.
I don't know, like a little sister to me or something.
Your father was an abusive alcoholic?
What?
Your father, he was an abusive alcoholic?
I didn't say that.
But he was, right?
You got that in the 40 minutes that I've been sitting here that seem like a week and a half?
It's in the notes my dad left.
Can I have a prescription now?
- He hit you?
- Come on.
He hit you, right?
How many times did you see Good Will Hunting?
- He hit you?
- Yes.
- He hit your mother?
- Yes.
You have a brother and two sisters.
He hit them, right?
Look, he didn't hit anybody once I was old enough to hit him back.
And when was that?
Will, how old were you when you had to protect your mother, your brother, and your two little sisters from a grown man who was drunk and violent?
Fifth grade.
I cracked a bottle of Dewar's across his face.
It's in your notes.
Why are you pursuing this line of...
I'm not trying to be an asshole.
I just want a sleeping pill.
I'm gonna give you one, but I doubt it's gonna work.
Let's give it a try.
You've got another 15 minutes on your session.
I didn't come here for a session.
You could have gotten sleeping pills from your internist.
Shit, you could have got them online.
I didn't go to my internist because he asks too many questions.
You didn't go to your internist because he doesn't ask you the right questions.
I didn't come here for a session.
I think you did.
I'm checking on the opposition research.
Maggie was detained by the police for attempting to blow up her parents' house.
He's overstating it.
My cousins and I wanted to shoot guns at soda cans.
Where did you place the soda cans?
- On top of the propane tanks.
- Which were in front of?
The diesel fuel combine.
But I'm an excellent shot.
The Deep South could have used you when the Russians invaded.
Will!
How's the opposition research on Will?
He once needed lenses for driving, then didn't.
So he probably had LASIK surgery.
He did.
He registered for the New York Marathon, but didn't finish.
My fault.
I twisted my ankle at the starting line.
He carried me to the first aid tent.
What else?
- He was hospitalized with tuberculosis.
- Already knew that.
He was credited on a country album as a guitarist.
He's an accomplished guitarist who occasionally jams with Leonard Cohen.
He got a C-minus in Sociology of Emotion.
It was a clerical mistake.
He never registered for the class.
- Then a C-minus is pretty good.
- I need something I can use.
Wait, are we trying to protect Will or give you ammunition?
Thought we could do both.
He contributed $250 to the failed primary campaign of a congressional candidate in Nebraska.
- While he was a journalist?
- No.
Nothing I can do with that.
I mean, they...
Nothing they can do with that.
The candidate was a Republican.
- So's Will.
- What?
He's a registered Republican.
The four of you weren't able to uncover that?
- We weren't looking.
- He was a speechwriter for Bush 41.
What did you think he was?
I just thought he did that as a public service.
Or to mess with him like in The Sting.
That's nothing like what happened in The Sting.
Jim got kicked out of a study abroad semester.
- He went to the Arctic Circle.
- I wanted to see the penguins.
- MACKENZIE:
Those are in the Antarctic.
- Lesson learned.
Why'd you get kicked out?
You're not allowed to fraternize with the Inuit.
He tried to score with an Eskimo.
I was just trying...
I was just trying to get past the disappointment with the penguins.
- (STIFLED LAUGHS)
- All right, so there's nothing so far.
Fox offered him a ton of money in 2006 to come to LA and get into late-night.
- A talk show?
- Yeah.
He'd have been good at that.
All right, get back to the news.
- Did you say 2006?
- Yeah.
- How far did it get?
- A deal memo.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
All right.
You know that this is stupid.
Just go do your jobs.
I've just heard something I can't believe.
Why don't you attack this woman?
She doesn't seem that threatening to me.
She's incredibly threatening.
My life is in constant danger when she's around.
- I'm Lonny Church.
- MacKenzie McHale.
- Attack!
- Nah.
Look, I'll be here at 9:00 unless you're leaving the building.
In which case, press pound five on your phone and I'll be here.
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.
Fox offered you a late-night talk show.
- Great, when do I start?
- Five years ago.
They offered you the show when we were together.
It was gonna take you to LA and it got as far as the deal memo.
What is it you think you've uncovered?
This whole time you've enjoyed making me feel guilty for ruining the life we would have had together when, in fact, you never had any intention of marrying me.
No intention of marrying me.
I mean, you never even mentioned it.
You were just gonna go to LA and leave a note?
Let me tell you something, the days of you being able to lord my mistake over me are behind us.
I've lived a life that is good and pure.
You were deceiving me while I was deceiving you.
You never had any intention of...
What's this?
I didn't tell you about the Fox offer because it was never real.
I knew I was being used as leverage, and I didn't want to be embarrassed in front of you when it went away.
I was still trying to impress you.
The ring was meant for me?
But I've lived a life that's good and pure.
Except for... (WHISPERS) Cheating on you.
- Could you speak up?
- Cheating on you.
- Except for cheating on you!
- There it is.
Okay.
Well, then, back to work.
Yeah.
Listen, when you do propose to someone, that's the ring that'll do it.
Yeah.
So as soon as you heard they were doing opposition research, you ran over to Tiffany and bought the ring?
That's insane.
I had to send my agent or it would have shown up in the papers.
- Will.
- I'm gonna return it.
Does that seem normal to you?
The world is made up of two kinds of people.
The ones who think they're normal and the ones who know there's no such thing.
Great, you took one semester of Intro to Adult Psych.
But the world is made up of a lot more than two kinds of people.
And I was speaking in the psychiatric sense of the word.
- Does going out and buying a ring...
- Which I'm going to return.
...as a bizarre...
I don't know what to call it,
- seem normal to you?
- You weren't around for the exposition.
She had an affair with her ex-boyfriend.
For four months while she was with me.
- It's four years later.
- And you know why I don't talk about it?
Because I'm tired of people telling me it's a "just get over it" situation.
Fuck you.
You don't know what it's like in my head.
(PHONE RINGS)
Sloan Sabbith.
KENDRA:
It's a Japanese news report from a few hours ago.
We know they're talking about you, but we don't know what they're saying.
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)
"After releasing incorrect information to the American journalist Sloan Sabbith..."
That's a picture of Elliot and he didn't release incorrect information.
I did.
And it wasn't incorrect.
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)
"After releasing incorrect information to the American journalist Sloan Sabbith...
"TEPCO spokesman Daisuke Tanaka has offered to resign today.
"He said, 'I apologize to my company, my government, and my country."'
(SIGHS)
Please, I have to fix this now.
Help me.
I need wisdom.
- I have wisdom.
- Kenzie, I love you, but a Japanese man's honor is at stake, and sometimes your wisdom leads to...
Like... (IMITATES EXPLOSION)
- No, I get it.
- Yeah.
Will?
She'd just been suspended and she's thinking about the other guy's job.
Honor, actually, is what she said.
Meanwhile, she's a punch line on the Internet.
- And he's got students, too.
- Who?
Sloan.
She teaches at Columbia twice a week.
You said, "He." "He's got students."
And you feel that's a breakthrough moment?
That my subconscious revealed something?
'Cause I'll be honest.
I'm pretty sure the reason I said "he" instead of "she"
is that I've been awake for a really long time now.
But those comments weren't on your site, right?
No, because nobody's gonna say that unless they're anonymous.
And if you don't count the death threat, it worked.
It was bully kryptonite.
No more LollypopLollypop.
- What did SurrendrDorothee mean when...
- Huh?
The screen name of the person...
It's what the...
- Yeah, the screen name of the person...
- Yeah.
On the last night you showed anonymous posts.
It's what the witch wrote in the sky...
I'm not asking what the screen name means.
I'm asking what the person, that when he or she said that your guest that night had hit the Uncle Tom Daily Double.
The guest he or she was talking about was a man named Sutton Wall, who was the deputy chief of staff to Rick Santorum, former senator for Pennsylvania who just announced his intention to run for President of the United States.
The list of prospective candidates for the Republican nomination for president may yet include another name.
Earlier this week, former Pennsylvania senator
Rick Santorum convened an exploratory committee...
And Sutton Wall is both black and gay.
The senator is perhaps best known for his full-throated advocacy of social issues.
Here to discuss how those positions and others may shape Mr. Santorum's bid for the White House is his former deputy chief of staff Sutton Wall, an adjunct professor of American Studies at Temple University, who will be serving as an advisor to the campaign throughout this process.
He teaches at Temple?
- Yeah.
- So he has students?
Yes, he has students.
And LollypopLollypop said you almost made him cry.
That...
That was absolutely not my intention.
Well, you're hardwired to hate bullies.
Like the way comic book heroes are born out of a childhood trauma.
Santorum was the bully in that situation.
Speaking to the New York Times in May 2005,
Senator Santorum said,
"Gay marriage threatens my marriage.
It threatens all marriages.
"It threatens the traditional values of this country."
Mr. Wall, how does gay marriage threaten Mr. Santorum's marriage?
WALL:
The senator believes that marriage is defined as the union of one man and one woman.
I understand that's what the former senator believes, but what he said was that gay marriage threatens his marriage and all marriages.
And I'm asking you exactly how it's a threat.
Sanctity of life is the number one issue with Rick Santorum, and he believes...
Mr. Wall, we'll get to purposely vague words like sanctity in a moment.
But I'd like you to try to answer the question.
How is Mr. Santorum's marriage threatened by the gay couple two houses down also being married?
Will, I was proud to serve on the senator's staff, and I'll be proud to serve and support him should he choose to run for president.
But that doesn't mean I necessarily agree with him on every single issue.
Gay marriage is now legal in five states as well as the District of Columbia.
Has Mr. Santorum's marriage been suffering as a result?
Has he complained to you that he and Mrs. Santorum seem to be fighting more or talking less?
- Of course not.
- Has there been any infidelity in the last seven years or an inability to relate to their children as a result of five states legalizing same-sex marriage?
This is a preposterous line of questioning, sir.
I'm afraid it has to be, sir, because it's a preposterous assertion.
Now, are you able to name one way in which Mr. Santorum's marriage to Mrs. Santorum is threatened by gay couples also having the right to marry?
I...
I am not able to name a way.
Thank you.
I could have just stopped it there.
Does it bother you that Mr. Santorum thinks there's something wrong with you that should be fixed?
Hang on, because I am sick and tired of these attacks, these wrongheaded attacks against a great man and a great public servant.
Reasonable people can disagree about how great a man or how great a public servant Rick Santorum is, but they can't disagree about the fact that he thinks you're a sick deviant who's threatening the fabric of society.
I have known this man for almost a decade, and I can tell you that he has treated me with nothing but respect.
This is Senator Santorum speaking to Fox News.
- Easy does it, Will.
- No, we're gonna do this thing.
...that this is the equivalent, that being black and being gay is the same is simply not true.
There are all sorts of studies out there that suggest just the contrary, and there are people who were gay and lived a gay lifestyle and aren't anymore.
I don't know if that's the similar situation.
I don't think that's the case with anybody that's black.
Mr. Santorum is forgiving you for being black because there's nothing you can do about that.
But you don't have to be gay.
I will say it again.
Mr. Santorum is a great man who would make a great president.
He has never treated me with anything but the utmost respect.
Except for finding you disgusting.
- That is a lie.
- Will, don't...
Has Rick Santorum on the floor of the US Senate compared homosexuality to incest and bestiality?
Those remarks have been taken out of context over the years...
Feel free to put the remarks in the proper context.
He makes a clear distinction between homosexuality and homosexual acts.
So he only finds you disgusting when you act like a homosexual?
- He doesn't find me disgusting.
- Yes, he does.
And he also thinks you're less than a man.
- No, he certainly does not.
- Come on.
WILL:
Our Declaration contains the words
"We hold these truths to be self-evident
"that all men are created equal. "
In order to arrive at the conclusion that homosexual love is something less than heterosexual love, you have to begin with the premise that a homosexual is something less than a man.
That's inescapable.
And so I'm asking you to explain to me why you would work for a man who believes that you're inferior.
- That you're damaged.
That you're ill.
- Stop hitting him.
Unnatural.
A threat to children.
Unfit to serve in the military.
Unfit to be a parent.
And unloved by God.
- I'm asking you, sir...
- Stop!
Just stop!
I believe in the sanctity of life.
And if that word is too vague for you, then look it up.
I support the senator because of all the candidates in the field,
I believe he is the only one whose passion on the issue of abortion equals my own.
And I believe he has the skills to make a fantastic president.
I am not talking...
That's not...
You will not interrupt me again, sir!
I am more than one thing.
How dare you reduce me to the color of my skin or my sexual orientation?
There are people who look just like me, thousands and thousands who died for the freedom to define their own lives for themselves.
How dare you presume to decide what I should think is important.
Yes, when it comes to equality for the gay community,
Senator Santorum is wrong.
But I am far more insulted by your high-handed implication
- that I need your protection.
- Sir, I...
Shut up!
I'll let you know when I'm finished.
I came on this program because Rick Santorum believes that the right to kill an unborn child is not inalienable.
And I stand with Rick Santorum.
And I stand with the Catholic Church.
I am not defined by my blackness.
I am not defined by my gayness.
And if that doesn't fit your narrow-minded expectation of who I'm supposed to be, I don't give a damn because I'm not defined by you either.
So get this through your head.
I don't need your help.
Mr. Wall?
Does Mr. Santorum think you're fit to be a teacher?
No.
We'll be back after this.
He has students.
And parents.
And friends.
And colleagues.
And strangers.
I was the bully.
(CHUCKLES) I was the bully.
Mm-hmm.
You've got to give me credit for uniting the far right, the gay community, and blacks in their dislike of me.
The Internet exploded.
Everybody thought I'd become unhinged.
It sort of brought back this thing that happened about a year ago at Northwestern.
When you yelled at a student.
I scared her.
All right.
All right.
That's News Night.
Thanks for washing us...
Watching us.
- Let me get out of here.
- End the broadcast.
- I'm Will McAvoy.
- Attaboy.
Terry Smith is coming up, mercifully, with The Capitol Report from Washington.
- Good night.
- (MUSIC PLAYING)
If you're here to make me feel better, it's not necessary.
You think I'm here to make you feel better?
The story is right.
In this one case,
I don't give a damn about on the record, off the record.
- And no one in Fukushima does either.
- I do.
The story is right.
- His spokesman denied it on the air.
- He said it to me!
And you got proof of that I can bounce off our satellite?
- No!
- Is Maggie into Jim?
For Christ's sake, we're talking about...
What?
Am I losing Maggie?
No.
Are you good at knowing these things?
No.
Make sure he's at Dr. Habib's office at 10:00 tomorrow.
When are you and me gonna get busy?
I'm flattered, but you'd crush me.
That's true.
That's happened before.
Dress up like a tailback and he won't be able to lay a hand on you.
Shrimp boat, if I wasn't being paid to keep you alive...
- MACKENZIE:
Let's go.
- Hey, girl!
Do you really have to call her that?
She's packing up her office.
She's gonna unpack her office 'cause I figured a way out.
What?
The Japanese words for four and seven sound alike.
'Hey, girl!
- Yes?
Come on down.
I am here.
What's the Japanese word for four?
Shi.
- What's the Japanese word for seven?
- Shichi.
Those words are easy to mix up.
- No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.
Not for someone who's fluent in Japanese.
- You're not fluent in Japanese.
- Yes, I am.
No, you're not.
That's how you mixed up the numbers when you were talking to Tanaka in the preinterview.
SLOAN:
No, it's for exactly that reason that there are two words for four and two words for seven.
Yon and nana.
And it went from a four to a five to a seven.
That sounds very complicated.
Not if you're fluent in Japanese.
You're not anymore.
You're gonna go on TV tonight during Elliot's show,
- which I pray to God Elliot is hosting.
- He is.
And you're going to apologize and explain your error.
In exchange, Daisuke Tanaka is going to say that you made it clear that you were on the record and he doesn't have to resign and you don't have to be suspended.
We're all going to just lie and I'm going to look stupid.
- You bet.
One more thing.
- What?
Fukushima's announcing the radiation levels are a seven.
Thank you.
I don't know what the hell you're thanking me for.
Well, it takes a big man to admit he was wrong.
That isn't even remotely what I am doing.
Hang on, she's got to go on the air and say she made a mistake, that her Japanese is poor...
- Which it certainly is not.
- Just...
God.
She's gonna go on the air and say she thought it was a seven when it's really a four that then moved up to a five and she's really sorry, but also now it's really a seven?
It won't be our proudest moment, but it'll save the guy's job.
Save his honor.
Help very slightly with our increasingly dinged-up reputation, and it'll help the girl who we will now go back to addressing as Sloan or Miss Sabbith.
Will.
You want me to lie?
On television?
From a news desk with the ACN bug in the corner?
I do.
And if there's any fallout, I'll be standing right next to you and in front.
I'll always be standing right next to you and in front.
We fucked up.
Let's just live with that now.
WILL:
We lied on television from the news desk.
JACK:
It was a pretty harmless lie, wasn't it?
You know how many air hours I've spent railing against lying?
Calling people out on it?
We're the news and we're all gonna know we lied for the rest of our lives.
All right, so it turns out you know what you're doing.
So I'm sorry I've been a jerk.
Obviously the reason I can't sleep is the Santorum aide.
And I haven't talked to anyone about it, so I was trying...
- Bacon.
- What?
The bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches.
Bacon has tyramine, which increases the release of norepinephrine, which is a neurostimulant.
When did you figure that out?
When you said you made bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches.
- That was like an hour ago!
- Yeah.
Will, listen, and I'm going to write you a mild prescription, but you should come back.
If you don't like me, see someone else.
But see someone.
You've had a lot going on for a long time.
Very serious stuff.
And, by the way, you should be at an Al-Anon meeting at least once a week.
You have a lot going on now.
You're being hunted.
In the press, on the Internet, very possibly literally.
This whole file here from four years ago, every page is about MacKenzie.
In these notes are a lot of evidence that you're experiencing acute depression and doing a masterful job covering it.
That's done.
JACK:
Buying the ring was not normal.
I don't know what else to call it.
It wasn't normal.
It really doesn't take a team of Viennese specialists to see that you have unresolved issues with MacKenzie.
WILL:
No, my feelings are completely resolved.
She's a good friend and my most trusted partner.
The ring was just a prank.
JACK:
I know what you think of all this.
But I would really urge you to spend an hour a week faking it.
That's it.
Our time's up.
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
It's another TMI story.
You've had Wade on the show five times in six weeks.
- What's the story gonna be?
- It's gonna be that you're trying to get your boyfriend elected to Congress.
You can't think I used you to raise his profile.
I know for sure you didn't use me.
Plus, nobody in his right mind would risk losing you.
- You look really nice tonight.
- Yeah?
Definite yes, yeah.
I didn't know that I was in love with you, too, until--
- You cheated on me with your ex-boyfriend.
- That's what happened!
- It's been three years.
Time hasn't helped?
- No.
I want to give you five minutes every night to talk about where we are and how we got here.
There are people more qualified than I am.
Yeah, the thing is, they're not going to have your legs.
I would not ask you if I didn't think you were qualified.
Come after me all you want, Nina, but you touch my staff and I will rededicate my life to ruining yours.
( Theme music playing )
Will: ...$223 billion, putting an edge on the current fight on Capitol Hill about how deeply to cut this year's spending, along with projections that it would bring the debt ceiling-- excuse me--
the deficit to 1.6 trillion, ensuring that the debt ceiling will be hit during this fiscal year.
That's News Night.
Thanks for washing us--
Watching us.
Let me get out of here.
Will McAvoy is coming up with the Capitol Report from Washington.
- I'm Terry-- no.
- Mackenzie:
Wow.
- That's not true.
- End the broadcast.
- I'm Will McAvoy.
- Attaboy.
Terry Smith is coming up, mercifully, with the Capitol Report from Washington.
Good night.
( Music playing )
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm fine.
- "Thank you for washing us"?
- Think people noticed?
I do.
Stand here on this spot.
- What are you doing?
- Administering an eye exam.
- Excellent.
- Read the top line.
- E.
- Next line.
I don't know why people think there's a problem with health care in this country.
- Our current system is fine.
- Next line.
L-G.
The next line, R-T-Z.
The Greek letter for pi, the geometric symbol for congruent, and something off the table of natural elements.
Great, put your tie back on and get in the studio so we can retape that for the West Coast.
What's the problem?
I didn't get much sleep last night.
- How much is not much?
- None.
- Seriously?
- I went to bed at midnight, didn't fall asleep.
Is this the first time that's happened?
- No.
- Is it the second time?
I'm having a little bout with insomnia.
Have you tried Ambien?
I don't want to wake up in the middle of the Triborough Bridge eating scrambled eggs in my pajamas.
( Imitating Groucho Marx ) How those eggs got into my pajamas I'll never know.
You shouldn't do Groucho.
Seriously, you need to sleep or you're gonna forget to thank people for washing us.
I'm seeing my guy tomorrow at 10:00.
- Who's your guy?
- Abe.
- Who's Abe?
- Dr. Habib.
You're still seeing Abe?
That's wonderful, Will.
Everyone could use a little therapy.
And you a lot more than most.
I'm glad you're doing that.
- Well...
- You've been skipping appointments?
Sometimes.
When was the last time you saw him?
- What's today, the 12th?
- Yeah.
- About four years ago.
- Why did you stop seeing him?
- I've kept the appointments.
- What does that mean?
I've had an appointment every Wednesday at 10:00.
I just don't go.
You've been paying him for four years?
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Thank God.
I have a business manager who does that.
Why don't you read a magazine?
No, I've already read that issue of Cat Fancy cover to cover and I'm saving American Stamp Collector for a long plane ride.
All right.
Why not just go to your regular doctor?
When I go to my internist, he asks me questions.
It's a half-hour interview before he puts on a stethoscope.
- What kinds of questions?
- I don't know.
- How you feeling?
- Asshole.
Here, read Vegan Health.
- Will?
- Yeah.
I'm Jack Habib.
Come on in.
Are you Abe's son?
- I am.
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
Come on in.
- Is your dad inside?
No.
I can wait out here.
My father died two years ago and I took his practice.
Come on in.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Wait, what?
Will, I'm Dr. Jacob Habib, son of Dr. Abraham Habib.
My father passed away and his patients now see me.
You've been paying me for two years.
Come on in.
How old are you?
( Chuckles ) I'm 29.
( Laughs ) Shut up.
- Can you write prescriptions?
- Yeah.
Let's go.
- I'll be two minutes.
- All right.
So if you're 29--
Don't try to count backwards.
I did everything early.
So unless you're certain you've got a Doogie Howser joke I haven't heard, why don't we just assume it was hilarious and move on?
- Okay.
- So what's going on?
I need something to help me sleep.
- Why?
- I can't sleep.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Any recent change in diet?
I haven't changed my diet since college.
- You should.
- I invented a new sandwich.
Scrambled eggs, bacon, and melted cheese on toast.
I make two of them every night before I get into bed.
You invented an Egg McMuffin.
- Getting enough exercise?
- I have to scramble the eggs.
- And other than that?
- No.
Look, any kind of sleeping pill will do.
Sure.
Just talk a little bit?
Oh, God, please, let's not.
- You're still taking Effexor?
- No.
- Clonazepam?
- No.
- Ativan?
- No.
Four years ago, you were on 135mg of Effexor
- plus Clonazepam and Ativan at bedtime.
- I'm not anymore.
- Why is that?
- I was cured.
These are all antianxiety medications.
And I have no more anxiety.
Except for not being able to sleep.
Right, so if you'll just give me a prescription for--
Yeah, I'm going to.
- Just a few more questions.
- Okay.
Any extra stress at work?
Extra stress?
- Yeah.
- No.
- No extra stress?
- No.
- One more question.
- Sure.
What are you fucking around with me for?
I'm sorry?
What are you fucking around with me for?
- I just asked if there's any extra stress at work--
- There isn't.
There isn't.
What about the death threat?
You know about that?
Anyone who reads a newspaper knows about that.
- It's truly not a big deal.
- No?
Jack, can I get the prescription?
Just tell me how a death threat isn't a big deal.
I used to be a criminal prosecutor.
And I'm telling you nobody who's serious about killing you sends you a note beforehand to warn you.
The gentleman who is with you in the waiting room, he's a bodyguard, right?
Yeah, but you shouldn't-- That's the--
Our insurance company makes that decision.
Based on what?
They have experts who determine whether a cret is threadible--
Threat is credible.
And why do they think the threat is credible?
Nine questions ago, you said one more question.
Why do they think the threat is credible?
Because I changed the rules of the comment section of our website.
That's all.
I changed the rules of the comment section.
As always, or at least since Monday, we end our show with your own viewer comments on our website.
So let's see what we have tonight.
LollypopLollypop says, "30 more seconds and you would have had that self-loathing hypocrite in tears."
That-
- That was absolutely not my intention.
SurrendrDorothee said, "Your Log Cabin closet case hit the Uncle Tom Daily Double-- a traitor to his race and a traitor to his sexual orientation."
Don't blow a gasket.
He's plainly not a closet case.
He's openly gay.
I also think he showed a lot of courage coming on the show.
Certainly more courage than it takes to post an anonymous comment on a website.
Terry Smith's coming up from Washington with the Capitol Report.
I'm Will McAvoy.
Good night.
( Music playing )
Man:
We're out.
- Neal!
- Believe me, those were the best two we had.
Why didn't we just hit him in the head with a shovel?
- We've got to talk about what just happened.
- I'm trying to.
Not the website.
We've got to talk about what happened on the air.
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Were you outside your body?
I don't want to talk about it.
I want to talk about the website.
The website's not the problem right now.
It's my problem right now.
We're putting up these comments--
- We've heard this before.
- But we're still doing it.
It's a trade with Reese.
The page views offset the ratings drop.
Is there any way of knowing if LollypopLollypop is 10 years old?
Or a basset hound?
The reason basset hounds have such long ears is so they can waft up the scent when they're hunting.
- Is there any way of knowing?
- No.
Is there any way of knowing if LollypopLollypop
- and SurrendrDorothee are the same person?
- No.
Who posts comments on the Internet more,
- people who are content or people who are incontent?
- Mackenzie:
Discontent.
- What?
- It's discontent, not incontent.
- It's about 30-1 incontent.
- Discontent.
Final question:
In your wildest dreams, can you imagine Walter Cronkite saying LollypopLollypop as many times as I have in the last 10 minutes?
Not unless he was in an a cappella doo-wop group, no.
He wasn't.
Here's what I'd love.
You want to join the discussion, fine.
I want to know your name, age, occupation,
- and level of education.
- Oh, God.
The thing about the Internet is it's a populist tool.
Populists have names, too.
William Jennings Bryan, Will Rogers, me.
- Will.
- Unless you're Deep Throat or in the Witness Protection Program, anonymity is cowardice.
You're in a mob.
You're lobbing smack from the cheap seats.
Don't we have bigger fish to fry than the--
Yes, but we can fry more than one fish at a time.
And how could we possibly verify someone's name,
- age, occupation, and level of education?
- Neal?
We implement a third-party verification service.
All you had to say was, "We can't"
- and the conversation would have been over.
- So it is possible?
It's what the IRS uses when you're filing online.
Talk to me, Tonto.
- We can do it if you want.
- Oh, I want.
Won't the result be that nobody posts comments on our website anymore?
First of all, oh, no.
What will we do without feedback from SurrendrDorothee?
And second, the result will be our website will ghettoize every other website.
The result will be civility in the public square and a triumph of populism.
I'm going to single-handedly fix the Internet.
- What could possibly go wrong?
- Mackenzie:
Will!
- What?
- We have to talk about what just happened.
No, we don't.
We're just gonna move on.
And when did you get the death threat?
I don't know.
A day after the mosque interview.
Woman:
We know that an Islamic trend is to build large mosques on the cherished sites of conquered lands.
- You're talking about Cordoba.
- That's exactly right.
When Muslims conquered Cordoba, Spain, they tore down churches and synagogues and put mosques in their place.
Ms. Greer, Muslims conquered Cordoba in the year 712.
Do you think we can call something that last happened in the 8th century a trend?
She'll say, "Why does it have to be at Ground Zero?"
Anyone being honest about the prospect of a mosque being built so close to Ground Zero would say it instinctually feels wrong.
Is it legal?
Of course it is.
Is it wrong?
Of course it is.
It should be built somewhere where the 9/11 families don't have to feel the agony of having a shrine to their loved ones stomped upon.
All over America we're seeing the influence of creeping Islam.
We are?
What about those who would impose Sharia law?
Women can be stoned to death for committing adultery.
No, they can't.
Actual laws are the only laws that are enforceable, including the one that says you can't create religious laws.
And the US is in no more danger of coming under Sharia law than it is the rules of Fight Club.
Let me ask you something.
Muslims the world over are fighting a civil war over the direction Islam is taking.
Are you going to be stationed at the door of that mosque to turn radicals away?
Can you guarantee that the current imam is going to be the same imam 10 years from now?
It's worth pointing out that it's not a mosque.
It's a community center.
I'm not sure why you think that makes it better.
What business does a community center have in the religion business?
And then pivot to the larger point.
I want the art and graphics reviewed three times before air.
Will:
Ms. Greer, you mentioned creeping Islam.
Are you concerned about creeping Christianity?
( Chuckles ) Only that it's not creeping fast enough.
Okay, here are some things done on American soil in the name of Christianity.
The Ku Klux Klan burned down black churches, raped women, murdered civil rights workers, murdered children, and terrorized communities for over a century.
The neo-Nazis all acted and continue to act in the name of white Christian supremacy.
The Army of God fatally attacks abortion clinics and doctors across the country.
The Covenant, The Sword, and The Arm of the Lord targets local police and federal agents.
The federal building in Oklahoma City, the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan, and the successful assassinations of Martin Luther King,
John F. Kennedy, John Lennon, and Abraham Lincoln, all perpetrated by Christians.
Ms. Greer, we weren't attacked by Muslims.
We were attacked by sociopaths.
And I, for one, would join you in protesting a community center for the criminally insane.
But no one is suggesting building one.
Here's the thing about the Japanese.
Where we tend to hype things up, they go the other direction.
You think they're lowballing Fukushima?
I don't know anything about nuclear reactors, and I'm not at all involved in this story.
I'm just saying I wouldn't take their word for it it's a level five.
Excuse me, Will.
There's a comment on your website you need to see.
Ah, now I get to say who is it from?
What do they do?
It's serious.
From about 25 minutes ago.
Don: "Fucking sand niggers should get herded and slaughtered.
I've got a bullet for you, too.
You think I'm fucking around?
2 Hudson Street, 27."
- Is 2 Hudson 27--
- It's my address and apartment number.
Alice Cynkar, an English professor at OSU.
It wasn't written by an English professor and it wasn't written by Alice Cynkar.
How much effort does it take to scam the new system?
