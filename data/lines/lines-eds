But we've only been able to do that by trusting the machine.
And if it's saying that this guy's gotta go, well, I think we should still trust it.
John, I urge you to consider the consequences of this action.
There are consequences to not acting.
Like with Simmons and Joss.
Don't do this.
If we let him walk out that door, Decima wins.
Samaritan will go live.
It's a possibility but not a certainty.
There may be another way.
We've never been here.
But are you really willing to take that risk?
Harold?
Since we started this, things have changed.
We've changed.
But the mission, our purpose, has always been constant...
To save lives.
If that's changed somehow, if we're in a place now where the machine is asking us to commit murder...
That's a place I can't go.
I'm afraid this is where I get off.
John.
You've had an opportunity to consider my proposal.
Will you help us?
My colleagues and I would like to, but unfortunately now is not the time.
Perhaps a demonstration of my system's capabilities will convince you that your country cannot afford to wait.
Test in a limited area, say...
New York City.
24 hours, quick, clean.
Then we shut it down.
No guns, no police, just information.
What kind of information?
If the NSA provides us with New York City's surveillance feeds, we will find you a terrorist.
You could find me a thousand terrorists, but like I said, we'll never get this through Congress.
And as I told you, dissenting voices would not be a problem.
It's time to remove those obstacles.
Answer your phone, Senator.
How you doing, Garrison?
This is Roger McCourt.
I understand you'll be preparing some legislation.
Is that right?
If you can handle the senate,
I can ensure that the house rules facilitate a quiet passage.
You can do all that?
Absolutely, Senator.
Okay.
Let's...
Do it.
Excellent.
Now if there's anything else you need, just ask.
I'm your man.
Virgil, are we operational?
You're just in time for the ribbon cutting.
Feeds are coming online now.
Commencing beta test.
Okay, we have 24 hours.
Splendid.
Find me Harold Finch.
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system...
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
The leaked black budget report reveals several classified military intelligence programs, with code names like Chalk Eagle and Tractor Rose.
A program designated Northern Lights has...
Northern Lights has a budget far outstripping any other program.
Classified as "operation support"
for counterterrorism activities,"
the details are scarce.
Some have speculated that it may be related to the surveillance of American citizens.
If so, what does that mean for our privacy?
Media got a hold of the program name, which means your old boss control just lost it.
Bitch tried to kill me.
Nice to see her head on the chopping block for change.
Anyone connected to the machine will be burying evidence 6 feet down.
Could put the program in jeopardy.
Government can't put the machine back in the box.
We're still getting our numbers, so the lights are on.
Let's go.
Morning.
You guys have the pancakes?
Try the banana chocolate chip... amazing.
What?
No small talk?
All right, fine by me.
You have the product?
What's it look like?
You got the money?
1 million.
We have a deal?
You got it, man.
That fast, huh?
Couldn't even wait to get back to the hotel to count it?
See, Ray, your partner's already picked out a house in Hawaii.
So as soon as you turn your back, he's gonna put two in your head and keep all the money for himself.
But guess what, Julio.
Ray here put a down payment on a yacht, told your girl he'd show her the world.
500,000 buys a lot.
But a million?
Both of you would take out your partner for that.
Oh, you little son of a...
Sorry, guys.
Deal's off.
Sweet dreams, boys.
Fusco can clean this up.
20 years in lockup ought to keep 'em from killing each other.
See?
Business as usual.
Even if the government's program's on ice, the machine is still spitting out numbers.
You know Finch.
Even without Northern Lights, his machine will find a way to maintain national security.
Really?
Well, then who's handling the relevant threats?
Root.
Hey, kids.
- You miss me between drug deals?
- Yeah
I miss you like I miss an intestinal parasite.
I love your similes.
Hop on, Shaw.
We've got a relevant number in Alaska.
We're gonna steal a jet.
Does sound kind of fun.
Send me a postcard.
Turn that frown upside down, Lurch.
You're going on vacation too.
Harold's about to call from D.C. he needs your help.
Mr. Reese, I'm afraid our services are required in the nation's capital.
I heard.
On my way.
Finch?
This'll work.
Oh, good, you're here.
Sorry, got tied up at the library.
I'm happy to see that you've come prepared for a long haul.
Dare I hope that you've packed something other than weaponry?
There's some trip wire to booby-trap the room door.
And a toothbrush.
Oral hygiene is something, I suppose.
You got a number here in D.C.?
It would seem so.
My investigation into vigilance's activities will have to wait.
Well, Root is getting the relevant numbers now.
Shaw is with her.
We're entering uncharted territory, tasked with both relevant and irrelevant numbers.
Already stretched pretty thin, Finch.
And at the worst possible time.
Just when Decima is determined to make Samaritan operational.
Maybe the timing's not a coincidence.
I fear that it may be connected.
These are strange times, and the threat of Samaritan should not be underestimated.
How do you know it's not already up and running?
Because we'd be dead, Mr. Reese.
The machine is a shield.
It protects lives.
I designed it with safeguards to prevent it being abused as an agent of destruction.
Samaritan is an open system, a sword.
If it gains access to the government's feeds, there will be no checks on it's power.
There will be no limits to the knowledge possessed by the person controlling it.
Decima would definitely use it to hunt down it's enemies.
And as confidants of the machine, you and I would be at the top of the list.
So maybe the machine is trying to protect us.
No, I built it to protect everyone, one number at a time.
Oh, my.
What?
That's Roger McCourt.
Our new number is a United States congressman?
From Illinois.
Six terms in Congress.
Current ranking minority member of the pivotal house rules committee.
The rules committee controls the flow of legislation...
Spurring it forward or stopping it altogether.
If he has that much power, he'll have plenty of enemies.
Given their activities in Washington recently, vigilance would have to be a suspect.
However, McCourt's been an outspoken opponent of government surveillance.
Could Decima want him dead?
Perhaps.
But killing a congressman would seem too flashy for them.
Nobody likes the government these days.
Any disgruntled citizen could be the assassin.
We have to get to the Capitol.
You call this music?
Finch?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Can we put the screeching cat out of it's misery?
It's not feline.
It's Verdi.
There's a performance of Il Trovatore at the Kennedy Center that I'd like to catch.
Next time you can be the disc jockey.
We'll listen to whatever you like.
Well, maybe next time I'll just sing for you.
I do a great ring cycle, you know.
I think I'll skip your Brunnhilde.
Suit yourself.
Looks like our congressman is in danger of catching lobbyist disease.
It's gonna be difficult to get ears on McCourt.
His aide handles all phone activity.
McCourt doesn't want the government eavesdropping on him?
Congressmen know better than anyone that their employer could be listening.
We'll have to get close to him, narrow down the list of threats.
The capitol police detail won't let anyone near him.
Congressmen are eligible for secret service protection in the event of additional risk.
No one's made an attempt on his life yet.
The congressman doesn't even know the danger he's in.
He knows now.
Drive, Finch.
I have to tell you, Mr. Reese,
I don't approve of this strategy.
You're the one who said you couldn't make an alias that would pass secret service muster.
I said I didn't have time.
I didn't know you were gonna steal the identity of an actual secret service agent.
I'm just borrowing it.
Relax.
Order some room service.
Perhaps I will when you tell me what you've done with the real Agent Abbott.
He's resting comfortably in a motel room near the airport.
Define "comfortably."
Gotta go, Finch.
The rules committee is meeting in ten minutes, you have your journal interview at 11:30, and then lunch at Ocean Grill with Cynthia Carol from Privacy First to discuss your anti-surveillance initiative.
- Good morning, Leslie.
- Good morning, Congressman.
Who's this?
This is Agent Abbott, secret service.
He's been assigned to you.
Because of the shooting?
Oh, sorry, I was thinking more about the business ahead of me today rather than behind.
Where you from, Abbott?
He's from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Tulsa, sir.
Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Good people, salt of the earth.
And for tonight, tickets to the Verdi opera at the Kennedy Center.
Do I have to go to this?
This sounds like screeching cats.
You promised your wife.
I could shoot you in the leg, sir.
Pardon me?
Might get you out of the opera.
You know, Duran here, he always wanted to be secret service.
Isn't that right, Duran?
At one time, sir.
Well, if you show Abbott some love here, maybe he'll put in a good word for you.
Oh, and we can dispense with the stoplights today, okay?
- McCourt!
- Dunphy.
You should've called first.
My office is slammed this morning.
Is this about the airline contract?
- They're trying to stick it to us, Mac.
- Yeah.
And now I'm hearing you might be taking their side instead of the union's?
Dunphy, Dunphy.
It must be Bruce Dunphy, part of the leadership of the Illinois Machinists Union.
I know it's a lousy contract, but
I do think that you ought to sign it.
Unbelievable.
You backstabbing son of a...
Whoa, hold it, hold it.
You think you can pull this bait and switch with us, with me, and get away with it?
Looks like McCourt might have crossed the wrong union, boss.
It's not a good deal, but it does keep the plant open.
And it puts you at the front of the line for a bigger government contract that's coming down the pike next year.
- Another contract?
- Yeah.
So you see, Bruce, I am looking out for your guys.
But you do have to trust me.
I guess I jumped the gun a little bit.
Forget it.
Hey, is your wife in town with you?
- Yeah.
- Here.
Go as my guest.
It's classical stuff.
She'll love it.
Really?
Oh, thanks, Mac.
It's my pleasure.
Tell your guys not to worry.
Remember, I'm your man.
Thanks.
Leslie, will you call my wife and tell her unfortunately the opera was sold out?
It would appear our congressman has quite a knack for getting himself out of unpleasant situations.
Yeah, that opera would've been brutal.
Hmm.
I'm not accustomed to taking meetings on such short notice, but your reputation precedes you.
Don't worry, Senator.
I come with only the best of intentions.
So what can I do for you?
Actually it's what I can do for you and your Northern Lights problem.
If you're referring to the leaked black budget report, mine's just one of 100 names found in there.
I've already made it clear
I have no knowledge of that project.
Really?
I thought you knew a great deal about it, especially since the 2008 policy retreat on Martha's vineyard when you were tapped to shepherd the program.
Surely you didn't think, in a world where you were surveilling everyone, that no one was watching you.
So...
What is it you want?
As I told you, to help.
The group responsible for leaking your black budget to the press calls themselves Vigilance.
Privacy terrorists.
This is one of their leaders, known by his alias as Peter Collier.
Ironic.
You risked your career hiding a program designed to protect the country, yet it couldn't protect you from this group when you needed it to.
And now you've had to shut it down...
Leaving your country unprotected.
A frightening prospect indeed.
The country will always be protected.
Yes, I'm sure you're weighing alternative approaches, as your president might say.
I can save you the time.
My company, Decima Technologies, is finalizing development of a new surveillance system.
All due respect, we've gone down a similar path with mixed results.
Northern lights was effective but compromised by the ethics of it's creator.
It spoke but never listened.
What I have not only listens, but obeys.
It can find anyone anywhere, anytime.
You merely need to ask.
As intriguing as that sounds, there are some members of Congress making too much hay out of this latest scandal to ever green-light another program.
Hmm.
Share my proposal with your colleagues.
If there is interest...
Dissenting voices will not be a problem.
How can you be sure?
Because, Senator, obstacles are only obstacles until you move them out of the way.
So how long you been with the congressman?
Long enough to know he doesn't need secret service protection.
What about the shooting?
Just some antigovernment wing nut looking to make the news cycle.
I suppose that's possible.
Mr. Reese?
That's my supervisor.
Guy's always in my ear.
What do you got, Finch?
Nothing of note.
McCourt's list of enemies is practically nonexistent.
He ran a surprisingly clean campaign to get into office, and his current stand against unchecked surveillance has endeared him to elements of both parties.
What about his personal life?
No red flags... finances are sound, carries no debt, and has an impressive stock portfolio.
Help you with something, friend?
Let go of me.
I'm trying to be polite here.
It's all right, Abbott, I've got this.
Have a seat.
Thank you, sir.
Local homeless guy.
I've seen him around.
McCourt knows him?
No, but people like him know McCourt.
He's got a standing offer to buy a meal for anyone who needs one.
It's a practice he started last year to raise awareness for the homeless problem.
One more, Congressman.
It also helps burnish his public image.
Okay.
Get him some soup.
Finch, take this down.
Echo Five Dash Nine Mike India Six.
A license plate?
See if you can trace it.
Abbott, chop chop!
What was that?
Forget it.
Starting to think I should've gone with Root.
Thanks for being my travel buddy on these errands.
Sure.
It's not every day you get to beat up a militia group in Anchorage, then hop a plane to Miami.
So is this what you're doing from now on, you're chasing down bad guys?
I doubt it.
There's still too much work to be done.
What kind of work?
Preparation.
I understand.
We're leaving now.
- Time to go.
- Where to?
- St. Louis.
- Oh, great.
I know a steak joint that serves a filet that's better than sex.
Yummy as that sounds, you won't be joining me.
She needs you somewhere else.
W-where?
You should go back to dealing coke, Sonny.
It's a lot safer than moving explosives.
You there, Finch?
Always, Mr. Reese.
Sounds rather quiet there.
I think the only thing McCourt is in danger of is working too late.
I fear you may need to remain on his security detail longer than anticipated.
Shouldn't we check in on the real Agent Abbott?
Yeah, I guess someone should turn him over.
I beg your pardon?
What's going on?
Something's wrong, Finch.
Sorry.
What the hell, Abbott?
You never heard of knocking?
I'm sorry.
I thought I heard a...
Never mind.
Should I call it in?
Finch, McCourt and his aide have been working on more than just policy positions.
Might wanna consider his wife as a possible threat.
Actually, her emails show that she's been aware of his affairs for quite some time.
Seems they have more of an arrangement than a marriage.
Mr. Reese, I found something.
What is it?
With Fusco's aid,
I was able to trace the license plate from the SUV outside the restaurant back to a rental car company.
It seems the vehicle was rented to a shell corporation set up by another company...
Decima Technologies.
Decima.
You were right, Finch.
It's all connected.
McCourt must be a threat to Samaritan.
Which would explain why they're here.
Duran.
There's something you should know, Officer.
He's not secret service.
What?
Who's this?
Here's the real Agent Abbott.
Don't do it.
- Abbott, what are you doing?
- Stay put.
Mr. Reese, what's happening?
Change of plans.
I've got McCourt.
Got him?
You've kidnapped a United States congressman?
Like you said, Finch, these are strange times.
Hello, Harold.
Mr. Reese, I have to question the wisdom of abducting an elected official.
Well, Decima blew my cover and started shooting.
The capitol police and secret service are scouring the city for you now, plus the FBI and about a dozen other three-letter agencies.
Let's see how they're doing.
Traveling west on Independence Avenue.
Congressman was abducted in a black sport utility vehicle,
- Illinois license plate 20...
- Mm-hmm.
- That's us.
- Congressional tags.
So we need to dump the car and hole up somewhere.
Very well.
Turn left up here.
I know a place.
American beef consultants, Finch?
We need a hiding place, not a burger.
Last month I bought the beef industry's lobbying arm.
And don't knock the hamburgers.
They're superb.
Doesn't look like much of a safe house.
That's the idea...
I cleared out this floor and added a couple of cutting-edge amenities...
Fully stocked kitchen, bulletproof glass.
Okay, Mac.
You gonna scream?
John.
Bedside manner.
Congressman, strange as it may seem, we wish you no harm, we're here to help.
But we do need to ask you a few questions, and we would prefer that you did not yell for assistance.
Who are you?
Security advisors...
Of a sort.
Well, yeah, I can pay the ransom.
I can get however much money you need.
Someone's trying to kill you.
Yeah, you.
What?
No.
We're protection.
Protection?
You posed as, uh, secret service, you knock out my security detail, and then you abduct me at gunpoint.
Technically I also shot at you a couple days ago.
Somebody help me, please!
That's enough!
We don't have time for this.
If you wanna survive, you're gonna have to help us.
Now, about that hit squad that my colleague rescued you from...
Hit squad?
That wasn't a hit squad.
That was the FBI trying to save me from you.
I know it may have appeared that way, but I assure you that was not the case.
What do you know about company called Decima?
Never heard of it.
Why?
They sent the team that tried to kill you.
Do you know why they would consider you an enemy?
Me, an enemy?
I'm not an enemy.
People love me.
I mean, I might piss a few people off along the way, but I always get 'em whatever it is they need.
I'm a deal maker.
So what is it with you guys?
What do you want, money?
You want a personal telephone call from the president?
'Cause I can get it.
Just please, come on.
Let me go.
Then, whatever you need, I'm your man.
Finch, get down!
- You guys all right?
- Yes, we're fine.
Why is everybody shooting at everybody?
I mean, if you're shooting at federal agents...
Feds don't walk in scattering lead.
- Decima found us.
- How?
McCourt has no phone to follow.
It's a tracker.
Do you know who gave you this?
No idea.
It was given to me at a fund-raiser a week ago.
More operatives will be arriving soon.
We need to go.
We should leave the beltway.
We'll need a new car.
Or an old one...
Easier to hotwire.
Take McCourt.
This guy again.
He's like a cockroach.
Sounds like our last escape route is about to disappear.
I'm more comfortable shooting this guy than the cops.
You guys going my way?
Congressman was abducted by a white male, 6'3", dark hair, in suit.
Be advised, suspect is armed and extremely dangerous.
Nice car, Shaw.
So how'd you know we'd be there?
I didn't...
Until five minutes ago.
I got a call from Root.
So you're the one we're saving?
Yeah.
Who are you?
Right now I'm the getaway driver.
Boy, this just gets worse.
Cheer up, Mac.
You could be in the trunk with the guy who wants to kill you.
We can't go back.
It's too dangerous.
I could try blasting through the roadblock.
The term "blasting"
does not inspire great confidence, Ms. Shaw.
Time to get some fresh air.
I'll get the guy in the trunk.
Let's go.
Time to stretch your legs.
All clear.
Newspapers in the driveway, mail piled up.
Must be on vacation.
Let's hope they decide to stay another night.
What now?
Some answers.
Look, I don't know how many times I have to tell you.
I haven't done anything to make anybody wanna kill me.
Well, until we determine the reason that Decima keeps making attempts on your life, you'll have to stay with us.
You have our Decima friend's phone?
I pulled out the SIM card.
If you really wanna protect me, why don't you just take me to the cops?
Law enforcement is no deterrent to the people coming after you, Congressman.
This is insane.
You've obviously done something to attract their attention.
Like what?
Decima is a private intelligence company developing a large-scale surveillance program...
The type of program that you've been vocally against.
Along with half the Congress.
So?
But your position on the rules committee gives you the power to alter or halt legislation.
Have you sidelined anything that would affect Decima's plans?
No.
I don't know anything about that company or why they would wanna kill me.
This is all just a huge mistake.
We're not getting anywhere here.
Maybe Shaw's having some luck.
You can talk or bleed out.
You help us, we'll help you.
Suit yourself, tough guy.
Hope it's worth dying for.
That may not be necessary.
I was able to get into his phone through a key vulnerability in the SMS encryption.
I think we may have misread this situation.
"Protect"?
Seems we're not the only ones concerned with the congressman's safety.
So who are you supposed to be protecting McCourt from?
I wasn't given that information.
But in the week we've been watching him, the only ones who have taken a shot at him are you.
You think maybe I could get a coffee?
Or some water would be fine.
Mr. McCourt, you're sure you have no knowledge of Decima?
I already answered that.
Why do you keep beating that drum?
Because they're protecting you.
Protecting me?
A minute ago you said they were trying to kill me.
I did.
Something doesn't add up.
Actually I think it might.
I looked into your finances earlier today, Congressman.
You did what?
I noticed your stock portfolio, up 20% over last year.
What are you getting at?
Your trading activities.
Your portfolio is up 20% due to trades you've made in the last two weeks.
Trades that have increased in value by over 600%.
- So?
- So...
Either you're the smartest investor in Washington, or you're getting some very good information.
Inside information.
I don't like what you're implying.
It's more than an implication, Congressman, and it'll become a call to an S.E.C. investigator I know unless you're more truthful with us.
Okay.
I know Decima Technologies.
But they're not trying to kill me.
We have an understanding.
What kind of an understanding?
They were looking for a little legislative support for their new surveillance program.
Support?
You've been leading the charge against government surveillance.
Course I have.
'Cause I realized that the government can't keep a secret.
You look at, uh, Prism and this Northern Lights mess.
What do you know about Decima's program?
Not much really.
Just that it's an alternative to a government-run system.
Which, at this point, should make everybody happy.
And in return for your support, you're getting insider stock tips.
You're a couple of smart guys, you know?
Surely you understand that everything that happens in Washington is a deal.
And you're a deal maker.
In case you didn't know, the business of governments is business.
They're moving grid to grid through the neighborhood.
We need to make a move.
Greer is positioning Samaritan to replace the machine.
McCourt is helping Decima.
We've been looking at him as a victim,
- but he's really a perpetrator.
- I'm not so sure.
His involvement is tangential at best, and he doesn't know Greer's intentions.
But if he's not a victim or a perp, then why did the machine give us his number?
What is it we're supposed to be stopping?
I'm not sure we're supposed to be stopping anything.
Finch, you said McCourt could speed up or halt legislation.
Yes, he's in a unique position to remove any legislative roadblock to Samaritan.
So without McCourt,
Samaritan doesn't get past Congress.
And Greer wouldn't get access to the NSA's surveillance feeds.
Then that's why we got his number.
He is the victim.
His life is in danger.
But from who?
Us.
I think the machine wants us to kill McCourt.
John, think about what you're saying.
I have.
Just because Decima is not the threat to McCourt doesn't mean that we must be.
The machine is designed to save lives, not take them.
But could it?
Could the machine ever tell us to kill someone?
Is it possible?
It's conceivable.
Well, how bad would the situation have to be?
Bad.
It would have to see that an individual's actions could directly result in the loss of others' lives.
How many lives?
A dozen, a hundred?
How many?
A lot.
I'm not sure.
I never dreamt it would come to this.
Well, it has.
Your machine...
It sees something coming...
Something bad...
And it wants us to stop it.
I don't know.
You don't know that.
Look, I've never entirely trusted your machine, but you built it, and I trust you.
You're the one who said we can't underestimate the threat of Samaritan.
Mr. McCourt, you have to call off your deal with Decima.
Their surveillance program cannot be approved.
What... what are you, one of those privacy nut jobs?
Is that what this is about?
With access to the government's surveillance feeds,
Decima will be able to acquire any information, any secret it desires, and sell it to the highest bidder.
And that would be the United States government.
Perhaps, for now.
But unbridled access will create unlimited opportunities for abuse.
People will be ruined, lives will be lost.
The results will be nothing short of catastrophic.
These programs are always gonna be controversial but also inevitable.
People get up in arms whenever they go public, but eventually the noise dies down, because the simple truth is that people wanna be protected.
They just don't wanna know how.
Oh, maybe I haven't offered you the right incentive.
So how much?
Excuse me?
To withdraw your support for Decima's program, how much?
Hey, you know, I did this to keep the country safe.
And yeah, maybe I got a little something for myself during the process.
All that makes me is good at what I do.
I'm not calling off the deal.
Looks like we've got company...
S.W.A.T., feds, the works.
Mr. Reese, it was never my intention for people to be killed because of the machine.
What do you think happened when it gave the government a terrorist number?
What do you think we used to do for a living?
That man is not a terrorist.
He's just an opportunistic and corrupt pawn.
That doesn't make the threat any less real.
We are not assassins.
We protect people.
Isn't that what we're doing, sacrificing the life of one to save the lives of many?
Shaw, help me out here.
Six months ago, I would've already put a bullet in that guy's head.
But ever since hanging around you guys,
I've kind of gotten used to saving people.
But we've only been able to do that by trusting the machine.
And if it's saying that this guy's gotta go, well, I think we should still trust it.
John, I urge you to consider the consequences of this action.
There are consequences to not acting.
Like with Simmons and Joss.
Don't do this.
If we let him walk out that door, Decima wins.
Samaritan will go live.
It's a possibility but not a certainty.
There may be another way.
We've never been here.
But are you really willing to take that risk?
Harold?
Since we started this, things have changed.
We've changed.
But the mission, our purpose, has always been constant...
To save lives.
If that's changed somehow, if we're in a place now where the machine is asking us to commit murder...
That's a place I can't go.
I'm afraid this is where I get off.

My colleagues and I would like to, but unfortunately now is not the time.
Perhaps a demonstration of my system's capabilities will convince you that your country cannot afford to wait.
Test in a limited area, say...
New York City.
24 hours, quick, clean.
Then we shut it down.
No guns, no police, just information.
What kind of information?
If the NSA provides us with New York City's surveillance feeds, we will find you a terrorist.
You could find me a thousand terrorists, but like I said, we'll never get this through Congress.
And as I told you, dissenting voices would not be a problem.

How you doing, Garrison?
This is Roger McCourt.
I understand you'll be preparing some legislation.
Is that right?
If you can handle the senate,
I can ensure that the house rules facilitate a quiet passage.
You can do all that?
Absolutely, Senator.
Okay.
Let's...
Do it.
Excellent.

(finch) you are being watched.
The government has a secret system--
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror,
But it sees everything...
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator,
If your number's up, we'll find you.
The leaked black budget report reveals several classified
Military intelligence programs,
With code names like chalk eagle
And tractor rose.
A program designated northern lights has...
Northern lights has a budget far outstripping
Any other program.
Classified as "operation support
For counterterrorism activities,"
The details are scarce.
Somehavespeculated that it may be related
To the surveillance of american citizens.
If so, what does that mean for our privacy?
Media got a hold of the program name,
Which means your old boss control just lost it.
Bitch tried to kill me.
Nice to see her head on the chopping block for change.
Anyone connected to the machine will be burying evidence 6 feet down.
Could put the program in jeopardy.
Government can't put the machine back in the box.
We're still getting our numbers,
So the lights are on.
Let's go.
Morning.
You guys have the pancakes?
Try the banana chocolate chip--amazing.
What?
No small talk?
All right, fine by me.
You have the product?
What's it look like?
You got the money?
1 million.
We have a deal?
You got it, man.
That fast, huh?
Couldn't even wait to get back to the hotel to count it?
See, ray, your partner's already picked out a house in hawaii.
So as soon as you turn your back,
He's gonna put two in your head
And keep all the money for himself.
But guess what, julio.
Ray here put a down payment on a yacht,
Told your girl he'd show her the world.
500,000 buys a lot.
But a million?
Both of you would take out your partner for that.
Oh, you little son of a...
Sorry, guys.
Deal's off.
[all grunting]
Sweet dreams, boys.
[groans]
Fusco can clean this up.
20 years in lockup ought to keep 'em from killing each other.
(shaw) see?
Business as usual.
Even if the government's program's on ice,
The machine is still spitting out numbers.
You know finch.
Even without northern lights, his machine will find a way
To maintain national security.
Really?
Well, then who's handling the relevant threats?
Root.
Hey, kids.
You miss me between drug deals?
Yeah.
I miss you like I miss an intestinal parasite.
I love your similes.
Hop on, shaw.
We've got a relevant number in alaska.
We're gonna steal a jet.
Does sound kind of fun.
Send me a postcard.
Turn that frown upside down, lurch.
You're going on vacation too.
Harold's about to call from d.C. He needs your help.
[engine revs] [earpiece beeps]
(finch) mr.
Reese, I'm afraid our services are required
Inthenation'scapital.
I heard.
On my way.
[door opens, closes]
Finch?
This'll work.
[door opens]
Oh, good, you're here.
Sorry, got tied up at the library.
I'm happy to see that you've come prepared for a long haul.
Dare I hope that you've packed something other than weaponry?
There's some trip wire to booby-trap the room door.
And a toothbrush.
Oral hygiene is something, I suppose.
You got a number here in d.C.?
It would seem so.
My investigation into vigilance's activities
Will have to wait.
Well, root is getting the relevant numbers now.
Shaw is with her.
We're entering uncharted territory,
Tasked with both relevant and irrelevant numbers.
Already stretched pretty thin, finch.
And at the worst possible time.
Just when decima is determined to make samaritan operational.
Maybe the timing's not a coincidence.
I fear that it may be connected.
These are strange times,
And the threat of samaritan should not be underestimated.
How do you know it's not already up and running?
Because we'd be dead, mr.
Reese.
The machine is a shield.
It protects lives.
I designed it with safeguards to prevent it being abused
As an agent of destruction.
Samaritan is an open system, a sword.
If it gains access to the government's feeds,
There will be no checks on its power.
There will be no limits to the knowledge possessed
By the person controlling it.
Decima would definitely use it to hunt down its enemies.
And as confidants of the machine,
You and I would be at the top of the list.
(reese) so maybe the machine is trying to protect us.
No, I built it to protect everyone,
One number at a time.
Oh, my.
What?
(reese) that's roger mccourt.
Our new number is a United States congressman?
From illinois.
Six terms in congress.
Current ranking minority member
Ofthepivotal house rules committee.
The rules committee controls the flow of legislation--
Spurring it forward or stopping it altogether.
If he has that much power,
He'll have plenty of enemies.
Given their activities in washington recently,
Vigilance would have to be a suspect.
However,mccourt'sbeen an outspoken opponent
Of government surveillance.
Could decima want him dead?
Perhaps.
But killing a congressman would seem too flashy for them.
Nobody likes the government these days.
Any disgruntled citizen could be the assassin.
We have to get to the capitol.
[opera music]
¶ ¶ [reese scoffs]
You call this music?
Finch?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Can we put the screeching cat out of its misery?
It's not feline.
It's verdi.
There's a performance of il trovatore
Atthekennedycenter that I'd like to catch.
Next time you can be the disc jockey.
We'll listen to whatever you like.
Well, maybe next time I'll just sing for you.
I do a great ring cycle, you know.
I think I'll skip your brunnhilde.
Suit yourself.
Lookslikeourcongressman is in danger
Ofcatching lobbyist disease.
It's gonna be difficult to get ears on mccourt.
Hisaidehandles all phone activity.
Mccourt doesn't want the government eavesdropping on him?
Congressmen know better than anyone
That their employer could be listening.
We'll have to get close to him,
Narrow down the list of threats.
The capitol police detail won't let anyone near him.
Congressmen are eligible for secret service protection
In the event of additional risk.
No one's made an attempt on his life yet.
The congressman doesn't even know the danger he's in.
[rock music]
¶ ¶ [all screaming]
He knows now.
Drive, finch.
[engine starts] [tires screeching]
I have to tell you, mr.
Reese,
I don't approve of this strategy.
You're the one who said you couldn't make an alias
That would pass secret service muster.
(finch) I said I didn't have time.
I didn't know you were gonna steal the identity
Of an actual secret service agent.
(reese) I'm just borrowing it.
Relax.
Order some room service.
(finch) perhaps I will when you tell me what you've done
Withtherealagentabbott.
He's resting comfortably in a motel room near the airport.
Define "comfortably."
Gotta go, finch.
The rules committee is meeting in ten minutes,
You have your journal interview at 11:30,
And then lunch at ocean grill
With cynthia carol from privacy first
To discuss your anti-surveillance initiative.
Good morning, leslie.
Good morning, congressman.
Who's this?
This is agent abbott, secret service.
He'sbeenassignedtoyou.
Because of the shooting?
Oh, sorry, I was thinking more
About the business ahead of me today
Rather than behind.
Whereyoufrom,abbott?
[typing]
(finch) he's from tulsa, oklahoma.
Tulsa, sir.
Tulsa, oklahoma.
Good people, salt of the earth.
And for tonight, tickets to the verdi opera
Atthekennedycenter.
Do I have to go to this?
This sounds like screeching cats.
You promised your wife.
I could shoot you in the leg, sir.
Pardon me?
Might get you out of the opera.
[laughs]
You know, duran here, he always wanted to be secret service.
Isn't that right, duran?
At one time, sir.
Well, if you show abbott some love here,
Maybe he'll put in a good word for you.
Oh, and we can dispense with the stoplights today, okay?
[beeping] [engine starts] [sirens blaring]
Mccourt!
Dunphy.
You should've called first.
My office is slammed this morning.
Is this about the airline contract?
They're trying to stick it to us, mac.
Yeah.
And now I'm hearing you might be taking their side
Instead of the union's?
Dunphy, dunphy.
(finch) it must be bruce dunphy,
Part of the leadership of the illinois machinists union.
I know it's a lousy contract,
But I do think that you ought to sign it.
Unbelievable.
You backstabbing son of a--
Whoa, hold it, hold it.
You think you can pull this bait and switch with us,
With me, and get away with it?
Looks like mccourt might have crossed the wrong union, boss.
It's not a good deal, but it does keep the plant open.
[sighs]
And it puts you at the front of the line
For a bigger government contract
That's coming down the pike next year.
Another contract?
Yeah.
So you see, bruce, I am looking out for your guys.
But you do have to trust me.
(dunphy) I guess I jumped the gun a little bit.
Forget it.
Hey, is your wife in town with you?
Yeah.
Here.
Go as my guest.
It's classical stuff.
She'll love it.
Really?
Oh, thanks, mac.
It's my pleasure.
Tell your guys not to worry.
Remember, I'm your man.
Thanks.
Leslie, will you call my wife
And tell her unfortunately the opera was sold out?
It would appear our congressman has quite a knack
For getting himself out of unpleasant situations.
Yeah, that opera would've been brutal.
Hmm.
[clears throat]
I'm not accustomed to taking meetings
On such short notice,
But your reputation precedes you.
Don't worry, senator.
I come with only the best of intentions.
So what can I do for you?
Actually it's what I can do for you
And your northern lights problem.
If you're referring to the leaked black budget report,
Mine's just one of 100 names found in there.
I've already made it clear
I have no knowledge of that project.
Really?
I thought you knew a great deal about it,
Especially since the 2008 policy retreat
On martha's vineyard
When you were tapped to shepherd the program.
Surely you didn't think,
In a world where you were surveilling everyone,
That no one was watching you.
So...
What is it you want?
As I told you,
To help.
The group responsible
For leaking your black budget to the press
Calls themselves vigilance.
Privacy terrorists.
This is one of their leaders,
Known by his alias as peter collier.
Ironic.
You risked your career hiding a program
Designed to protect the country,
Yet it couldn't protect you from this group
When you needed it to.
And now you've had to shut it down...
Leaving your country unprotected.
A frightening prospect indeed.
The country will always be protected.
Yes, I'm sure you're weighing alternative approaches,
As your president might say.
I can save you the time.
My company, decima technologies,
Is finalizing development of a new surveillance system.
All due respect,
We've gone down a similar path with mixed results.
Northern lights was effective
But compromised by the ethics of its creator.
It spoke but never listened.
What I have not only listens but obeys.
Itcanfindanyone
Anywhere, anytime.
You merely need to ask.
As intriguing as that sounds,
There are some members of congress
Making too much hay out of this latest scandal
To ever green-light another program.
Hmm.
Share my proposal with your colleagues.
If there is interest...
Dissenting voices will not be a problem.
How can you be sure?
Because, senator,
Obstacles are only obstacles
Until you move them out of the way.
[indistinct chatter]
So how long you been with the congressman?
Long enough to know he doesn't need secret service protection.
What about the shooting?
Just some antigovernment wing nut
Looking to make the news cycle.
I suppose that's possible.
(finch) mr.
Reese?
That's my supervisor.
Guy's always in my ear.
What do you got, finch?
Nothing of note.
Mccourt's list of enemies is practically nonexistent.
Heranasurprisinglyclean campaign to get into office,
And his current stand against unchecked surveillance
Has endeared him to elements of both parties.
What about his personal life?
No red flags--finances are sound, carries no debt,
Andhasan impressive stock portfolio.
Help you with something, friend?
Let go of me.
I'm trying to be polite here.
It's all right, abbott, I've got this.
Have a seat.
Thank you, sir.
Local homeless guy.
I've seen him around.
Mccourt knows him?
(duran) no, but people like him know mccourt.
He's got a standing offer to buy a meal
For anyone who needs one.
It's a practice he started last year
Toraiseawareness for the homeless problem.
One more, congressman.
(finch) it also helps burnish his public image.
(mccourt) okay.
Get him some soup.
Finch, take this down.
(reese) echo five dash nine mike india six.
A license plate?
See if you can trace it.
Abbott, chop-chop!
(finch) what was that?
Forget it.
Starting to think I should've gone with root.
[salsa music]
Thanks for being my travel buddy on these errands.
Sure.
It's not every day you get to beat up a militia group
In anchorage, then hop a plane to miami.
So is this what you're
Doing from now on, you're chasing down bad guys?
I doubt it.
There's still too much work to be done.
What kind of work?
Preparation.
I understand.
We're leaving now.
Time to go.
Where to?
St. Louis.
Oh, great.
I know a steak joint that serves a filet that's better than sex.
Yummy as that sounds, you won't be joining me.
She needs you somewhere else.
W-where?
[sighs] [door closes]
You should go back to dealing coke, sonny.
It's a lot safer than moving explosives.
¶ ¶
You there, finch?
Always, mr.
Reese.
Sounds rather quiet there.
I think the only thing mccourt is in danger of
Is working too late.
I fear you may need to remain on his security detail
Longer than anticipated.
Shouldn't we check in on the real agent abbott?
Yeah, I guess someone should turn him over.
I beg your pardon?
[man groans] [clatter] [sighs] [man groaning]
What's going on?
Something's wrong, finch.
[cocks gun] [gasps] sorry.
(mccourt) what the hell, abbott?
You never heard of knocking?
I'm sorry.
I thought I heard a...
Never mind.
Should I call it in?
Finch, mccourt and his aide have been working
On more than just policy positions.
Might wanna consider his wife as a possible threat.
Actually, her emails show that she's been aware of his affairs
Forquitesometime.
Seems they have more of an arrangement than a marriage.
Mr. Reese, I found something.
(reese) what is it?
With fusco's aid,
I was able to trace the license plate
Fromthesuv outside the restaurant
Backto a rental car company.
It seems the vehicle was rented to a shell corporation
Setupby anothercompany...
Decima technologies.
Decima.
You were right, finch.
It's all connected.
Mccourt must be a threat to samaritan.
Which would explain why they're here.
[phone ringing] [phone beeps] duran.
(man) there's something you should know, officer.
He's not secret service.
What?
Who's this?
Here's the real agent abbott.
Don't do it.
Abbott, what are you doing?
Stay put.
Mr. Reese, what's happening?
Change of plans.
I've got mccourt.
Got him?
You've kidnapped a United States congressman?
Like you said, finch, these are strange times.
[tires screeching]
[mumbling]
Hello, harold.
Mr. Reese, I have to question the wisdom
Of abducting an elected official.
Well, decima blew my cover and started shooting.
The capitol police and secret service
Are scouring the city for you now,
Plus the fbi and about a dozen other three-letter agencies.
Let's see how they're doing.
(woman) traveling west on independence avenue.
Congressmanwasabductedin a black sport utility vehicle,
Illinoislicenseplate20...
Mm-hmm.
That's us.
Congressional tags.
So we need to dump the car and hole up somewhere.
Very well.
Turn left up here.
I know a place.
(reese) american beef consultants, finch?
We need a hiding place, not a burger.
Last month I bought the beef industry's lobbying arm.
And don't knock the hamburgers.
They're superb.
Doesn't look like much of a safe house.
That's the idea-- I cleared out this floor
And added a couple of cutting-edge amenities--
Fullystockedkitchen, bulletproof glass.
Okay, mac.
[grunts]
You gonna scream?
[grunts]
John.
Bedside manner.
Congressman, strange as it may seem,
We wish you no harm, we're here to help.
But we do need to ask you a few questions,
And we would prefer that you did not yell for assistance.
[sighs] who are you?
Security advisors...
Of a sort.
[scoffs] well, yeah, I can pay the ransom.
I can get however much money you need.
Someone's trying to kill you.
Yeah, you.
What?
No.
We're protection.
Protection?
You posed as, uh, secret service,
You knock out my security detail,
And then you abduct me at gunpoint.
Technically I also shot at you a couple days ago.
Somebody help me, please!
That's enough!
We don't have time for this.
Ifyouwannasurvive, you're gonna have to help us.
Now, about that hit squad that my colleague rescued you from...
Hit squad?
That wasn't a hit squad.
That was the fbi trying to save me from you.
I know it may have appeared that way,
But I assure you that was not the case.
What do you know about company called decima?
Never heard of it.
Why?
They sent the team that tried to kill you.
Do you know why they would consider you an enemy?
Me, an enemy?
[laughing] I'm not an enemy.
People love me.
I mean, I might piss a few people off along the way,
But I always get 'em whatever it is they need.
I'm a deal maker.
So what is it with you guys?
What do you want, money?
You want a personal telephone call from the president?
'cause I can get it.
Just please, come on.
Let me go.
Then, whatever you need, I'm your man.
[door closes] [indistinct chatter]
Finch, get down!
[gunshots]
[screams]
You guys all right?
(finch) yes, we're fine.
Why is everybody shooting at everybody?
I mean, if you're shooting at federal agents...
Feds don't walk in scattering lead.
Decima found us.
How?
Mccourt has no phone to follow.
It's a tracker.
Do you know who gave you this?
No idea.
It was given to me at a fund-raiser a week ago.
More operatives will be arriving soon.
We need to go.
We should leave the beltway.
We'll need a new car.
Or an old one-- easier to hotwire.
[tires screeching]
Take mccourt.
This guy again.
He's like a cockroach.
[sirens wail]
Sounds like our last escape route
Is about to disappear.
I'm more comfortable shooting this guy than the cops.
[bullet ricochets] [cocks gun]
[car approaching] [screams]
[tires screeching] [engine revs]
You guys going my way?
(man) congressman was abducted by a white male, 6'3",darkhair,insuit .
Beadvised,suspectisarmed and extremely dangerous.
Nice car, shaw.
So how'd you know we'd be there?
I didn't...
Until five minutes ago.
I got a call from root.
So you're the one we're saving?
Yeah.
Who are you?
Right now I'm the getaway driver.
[laughs] boy, this just gets worse.
(reese) cheer up, mac.
You could be in the trunk with the guy who wants to kill you.
[man grunts, banging in trunk]
We can't go back.
It's too dangerous.
I could try blasting through the roadblock.
(finch) the term "blasting"
Does not inspire great confidence, ms.
Shaw.
Time to get some fresh air.
I'll get the guy in the trunk.
Let'sgo.
[indistinct chatter]
Time to stretch your legs.
All clear.
Newspapers in the driveway, mail piled up.
Must be on vacation.
Let's hope they decide to stay another night.
What now?
Some answers.
Look, I don't know how many times I have to tell you.
I haven't done anything to make anybody wanna kill me.
Well, until we determine the reason
That decima keeps making attempts on your life,
You'll have to stay with us.
You have our decima friend's phone?
I pulled out the sim card.
If you really wanna protect me,
Why don't you just take me to the cops?
Law enforcement is no deterrent
To the people coming after you, congressman.
This is insane.
You've obviously done something to attract their attention.
Like what?
Decima is a private intelligence company
Developing a large-scale surveillance program--
The type of program that you've been vocally against.
Along with half the congress.
So?
But your position on the rules committee
Gives you the power to alter or halt legislation.
Have you sidelined anything that would affect decima's plans?
(mccourt) no.
I don't know anything about that company
Or why they would wanna kill me.
This is all just a huge mistake.
We're not getting anywhere here.
Maybe shaw's having some luck.
(shaw) you can talk or bleed out.
You help us, we'll help you.
Suit yourself, tough guy.
Hope it's worth dying for.
(finch) that may not be necessary.
I was able to get into his phone through a key vulnerability
In the sms encryption.
I think we may have misread this situation.
"protect"?
Seems we're not the only ones concerned
With the congressman's safety.
(reese) so who are you supposed to be protecting mccourt from?
[scoffs]
I wasn't given that information.
But in the week we've been watching him,
The only ones who have taken a shot at him are you.
[sighs]
You think maybe I could get a coffee?
Or some water would be fine.
Mr. Mccourt, you're sure you have no knowledge of decima?
I already answered that.
Why do you keep beating that drum?
Because they're protecting you.
Protecting me?
A minute ago you said they were trying to kill me.
I did.
Something doesn't add up.
Actually I think it might.
I looked into your finances earlier today, congressman.
You did what?
I noticed your stock portfolio,
Up 20% over last year.
What are you getting at?
Your trading activities.
Your portfolio is up 20% due to trades
You've made in the last two weeks.
Trades that have increased in value by over 600%.
So?
So...
Either you're the smartest investor in washington,
Or you're getting some very good information.
Inside information.
I don't like what you're implying.
It's more than an implication, congressman,
And it'll become a call to an s.E.C. Investigator I know
Unless you're more truthful with us.
Okay.
I know decima technologies.
But they're not trying to kill me.
We have an understanding.
What kind of an understanding?
They were looking for a little legislative support
For their new surveillance program.
Support?
You've been leading the charge against government surveillance.
CourseI have.
'cause I realized that the government
Can't keep a secret.
You look at, uh, prism and this northern lights mess.
What do you know about decima's program?
Not much really.
Justthatit 'san alternative to a government-run system.
Which, at this point, should make everybody happy.
And in return for your support,
You're getting insider stock tips.
You're a couple of smart guys, you know?
Surely you understand
That everything that happens in washington is a deal.
(reese) and you're a deal maker.
In case you didn't know,
The business of governments is business.
[sirens blaring]
They're moving grid to grid through the neighborhood.
We need to make a move.
Greer is positioning samaritan to replace the machine.
Mccourt is helping decima.
We've been looking at him as a victim,
But he's really a perpetrator.
I'm not so sure.
His involvement is tangential at best,
And he doesn't know greer's intentions.
But if he's not a victim or a perp,
Then why did the machine give us his number?
What is it we're supposed to be stopping?
I'm not sure we're supposed to be stopping anything.
Finch, you said mccourt could speed up or halt legislation.
Yes, he's in a unique position to remove
Any legislative roadblock to samaritan.
So without mccourt,
Samaritan doesn't get past congress.
And greer wouldn't get access to the nsa's surveillance feeds.
Then that's why we got his number.
He is the victim.
His life is in danger.
But from who?
Us.
I think the machine wants us to kill mccourt.
John, think about what you're saying.
I have.
Just because decima is not
The threat to mccourt doesn't mean that we must be.
The machine is designed to save lives, not take them.
But could it?
Could the machine ever tell us to kill someone?
Is it possible?
It's conceivable.
Well, how bad would the situation have to be?
Bad.
It would have to see that an individual's actions
Could directly result in the loss of others' lives.
How many lives?
A dozen, a hundred?
How many?
A lot.
I'm not sure.
I never dreamt it would come to this.
Well, it has.
Your machine-- it sees something coming--
Something bad-- and it wants us to stop it.
I don't know.
You don't know that.
Look, I've never entirely trusted your machine,
But you built it, and I trust you.
You're the one who said we can't underestimate
The threat of samaritan.
Mr. Mccourt,
You have to call off your deal with decima.
Their surveillance program cannot be approved.
What--what are you, one of those privacy nut jobs?
Is that what this is about?
With access to the government's surveillance feeds,
Decima will be able to acquire any information,
Any secret it desires,
And sell it to the highest bidder.
And that would be the United States government.
Perhaps, for now.
But unbridled access will create
Unlimited opportunities for abuse.
People will be ruined, lives will be lost.
The results will be nothing short of catastrophic.
These programs are always gonna be controversial
But also inevitable.
People get up in arms whenever they go public,
But eventually the noise dies down,
Because the simple truth is that people wanna be protected.
They just don't wanna know how.
Oh, maybe I haven't offered you the right incentive.
So how much?
Excuse me?
To withdraw your support for decima's program, how much?
Hey, you know, I did this to keep the country safe.
And yeah, maybe I got a little something for myself
During the process.
All that makes me is good at what I do.
I'm not calling off the deal.
Looks like we've got company-- s.W.A.T., feds, the works.
Mr. Reese, it was never my intention
For people to be killed because of the machine.
What do you think happened when it gave the government
A terrorist number?
What do you think we used to do for a living?
That man is not a terrorist.
He's just an opportunistic and corrupt pawn.
That doesn't make the threat any less real.
We are not assassins.
We protect people.
Isn't that what we're doing,
Sacrificing the life of one to save the lives of many?
Shaw, help me out here.
Six months ago, I would've already put a bullet
In that guy's head.
But ever since hanging around you guys,
I've kind of gotten used to saving people.
But we've only been able to do that by trusting the machine.
And if it's saying that this guy's gotta go,
Well, I think we should still trust it.
John, I urge you to consider the consequences of this action.
There are consequences to not acting.
Like with simmons and joss.
Don't do this.
If we let him walk out that door, decima wins.
Samaritan will go live.
It's a possibility but not a certainty.
There may be another way.
We've never been here.
But are you really willing to take that risk?
Harold?
Since we started this, things have changed.
We've changed.
But the mission, our purpose, has always been constant--
To save lives.
If that's changed somehow, if we're in a place now
Where the machine is asking us to commit murder...
That's a place I can't go.
I'm afraid this is where I get off.
John.

¶ ¶
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system...
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
The leaked black budget report reveals several classified military intelligence programs, with code names like Chalk Eagle and Tractor Rose.
A program designated Northern Lights has...
Northern Lights has a budget far outstripping any other program.
Classified as "operation support for counterterrorism activities,"
the details are scarce.
Some have speculated that it may be related to the surveillance of American citizens.
If so, what does that mean for our privacy?
Media got a hold of the program name, which means your old boss control just lost it.
Bitch tried to kill me.
Nice to see her head on the chopping block for change.
Anyone connected to the machine will be burying evidence 6 feet down.
Could put the program in jeopardy.
Government can't put the machine back in the box.
We're still getting our numbers, so the lights are on.
Let's go.
Morning.
You guys have the pancakes?
Try the banana chocolate chip... amazing.
What?
No small talk?
All right, fine by me.
You have the product?
What's it look like?
You got the money?
1 million.
We have a deal?
You got it, man.
That fast, huh?
Couldn't even wait to get back to the hotel to count it?
See, Ray, your partner's already picked out a house in Hawaii.
So as soon as you turn your back, he's gonna put two in your head and keep all the money for himself.
But guess what, Julio.
Ray here put a down payment on a yacht, told your girl he'd show her the world.
500,000 buys a lot.
But a million?
Both of you would take out your partner for that.
Oh, you little son of a...
Sorry, guys.
Deal's off.
Sweet dreams, boys.
Fusco can clean this up.
20 years in lockup ought to keep 'em from killing each other.
See?
Business as usual.
Even if the government's program's on ice, the machine is still spitting out numbers.
You know Finch.
Even without Northern Lights, his machine will find a way to maintain national security.
Really?
Well, then who's handling the relevant threats?
Root.
Hey, kids.
- You miss me between drug deals?
- Yeah.
I miss you like I miss an intestinal parasite.
I love your similes.
Hop on, Shaw.
We've got a relevant number in Alaska.
We're gonna steal a jet.
Does sound kind of fun.
Send me a postcard.
Turn that frown upside down, lurch.
You're going on vacation too.
Harold's about to call from D.C. he needs your help.
Mr. Reese, I'm afraid our services are required in the nation's capital.
I heard.
On my way.
Finch?
This'll work.
Oh, good, you're here.
Sorry, got tied up at the library.
I'm happy to see that you've come prepared for a long haul.
Dare I hope that you've packed something other than weaponry?
There's some trip wire to booby-trap the room door.
And a toothbrush.
Oral hygiene is something, I suppose.
You got a number here in D.C.?
It would seem so.
My investigation into vigilance's activities will have to wait.
Well, Root is getting the relevant numbers now.
Shaw is with her.
We're entering uncharted territory, tasked with both relevant and irrelevant numbers.
Already stretched pretty thin, Finch.
And at the worst possible time.
Just when Decima is determined to make Samaritan operational.
Maybe the timing's not a coincidence.
I fear that it may be connected.
These are strange times, and the threat of Samaritan should not be underestimated.
How do you know it's not already up and running?
Because we'd be dead, Mr. Reese.
The machine is a shield.
It protects lives.
I designed it with safeguards to prevent it being abused as an agent of destruction.
Samaritan is an open system, a sword.
If it gains access to the government's feeds, there will be no checks on its power.
There will be no limits to the knowledge possessed by the person controlling it.
Decima would definitely use it to hunt down its enemies.
And as confidants of the machine, you and I would be at the top of the list.
So maybe the machine is trying to protect us.
No, I built it to protect everyone, one number at a time.
Oh, my.
What?
That's Roger McCourt.
Our new number is a United States congressman?
From Illinois.
Six terms in Congress.
Current ranking minority member of the pivotal house rules committee.
The rules committee controls the flow of legislation...
Spurring it forward or stopping it altogether.
If he has that much power, he'll have plenty of enemies.
Given their activities in Washington recently, vigilance would have to be a suspect.
However, McCourt's been an outspoken opponent of government surveillance.
Could Decima want him dead?
Perhaps.
But killing a congressman would seem too flashy for them.
Nobody likes the government these days.
Any disgruntled citizen could be the assassin.
We have to get to the Capitol.
You call this music?
Finch?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Can we put the screeching cat out of its misery?
It's not feline.
It's Verdi.
There's a performance of Il Trovatore at the Kennedy Center that I'd like to catch.
Next time you can be the disc jockey.
We'll listen to whatever you like.
Well, maybe next time I'll just sing for you.
I do a great ring cycle, you know.
I think I'll skip your Brunnhilde.
Suit yourself.
Looks like our congressman is in danger of catching lobbyist disease.
It's gonna be difficult to get ears on McCourt.
His aide handles all phone activity.
McCourt doesn't want the government eavesdropping on him?
Congressmen know better than anyone that their employer could be listening.
We'll have to get close to him, narrow down the list of threats.
The capitol police detail won't let anyone near him.
Congressmen are eligible for secret service protection in the event of additional risk.
No one's made an attempt on his life yet.
The congressman doesn't even know the danger he's in.
He knows now.
Drive, Finch.
I have to tell you, Mr. Reese,
I don't approve of this strategy.
You're the one who said you couldn't make an alias that would pass secret service muster.
I said I didn't have time.
I didn't know you were gonna steal the identity of an actual secret service agent.
I'm just borrowing it.
Relax.
Order some room service.
Perhaps I will when you tell me what you've done with the real Agent Abbott.
He's resting comfortably in a motel room near the airport.
Define "comfortably."
Gotta go, Finch.
The rules committee is meeting in ten minutes, you have your journal interview at 11:30, and then lunch at Ocean Grill with Cynthia Carol from Privacy First to discuss your anti-surveillance initiative.
- Good morning, Leslie.
- Good morning, Congressman.
Who's this?
This is Agent Abbott, secret service.
He's been assigned to you.
Because of the shooting?
Oh, sorry, I was thinking more about the business ahead of me today rather than behind.
Where you from, Abbott?
He's from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Tulsa, sir.
Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Good people, salt of the earth.
And for tonight, tickets to the Verdi opera at the Kennedy Center.
Do I have to go to this?
This sounds like screeching cats.
You promised your wife.
I could shoot you in the leg, sir.
Pardon me?
Might get you out of the opera.
You know, Duran here, he always wanted to be secret service.
Isn't that right, Duran?
At one time, sir.
Well, if you show Abbott some love here, maybe he'll put in a good word for you.
Oh, and we can dispense with the stoplights today, okay?
- McCourt!
- Dunphy.
You should've called first.
My office is slammed this morning.
Is this about the airline contract?
- They're trying to stick it to us, Mac.
- Yeah.
And now I'm hearing you might be taking their side instead of the union's?
Dunphy, Dunphy.
It must be Bruce Dunphy, part of the leadership of the Illinois Machinists Union.
I know it's a lousy contract, but
I do think that you ought to sign it.
Unbelievable.
You backstabbing son of a...
Whoa, hold it, hold it.
You think you can pull this bait and switch with us, with me, and get away with it?
Looks like McCourt might have crossed the wrong union, boss.
It's not a good deal, but it does keep the plant open.
And it puts you at the front of the line for a bigger government contract that's coming down the pike next year.
- Another contract?
- Yeah.
So you see, Bruce, I am looking out for your guys.
But you do have to trust me.
I guess I jumped the gun a little bit.
Forget it.
Hey, is your wife in town with you?
- Yeah.
- Here.
Go as my guest.
It's classical stuff.
She'll love it.
Really?
Oh, thanks, Mac.
It's my pleasure.
Tell your guys not to worry.
Remember, I'm your man.
Thanks.
Leslie, will you call my wife and tell her unfortunately the opera was sold out?
It would appear our congressman has quite a knack for getting himself out of unpleasant situations.
Yeah, that opera would've been brutal.
Hmm.
I'm not accustomed to taking meetings on such short notice, but your reputation precedes you.
Don't worry, Senator.
I come with only the best of intentions.
So what can I do for you?
Actually it's what I can do for you and your Northern Lights problem.
If you're referring to the leaked black budget report, mine's just one of 100 names found in there.
I've already made it clear
I have no knowledge of that project.
Really?
I thought you knew a great deal about it, especially since the 2008 policy retreat on Martha's vineyard when you were tapped to shepherd the program.
Surely you didn't think, in a world where you were surveilling everyone, that no one was watching you.
So...
What is it you want?
As I told you, to help.
The group responsible for leaking your black budget to the press calls themselves Vigilance.
Privacy terrorists.
This is one of their leaders, known by his alias as Peter Collier.
Ironic.
You risked your career hiding a program designed to protect the country, yet it couldn't protect you from this group when you needed it to.
And now you've had to shut it down...
Leaving your country unprotected.
A frightening prospect indeed.
The country will always be protected.
Yes, I'm sure you're weighing alternative approaches, as your president might say.
I can save you the time.
My company, Decima Technologies, is finalizing development of a new surveillance system.
All due respect, we've gone down a similar path with mixed results.
Northern lights was effective but compromised by the ethics of its creator.
It spoke but never listened.
What I have not only listens, but obeys.
It can find anyone anywhere, anytime.
You merely need to ask.
As intriguing as that sounds, there are some members of Congress making too much hay out of this latest scandal to ever green-light another program.
Hmm.
Share my proposal with your colleagues.
If there is interest...
Dissenting voices will not be a problem.
How can you be sure?
Because, Senator, obstacles are only obstacles until you move them out of the way.
So how long you been with the congressman?
Long enough to know he doesn't need secret service protection.
What about the shooting?
Just some antigovernment wing nut looking to make the news cycle.
I suppose that's possible.
Mr. Reese?
That's my supervisor.
Guy's always in my ear.
What do you got, Finch?
Nothing of note.
McCourt's list of enemies is practically nonexistent.
He ran a surprisingly clean campaign to get into office, and his current stand against unchecked surveillance has endeared him to elements of both parties.
What about his personal life?
No red flags... finances are sound, carries no debt, and has an impressive stock portfolio.
Help you with something, friend?
Let go of me.
I'm trying to be polite here.
It's all right, Abbott, I've got this.
Have a seat.
Thank you, sir.
Local homeless guy.
I've seen him around.
McCourt knows him?
No, but people like him know McCourt.
He's got a standing offer to buy a meal for anyone who needs one.
It's a practice he started last year to raise awareness for the homeless problem.
One more, Congressman.
It also helps burnish his public image.
Okay.
Get him some soup.
Finch, take this down.
Echo Five Dash Nine Mike India Six.
A license plate?
See if you can trace it.
Abbott, chop chop!
What was that?
Forget it.
Starting to think I should've gone with Root.
Thanks for being my travel buddy on these errands.
Sure.
It's not every day you get to beat up a militia group in Anchorage, then hop a plane to Miami.
So is this what you're doing from now on, you're chasing down bad guys?
I doubt it.
There's still too much work to be done.
What kind of work?
Preparation.
I understand.
We're leaving now.
- Time to go.
- Where to?
- St. Louis.
- Oh, great.
I know a steak joint that serves a filet that's better than sex.
Yummy as that sounds, you won't be joining me.
She needs you somewhere else.
W-where?
You should go back to dealing coke, Sonny.
It's a lot safer than moving explosives.
You there, Finch?
Always, Mr. Reese.
Sounds rather quiet there.
I think the only thing McCourt is in danger of is working too late.
I fear you may need to remain on his security detail longer than anticipated.
Shouldn't we check in on the real Agent Abbott?
Yeah, I guess someone should turn him over.
I beg your pardon?
What's going on?
Something's wrong, Finch.
Sorry.
What the hell, Abbott?
You never heard of knocking?
I'm sorry.
I thought I heard a...
Never mind.
Should I call it in?
Finch, McCourt and his aide have been working on more than just policy positions.
Might wanna consider his wife as a possible threat.
Actually, her emails show that she's been aware of his affairs for quite some time.
Seems they have more of an arrangement than a marriage.
Mr. Reese, I found something.
What is it?
With Fusco's aid,
I was able to trace the license plate from the SUV outside the restaurant back to a rental car company.
It seems the vehicle was rented to a shell corporation set up by another company...
Decima Technologies.
Decima.
You were right, Finch.
It's all connected.
McCourt must be a threat to Samaritan.
Which would explain why they're here.
Duran.
There's something you should know, Officer.
He's not secret service.
What?
Who's this?
Here's the real Agent Abbott.
Don't do it.
- Abbott, what are you doing?
- Stay put.
Mr. Reese, what's happening?
Change of plans.
I've got McCourt.
Got him?
You've kidnapped a United States congressman?
Like you said, Finch, these are strange times.
Hello, Harold.
Mr. Reese, I have to question the wisdom of abducting an elected official.
Well, Decima blew my cover and started shooting.
The capitol police and secret service are scouring the city for you now, plus the FBI and about a dozen other three-letter agencies.
Let's see how they're doing.
Traveling west on Independence Avenue.
Congressman was abducted in a black sport utility vehicle,
- Illinois license plate 20...
- Mm-hmm.
- That's us.
- Congressional tags.
So we need to dump the car and hole up somewhere.
Very well.
Turn left up here.
I know a place.
American beef consultants, Finch?
We need a hiding place, not a burger.
Last month I bought the beef industry's lobbying arm.
And don't knock the hamburgers.
They're superb.
Doesn't look like much of a safe house.
That's the idea...
I cleared out this floor and added a couple of cutting-edge amenities...
Fully stocked kitchen, bulletproof glass.
Okay, Mac.
You gonna scream?
John.
Bedside manner.
Congressman, strange as it may seem, we wish you no harm, we're here to help.
But we do need to ask you a few questions, and we would prefer that you did not yell for assistance.
Who are you?
Security advisors...
Of a sort.
Well, yeah, I can pay the ransom.
I can get however much money you need.
Someone's trying to kill you.
Yeah, you.
What?
No.
We're protection.
Protection?
You posed as, uh, secret service, you knock out my security detail, and then you abduct me at gunpoint.
Technically I also shot at you a couple days ago.
Somebody help me, please!
That's enough!
We don't have time for this.
If you wanna survive, you're gonna have to help us.
Now, about that hit squad that my colleague rescued you from...
Hit squad?
That wasn't a hit squad.
That was the FBI trying to save me from you.
I know it may have appeared that way, but I assure you that was not the case.
What do you know about company called Decima?
Never heard of it.
Why?
They sent the team that tried to kill you.
Do you know why they would consider you an enemy?
Me, an enemy?
I'm not an enemy.
People love me.
I mean, I might piss a few people off along the way, but I always get 'em whatever it is they need.
I'm a deal maker.
So what is it with you guys?
What do you want, money?
You want a personal telephone call from the president?
'Cause I can get it.
Just please, come on.
Let me go.
Then, whatever you need, I'm your man.
Finch, get down!
- You guys all right?
- Yes, we're fine.
Why is everybody shooting at everybody?
I mean, if you're shooting at federal agents...
Feds don't walk in scattering lead.
- Decima found us.
- How?
McCourt has no phone to follow.
It's a tracker.
Do you know who gave you this?
No idea.
It was given to me at a fund-raiser a week ago.
More operatives will be arriving soon.
We need to go.
We should leave the beltway.
We'll need a new car.
Or an old one...
Easier to hotwire.
Take McCourt.
This guy again.
He's like a cockroach.
Sounds like our last escape route is about to disappear.
I'm more comfortable shooting this guy than the cops.
You guys going my way?
Congressman was abducted by a white male, 6'3", dark hair, in suit.
Be advised, suspect is armed and extremely dangerous.
Nice car, Shaw.
So how'd you know we'd be there?
I didn't...
Until five minutes ago.
I got a call from Root.
So you're the one we're saving?
Yeah.
Who are you?
Right now I'm the getaway driver.
Boy, this just gets worse.
Cheer up, Mac.
You could be in the trunk with the guy who wants to kill you.
We can't go back.
It's too dangerous.
I could try blasting through the roadblock.
The term "blasting"
does not inspire great confidence, Ms. Shaw.
Time to get some fresh air.
I'll get the guy in the trunk.
Let's go.
Time to stretch your legs.
All clear.
Newspapers in the driveway, mail piled up.
Must be on vacation.
Let's hope they decide to stay another night.
What now?
Some answers.
Look, I don't know how many times I have to tell you.
I haven't done anything to make anybody wanna kill me.
Well, until we determine the reason that Decima keeps making attempts on your life, you'll have to stay with us.
You have our Decima friend's phone?
I pulled out the SIM card.
If you really wanna protect me, why don't you just take me to the cops?
Law enforcement is no deterrent to the people coming after you, congressman.
This is insane.
You've obviously done something to attract their attention.
Like what?
Decima is a private intelligence company developing a large-scale surveillance program...
The type of program that you've been vocally against.
Along with half the Congress.
So?
But your position on the rules committee gives you the power to alter or halt legislation.
Have you sidelined anything that would affect Decima's plans?
No.
I don't know anything about that company or why they would wanna kill me.
This is all just a huge mistake.
We're not getting anywhere here.
Maybe Shaw's having some luck.
You can talk or bleed out.
You help us, we'll help you.
Suit yourself, tough guy.
Hope it's worth dying for.
That may not be necessary.
I was able to get into his phone through a key vulnerability in the SMS encryption.
I think we may have misread this situation.
"Protect"?
Seems we're not the only ones concerned with the congressman's safety.
So who are you supposed to be protecting McCourt from?
I wasn't given that information.
But in the week we've been watching him, the only ones who have taken a shot at him are you.
You think maybe I could get a coffee?
Or some water would be fine.
Mr. McCourt, you're sure you have no knowledge of Decima?
I already answered that.
Why do you keep beating that drum?
Because they're protecting you.
Protecting me?
A minute ago you said they were trying to kill me.
I did.
Something doesn't add up.
Actually I think it might.
I looked into your finances earlier today, Congressman.
You did what?
I noticed your stock portfolio, up 20% over last year.
What are you getting at?
Your trading activities.
Your portfolio is up 20% due to trades you've made in the last two weeks.
Trades that have increased in value by over 600%.
- So?
- So...
Either you're the smartest investor in Washington, or you're getting some very good information.
Inside information.
I don't like what you're implying.
It's more than an implication, Congressman, and it'll become a call to an S.E.C. investigator I know unless you're more truthful with us.
Okay.
I know Decima Technologies.
But they're not trying to kill me.
We have an understanding.
What kind of an understanding?
They were looking for a little legislative support for their new surveillance program.
Support?
You've been leading the charge against government surveillance.
Course I have.
'Cause I realized that the government can't keep a secret.
You look at, uh, Prism and this Northern Lights mess.
What do you know about Decima's program?
Not much really.
Just that it's an alternative to a government-run system.
Which, at this point, should make everybody happy.
And in return for your support, you're getting insider stock tips.
You're a couple of smart guys, you know?
Surely you understand that everything that happens in Washington is a deal.
And you're a deal maker.
In case you didn't know, the business of governments is business.
They're moving grid to grid through the neighborhood.
We need to make a move.
Greer is positioning Samaritan to replace the machine.
McCourt is helping Decima.
We've been looking at him as a victim,
- but he's really a perpetrator.
- I'm not so sure.
His involvement is tangential at best, and he doesn't know Greer's intentions.
But if he's not a victim or a perp, then why did the machine give us his number?
What is it we're supposed to be stopping?
I'm not sure we're supposed to be stopping anything.
Finch, you said McCourt could speed up or halt legislation.
Yes, he's in a unique position to remove any legislative roadblock to Samaritan.
So without McCourt,
Samaritan doesn't get past Congress.
And Greer wouldn't get access to the NSA's surveillance feeds.
Then that's why we got his number.
He is the victim.
His life is in danger.
But from who?
Us.
I think the machine wants us to kill McCourt.
John, think about what you're saying.
I have.
Just because Decima is not the threat to McCourt doesn't mean that we must be.
The machine is designed to save lives, not take them.
But could it?
Could the machine ever tell us to kill someone?
Is it possible?
It's conceivable.
Well, how bad would the situation have to be?
Bad.
It would have to see that an individual's actions could directly result in the loss of others' lives.
How many lives?
A dozen, a hundred?
How many?
A lot.
I'm not sure.
I never dreamt it would come to this.
Well, it has.
Your machine...
It sees something coming...
Something bad...
And it wants us to stop it.
I don't know.
You don't know that.
Look, I've never entirely trusted your machine, but you built it, and I trust you.
You're the one who said we can't underestimate the threat of Samaritan.
Mr. McCourt, you have to call off your deal with Decima.
Their surveillance program cannot be approved.
What... what are you, one of those privacy nut jobs?
Is that what this is about?
With access to the government's surveillance feeds,
Decima will be able to acquire any information, any secret it desires, and sell it to the highest bidder.
And that would be the United States government.
Perhaps, for now.
But unbridled access will create unlimited opportunities for abuse.
People will be ruined, lives will be lost.
The results will be nothing short of catastrophic.
These programs are always gonna be controversial but also inevitable.
People get up in arms whenever they go public, but eventually the noise dies down, because the simple truth is that people wanna be protected.
They just don't wanna know how.
Oh, maybe I haven't offered you the right incentive.
So how much?
Excuse me?
To withdraw your support for Decima's program, how much?
Hey, you know, I did this to keep the country safe.
And yeah, maybe I got a little something for myself during the process.
All that makes me is good at what I do.
I'm not calling off the deal.
Looks like we've got company...
S.W.A.T., feds, the works.
Mr. Reese, it was never my intention for people to be killed because of the machine.
What do you think happened when it gave the government a terrorist number?
What do you think we used to do for a living?
That man is not a terrorist.
He's just an opportunistic and corrupt pawn.
That doesn't make the threat any less real.
We are not assassins.
We protect people.
Isn't that what we're doing, sacrificing the life of one to save the lives of many?
Shaw, help me out here.
Six months ago, I would've already put a bullet in that guy's head.
But ever since hanging around you guys,
I've kind of gotten used to saving people.
But we've only been able to do that by trusting the machine.
And if it's saying that this guy's gotta go, well, I think we should still trust it.
John, I urge you to consider the consequences of this action.
There are consequences to not acting.
Like with Simmons and Joss.
Don't do this.
If we let him walk out that door, Decima wins.
Samaritan will go live.
It's a possibility but not a certainty.
There may be another way.
We've never been here.
But are you really willing to take that risk?
Harold?
Since we started this, things have changed.
We've changed.
But the mission, our purpose, has always been constant...
To save lives.
If that's changed somehow, if we're in a place now where the machine is asking us to commit murder...
That's a place I can't go.
I'm afraid this is where I get off.
John.
You've had an opportunity to consider my proposal.
Will you help us?
My colleagues and I would like to, but unfortunately now is not the time.
Perhaps a demonstration of my system's capabilities will convince you that your country cannot afford to wait.
Test in a limited area, say...
New York City.
24 hours, quick, clean.
Then we shut it down.
No guns, no police, just information.
What kind of information?
If the NSA provides us with New York City's surveillance feeds, we will find you a terrorist.
You could find me a thousand terrorists, but like I said, we'll never get this through Congress.
And as I told you, dissenting voices would not be a problem.
It's time to remove those obstacles.
Answer your phone, Senator.
How you doing, Garrison?
This is Roger McCourt.
I understand you'll be preparing some legislation.
Is that right?
If you can handle the senate,
I can ensure that the house rules facilitate a quiet passage.
You can do all that?
Absolutely, Senator.
Okay.
Let's...
Do it.
Excellent.
Now if there's anything else you need, just ask.
I'm your man.
Virgil, are we operational?
You're just in time for the ribbon cutting.
Feeds are coming online now.
Commencing beta test.
Okay, we have 24 hours.
Splendid.
Find me Harold Finch.
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything-- violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator,
If your number's up, we'll find you.
The leaked black budget report reveals several classified military intelligence programs, with code names like Chalk Eagle and tractor rose.
A program designated Northern Lights has...
Northern Lights has a budget far outstripping any other program.
Classified as "Operation support for counterterrorism activities,"
The details are scarce.
Some have speculated that it may be related to the surveillance of American citizens.
If so, what does that mean for our privacy?
Media got a hold of the program name, which means your old boss Control just lost it.
Bitch tried to kill me.
Nice to see her head on the chopping block for change.
Anyone connected to the machine will be burying evidence 6 feet down.
Could put the program in jeopardy.
Government can't put the machine back in the box.
We're still getting our numbers,
So the lights are on.
Let's go.
Morning.
You guys have the pancakes?
Try the banana chocolate chip--amazing.
What?
No small talk?
All right, fine by me.
You have the product?
What's it look like?
You got the money?
1 million.
We have a deal?
You got it, man.
That fast, huh?
Couldn't even wait to get back to the hotel to count it?
See, Ray, your partner's already picked out a house in Hawaii.
So as soon as you turn your back, he's gonna put two in your head and keep all the money for himself.
But guess what, Julio.
Ray here put a down payment on a yacht, told your girl he'd show her the world.
500,000 buys a lot.
But a million?
Both of you would take out your partner for that.
You little son of a...
Sorry, guys.
Deal's off.
Sweet dreams, boys.
Fusco can clean this up.
20 years in lockup ought to keep 'em from killing each other.
See?
Business as usual.
Even if the government's program's on ice, the machine is still spitting out numbers.
You know Finch.
Even without Northern Lights, his machine will find a way to maintain national security.
Really?
Then who's handling the relevant threats?
Root.
Hey, kids.
You miss me between drug deals?
Yeah.
I miss you like I miss an intestinal parasite.
I love your similes.
Hop on, Shaw.
We've got a relevant number in Alaska.
We're gonna steal a jet.
Does sound kind of fun.
Send me a postcard.
Turn that frown upside down, Lurch.
You're going on vacation too.
Harold's about to call from D.C.
He needs your help.
Mr. Reese, I'm afraid our services are required in the nation's capital.
I heard.
On my way.
Finch?
This'll work.
Oh, good, you're here.
Sorry, got tied up at the library.
I'm happy to see that you've come prepared for a long haul.
Dare I hope that you've packed something other than weaponry?
There's some trip wire to booby-trap the room door.
And a toothbrush.
Oral hygiene is something, I suppose.
You got a number here in D.C.?
It would seem so.
My investigation into vigilance's activities will have to wait.
Root is getting the relevant numbers now.
Shaw is with her.
We're entering uncharted territory, tasked with both relevant and irrelevant numbers.
Already stretched pretty thin, Finch.
And at the worst possible time.
Just when Decima is determined to make Samaritan operational.
Maybe the timing's not a coincidence.
I fear that it may be connected.
These are strange times, and the threat of Samaritan should not be underestimated.
How do you know it's not already up and running?
Because we'd be dead, Mr. Reese.
The machine is a Shield.
It protects lives.
I designed it with safeguards to prevent it being abused as an agent of destruction.
Samaritan is an open system, a sword.
If it gains access to the government's feeds, there will be no checks on its power.
There will be no limits to the knowledge possessed by the person controlling it.
Decima would definitely use it to hunt down its enemies.
And as confidants of the machine, you and I would be at the top of the list.
So maybe the machine is trying to protect us.
No, I built it to protect everyone,
One number at a time.
Oh, my.
What?
That's Roger McCourt.
Our new number is a United States Congressman?
From Illinois.
Six terms in Congress.
Current ranking minority member of the pivotal House Rules Committee.
The Rules Committee controls the flow of legislation-- spurring it forward or stopping it altogether.
If he has that much power, he'll have plenty of enemies.
Given their activities in Washington recently,
Vigilance would have to be a suspect.
However, McCourt's been an outspoken opponent of government surveillance.
Could Decima want him dead?
Perhaps.
But killing a congressman would seem too flashy for them.
Nobody likes the government these days.
Any disgruntled citizen could be the assassin.
We have to get to the capitol.
You call this music?
Finch?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Can we put the screeching cat out of its misery?
It's not Feline.
It's Verdi.
There's a performance of il trovatore at the Kennedy Center that I'd like to catch.
Next time you can be the disc jockey.
We'll listen to whatever you like.
Maybe next time I'll just sing for you.
I do a great Ring Cycle, you know.
I think I'll skip your Brunnhilde.
Suit yourself.
Looks like our congressman is in danger of catching lobbyist disease.
It's gonna be difficult to get ears on McCourt.
His aide handles all phone activity.
McCourt doesn't want the government eavesdropping on him?
Congressmen know better than anyone that their employer could be listening.
We'll have to get close to him, narrow down the list of threats.
The Capitol Police detail won't let anyone near him.
Congressmen are eligible for Secret Service protection in the event of additional risk.
No one's made an attempt on his life yet.
The congressman doesn't even know the danger he's in.
He knows now.
Drive, Finch.
I have to tell you, Mr. Reese,
I don't approve of this strategy.
You're the one who said you couldn't make an alias that would pass Secret Service muster.
I said I didn't have time.
I didn't know you were gonna steal the identity of an actual Secret Service agent.
I'm just borrowing it.
Relax.
Order some room service.
Perhaps I will when you tell me what you've done with the real Agent Abbott.
He's resting comfortably in a motel room near the airport.
Define "comfortably."
Gotta go, Finch.
The Rules Committee is meeting in ten minutes, you have your journal interview at 11:30, and then lunch at ocean grill with Cynthia Carol from Privacy First to discuss your anti-surveillance initiative.
- Good morning, Leslie.
- Good morning, congressman.
Who's this?
This is agent Abbott, Secret Service.
He's been assigned to you.
Because of the shooting?
Oh, sorry, I was thinking more about the business ahead of me today rather than behind.
Where you from, Abbott?
He's from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Tulsa, sir.
Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Good people, salt of the earth.
And for tonight, tickets to the Verdi opera at the Kennedy Center.
Do I have to go to this?
This sounds like screeching cats.
You promised your wife.
I could shoot you in the leg, sir.
Pardon me?
Might get you out of the opera.
You know, Duran here, he always wanted to be secret service.
Isn't that right, Duran?
At one time, sir.
If you show Abbott some love here,
Maybe he'll put in a good word for you.
And we can dispense with the stoplights today, okay?
- McCourt!
- Dunphy.
You should've called first.
My office is slammed this morning.
Is this about the airline contract?
They're trying to stick it to us, Mac.
And now I'm hearing you might be taking their side instead of the Union's?
Dunphy, Dunphy.
It must be Bruce Dunphy,
Part of the leadership of the Illinois Machinists Union.
I know it's a lousy contract, but I do think that you ought to sign it.
Unbelievable.
You backstabbing son of a--
Whoa, hold it, hold it.
You think you can pull this bait and switch with us, with me, and get away with it?
Looks like McCourt might have crossed the wrong Union boss.
It's not a good deal, but it does keep the plant open.
And it puts you at the front of the line for a bigger government contract that's coming down the pike next year.
- Another contract?
- Yeah.
So you see, Bruce, I am looking out for your guys.
But you do have to trust me.
I guess I jumped the gun a little bit.
Forget it.
Is your wife in town with you?
- Yeah.
- Here.
Go as my guest.
It's classical stuff.
She'll love it.
Really?
Oh, thanks, Mac.
It's my pleasure.
Tell your guys not to worry.
Remember, I'm your man.
Thanks.
Leslie, will you call my wife and tell her unfortunately the opera was sold out?
It would appear our congressman has quite a knack for getting himself out of unpleasant situations.
Yeah, that opera would've been brutal.
I'm not accustomed to taking meetings on such short notice, but your reputation precedes you.
Don't worry, Senator.
I come with only the best of intentions.
So what can I do for you?
Actually it's what I can do for you and your Northern Lights problem.
If you're referring to the leaked black budget report, mine's just one of 100 names found in there.
I've already made it clear I have no knowledge of that project.
Really?
I thought you knew a great deal about it, especially since the 2008 policy retreat on Martha's Vineyard when you were tapped to shepherd the program.
Surely you didn't think, in a world where you were surveilling everyone, that no one was watching you.
So... what is it you want?
As I told you, to help.
The group responsible for leaking your black budget to the press calls themselves Vigilance.
Privacy terrorists.
This is one of their leaders, known by his alias as Peter Collier.
Ironic.
You risked your career hiding a program designed to protect the country, yet it couldn't protect you from this group when you needed it to.
And now you've had to shut it down... leaving your country unprotected.
A frightening prospect indeed.
The country will always be protected.
Yes, I'm sure you're weighing alternative approaches, as your president might say.
I can save you the time.
My company, Decima Technologies, is finalizing development of a new surveillance system.
All due respect, we've gone down a similar path with mixed results.
Northern Lights was effective but compromised by the ethics of its creator.
It spoke but never listened.
What I have not only listens but obeys.
It can find anyone anywhere, anytime.
You merely need to ask.
As intriguing as that sounds, there are some members of congress making too much hay out of this latest scandal to ever green-light another program.
Share my proposal with your colleagues.
If there is interest... dissenting voices will not be a problem.
How can you be sure?
Because, Senator, obstacles are only obstacles until you move them out of the way.
So how long you been with the congressman?
Long enough to know he doesn't need Secret Service protection.
What about the shooting?
Just some antigovernment wing nut looking to make the news cycle.
I suppose that's possible.
Mr. Reese?
That's my supervisor.
Guy's always in my ear.
What do you got, Finch?
Nothing of note.
McCourt's list of enemies is practically nonexistent.
He ran a surprisingly clean campaign to get into office, and his current stand against unchecked surveillance has endeared him to elements of both parties.
What about his personal life?
No red flags--finances are sound, carries no debt, and has an impressive stock portfolio.
Help you with something, friend?
Let go of me.
I'm trying to be polite here.
It's all right, Abbott, I've got this.
Have a seat.
Thank you, sir.
Local homeless guy.
I've seen him around.
McCourt knows him?
No, but people like him know McCourt.
He's got a standing offer to buy a meal for anyone who needs one.
It's a practice he started last year to raise awareness for the homeless problem.
One more, Congressman.
It also helps burnish his public image.
Okay.
Get him some soup.
Finch, take this down.
E5-9MI6 Echo five dash nine mike india six.
A license plate?
See if you can trace it.
Abbott, chop-chop!
What was that?
Forget it.
Starting to think I should've gone with Root.
Thanks for being my travel buddy on these errands.
Sure.
It's not every day you get to beat up a militia group in anchorage, then hop a plane to Miami.
So is this what you're doing from now on, you're chasing down bad guys?
I doubt it.
There's still too much work to be done.
What kind of work?
Preparation.
I understand.
We're leaving now.
- Time to go.
- Where to?
- St. Louis.
- Oh, great.
I know a steak joint that serves a filet that's better than sex.
Yummy as that sounds, you won't be joining me.
She needs you somewhere else.
W-where?
You should go back to dealing coke, Sonny.
It's a lot safer than moving explosives.
- You there, Finch?
- Always, Mr. Reese.
Sounds rather quiet there.
I think the only thing McCourt is in danger of is working too late.
I fear you may need to remain on his security detail longer than anticipated.
Shouldn't we check in on the real Agent Abbott?
Yeah, I guess someone should turn him over.
I beg your pardon?
What's going on?
Something's wrong, Finch.
Sorry.
What the hell, Abbott?
You never heard of knocking?
I'm sorry.
I thought I heard a...
Never mind.
Should I call it in?
Finch, McCourt and his aide have been working on more than just policy positions.
Might wanna consider his wife as a possible threat.
Actually, her emails show that she's been aware of his affairs for quite some time.
Seems they have more of an arrangement than a marriage.
Mr. Reese, I found something.
What is it?
With Fusco's aid,
I was able to trace the license plate from the SUV outside the restaurant back to a rental car company.
It seems the vehicle was rented to a shell corporation set up by another company...
Decima Technologies.
Decima.
You were right, Finch.
It's all connected.
McCourt must be a threat to Samaritan.
Which would explain why they're here.
Duran.
There's something you should know, Officer.
He's not Secret Service.
What?
Who's this?
Here's the real Agent Abbott.
Don't do it.
- Abbott, what are you doing?
- Stay put.
Mr. Reese, what's happening?
Change of plans.
I've got McCourt.
Got him?
You've kidnapped a United States congressman?
Like you said, Finch, these are strange times.
Hello, Harold.
Mr. Reese, I have to question the wisdom of abducting an elected official.
Decima blew my cover and started shooting.
The Capitol Police and Secret Service are scouring the city for you now, plus the FBI and about a dozen other three-letter agencies.
Let's see how they're doing.
Traveling west on Independence Avenue.
Congressman was abducted in a black sport utility vehicle,
Illinois license plate ...
That's us.
So we need to dump the car and hole up somewhere.
Very well.
Turn left up here.
I know a place.
American Beef Consultants, Finch?
We need a hiding place, not a burger.
Last month I bought the beef industry's lobbying arm.
And don't knock the hamburgers.
They're superb.
Doesn't look like much of a safe house.
That's the idea-
- I cleared out this floor and added a couple of cutting-edge amenities--
Fully stocked kitchen, bulletproof glass.
Okay, Mac.
You gonna scream?
John.
Bedside manner.
Congressman, strange as it may seem, we wish you no harm, we're here to help.
But we do need to ask you a few questions, and we would prefer that you did not yell for assistance.
Who are you?
Security advisors... of a sort.
Yeah, I can pay the ransom.
I can get however much money you need.
Someone's trying to kill you.
Yeah, you.
What?
No.
We're protection.
Protection?
You posed as, uh, Secret Service, you knock out my security detail, and then you abduct me at gunpoint.
Technically I also shot at you a couple days ago.
Somebody help me, please!
That's enough!
We don't have time for this.
If you wanna survive, you're gonna have to help us.
Now, about that hit squad that my colleague rescued you from...
Hit squad?
That wasn't a hit squad.
That was the FBI trying to save me from you.
I know it may have appeared that way,
But I assure you that was not the case.
What do you know about company called Decima?
Never heard of it.
Why?
They sent the team that tried to kill you.
Do you know why they would consider you an enemy?
Me, an enemy?
I'm not an enemy.
People love me.
I mean, I might piss a few people off along the way, but I always get 'em whatever it is they need.
I'm a deal maker.
So what is it with you guys?
What do you want, money?
You want a personal telephone call from the President?
'cause I can get it.
Just please, come on.
Let me go.
Then, whatever you need, I'm your man.
Finch, get down!
- You guys all right?
- Yes, we're fine.
Why is everybody shooting at everybody?
I mean, if you're shooting at Federal Agents...
Feds don't walk in scattering lead.
Decima found us.
How?
McCourt has no phone to follow.
It's a tracker.
Do you know who gave you this?
No idea.
It was given to me at a fund-raiser a week ago.
More operatives will be arriving soon.
We need to go.
We should leave the beltway.
We'll need a new car.
Or an old one-- easier to hotwire.
Take McCourt.
This guy again.
He's like a cockroach.
Sounds like our last escape route is about to disappear.
I'm more comfortable shooting this guy than the cops.
You guys going my way?
Congressman was abducted by a white male, 6'3", dark hair, in suit.
Be advised, suspect is armed and extremely dangerous.
Nice car, Shaw.
So how'd you know we'd be there?
I didn't until five minutes ago.
I got a call from Root.
So you're the one we're saving?
Yeah.
Who are you?
Right now I'm the getaway driver.
Boy, this just gets worse.
Cheer up, Mac.
You could be in the trunk with the guy who wants to kill you.
We can't go back.
It's too dangerous.
I could try blasting through the roadblock.
The term "Blasting"
does not inspire great confidence, Ms. Shaw.
Time to get some fresh air.
I'll get the guy in the trunk.
Let's go.
Time to stretch your legs.
All clear.
Newspapers in the driveway, mail piled up.
Must be on vacation.
Let's hope they decide to stay another night.
What now?
Some answers.
Look, I don't know how many times I have to tell you.
I haven't done anything to make anybody wanna kill me.
Until we determine the reason that Decima keeps making attempts on your life, you'll have to stay with us.
You have our Decima friend's phone?
I pulled out the sim card.
If you really wanna protect me, why don't you just take me to the cops?
Law enforcement is no deterrent to the people coming after you, Congressman.
This is insane.
You've obviously done something to attract their attention.
Like what?
Decima is a private intelligence company
Developing a large-scale surveillance program--
The type of program that you've been vocally against.
Along with half the congress.
So?
But your position on the Rules Committee gives you the power to alter or halt legislation.
Have you sidelined anything that would affect Decima's plans?
No.
I don't know anything about that company or why they would wanna kill me.
This is all mistake, just a huge mistake.
We're not getting anywhere here.
Maybe Shaw's having some luck.
You can talk or bleed out.
You help us, we'll help you.
Suit yourself, tough guy.
Hope it's worth dying for.
That may not be necessary.
I was able to get into his phone through a key vulnerability in the sms encryption.
I think we may have misread this situation.
"Protect"?
Seems we're not the only ones concerned with the Congressman's safety.
So who are you supposed to be protecting McCourt from?
I wasn't given that information.
But in the week we've been watching him, the only ones who have taken a shot at him are you.
You think maybe I could get a coffee?
Or some water would be fine.
Mr. McCourt, you're sure you have no knowledge of Decima?
I already answered that.
Why do you keep beating that drum?
Because they're protecting you.
Protecting me?
A minute ago you said they were trying to kill me.
I did.
Something doesn't add up.
Actually I think it might.
I looked into your finances earlier today, Congressman.
You did what?
I noticed your stock portfolio, up 20% over last year.
What are you getting at?
Your trading activities.
Your portfolio is up 20% due to trades you've made in the last two weeks.
Trades that have increased in value by over 600%.
So?
So... either you're the smartest investor in Washington, or you're getting some very good information.
Inside information.
I don't like what you're implying.
It's more than an implication, Congressman,
And it'll become a call to an S.E.C. investigator I know unless you're more truthful with us.
Okay.
I know Decima Technologies.
But they're not trying to kill me.
We have an understanding.
What kind of an understanding?
They were looking for a little legislative support for their new surveillance program.
Support?
You've been leading the charge against government surveillance.
Course I have.
'cause I realized that the government can't keep a secret.
You look at, uh, Prism and this Northern Lights mess.
What do you know about Decima's program?
Not much really.
Just that it's an alternative to a government-run system.
Which, at this point, should make everybody happy.
And in return for your support,
You're getting insider stock tips.
You're a couple of smart guys, you know?
Surely you understand that everything that happens in Washington is a deal.
And you're a deal maker.
In case you didn't know, the business of governments is business.
They're moving grid to grid through the neighborhood.
We need to make a move.
Greer is positioning Samaritan to replace the machine.
McCourt is helping Decima.
We've been looking at him as a victim, but he's really a perpetrator.
I'm not so sure.
His involvement is tangential at best, and he doesn't know Greer's intentions.
But if he's not a victim or a perp,
Then why did the machine give us his number?
What is it we're supposed to be stopping?
I'm not sure we're supposed to be stopping anything.
Finch, you said McCourt could speed up or halt legislation.
Yes, he's in a unique position to remove any legislative roadblock to Samaritan.
So without McCourt,
Samaritan doesn't get past Congress.
And Greer wouldn't get access to the NSAs surveillance feeds.
Then that's why we got his number.
He is the victim.
His life is in danger.
But from who?
Us.
I think the machine wants us to kill McCourt.
John, think about what you're saying.
I have.
Just because Decima is not the threat to McCourt doesn't mean that we must be.
The machine is designed to save lives, not take them.
But could it?
Could the machine ever tell us to kill someone?
Is it possible?
It's conceivable.
How bad would the situation have to be?
Bad.
It would have to see that an individual's actions could directly result in the loss of others' lives.
How many lives?
A dozen, a hundred?
How many?
A lot.
I'm not sure.
I never dreamt it would come to this.
It has.
Your machine-- it sees something coming--
Something bad-- and it wants us to stop it.
I don't know.
You don't know that.
Look, I've never entirely trusted your machine, but you built it, and I trust you.
You're the one who said we can't underestimate the threat of Samaritan.
Mr. McCourt,
You have to call off your deal with Decima.
Their surveillance program cannot be approved.
What--what are you, one of those privacy nut jobs?
Is that what this is about?
With access to the government's surveillance feeds,
Decima will be able to acquire any information, any secret it desires, and sell it to the highest bidder.
And that would be the United States government.
Perhaps, for now.
But unbridled access will create unlimited opportunities for abuse.
People will be ruined, lives will be lost.
The results will be nothing short of catastrophic.
These programs are always gonna be controversial but also inevitable.
People get up in arms whenever they go public, but eventually the noise dies down, because the simple truth is that people wanna be protected.
They just don't wanna know how.
Maybe I haven't offered you the right incentive.
So how much?
Excuse me?
To withdraw your support for Decima's program, how much?
You know, I did this to keep the country safe.
And yeah, maybe I got a little something for myself during the process.
All that makes me is good at what I do.
I'm not calling off the deal.
Looks like we've got company-- S.W.A.T., Feds, the works.
Mr. Reese, it was never my intention for people to be killed because of the machine.
What do you think happened when it gave the government a terrorist number?
What do you think we used to do for a living?
That man is not a terrorist.
He's just an opportunistic and corrupt pawn.
That doesn't make the threat any less real.
We are not assassins.
We protect people.
Isn't that what we're doing, sacrificing the life of one to save the lives of many?
Shaw, help me out here.
Six months ago, I would've already put a bullet in that guy's head.
But ever since hanging around you guys,
I've kind of gotten used to saving people.
But we've only been able to do that by trusting the machine.
And if it's saying that this guy's gotta go, well, I think we should still trust it.
John, I urge you to consider the consequences of this action.
There are consequences to not acting.
Like with Simmons and Joss.
Don't do this.
If we let him walk out that door, Decima wins.
Samaritan will go live.
It's a possibility but not a certainty.
There may be another way.
We've never been here.
But are you really willing to take that risk?
Harold?
Since we started this, things have changed.
We've changed.
But the mission, our purpose, has always been constant-- to save lives.
If that's changed somehow, if we're in a place now where the machine is asking us to commit murder...
That's a place I can't go.
I'm afraid this is where I get off.
John.
Pick it up, pick it all up
And start again
You've got a second chance You could go home
Escape it all
It's just irrelevant
You've got a warm heart
You've got a beautiful brain
But it's disintegrating
It's just medicine
It's just medicine
You could still be what you want to
What you said you were when I met you
You've had an opportunity to consider my proposal.
Will you help us?
My colleagues and I would like to, but unfortunately now is not the time.
Perhaps a demonstration of my system's capabilities will convince you that your country cannot afford to wait.
Test in a limited area, say...
New York City.
24 hours, quick, clean.
Then we shut it down.
No guns, no police, just information.
What kind of information?
If the NSA provides us with New York City's surveillance feeds, we will find you a terrorist.
You could find me a thousand terrorists, but like I said, we'll never get this through congress.
And as I told you, dissenting voices would not be a problem.
What you said you were when I met you
You could still be what you want to
What you said you were
When I met you
When you met me
When I met you
It's time to remove those obstacles.
Answer your phone, Senator.
How you doing, Garrison?
This is Roger McCourt.
I understand you'll be preparing some legislation.
Is that right?
If you can handle the senate,
I can ensure that the House rules facilitate a quiet passage.
You can do all that?
Absolutely, Senator.
Okay.
Let's...
Do it.
Excellent.
Now if there's anything else you need, just ask.
I'm your man.
From all the medicine
Medicine
You could still be what you want to be
What you said you were when you met me
You could still be what you want to
Virgil, are we operational?
You're just in time for the ribbon cutting.
Feeds are coming online now.
Commencing beta test.
When I met you
Okay, we have 24 hours.
Splendid.
Find me Harold Finch.
FINCH:
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system, a machine that spies on you, every hour of every day.
Ripped By mstoll
I designed the Machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
The leaked black budget report reveals several classified military intelligence programs, with code names like Chalk Eagle and Tractor Rose.
A program designated Northern Lights has...
Northern Lights has a budget far outstripping any other program.
Classified as "operation support for counterterrorism activities,"
the details are scarce.
Some have speculated that it may be related to the surveillance of American citizens.
If so, what does that mean for our privacy?
Media got a hold of the program name, which means your old boss Control just lost it.
Bitch tried to kill me.
Nice to see her head on the chopping block for change.
Anyone connected to the Machine will be burying evidence six feet down.
Could put the program in jeopardy.
Government can't put the Machine back in the box.
We're still getting our numbers, so the lights are on.
Let's go.
Morning.
You guys have the pancakes?
Try the banana chocolate chip...
amazing.
What?
No small talk?
All right, fine by me.
You have the product?
What's it look like?
You got the money?
One million.
We have a deal?
You got it, man.
That fast, huh?
Couldn't even wait to get back to the hotel to count it?
See, Ray, your partner's already picked out a house in Hawaii.
So as soon as you turn your back, he's gonna put two in your head
- and keep all the money for himself.
- But guess what, Julio.
Ray here put a down payment on a yacht, told your girl he'd show her the world.
Five-hundred thousand buys a lot.
But a million?
Both of you would take out your partner for that.
- Oh, you little son of a...
- Sorry, guys.
Deals off.
(GRUNTING, GROANING)
Sweet dreams, boys.
Fusco can clean this up.
Twenty years in lockup ought to keep 'em from killing each other.
See?
Business as usual.
Even if the government's program's on ice, the Machine is still spitting out numbers.
You know Finch, even without Northern Lights, his machine will find a way to maintain national security.
Really?
Well, then who's handling the relevant threats?
- Root.
- Hey, kids.
- You miss me between drug deals?
- Yeah
I miss you like I miss an intestinal parasite.
I love your similes.
Hop on, Shaw.
We've got a relevant number in Alaska.
We're gonna steal a jet.
Does sound kind of fun.
Send me a postcard.
Turn that frown upside down, Lurch.
You're going on vacation too.
Harold's about to call from DC.
He needs your help.
(MOTORCYCLE ENGINE REVS)
FINCH:
Mr. Reese, I'm afraid our services are required in the nation's capital.
I heard.
On my way.
(ELECTRONIC CHATTER)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Finch?
This'll work.
(DOOR OPENS)
Oh, good, you're here.
Sorry, got tied up at the library.
I'm happy to see that you've come prepared for a long haul.
Dare I hope that you've packed something other than weaponry?
There's some trip wire to booby-trap the room door.
And a toothbrush.
Oral hygiene is something, I suppose.
You got a number here in DC.?
It would seem so.
My investigation into Vigilance's activities will have to wait.
Well, Root is getting the relevant numbers now.
Shaw is with her.
We're entering uncharted territory, tasked with both relevant and irrelevant numbers.
Already stretched pretty thin, Finch.
And at the worst possible time.
Just when Decima is determined to make Samaritan operational.
Maybe the timing's not a coincidence.
I fear that it may be connected.
These are strange times, and the threat of Samaritan should not be underestimated.
How do you know it's not already up and running?
Because we'd be dead, Mr. Reese.
The Machine is a shield.
It protects lives.
I designed it with safeguards to prevent it being abused as an agent of destruction.
Samaritan is an open system, a sword.
If it gains access to the government's feeds, there will be no checks on its power.
There will be no limits to the knowledge possessed by the person controlling it.
Decima would definitely use it to hunt down its enemies.
And as confidants of the Machine, you and I would be at the top of the list.
REESE:
So maybe the Machine is trying to protect us.
No, I built it to protect everyone, one number at a time.
- Oh, my.
- What?
That's Roger McCourt.
Our new number is a United States congressman?
From Illinois.
Six terms in Congress.
Current ranking minority member of the Pivotal House Rules Committee.
The rules committee controls the flow of legislation, spurring it forward or stopping it altogether.
If he has that much power, he'll have plenty of enemies.
Given their activities in Washington recently,
Vigilance would have to be a suspect.
However, McCourt's been an outspoken opponent of government surveillance.
Could Decima want him dead?
Perhaps.
But killing a congressman would seem too flashy for them.
Nobody likes the government these days.
Any disgruntled citizen could be the assassin.
We have to get to the Capitol.

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
You call this music?
Finch?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Can we put the screeching cat out of its misery?
It's not feline.
It's Verdi.
There's a performance of ll Trovatore at the Kennedy Center that I'd like to catch.
Next time you can be the disc jockey.
We'll listen to whatever you like.
Well, maybe next time I'll just sing for you.
I do a great Ring cycle, you know.
I think I'll skip your Brunhilde.
Suit yourself.
REESE:
Looks like our congressman is in danger of catching lobbyist disease.
It's gonna be difficult to get ears on McCourt.
His aide handles all phone activity.
McCourt doesn't want the government eavesdropping on him?
Congressmen know better than anyone that their employer could be listening.
We'll have to get close to him, narrow down the list of threats.
The Capitol police detail won't let anyone near him.
Congressmen are eligible for Secret Service protection in the event of additional risk.
No one's made an attempt on his life yet.
The congressman doesn't even know the danger he's in.
Get down!
(SCREAMING)
He knows now.
Drive, Finch.
(ENGINE STARTS)
(ELECTRONIC CHATTER)
I have to tell you, Mr. Reese, I don't approve of this strategy.
You're the one who said you couldn't make an alias that would pass Secret Service muster.
I said I didn't have time, I didn't know you were gonna steal the identity of an actual Secret Service agent.
REESE:
I'm just borrowing it.
Relax.
Order some room service.
FINCH:
Perhaps I will when you tell me what you've done with the real Agent Abbott.
He's resting comfortably in a motel room near the airport.
Define "comfortably."
Gotta go, Finch.
The rules committee is meeting in ten minutes.
You have your Journal interview at 11:30.
Then lunch at Ocean Grill with Cynthia Carol from Privacy First to discuss your anti-surveillance initiative.
- Good morning, Leslie.
- Good morning, Congressman.
Who's this?
This is Agent Abbott, Secret Service.
He's been assigned to you.
Because of the shooting?
- Oh, sorry.
I was thinking more about the business ahead of me today rather than behind.
Where you from, Abbott?
He's from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Tulsa, sir.
Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Good people, salt of the earth.
And for tonight, tickets to the Verdi opera at the Kennedy Center.
Do I have to go to this?
This sounds like screeching cats.
- You promised your wife.
- I could shoot you in the leg, sir.
Pardon me?
Might get you out of the opera.
You know, Duran here, he always wanted to be Secret Service.
Isn't that right, Duran?
At one time, sir.
Well, if you show Abbott some love here, maybe he'll put in a good word for you.
Oh, and we can dispense with the stoplights today, okay?
(SHORT BEEPS)
(ENGINE STARTS, SIREN CHIRPS)
McCourt!
Dunphy.
You should've called first.
My office is slammed this morning.
Is this about the airline contract?
- They're trying to stick it to us, Mac.
- Yeah.
Now I'm hearing you might be taking their side instead of the union's?
Dunphy, Dunphy.
It must be Bruce Dunphy, part of the leadership of the Illinois Machinists Union.
I know it's a lousy contract, but I do think that you ought to sign it.
Unbelievable.
You backstabbing son of a...
- Whoa, hold it, hold it.
- Think you can pull this bait and switch with us, we me, and get away with it?
Looks like McCourt might have crossed the wrong union boss.
It's not a good deal, but it does keep the plant open.
And it puts you at the front of the line for a bigger government contract that's coming down the pipe next year.
- Another contract?
- Yeah.
So you see, Bruce, I am looking out for your guys.
But you do have to trust me.
I guess I jumped the gun a little bit.
Forget it.
- Hey, is your wife in town with you?
- Yeah.
Here.
Go as my guest.
It's classical stuff.
She'll love it.
Really?
Oh, thanks, Mac.
It's my pleasure.
Tell your guys not to worry.
Remember, I'm your man.
Thanks.
Leslie, call my wife and tell her unfortunately the opera was sold out.
It would appear our congressman has quite a knack for getting himself out of unpleasant situations.
Yeah, that opera would've been brutal.
Hmm.
(ELECTRONIC CHATTER)
(CLEARS THROAT)
I'm not accustomed to taking meetings on such short notice, but your reputation precedes you.
Don't worry, Senator.
I come with only the best of intentions.
So what can I do for you?
Actually it's what I can do for you and your Northern Lights problem.
If you're referring to the leaked black-budget report, mine's just one of 100 names found in there.
I've already made it clear I have no knowledge of that project.
Really?
I thought you knew a great deal about it, especially since the 2008 policy retreat on Martha's vineyard when you were tapped to shepherd the program.
Surely you didn't think, in a world where you were surveilling everyone, that no one was watching you.
So, what is it you want?
As I told you, to help.
The group responsible for leaking your black budget to the press calls themselves Vigilance.
Privacy terrorists.
This is one of their leaders, known by his alias as Peter Collier.
Ironic.
You risked your career hiding a program designed to protect the country, yet it couldn't protect you from this group when you needed it to.
And now you've had to shut it down, leaving your country unprotected.
A frightening prospect indeed.
SENATOR:
The country will always be protected.
Yes, I'm sure you're weighing alternative approaches, as your president might say.
I can save you the time.
My company, Decima Technologies, is finalizing development of a new surveillance system.
All due respect, we've gone down a similar path with mixed results.
Northern Lights was effective but compromised by the ethics of its creator.
It spoke but never listened.
What I have not only listens, but obeys.
It can find anyone, anywhere, anytime.
You merely need to ask.
As intriguing as that sounds, there are some members of Congress making too much hay out of this latest scandal to ever green-light another program.
Heh.
Share my proposal with your colleagues.
If there is interest, dissenting voices will not be a problem.
How can you be sure?
Because, Senator, obstacles are only obstacles until you move them out of the way.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
So how long you been with the congressman?
Long enough to know he doesn't need Secret Service protection.
- What about the shooting?
- Just some antigovernment wing nut
- looking to make the news cycle.
- I suppose that's possible.
FINCH:
Mr. Reese?
That's my supervisor.
Guy's always in my ear.
- What do you got, Finch?
- Nothing of note.
McCourt's list of enemies is practically nonexistent.
He ran a surprisingly clean campaign to get into office, and his current stand against unchecked surveillance has endeared him to elements of both parties.
- What about his personal life?
- No red flags.
Finances are sound, carries no debt, and has an impressive stock portfolio.
And that's the point I'm making now...
- Help you with something, friend?
- Let go of me.
I'm trying to be polite here.
It's all right, Abbott, I've got this.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.
Local homeless guy.
I've seen him around.
McCourt knows him?
No, but people like him know McCourt.
He's got a standing offer to buy a meal for anyone who needs one.
It's a practice he started last year to raise awareness for the homeless problem.
- One more, Congressman.
- Also helps burnish his public image.
Okay.
Get him some soup.
Finch, take this down.
Echo-Five-Dash-Nine-Mike-India-Six.
A license plate?
See if you can trace it.
Abbott, chop chop!
FINCH:
What was that?
Forget it.
Starting to think I should've gone with Root.
(ELECTRONIC CHATTER)
Thanks for being my travel buddy on these errands.
Sure, it's not every day you get to beat up a militia group in Anchorage, then hop a plane to Miami.
So is this what you're doing from now on, you're chasing down bad guys?
I doubt it.
There's still too much work to be done.
What kind of work?
Preparation.
I understand.
We're leaving now.
- Time to go.
- Where to?
- St. Louis.
- Oh, great.
I know a steak joint that serves a filet that's better than sex.
Yummy as that sounds, you won't be joining me.
She needs you somewhere else.
Where?
You should go back to dealing coke, Sonny.
It's a lot safer than moving explosives.
(ELECTRONIC STATIC)
You there, Finch?
Always, Mr. Reese.
Sounds rather quiet there.
I think the only thing McCourt is in danger of is working too late.
I fear you may need to remain on his security detail longer than anticipated.
Shouldn't we check in on the real Agent Abbott?
Yeah, I guess someone should turn him over.
I beg your pardon?
(CRASH, YELL)
(MUTTERING THROUGH DOOR)
- What's going on?
- Something's wrong, Finch.
- Sorry.
- What the hell, Abbott?
You never heard of knocking?
I'm sorry.
I thought I heard a...
Never mind.
Should I call it in?
(ELECTRONIC CHATTER)
Finch, McCourt and his aide have been working on more than just policy positions.
Might wanna consider his wife as a possible threat.
Actually, her e-mails show that she's been aware of his affairs for quite some time.
Seems they have more of an arrangement than a marriage.
Mr. Reese, I found something.
REESE:
What is it?
With Fusco's aid, I was able to trace the license plate from the SUV outside the restaurant back to a rental car company.
It seems the vehicle was rented to a shell corporation set up by another company.
Decima Technologies.
Decima.
You were right, Finch.
It's all connected.
McCourt must be a threat to Samaritan.
(DOOR OPENS)
Which would explain why they're here.

Hello, Harold.
Mr. Reese, I have to question the wisdom of abducting an elected official.
Well, Decima blew my cover and started shooting.
The Capitol police and Secret Service are scouring the city for you now, plus the FBI and about a dozen other three-letter agencies.
Let's see how they're doing.
WOMAN: ...traveling west on Independence Avenue.
Congressman was abducted in a black sport utility vehicle,
- Illinois license plate 20...
- That's us.
So we need to dump the car and hole up somewhere.
Very well.
Turn left up here.
I know a place.
(ELECTRONIC CHATTER)
REESE:
American Beef Consultants, Finch?
We need a hiding place, not a burger.
Last month I bought the beef industry's lobbying arm.
And don't knock the hamburgers.
They're superb.
Doesn't look like much of a safe house.
That's the idea.
I cleared out this floor, and added a couple of cutting-edge amenities:
fully stocked kitchen, bulletproof glass.
Okay, Mac, you gonna scream?
Mmm.
John, bedside manner.
Congressman, strange as it may seem, we wish you no harm, we're here to help.
But we do need to ask you a few questions, and we would prefer that you did not yell for assistance.
Who are you?
Security advisors... of a sort.
Well, yeah, I can pay the ransom.
I can get however much money you need.
- Someone's trying to kill you.
- Yeah, you.
- What?
No.
We're protection.
Protection?
You posed as, uh, Secret Service, you knock out my security detail, and then you abduct me at gunpoint.
Technically I also shot at you a couple days ago.
Somebody help me, please!
That's enough!
We don't have time for this.
If you wanna survive, you have to help us.
Now, about that hit squad that my colleague rescued you from.
Hit squad?
That wasn't a hit squad.
That was the FBI trying to save me from you.
I know it may have appeared that way, but I assure you that was not the case.
What do you know about a company called Decima?
Never heard of it.
Why?
They sent the team that tried to kill you.
Do you know why they would consider you an enemy?
Me, an enemy?
(CHUCKLING) I'm not an enemy.
People love me.
I mean, I might piss a few people off along the way, but I always get 'em whatever it is they need.
I'm a deal maker.
So what is it with you guys?
What do you want, money?
You want a personal telephone call from the president?
'Cause I can get it.
Just please, come on.
Let me go.
Then, whatever you need, I'm your man.

- You guys all right?
- Yes, we're fine.
Why is everybody shooting at everybody?
If you're shooting at federal agents...
Feds don't walk in scattering lead.
- Decima found us.
- How?
McCourt has no phone to follow.
It's a tracker.
Do you know who gave you this?
No idea.
It was given to me at a fundraiser a week ago.
More operatives will be arriving soon.
We need to go.
We should leave the beltway.
We'll need a new car.
Or an old one, easier to hotwire.
(TIRES SCREECH)

I got a call from Root.

Right now I'm the getaway driver.

I could try blasting through the roadblock.

All clear.

Must be on vacation.
Let's hope they decide to stay another night.
What now?
Some answers.
Look, I don't know how many times I have to tell you,
I haven't done anything to make anybody wanna kill me.
Well, until we determine the reason that Decima keeps making attempts on your life, you'll have to stay with us.
- You have our Decima friend's phone?
- I pulled out the SIM card.
If you really wanna protect me, why don't you just take me to the cops?
Law enforcement is no deterrent to the people coming after you, Congressman.
This is insane.
You've obviously done something to attract their attention.
Like what?
Decima is a private intelligence company developing a large-scale surveillance program.
The type of program that you've been vocally against.
Along with half the Congress.
So?
But your position on the rules committee gives you the power to alter or halt legislation.
Have you sidelined anything that would affect Decima's plans?
No.
I don't know anything about that company or why they would wanna kill me.
This is all just a huge mistake.
We're not getting anywhere here.
Maybe Shaw's having some luck.
You can talk or bleed out.
You help us, we'll help you.
Suit yourself, tough guy.
Hope it's worth dying for.
That may not be necessary.
I was able to get into his phone through a key vulnerability in the SMS encryption.
I think we may have misread this situation.
Protect?
Seems we're not the only ones concerned with the congressman's safety.
So who are you supposed to be protecting McCourt from?
(SCOFFS)
I wasn't given that information.
But in the week we've been watching him, the only ones who have taken a shot at him are you.
Ah.
You think maybe I could get a coffee?
Or some water would be fine.
Mr. McCourt, you're sure you have no knowledge of Decima?
I already answered that.
- Why do you keep beating that drum?
Because they're protecting you.
Protecting me?
A minute ago you said they were trying to kill me.
I did.
Something doesn't add up.
Actually I think it might.
I looked into your finances earlier today, Congressman.
You did what?
I noticed your stock portfolio, up 20 percent over last year.
What are you getting at?
Your trading activities.
Your portfolio is up 20 percent due to trades you've made in the last two weeks.
Trades that have increased in value by over 600 percent.
- So?
- So... either you're the smartest investor in Washington, or you're getting some very good information.
Inside information.
I don't like what you're implying.
It's more than an implication, Congressman, and it'll become a call to an SEC investigator I know unless you're more truthful with us.
Okay-
I know Decima Technologies.
But they're not trying to kill me.
We have an understanding.
What kind of an understanding?
They were looking for a little legislative support for their new surveillance program.
Support?
You've been leading the charge against government surveillance.
Course I have. 'Cause I realized that the government can't keep a secret.
You look at Prism and this Northern Lights mess.
What do you know about Decima's program?
Not much really.
Just that it's an alternative to a government-run system, which, at this point, should make everybody happy.
And in return for your support, you're getting insider stock tips.
You're a couple of smart guys, you know?
Surely you understand that everything that happens in Washington is a deal.
And you're a dealmaker.
In case you didn't know, the business of governance...
is business.
(POLICE SIREN IN DISTANCE)
They're moving grid-to-grid through the neighborhood.
We need to make a move.
Greer is positioning Samaritan to replace the Machine.
McCourt is helping Decima.
We've been looking at him as a victim, but he's really a perpetrator.
I'm not so sure.
His involvement is tangential at best, and he doesn't know Greens intentions.
If he's not a victim or a perp, then why did the Machine give us his number?
What is it we're supposed to be stopping?
I'm not sure we're supposed to be stopping anything.
Finch, you said McCourt could speed up or halt legislation.
Yes, he's in a unique position to remove any legislative roadblock to Samaritan.
So without McCourt, Samaritan doesn't get past Congress.
And Greer wouldn't get access to the NSA's surveillance feeds.
Then that's why we got his number.
He is the victim.
His life is in danger.
But from who?
Us.
I think the Machine wants us to kill McCourt.
(ELECTRONIC CHATTER)
- John, think about what you're saying.
- I have.
Just because Decima is not the threat to McCourt doesn't mean that we must be.
The Machine is designed to save lives, not take them.
But could it?
Could the Machine ever tell us to kill someone?
Is it possible?
It's conceivable.
Well, how bad would the situation have to be?
Bad.
It would have to see that an individual's actions could directly result in the loss of others' lives.
How many lives?
A dozen, a hundred?
How many?
A lot.
I'm not sure.
I never dreamt it would come to this.
Well, it has.
Your machine, it sees something coming,
Something bad, and it wants us to stop it.
I don't know.
You don't know that.
Look, I've never entirely trusted your machine, but you built it, and I trust you.
You're the one who said we can't underestimate the threat of Samaritan.
Mr. McCourt... you have to call off your deal with Decima.
Their surveillance program cannot be approved.
What are you, one of those privacy nut jobs?
Is that what this is about?
With access to the government's surveillance feeds,
Decima will be able to acquire any information, any secret it desires, and sell it to the highest bidder.
And that would be the United States government.
Perhaps, for now.
But unbridled access will create unlimited opportunities for abuse.
People will be ruined, lives will be lost.
The results will be nothing short of catastrophic.
These programs are always gonna be controversial but also inevitable.
People get up in arms whenever they go public, but eventually the noise dies down, because the simple truth is that people wanna be protected.
They just don't wanna know how.
Oh, maybe I haven't offered you the right incentive.
So how much?
Excuse me?
To withdraw your support for Decima's program, how much?
Hey, you know, I did this to keep the country safe.
And, yeah, maybe I got a little something for myself during the process.
All that makes me is good at what I do.
I'm not calling off the deal.
Looks like we've got company.
SWAT, feds, the works.
Mr. Reese, it was never my intention for people to be killed because of the Machine.
What do you think happened when it gave the government a terrorist number?
What do you think we used to do for a living?
That man is not a terrorist.
He's just an opportunistic and corrupt pawn.
That doesn't make the threat any less real.
We are not assassins.
We protect people.
Isn't that what we're doing?
Sacrificing the life of one to save the lives of many?
Shaw, help me out here.
Six months ago, I would've already put a bullet in that guy's head.
But ever since hanging around you guys, I've kind of gotten used to saving people but we've only been able to do that by trusting the Machine.
And if it's saying that this guy's gotta go...
Well, I think we should still trust it.
John, I urge you to consider the consequences of this action.
There are consequences to not acting.
Like with Simmons and Joss.
Don't do this.
If we let him walk out that door, Decima wins.
Samaritan will go live.
It's a possibility, but not a certainty.
There may be another way.
We've never been here.
But are you really willing to take that risk?
Harold?
Since we started this, things have changed.
We've changed.
But the mission, our purpose, has always been constant:
to save lives.
If that's changed somehow, if we're in a place now where the Machine is asking us to commit murder...
That's a place I can't go.
I'm afraid this is where I get off.
John.
(MUTED SOUND)
(MUFFLED GUNFIRE)
Unh!
MAN:
You've had an opportunity to consider my proposal.
Will you help us?
My colleagues and I would like to, but unfortunately now is not the time.
Perhaps a demonstration of my system's capabilities will convince you that your country cannot afford to wait.
Test in a limited area, say...
New York City.
Twenty-four hours, quick, clean.
Then we shut it down.
No guns, no police, just information.
SENATOR:
What kind of information?
If the NSA provides us with New York City's surveillance feeds, we will find you a terrorist.
SENATOR:
You could find me a thousand terrorists, but like I said' we'll never get this through Congress.
MAN:
And as I told you, dissenting voices would not be a problem.
MAN:
it's time to remove those obstacles.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Answer your phone, Senator.
How you doing, Garrison?
This is Roger McCourt.
I understand you'll be preparing some legislation.
Is that right?
McCOURT:
If you can handle the Senate,
I can ensure that the House rules facilitate a quiet passage.
You can do all that?
Absolutely, Senator.
Okay.
Let's...
- do it.
- Excellent.
Now if there's anything else you need, just ask.
I'm your man.
Virgil, are we operational?
You're just in time for the ribbon cutting.
Feeds are coming online now.
Commencing beta test.
Okay, we have 24 hours.
Splendid.
Find me Harold Finch.
Ripped By mstoll
(English US
- SDH)
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system, a machine that spies on you, every hour of every day.
Ripped By mstoll
I designed the Machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
The leaked black budget report reveals several classified military intelligence programs, with code names like Chalk Eagle and Tractor Rose.
A program designated Northern Lights has...
Northern Lights has a budget far outstripping any other program.
Classified as "operation support for counterterrorism activities,"
the details are scarce.
Some have speculated that it may be related to the surveillance of American citizens.
If so, what does that mean for our privacy?
Media got a hold of the program name, which means your old boss Control just lost it.
Bitch tried to kill me.
Nice to see her head on the chopping block for change.
Anyone connected to the Machine will be burying evidence six feet down.
Could put the program in jeopardy.
Government can't put the Machine back in the box.
We're still getting our numbers, so the lights are on.
Let's go.
Morning.
You guys have the pancakes?
Try the banana chocolate chip...
amazing.
What?
No small talk?
All right, fine by me.
You have the product?
What's it look like?
You got the money?
One million.
We have a deal?
You got it, man.
That fast, huh?
Couldn't even wait to get back to the hotel to count it?
See, Ray, your partner's already picked out a house in Hawaii.
So as soon as you turn your back, he's gonna put two in your head
- and keep all the money for himself.
- But guess what, Julio.
Ray here put a down payment on a yacht, told your girl he'd show her the world.
Five-hundred thousand buys a lot.
But a million?
Both of you would take out your partner for that.
- Oh, you little son of a...
- Sorry, guys.
Deals off.
Sweet dreams, boys.
Fusco can clean this up.
Twenty years in lockup ought to keep 'em from killing each other.
See?
Business as usual.
Even if the government's program's on ice, the Machine is still spitting out numbers.
You know Finch, even without Northern Lights, his machine will find a way to maintain national security.
Really?
Well, then who's handling the relevant threats?
- Root.
- Hey, kids.
- You miss me between drug deals?
- Yeah
I miss you like I miss an intestinal parasite.
I love your similes.
Hop on, Shaw.
We've got a relevant number in Alaska.
We're gonna steal a jet.
Does sound kind of fun.
Send me a postcard.
Turn that frown upside down, Lurch.
You're going on vacation too.
Harold's about to call from DC.
He needs your help.
Mr. Reese, I'm afraid our services are required in the nation's capital.
I heard.
On my way.
Finch?
This'll work.
Oh, good, you're here.
Sorry, got tied up at the library.
I'm happy to see that you've come prepared for a long haul.
Dare I hope that you've packed something other than weaponry?
There's some trip wire to booby-trap the room door.
And a toothbrush.
Oral hygiene is something, I suppose.
You got a number here in DC.?
It would seem so.
My investigation into Vigilance's activities will have to wait.
Well, Root is getting the relevant numbers now.
Shaw is with her.
We're entering uncharted territory, tasked with both relevant and irrelevant numbers.
Already stretched pretty thin, Finch.
And at the worst possible time.
Just when Decima is determined to make Samaritan operational.
Maybe the timing's not a coincidence.
I fear that it may be connected.
These are strange times, and the threat of Samaritan should not be underestimated.
How do you know it's not already up and running?
Because we'd be dead, Mr. Reese.
The Machine is a shield.
It protects lives.
I designed it with safeguards to prevent it being abused as an agent of destruction.
Samaritan is an open system, a sword.
If it gains access to the government's feeds, there will be no checks on its power.
There will be no limits to the knowledge possessed by the person controlling it.
Decima would definitely use it to hunt down its enemies.
And as confidants of the Machine, you and I would be at the top of the list.
So maybe the Machine is trying to protect us.
No, I built it to protect everyone, one number at a time.
- Oh, my.
- What?
That's Roger McCourt.
Our new number is a United States congressman?
From Illinois.
Six terms in Congress.
Current ranking minority member of the Pivotal House Rules Committee.
The rules committee controls the flow of legislation, spurring it forward or stopping it altogether.
If he has that much power, he'll have plenty of enemies.
Given their activities in Washington recently,
Vigilance would have to be a suspect.
However, McCourt's been an outspoken opponent of government surveillance.
Could Decima want him dead?
Perhaps.
But killing a congressman would seem too flashy for them.
Nobody likes the government these days.
Any disgruntled citizen could be the assassin.
We have to get to the Capitol.
You call this music?
Finch?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Can we put the screeching cat out of its misery?
It's not feline.
It's Verdi.
There's a performance of ll Trovatore at the Kennedy Center that I'd like to catch.
Next time you can be the disc jockey.
We'll listen to whatever you like.
Well, maybe next time I'll just sing for you.
I do a great Ring cycle, you know.
I think I'll skip your Brunhilde.
Suit yourself.
Looks like our congressman is in danger of catching lobbyist disease.
It's gonna be difficult to get ears on McCourt.
His aide handles all phone activity.
McCourt doesn't want the government eavesdropping on him?
Congressmen know better than anyone that their employer could be listening.
We'll have to get close to him, narrow down the list of threats.
The Capitol police detail won't let anyone near him.
Congressmen are eligible for Secret Service protection in the event of additional risk.
No one's made an attempt on his life yet.
The congressman doesn't even know the danger he's in.
Get down!
He knows now.
Drive, Finch.
I have to tell you, Mr. Reese, I don't approve of this strategy.
You're the one who said you couldn't make an alias that would pass Secret Service muster.
I said I didn't have time, I didn't know you were gonna steal the identity of an actual Secret Service agent.
I'm just borrowing it.
Relax.
Order some room service.
Perhaps I will when you tell me what you've done with the real Agent Abbott.
He's resting comfortably in a motel room near the airport.
Define "comfortably."
Gotta go, Finch.
The rules committee is meeting in ten minutes.
You have your Journal interview at 11:30.
Then lunch at Ocean Grill with Cynthia Carol from Privacy First to discuss your anti-surveillance initiative.
- Good morning, Leslie.
- Good morning, Congressman.
Who's this?
This is Agent Abbott, Secret Service.
He's been assigned to you.
Because of the shooting?
- Oh, sorry.
I was thinking more about the business ahead of me today rather than behind.
Where you from, Abbott?
He's from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Tulsa, sir.
Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Good people, salt of the earth.
And for tonight, tickets to the Verdi opera at the Kennedy Center.
Do I have to go to this?
This sounds like screeching cats.
- You promised your wife.
- I could shoot you in the leg, sir.
Pardon me?
Might get you out of the opera.
You know, Duran here, he always wanted to be Secret Service.
Isn't that right, Duran?
At one time, sir.
Well, if you show Abbott some love here, maybe he'll put in a good word for you.
Oh, and we can dispense with the stoplights today, okay?
McCourt!
Dunphy.
You should've called first.
My office is slammed this morning.
Is this about the airline contract?
- They're trying to stick it to us, Mac.
- Yeah.
Now I'm hearing you might be taking their side instead of the union's?
Dunphy, Dunphy.
It must be Bruce Dunphy, part of the leadership of the Illinois Machinists Union.
I know it's a lousy contract, but I do think that you ought to sign it.
Unbelievable.
You backstabbing son of a...
- Whoa, hold it, hold it.
- Think you can pull this bait and switch with us, we me, and get away with it?
Looks like McCourt might have crossed the wrong union boss.
It's not a good deal, but it does keep the plant open.
And it puts you at the front of the line for a bigger government contract that's coming down the pipe next year.
- Another contract?
- Yeah.
So you see, Bruce, I am looking out for your guys.
But you do have to trust me.
I guess I jumped the gun a little bit.
Forget it.
- Hey, is your wife in town with you?
- Yeah.
Here.
Go as my guest.
It's classical stuff.
She'll love it.
Really?
Oh, thanks, Mac.
It's my pleasure.
Tell your guys not to worry.
Remember, I'm your man.
Thanks.
Leslie, call my wife and tell her unfortunately the opera was sold out.
It would appear our congressman has quite a knack for getting himself out of unpleasant situations.
Yeah, that opera would've been brutal.
Hmm.
I'm not accustomed to taking meetings on such short notice, but your reputation precedes you.
Don't worry, Senator.
I come with only the best of intentions.
So what can I do for you?
Actually it's what I can do for you and your Northern Lights problem.
If you're referring to the leaked black-budget report, mine's just one of 100 names found in there.
I've already made it clear I have no knowledge of that project.
Really?
I thought you knew a great deal about it, especially since the 2008 policy retreat on Martha's vineyard when you were tapped to shepherd the program.
Surely you didn't think, in a world where you were surveilling everyone, that no one was watching you.
So, what is it you want?
As I told you, to help.
The group responsible for leaking your black budget to the press calls themselves Vigilance.
Privacy terrorists.
This is one of their leaders, known by his alias as Peter Collier.
Ironic.
You risked your career hiding a program designed to protect the country, yet it couldn't protect you from this group when you needed it to.
And now you've had to shut it down, leaving your country unprotected.
A frightening prospect indeed.
The country will always be protected.
Yes, I'm sure you're weighing alternative approaches, as your president might say.
I can save you the time.
My company, Decima Technologies, is finalizing development of a new surveillance system.
All due respect, we've gone down a similar path with mixed results.
Northern Lights was effective but compromised by the ethics of its creator.
It spoke but never listened.
What I have not only listens, but obeys.
It can find anyone, anywhere, anytime.
You merely need to ask.
As intriguing as that sounds, there are some members of Congress making too much hay out of this latest scandal to ever green-light another program.
Heh.
Share my proposal with your colleagues.
If there is interest, dissenting voices will not be a problem.
How can you be sure?
Because, Senator, obstacles are only obstacles until you move them out of the way.
So how long you been with the congressman?
Long enough to know he doesn't need Secret Service protection.
- What about the shooting?
- Just some antigovernment wing nut
- looking to make the news cycle.
- I suppose that's possible.
Mr. Reese?
That's my supervisor.
Guy's always in my ear.
- What do you got, Finch?
- Nothing of note.
McCourt's list of enemies is practically nonexistent.
He ran a surprisingly clean campaign to get into office, and his current stand against unchecked surveillance has endeared him to elements of both parties.
- What about his personal life?
- No red flags.
Finances are sound, carries no debt, and has an impressive stock portfolio.
And that's the point I'm making now...
- Help you with something, friend?
- Let go of me.
I'm trying to be polite here.
It's all right, Abbott, I've got this.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.
Local homeless guy.
I've seen him around.
McCourt knows him?
No, but people like him know McCourt.
He's got a standing offer to buy a meal for anyone who needs one.
It's a practice he started last year to raise awareness for the homeless problem.
- One more, Congressman.
- Also helps burnish his public image.
Okay.
Get him some soup.
Finch, take this down.
Echo-Five-Dash-Nine-Mike-India-Six.
A license plate?
See if you can trace it.
Abbott, chop chop!
What was that?
Forget it.
Starting to think I should've gone with Root.
Thanks for being my travel buddy on these errands.
Sure, it's not every day you get to beat up a militia group in Anchorage, then hop a plane to Miami.
So is this what you're doing from now on, you're chasing down bad guys?
I doubt it.
There's still too much work to be done.
What kind of work?
Preparation.
I understand.
We're leaving now.
- Time to go.
- Where to?
- St. Louis.
- Oh, great.
I know a steak joint that serves a filet that's better than sex.
Yummy as that sounds, you won't be joining me.
She needs you somewhere else.
Where?
You should go back to dealing coke, Sonny.
It's a lot safer than moving explosives.
You there, Finch?
Always, Mr. Reese.
Sounds rather quiet there.
I think the only thing McCourt is in danger of is working too late.
I fear you may need to remain on his security detail longer than anticipated.
Shouldn't we check in on the real Agent Abbott?
Yeah, I guess someone should turn him over.
I beg your pardon?
- What's going on?
- Something's wrong, Finch.
- Sorry.
- What the hell, Abbott?
You never heard of knocking?
I'm sorry.
I thought I heard a...
Never mind.
Should I call it in?
Finch, McCourt and his aide have been working on more than just policy positions.
Might wanna consider his wife as a possible threat.
Actually, her e-mails show that she's been aware of his affairs for quite some time.
Seems they have more of an arrangement than a marriage.
Mr. Reese, I found something.
What is it?
With Fusco's aid, I was able to trace the license plate from the SUV outside the restaurant back to a rental car company.
It seems the vehicle was rented to a shell corporation set up by another company.
Decima Technologies.
Decima.
You were right, Finch.
It's all connected.
McCourt must be a threat to Samaritan.
Which would explain why they're here.
Duran.
There's something you should know, Officer.
He's not Secret Service.
What?
Who's this?
Here's the real Agent Abbott.
Don't do it.
- Abbott, what are you doing?
- Stay put.
- Mr. Reese, what's happening?
- Change of plans.
I've got McCourt.
Got him?
You've kidnapped a United States congressman?
Like you said, Finch, these are strange times.
Hello, Harold.
Mr. Reese, I have to question the wisdom of abducting an elected official.
Well, Decima blew my cover and started shooting.
The Capitol police and Secret Service are scouring the city for you now, plus the FBI and about a dozen other three-letter agencies.
Let's see how they're doing.
...traveling west on Independence Avenue.
Congressman was abducted in a black sport utility vehicle,
- Illinois license plate 20...
- That's us.
So we need to dump the car and hole up somewhere.
Very well.
Turn left up here.
I know a place.
American Beef Consultants, Finch?
We need a hiding place, not a burger.
Last month I bought the beef industry's lobbying arm.
And don't knock the hamburgers.
They're superb.
Doesn't look like much of a safe house.
That's the idea.
I cleared out this floor, and added a couple of cutting-edge amenities:
fully stocked kitchen, bulletproof glass.
Okay, Mac, you gonna scream?
Mmm.
John, bedside manner.
Congressman, strange as it may seem, we wish you no harm, we're here to help.
But we do need to ask you a few questions, and we would prefer that you did not yell for assistance.
Who are you?
Security advisors... of a sort.
Well, yeah, I can pay the ransom.
I can get however much money you need.
- Someone's trying to kill you.
- Yeah, you.
- What?
No.
We're protection.
Protection?
You posed as, uh, Secret Service, you knock out my security detail, and then you abduct me at gunpoint.
Technically I also shot at you a couple days ago.
Somebody help me, please!
That's enough!
We don't have time for this.
If you wanna survive, you have to help us.
Now, about that hit squad that my colleague rescued you from.
Hit squad?
That wasn't a hit squad.
That was the FBI trying to save me from you.
I know it may have appeared that way, but I assure you that was not the case.
What do you know about a company called Decima?
Never heard of it.
Why?
They sent the team that tried to kill you.
Do you know why they would consider you an enemy?
Me, an enemy?
I'm not an enemy.
People love me.
I mean, I might piss a few people off along the way, but I always get 'em whatever it is they need.
I'm a deal maker.
So what is it with you guys?
What do you want, money?
You want a personal telephone call from the president?
'Cause I can get it.
Just please, come on.
Let me go.
Then, whatever you need, I'm your man.
Finch, get down!
- You guys all right?
- Yes, we're fine.
Why is everybody shooting at everybody?
If you're shooting at federal agents...
Feds don't walk in scattering lead.
- Decima found us.
- How?
McCourt has no phone to follow.
It's a tracker.
Do you know who gave you this?
No idea.
It was given to me at a fundraiser a week ago.
More operatives will be arriving soon.
We need to go.
We should leave the beltway.
We'll need a new car.
Or an old one, easier to hotwire.
Take McCourt.
This guy again.
He's like a cockroach.
Sounds like our last escape route is about to disappear.
I'm more comfortable shooting this guy than the cops.
You guys going my Way?
Congressman was abducted by a white male,
Six-three, dark hair, in suit.
Be advised, suspect is armed and extremely dangerous.
Nice car, Shaw.
So how'd you know we'd be there?
I didn't... until five minutes ago.
I got a call from Root.
- So you're the one we're saving?
- Yeah.
Who are you?
Right now I'm the getaway driver.
Heh.
Boy, this just gets worse.
Cheer up, Mac.
You could be in the trunk with the guy who wants to kill you.
We can't go back.
It's too dangerous.
I could try blasting through the roadblock.
The term "blasting"
does not inspire great confidence, Ms. Shaw.
Time to get some fresh air.
I'll get the guy in the trunk.
Let's go.
Sir, you need to pull forward please.
Thank you.
Time to stretch your legs.
All clear.
Newspapers in the driveway, mail piled up.
Must be on vacation.
Let's hope they decide to stay another night.
What now?
Some answers.
Look, I don't know how many times I have to tell you,
I haven't done anything to make anybody wanna kill me.
Well, until we determine the reason that Decima keeps making attempts on your life, you'll have to stay with us.
- You have our Decima friend's phone?
- I pulled out the SIM card.
If you really wanna protect me, why don't you just take me to the cops?
Law enforcement is no deterrent to the people coming after you, Congressman.
This is insane.
You've obviously done something to attract their attention.
Like what?
Decima is a private intelligence company developing a large-scale surveillance program.
The type of program that you've been vocally against.
Along with half the Congress.
So?
But your position on the rules committee gives you the power to alter or halt legislation.
Have you sidelined anything that would affect Decima's plans?
No.
I don't know anything about that company or why they would wanna kill me.
This is all just a huge mistake.
We're not getting anywhere here.
Maybe Shaw's having some luck.
You can talk or bleed out.
You help us, we'll help you.
Suit yourself, tough guy.
Hope it's worth dying for.
That may not be necessary.
I was able to get into his phone through a key vulnerability in the SMS encryption.
I think we may have misread this situation.
Protect?
Seems we're not the only ones concerned with the congressman's safety.
So who are you supposed to be protecting McCourt from?
I wasn't given that information.
But in the week we've been watching him, the only ones who have taken a shot at him are you.
Ah.
You think maybe I could get a coffee?
Or some water would be fine.
Mr. McCourt, you're sure you have no knowledge of Decima?
I already answered that.
- Why do you keep beating that drum?
Because they're protecting you.
Protecting me?
A minute ago you said they were trying to kill me.
I did.
Something doesn't add up.
Actually I think it might.
I looked into your finances earlier today, Congressman.
You did what?
I noticed your stock portfolio, up 20 percent over last year.
What are you getting at?
Your trading activities.
Your portfolio is up 20 percent due to trades you've made in the last two weeks.
Trades that have increased in value by over 600 percent.
- So?
- So... either you're the smartest investor in Washington, or you're getting some very good information.
Inside information.
I don't like what you're implying.
It's more than an implication, Congressman, and it'll become a call to an SEC investigator I know unless you're more truthful with us.
Okay-
I know Decima Technologies.
But they're not trying to kill me.
We have an understanding.
What kind of an understanding?
They were looking for a little legislative support for their new surveillance program.
Support?
You've been leading the charge against government surveillance.
Course I have. 'Cause I realized that the government can't keep a secret.
You look at Prism and this Northern Lights mess.
What do you know about Decima's program?
Not much really.
Just that it's an alternative to a government-run system, which, at this point, should make everybody happy.
And in return for your support, you're getting insider stock tips.
You're a couple of smart guys, you know?
Surely you understand that everything that happens in Washington is a deal.
And you're a dealmaker.
In case you didn't know, the business of governance...
is business.
They're moving grid-to-grid through the neighborhood.
We need to make a move.
Greer is positioning Samaritan to replace the Machine.
McCourt is helping Decima.
We've been looking at him as a victim, but he's really a perpetrator.
I'm not so sure.
His involvement is tangential at best, and he doesn't know Greens intentions.
If he's not a victim or a perp, then why did the Machine give us his number?
What is it we're supposed to be stopping?
I'm not sure we're supposed to be stopping anything.
Finch, you said McCourt could speed up or halt legislation.
Yes, he's in a unique position to remove any legislative roadblock to Samaritan.
So without McCourt, Samaritan doesn't get past Congress.
And Greer wouldn't get access to the NSA's surveillance feeds.
Then that's why we got his number.
He is the victim.
His life is in danger.
But from who?
Us.
I think the Machine wants us to kill McCourt.
- John, think about what you're saying.
- I have.
Just because Decima is not the threat to McCourt doesn't mean that we must be.
The Machine is designed to save lives, not take them.
But could it?
Could the Machine ever tell us to kill someone?
Is it possible?
It's conceivable.
Well, how bad would the situation have to be?
Bad.
It would have to see that an individual's actions could directly result in the loss of others' lives.
How many lives?
A dozen, a hundred?
How many?
A lot.
I'm not sure.
I never dreamt it would come to this.
Well, it has.
Your machine, it sees something coming,
Something bad, and it wants us to stop it.
I don't know.
You don't know that.
Look, I've never entirely trusted your machine, but you built it, and I trust you.
You're the one who said we can't underestimate the threat of Samaritan.
Mr. McCourt... you have to call off your deal with Decima.
Their surveillance program cannot be approved.
What are you, one of those privacy nut jobs?
Is that what this is about?
With access to the government's surveillance feeds,
Decima will be able to acquire any information, any secret it desires, and sell it to the highest bidder.
And that would be the United States government.
Perhaps, for now.
But unbridled access will create unlimited opportunities for abuse.
People will be ruined, lives will be lost.
The results will be nothing short of catastrophic.
These programs are always gonna be controversial but also inevitable.
People get up in arms whenever they go public, but eventually the noise dies down, because the simple truth is that people wanna be protected.
They just don't wanna know how.
Oh, maybe I haven't offered you the right incentive.
So how much?
Excuse me?
To withdraw your support for Decima's program, how much?
Hey, you know, I did this to keep the country safe.
And, yeah, maybe I got a little something for myself during the process.
All that makes me is good at what I do.
I'm not calling off the deal.
Looks like we've got company.
SWAT, feds, the works.
Mr. Reese, it was never my intention for people to be killed because of the Machine.
What do you think happened when it gave the government a terrorist number?
What do you think we used to do for a living?
That man is not a terrorist.
He's just an opportunistic and corrupt pawn.
That doesn't make the threat any less real.
We are not assassins.
We protect people.
Isn't that what we're doing?
Sacrificing the life of one to save the lives of many?
Shaw, help me out here.
Six months ago, I would've already put a bullet in that guy's head.
But ever since hanging around you guys, I've kind of gotten used to saving people but we've only been able to do that by trusting the Machine.
And if it's saying that this guy's gotta go...
Well, I think we should still trust it.
John, I urge you to consider the consequences of this action.
There are consequences to not acting.
Like with Simmons and Joss.
Don't do this.
If we let him walk out that door, Decima wins.
Samaritan will go live.
It's a possibility, but not a certainty.
There may be another way.
We've never been here.
But are you really willing to take that risk?
Harold?
Since we started this, things have changed.
We've changed.
But the mission, our purpose, has always been constant:
to save lives.
If that's changed somehow, if we're in a place now where the Machine is asking us to commit murder...
That's a place I can't go.
I'm afraid this is where I get off.
John.
Unh!
You've had an opportunity to consider my proposal.
Will you help us?
My colleagues and I would like to, but unfortunately now is not the time.
Perhaps a demonstration of my system's capabilities will convince you that your country cannot afford to wait.
Test in a limited area, say...
New York City.
Twenty-four hours, quick, clean.
Then we shut it down.
No guns, no police, just information.
What kind of information?
If the NSA provides us with New York City's surveillance feeds, we will find you a terrorist.
You could find me a thousand terrorists, but like I said' we'll never get this through Congress.
And as I told you, dissenting voices would not be a problem.
It's time to remove those obstacles.
Answer your phone, Senator.
How you doing, Garrison?
This is Roger McCourt.
I understand you'll be preparing some legislation.
Is that right?
If you can handle the Senate,
I can ensure that the House rules facilitate a quiet passage.
You can do all that?
Absolutely, Senator.
Okay.
Let's...
- do it.
- Excellent.
Now if there's anything else you need, just ask.
I'm your man.
Virgil, are we operational?
You're just in time for the ribbon cutting.
Feeds are coming online now.
Commencing beta test.
Okay, we have 24 hours.
Splendid.
Find me Harold Finch.
Ripped By mstoll
You are being watched.
The government has a secret system...
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Violent crimes involving ordinary people.
The government considers these people irrelevant.
We don't.
Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
You will never find us.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
The leaked black budget report reveals several classified military intelligence programs, with code names like Chalk Eagle and Tractor Rose.
A program designated Northern Lights has...
Northern Lights has a budget far outstripping any other program.
Classified as "operation support for counterterrorism activities,"
the details are scarce.
Some have speculated that it may be related to the surveillance of American citizens.
If so, what does that mean for our privacy?
Media got a hold of the program name, which means your old boss control just lost it.
Bitch tried to kill me.
Nice to see her head on the chopping block for change.
Anyone connected to the machine will be burying evidence 6 feet down.
Could put the program in jeopardy.
Government can't put the machine back in the box.
We're still getting our numbers, so the lights are on.
Let's go.
Morning.
You guys have the pancakes?
Try the banana chocolate chip... amazing.
What?
No small talk?
All right, fine by me.
You have the product?
What's it look like?
You got the money?
1 million.
We have a deal?
You got it, man.
That fast, huh?
Couldn't even wait to get back to the hotel to count it?
See, Ray, your partner's already picked out a house in Hawaii.
So as soon as you turn your back, he's gonna put two in your head and keep all the money for himself.
But guess what, Julio.
Ray here put a down payment on a yacht, told your girl he'd show her the world.
500,000 buys a lot.
But a million?
Both of you would take out your partner for that.
Oh, you little son of a...
Sorry, guys.
Deal's off.
Sweet dreams, boys.
Fusco can clean this up.
20 years in lockup ought to keep 'em from killing each other.
See?
Business as usual.
Even if the government's program's on ice, the machine is still spitting out numbers.
You know Finch.
Even without Northern Lights, his machine will find a way to maintain national security.
Really?
Well, then who's handling the relevant threats?
Root.
Hey, kids.
- You miss me between drug deals?
- Yeah.
I miss you like I miss an intestinal parasite.
I love your similes.
Hop on, Shaw.
We've got a relevant number in Alaska.
We're gonna steal a jet.
Does sound kind of fun.
Send me a postcard.
Turn that frown upside down, lurch.
You're going on vacation too.
Harold's about to call from D.C. he needs your help.
Mr. Reese, I'm afraid our services are required in the nation's capital.
I heard.
On my way.
Finch?
This'll work.
Oh, good, you're here.
Sorry, got tied up at the library.
I'm happy to see that you've come prepared for a long haul.
Dare I hope that you've packed something other than weaponry?
There's some trip wire to booby-trap the room door.
And a toothbrush.
Oral hygiene is something, I suppose.
You got a number here in D.C.?
It would seem so.
My investigation into vigilance's activities will have to wait.
Well, Root is getting the relevant numbers now.
Shaw is with her.
We're entering uncharted territory, tasked with both relevant and irrelevant numbers.
Already stretched pretty thin, Finch.
And at the worst possible time.
Just when Decima is determined to make Samaritan operational.
Maybe the timing's not a coincidence.
I fear that it may be connected.
These are strange times, and the threat of Samaritan should not be underestimated.
How do you know it's not already up and running?
Because we'd be dead, Mr. Reese.
The machine is a shield.
It protects lives.
I designed it with safeguards to prevent it being abused as an agent of destruction.
Samaritan is an open system, a sword.
If it gains access to the government's feeds, there will be no checks on its power.
There will be no limits to the knowledge possessed by the person controlling it.
Decima would definitely use it to hunt down its enemies.
And as confidants of the machine, you and I would be at the top of the list.
So maybe the machine is trying to protect us.
No, I built it to protect everyone, one number at a time.
Oh, my.
What?
That's Roger McCourt.
Our new number is a United States congressman?
From Illinois.
Six terms in Congress.
Current ranking minority member of the pivotal house rules committee.
The rules committee controls the flow of legislation...
Spurring it forward or stopping it altogether.
If he has that much power, he'll have plenty of enemies.
Given their activities in Washington recently, vigilance would have to be a suspect.
However, McCourt's been an outspoken opponent of government surveillance.
Could Decima want him dead?
Perhaps.
But killing a congressman would seem too flashy for them.
Nobody likes the government these days.
Any disgruntled citizen could be the assassin.
We have to get to the Capitol.
You call this music?
Finch?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Can we put the screeching cat out of its misery?
It's not feline.
It's Verdi.
There's a performance of Il Trovatore at the Kennedy Center that I'd like to catch.
Next time you can be the disc jockey.
We'll listen to whatever you like.
Well, maybe next time I'll just sing for you.
I do a great ring cycle, you know.
I think I'll skip your Brunnhilde.
Suit yourself.
Looks like our congressman is in danger of catching lobbyist disease.
It's gonna be difficult to get ears on McCourt.
His aide handles all phone activity.
McCourt doesn't want the government eavesdropping on him?
Congressmen know better than anyone that their employer could be listening.
We'll have to get close to him, narrow down the list of threats.
The capitol police detail won't let anyone near him.
Congressmen are eligible for secret service protection in the event of additional risk.
No one's made an attempt on his life yet.
The congressman doesn't even know the danger he's in.
He knows now.
Drive, Finch.
I have to tell you, Mr. Reese,
I don't approve of this strategy.
You're the one who said you couldn't make an alias that would pass secret service muster.
I said I didn't have time.
I didn't know you were gonna steal the identity of an actual secret service agent.
I'm just borrowing it.
Relax.
Order some room service.
Perhaps I will when you tell me what you've done with the real Agent Abbott.
He's resting comfortably in a motel room near the airport.
Define "comfortably."
Gotta go, Finch.
The rules committee is meeting in ten minutes, you have your journal interview at 11:30, and then lunch at Ocean Grill with Cynthia Carol from Privacy First to discuss your anti-surveillance initiative.
- Good morning, Leslie.
- Good morning, Congressman.
Who's this?
This is Agent Abbott, secret service.
He's been assigned to you.
Because of the shooting?
Oh, sorry, I was thinking more about the business ahead of me today rather than behind.
Where you from, Abbott?
He's from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Tulsa, sir.
Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Good people, salt of the earth.
And for tonight, tickets to the Verdi opera at the Kennedy Center.
Do I have to go to this?
This sounds like screeching cats.
You promised your wife.
I could shoot you in the leg, sir.
Pardon me?
Might get you out of the opera.
You know, Duran here, he always wanted to be secret service.
Isn't that right, Duran?
At one time, sir.
Well, if you show Abbott some love here, maybe he'll put in a good word for you.
Oh, and we can dispense with the stoplights today, okay?
- McCourt!
- Dunphy.
You should've called first.
My office is slammed this morning.
Is this about the airline contract?
- They're trying to stick it to us, Mac.
- Yeah.
And now I'm hearing you might be taking their side instead of the union's?
Dunphy, Dunphy.
It must be Bruce Dunphy, part of the leadership of the Illinois Machinists Union.
I know it's a lousy contract, but
I do think that you ought to sign it.
Unbelievable.
You backstabbing son of a...
Whoa, hold it, hold it.
You think you can pull this bait and switch with us, with me, and get away with it?
Looks like McCourt might have crossed the wrong union, boss.
It's not a good deal, but it does keep the plant open.
And it puts you at the front of the line for a bigger government contract that's coming down the pike next year.
- Another contract?
- Yeah.
So you see, Bruce, I am looking out for your guys.
But you do have to trust me.
I guess I jumped the gun a little bit.
Forget it.
Hey, is your wife in town with you?
- Yeah.
- Here.
Go as my guest.
It's classical stuff.
She'll love it.
Really?
Oh, thanks, Mac.
It's my pleasure.
Tell your guys not to worry.
Remember, I'm your man.
Thanks.
Leslie, will you call my wife and tell her unfortunately the opera was sold out?
It would appear our congressman has quite a knack for getting himself out of unpleasant situations.
Yeah, that opera would've been brutal.
Hmm.
I'm not accustomed to taking meetings on such short notice, but your reputation precedes you.
Don't worry, Senator.
I come with only the best of intentions.
So what can I do for you?
Actually it's what I can do for you and your Northern Lights problem.
If you're referring to the leaked black budget report, mine's just one of 100 names found in there.
I've already made it clear
I have no knowledge of that project.
Really?
I thought you knew a great deal about it, especially since the 2008 policy retreat on Martha's vineyard when you were tapped to shepherd the program.
Surely you didn't think, in a world where you were surveilling everyone, that no one was watching you.
So...
What is it you want?
As I told you, to help.
The group responsible for leaking your black budget to the press calls themselves Vigilance.
Privacy terrorists.
This is one of their leaders, known by his alias as Peter Collier.
Ironic.
You risked your career hiding a program designed to protect the country, yet it couldn't protect you from this group when you needed it to.
And now you've had to shut it down...
Leaving your country unprotected.
A frightening prospect indeed.
The country will always be protected.
Yes, I'm sure you're weighing alternative approaches, as your president might say.
I can save you the time.
My company, Decima Technologies, is finalizing development of a new surveillance system.
All due respect, we've gone down a similar path with mixed results.
Northern lights was effective but compromised by the ethics of its creator.
It spoke but never listened.
What I have not only listens, but obeys.
It can find anyone anywhere, anytime.
You merely need to ask.
As intriguing as that sounds, there are some members of Congress making too much hay out of this latest scandal to ever green-light another program.
Hmm.
Share my proposal with your colleagues.
If there is interest...
Dissenting voices will not be a problem.
How can you be sure?
Because, Senator, obstacles are only obstacles until you move them out of the way.
So how long you been with the congressman?
Long enough to know he doesn't need secret service protection.
What about the shooting?
Just some antigovernment wing nut looking to make the news cycle.
I suppose that's possible.
Mr. Reese?
That's my supervisor.
Guy's always in my ear.
What do you got, Finch?
Nothing of note.
McCourt's list of enemies is practically nonexistent.
He ran a surprisingly clean campaign to get into office, and his current stand against unchecked surveillance has endeared him to elements of both parties.
What about his personal life?
No red flags... finances are sound, carries no debt, and has an impressive stock portfolio.
Help you with something, friend?
Let go of me.
I'm trying to be polite here.
It's all right, Abbott, I've got this.
Have a seat.
Thank you, sir.
Local homeless guy.
I've seen him around.
McCourt knows him?
No, but people like him know McCourt.
He's got a standing offer to buy a meal for anyone who needs one.
It's a practice he started last year to raise awareness for the homeless problem.
One more, Congressman.
It also helps burnish his public image.
Okay.
Get him some soup.
Finch, take this down.
Echo Five Dash Nine Mike India Six.
A license plate?
See if you can trace it.
Abbott, chop chop!
What was that?
Forget it.
Starting to think I should've gone with Root.
Thanks for being my travel buddy on these errands.
Sure.
It's not every day you get to beat up a militia group in Anchorage, then hop a plane to Miami.
So is this what you're doing from now on, you're chasing down bad guys?
I doubt it.
There's still too much work to be done.
What kind of work?
Preparation.
I understand.
We're leaving now.
- Time to go.
- Where to?
- St. Louis.
- Oh, great.
I know a steak joint that serves a filet that's better than sex.
Yummy as that sounds, you won't be joining me.
She needs you somewhere else.
W-where?
You should go back to dealing coke, Sonny.
It's a lot safer than moving explosives.
You there, Finch?
Always, Mr. Reese.
Sounds rather quiet there.
I think the only thing McCourt is in danger of is working too late.
I fear you may need to remain on his security detail longer than anticipated.
Shouldn't we check in on the real Agent Abbott?
Yeah, I guess someone should turn him over.
I beg your pardon?
What's going on?
Something's wrong, Finch.
Sorry.
What the hell, Abbott?
You never heard of knocking?
I'm sorry.
I thought I heard a...
Never mind.
Should I call it in?
Finch, McCourt and his aide have been working on more than just policy positions.
Might wanna consider his wife as a possible threat.
Actually, her emails show that she's been aware of his affairs for quite some time.
Seems they have more of an arrangement than a marriage.
Mr. Reese, I found something.
What is it?
With Fusco's aid,
I was able to trace the license plate from the SUV outside the restaurant back to a rental car company.
It seems the vehicle was rented to a shell corporation set up by another company...
Decima Technologies.
Decima.
You were right, Finch.
It's all connected.
McCourt must be a threat to Samaritan.
Which would explain why they're here.
Duran.
There's something you should know, Officer.
He's not secret service.
What?
Who's this?
Here's the real Agent Abbott.
Don't do it.
- Abbott, what are you doing?
- Stay put.
Mr. Reese, what's happening?
Change of plans.
I've got McCourt.
Got him?
You've kidnapped a United States congressman?
Like you said, Finch, these are strange times.
Hello, Harold.
Mr. Reese, I have to question the wisdom of abducting an elected official.
Well, Decima blew my cover and started shooting.
The capitol police and secret service are scouring the city for you now, plus the FBI and about a dozen other three-letter agencies.
Let's see how they're doing.
Traveling west on Independence Avenue.
Congressman was abducted in a black sport utility vehicle,
- Illinois license plate 20...
- Mm-hmm.
- That's us.
- Congressional tags.
So we need to dump the car and hole up somewhere.
Very well.
Turn left up here.
I know a place.
American beef consultants, Finch?
We need a hiding place, not a burger.
Last month I bought the beef industry's lobbying arm.
And don't knock the hamburgers.
They're superb.
Doesn't look like much of a safe house.
That's the idea...
I cleared out this floor and added a couple of cutting-edge amenities...
Fully stocked kitchen, bulletproof glass.
Okay, Mac.
You gonna scream?
John.
Bedside manner.
Congressman, strange as it may seem, we wish you no harm, we're here to help.
But we do need to ask you a few questions, and we would prefer that you did not yell for assistance.
Who are you?
Security advisors...
Of a sort.
Well, yeah, I can pay the ransom.
I can get however much money you need.
Someone's trying to kill you.
Yeah, you.
What?
No.
We're protection.
Protection?
You posed as, uh, secret service, you knock out my security detail, and then you abduct me at gunpoint.
Technically I also shot at you a couple days ago.
Somebody help me, please!
That's enough!
We don't have time for this.
If you wanna survive, you're gonna have to help us.
Now, about that hit squad that my colleague rescued you from...
Hit squad?
That wasn't a hit squad.
That was the FBI trying to save me from you.
I know it may have appeared that way, but I assure you that was not the case.
What do you know about company called Decima?
Never heard of it.
Why?
They sent the team that tried to kill you.
Do you know why they would consider you an enemy?
Me, an enemy?
I'm not an enemy.
People love me.
I mean, I might piss a few people off along the way, but I always get 'em whatever it is they need.
I'm a deal maker.
So what is it with you guys?
What do you want, money?
You want a personal telephone call from the president?
'Cause I can get it.
Just please, come on.
Let me go.
Then, whatever you need, I'm your man.
Finch, get down!
- You guys all right?
- Yes, we're fine.
Why is everybody shooting at everybody?
I mean, if you're shooting at federal agents...
Feds don't walk in scattering lead.
- Decima found us.
- How?
McCourt has no phone to follow.
It's a tracker.
Do you know who gave you this?
No idea.
It was given to me at a fund-raiser a week ago.
More operatives will be arriving soon.
We need to go.
We should leave the beltway.
We'll need a new car.
Or an old one...
Easier to hotwire.
Take McCourt.
This guy again.
He's like a cockroach.
Sounds like our last escape route is about to disappear.
I'm more comfortable shooting this guy than the cops.
You guys going my way?
Congressman was abducted by a white male, 6'3", dark hair, in suit.
Be advised, suspect is armed and extremely dangerous.
Nice car, Shaw.
So how'd you know we'd be there?
I didn't...
Until five minutes ago.
I got a call from Root.
So you're the one we're saving?
Yeah.
Who are you?
Right now I'm the getaway driver.
Boy, this just gets worse.
Cheer up, Mac.
You could be in the trunk with the guy who wants to kill you.
We can't go back.
It's too dangerous.
I could try blasting through the roadblock.
The term "blasting"
does not inspire great confidence, Ms. Shaw.
Time to get some fresh air.
I'll get the guy in the trunk.
Let's go.
Time to stretch your legs.
All clear.
Newspapers in the driveway, mail piled up.
Must be on vacation.
Let's hope they decide to stay another night.
What now?
Some answers.
Look, I don't know how many times I have to tell you.
I haven't done anything to make anybody wanna kill me.
Well, until we determine the reason that Decima keeps making attempts on your life, you'll have to stay with us.
You have our Decima friend's phone?
I pulled out the SIM card.
If you really wanna protect me, why don't you just take me to the cops?
Law enforcement is no deterrent to the people coming after you, congressman.
This is insane.
You've obviously done something to attract their attention.
Like what?
Decima is a private intelligence company developing a large-scale surveillance program...
The type of program that you've been vocally against.
Along with half the Congress.
So?
But your position on the rules committee gives you the power to alter or halt legislation.
Have you sidelined anything that would affect Decima's plans?
No.
I don't know anything about that company or why they would wanna kill me.
This is all just a huge mistake.
We're not getting anywhere here.
Maybe Shaw's having some luck.
You can talk or bleed out.
You help us, we'll help you.
Suit yourself, tough guy.
Hope it's worth dying for.
That may not be necessary.
I was able to get into his phone through a key vulnerability in the SMS encryption.
I think we may have misread this situation.
"Protect"?
Seems we're not the only ones concerned with the congressman's safety.
So who are you supposed to be protecting McCourt from?
I wasn't given that information.
But in the week we've been watching him, the only ones who have taken a shot at him are you.
You think maybe I could get a coffee?
Or some water would be fine.
Mr. McCourt, you're sure you have no knowledge of Decima?
I already answered that.
Why do you keep beating that drum?
Because they're protecting you.
Protecting me?
A minute ago you said they were trying to kill me.
I did.
Something doesn't add up.
Actually I think it might.
I looked into your finances earlier today, Congressman.
You did what?
I noticed your stock portfolio, up 20% over last year.
What are you getting at?
Your trading activities.
Your portfolio is up 20% due to trades you've made in the last two weeks.
Trades that have increased in value by over 600%.
- So?
- So...
Either you're the smartest investor in Washington, or you're getting some very good information.
Inside information.
I don't like what you're implying.
It's more than an implication, Congressman, and it'll become a call to an S.E.C. investigator I know unless you're more truthful with us.
Okay.
I know Decima Technologies.
But they're not trying to kill me.
We have an understanding.
What kind of an understanding?
They were looking for a little legislative support for their new surveillance program.
Support?
You've been leading the charge against government surveillance.
Course I have.
'Cause I realized that the government can't keep a secret.
You look at, uh, Prism and this Northern Lights mess.
What do you know about Decima's program?
Not much really.
Just that it's an alternative to a government-run system.
Which, at this point, should make everybody happy.
And in return for your support, you're getting insider stock tips.
You're a couple of smart guys, you know?
Surely you understand that everything that happens in Washington is a deal.
And you're a deal maker.
In case you didn't know, the business of governments is business.
They're moving grid to grid through the neighborhood.
We need to make a move.
Greer is positioning Samaritan to replace the machine.
McCourt is helping Decima.
We've been looking at him as a victim,
- but he's really a perpetrator.
- I'm not so sure.
His involvement is tangential at best, and he doesn't know Greer's intentions.
But if he's not a victim or a perp, then why did the machine give us his number?
What is it we're supposed to be stopping?
I'm not sure we're supposed to be stopping anything.
Finch, you said McCourt could speed up or halt legislation.
Yes, he's in a unique position to remove any legislative roadblock to Samaritan.
So without McCourt,
Samaritan doesn't get past Congress.
And Greer wouldn't get access to the NSA's surveillance feeds.
Then that's why we got his number.
He is the victim.
His life is in danger.
But from who?
Us.
I think the machine wants us to kill McCourt.
John, think about what you're saying.
I have.
Just because Decima is not the threat to McCourt doesn't mean that we must be.
The machine is designed to save lives, not take them.
But could it?
Could the machine ever tell us to kill someone?
Is it possible?
It's conceivable.
Well, how bad would the situation have to be?
Bad.
It would have to see that an individual's actions could directly result in the loss of others' lives.
How many lives?
A dozen, a hundred?
How many?
A lot.
I'm not sure.
I never dreamt it would come to this.
Well, it has.
Your machine...
It sees something coming...
Something bad...
And it wants us to stop it.
I don't know.
You don't know that.
Look, I've never entirely trusted your machine, but you built it, and I trust you.
You're the one who said we can't underestimate the threat of Samaritan.
Mr. McCourt, you have to call off your deal with Decima.
Their surveillance program cannot be approved.
What... what are you, one of those privacy nut jobs?
Is that what this is about?
With access to the government's surveillance feeds,
Decima will be able to acquire any information, any secret it desires, and sell it to the highest bidder.
And that would be the United States government.
Perhaps, for now.
But unbridled access will create unlimited opportunities for abuse.
People will be ruined, lives will be lost.
The results will be nothing short of catastrophic.
These programs are always gonna be controversial but also inevitable.
People get up in arms whenever they go public, but eventually the noise dies down, because the simple truth is that people wanna be protected.
They just don't wanna know how.
Oh, maybe I haven't offered you the right incentive.
So how much?
Excuse me?
To withdraw your support for Decima's program, how much?
Hey, you know, I did this to keep the country safe.
And yeah, maybe I got a little something for myself during the process.
All that makes me is good at what I do.
I'm not calling off the deal.
Looks like we've got company...
S.W.A.T., feds, the works.
Mr. Reese, it was never my intention for people to be killed because of the machine.
What do you think happened when it gave the government a terrorist number?
What do you think we used to do for a living?
That man is not a terrorist.
He's just an opportunistic and corrupt pawn.
That doesn't make the threat any less real.
We are not assassins.
We protect people.
Isn't that what we're doing, sacrificing the life of one to save the lives of many?
Shaw, help me out here.
Six months ago, I would've already put a bullet in that guy's head.
But ever since hanging around you guys,
I've kind of gotten used to saving people.
But we've only been able to do that by trusting the machine.
And if it's saying that this guy's gotta go, well, I think we should still trust it.
John, I urge you to consider the consequences of this action.
There are consequences to not acting.
Like with Simmons and Joss.
Don't do this.
If we let him walk out that door, Decima wins.
Samaritan will go live.
It's a possibility but not a certainty.
There may be another way.
We've never been here.
But are you really willing to take that risk?
Harold?
Since we started this, things have changed.
We've changed.
But the mission, our purpose, has always been constant...
To save lives.
If that's changed somehow, if we're in a place now where the machine is asking us to commit murder...
That's a place I can't go.
I'm afraid this is where I get off.
John.
You've had an opportunity to consider my proposal.
Will you help us?
My colleagues and I would like to, but unfortunately now is not the time.
Perhaps a demonstration of my system's capabilities will convince you that your country cannot afford to wait.
Test in a limited area, say...
New York City.
24 hours, quick, clean.
Then we shut it down.
No guns, no police, just information.
What kind of information?
If the NSA provides us with New York City's surveillance feeds, we will find you a terrorist.
You could find me a thousand terrorists, but like I said, we'll never get this through Congress.
And as I told you, dissenting voices would not be a problem.
It's time to remove those obstacles.
Answer your phone, Senator.
How you doing, Garrison?
This is Roger McCourt.
I understand you'll be preparing some legislation.
Is that right?
If you can handle the senate,
I can ensure that the house rules facilitate a quiet passage.
You can do all that?
Absolutely, Senator.
Okay.
Let's...
Do it.
Excellent.
Now if there's anything else you need, just ask.
I'm your man.
Virgil, are we operational?
You're just in time for the ribbon cutting.
Feeds are coming online now.
Commencing beta test.
Okay, we have 24 hours.
Splendid.
Find me Harold Finch.

THE MOST PRECIOUS PRESENT FOR OUR FUHRER
ZAGREB, 21 April, 1941
Written and Directed by SRÐAN KOLJEVIÆ
Good evening.
Dr. Rudolf Zistler, lawyer?
Yes, that is me.
You have to come with us.
Why?
I have an order for your arrest.
May I see it?
This must be a mistake.
What is all this about?
Who are you?
Who issued this order?
Julijana, bring me the winter coat.
Why?
It is April.
Because.
Julijana, please.
Just a moment, please.
Everything will be fine.
I will go to the High Command first thing in the morning.
-Where are you taking him?
-That is classified.
Probably to Kerestinec.
Who issued such an order?
This must be a mistake.
My husband is an Austrian, and I'm a German.
This must be a mistake.
That's what they all say.
I know who gave this order.
Oh my God...
Vanda.
The man in the coat.
So, mister, you're a... merchant?
A lawyer.
Law can't help you anymore.
-I'm Veljko.
-Rudy.
I had a friend once, his name was Veljko.
One of the finest men I knew.
-What did you say your name was?
-Rudy.
-Rudolf Zistler.
-What are you doing here?
This jail is for Serbs, only.
The Jews are overthere.
My name, yes.
It always leads to wrong conclusion.
I'm not a Jew.
-A Communist, then?
-No.
I was a socialist, though.
But I don't believe that this is the reason.
What, then?
Maybe they think that I'm a Jew, maybe that I am an undesirable person.
Maybe it's revenge.
Revenge, for what?
For defending Young Bosnia in 1914.
-Princip?
-Yes.
There were 25 accused.
You knew him?
I'd rather not talk about it now.
Why not?
It is hard for people today to understand that.
Mister...
Tomorrow, they will take us away, God knows where.
To some camp or... something worse.
Who will understand, if not us?
I was an attorney trainee in Sarajevo at the time.
I got my doctor degree in Vienna, I passed my state license exam.
I applied for my own law firm.
It was on St. Vitus Day, 1914.
It was a clear day.
I met with a fellow lawyer Leo Pfeffer, who was investigator judge at the time.
Thanks.
Thank you.
It will be a hellish day.
It's already too hot.
I don't know if it's the heat, but there are no people by the river.
-On the Archduke's route.
-It's Sunday.
The promenade is full of people, but there is no one by the river.
What was that?
I don't know.
It came from there.
Probably the salvo, to salute Ferdinand.
I doubt it.
It came from over there, by the river.
Anyway, have you found the place for your office yet?
This is why I called you.
Maybe you know something about my application?
It's been three weeks now.
Bureaucracy, that's all.
But, I will ask around.
-What happened?
-They threw a bomb at Ferdinand.
This was Èabrinoviæ.
Is he able to answer questions?
I don't know if he has internal injuries.
His mouth and pharynx are burnt.
What did you say?
Cyanide...
Cyanide?
Who are you?
What is your name?
Anarchist.
Did he say anything to you?
He wanted know in which car is the Archduke.
And?
I told him.
Then what?
He thanked me.
-He didn't tell me why!
-Stop it, you fool!
-Anybody else been there?
-Yes.
That tiny Moritz, the mute Jew, the laughing stock.
You'd let him assassinate someone, too!
I said, do not disturb!
Chief, I have orders to inform you that Archduke Franz Ferdinand is a victim of assassination.
We know that, we are questioning the assassin.
No sir, another.
This time, the Archduke was shot.
And the Duchess, too.
Who is he?
Gavrilo Princip, a gymnasium student, age 19.
Son of a peasant, from the village of Obljaj, near Grahovo.
No previous convictions.
-A Serb?
-He says "Serb-Croat".
Yes, yes...
And the other one?
He's 19, too?
Yes, Nedeljko Èabrinoviæ, a graphic worker.
Expelled from Sarajevo for being a socialist.
Now he says that he's an anarchist, I don't know, really.
What do you think about this?
I think that this is a political assassination, like the ones in Zagreb.
Planinšæak, Jukiæ, Šefer...
The youth protests against
"the Austrian oppression of the Slav nations."
Yes.
Instead of going to church, these young men join such... organizations.
Progressive, Serb-Croat, revolutionary, Yugoslav, and what not.
It spreads like a disease.
What a God-awful company.
Antichrists.
Anyway, you will keep me posted about your investigation.
What is it?
Prosecutor, sir,
I will have to question your son, too.
They've seen him minutes before the assassination, walking by the river, with Princip.
They heard them singing...
La Marseillaise.
In the lynching atmosphere, the crowd burnt and looted Serbian property.
Zistler!
Pfeffer... what's going on?
Don't ask.
I got the assassination investigation.
I'm moving the office to the Military prison.
Outside the crowd is out of control.
I know.
My wife had a nervous breakdown.
She saw the crowd raiding the Jovièiæ store, they pulled out their guns.
The doctor told me to send her back to Croatia.
Mr. Ivasiuk!
Why doesn't the police do something about this?
Or the Army?
What can we do?
These are loyal citizens.
-And you will make photographs?
-Yes.
Commissioner Gerde will be pleased, as well as the Vienna and Sarajevo press.
You take photographs for the press?
!
Don't underestimate the press, they are extremely important to us.
Extremely important in this matter.
This is an European scandal and you don't even try to stop this barbarism!
This is a disgrace for this country!
Easy now, Zistler.
Take it easy.
He's just a little upset.
I will do you a favour and forget what I just heard.
You cannot do this.
Understand the moment.
Don't get involved.
If you need me...
here is the pass.
God helps, teacher!
What trouble brings you here?
My God help you.
Great trouble, Mitar.
Call your sons.
Blagoje!
Neðo!
You have to flee to Serbia.
Both you, and your sons.
Remember those schoolboys we led to Tuzla?
A month ago.
The two tiny ones?
With their guns?
Yes.
They killed Franz Ferdinand.
-The Archduke.
-Those two little boys?
It cannot be.
The smaller one, Gavrilo, he did it.
The tiny one?
God help me.
Big letters.
Big picture.
That means, big trouble.
Now what?
We have to flee to Serbia.
I will get you across Drina.
We are not going anywhere.
The Germans will come to arrest.
Soon.
I can't let the harvest go to waste.
Never mind the harvest.
Let me move your sons.
We're not going anywhere without our father.
Either the whole family, or no one.
Why didn't they kill him during the winter?
Why now?
And he tells me he is a son of a peasant.
Think about it.
Until tomorrow.
You should.
You take care of your family.
We'll stay here, see what God has in mind for us.
Mighty Austria, not God, has something in mind for you, and might ignores God.
Something puzzles me, still.
Austria is so mighty, and yet it couldn't keep the Archduke alive.
They let some children execute him.
Think about it!
Those schoolboys are really brave.
Did you tell the Keroviæ family to run?
Yes.
I did, but they won't run.
Veljko, please go.
You can cross the border in an hour.
I can...
But I cannot.
I cannot run, understand me.
I dragged into all this our godfathers, the Keroviæ and the Stepanoviæ family.
If I run now, the peasants will say,
"The teacher can always just pack his things and go to Serbia."
"But we cannot run, we are attached to the soil."
How could any scholar come here and work with the people if I would run now and leave them to suffer?
-I would lose face.
-How about us?
I'm sorry.
Get inside the house.
Do you hate me now?
I love you now, and I will always love you.
Sometimes I'm angry with myself for falling so much in love with you, the way you are.
But I fell in love with you just because of the way you are.
And so on, in circles.
You're trembling.
Let's go inside.
It's cold.
Yes?
What is this?
Police Chief Ivasiuk sends this.
These are lists.
Of all the Serbs detained down here.
If you need to question any of them, you can order.
Like on the menu, the Chief says.
Alright.
Bring Princip.
Get him!
Gavrilo Princip?
When did you decide to assassin the Archduke?
Two years ago.
After Žerajiè attempted his assassination.
Where did you get the weapons?
From a Belgrade Komita.
What did you do in Belgrade?
Finishing the gymnasium.
Did you volunteer for the Balkan Wars?
I tried.
They turned me down.
A reject, then?
Not a single army in the world would take you.
And now you... you!
You kill the greatest military commander of today.
Plus, his wife.
I didn't mean to kill her.
When I saw her in the car, I hesitated for a moment.
I'm sorry I killed her, I didn't mean to.
In the police you said, that you've never seen a pistol in your life until a month ago.
That you couldn't hit a tree, three steps away from you.
And now, you fire two shots.
Both of them killing them almost instantly.
How?
A strange feeling came over me.
And I fired.
Alright... why, then?
Our goal is unification.
Just like in Germany or Italy.
That is what I think and the youth thinks.
But some scum think otherwise.
Unification under Austria-Hungary?
God forbid.
Austria-Hungary will fall apart like a plague.
Pfeffer wrote down...
He was short, scrawny, with a long, pale face.
It was hard to imagine him, so small, shy and quiet, determined to perform such action.
Furthermore... his eyes.
These pale blue eyes were everything but wild, villain eyes.
These eyes were sparkling, piercing, otherwise calm.
Natural intelligence rose from those eyes, as well as calmness and extreme energy.
Have you heard that Ferdinand is coming?
Hamdija, everybody knows that.
We should give him a proper welcome.
-If only we had men to do it.
-We do have men.
-But we don't have the means.
-No?
All we have is excuses.
First Ibro Fazlinoviæ said he'll kill Franz.
And nothing!
After that, Ðulaga Bukovac.
Again nothing!
Hello, my friends.
I hear that you talk about Franz Ferdinand.
He won't live much longer, I guarantee you that.
You think you're a tough Slovenian?
Easy, Hamdija.
Let me introduce you.
This is Ivan Endliher, from the Slovenian National Revival.
Ivo Andriæ, the first President of our Serbo-Croatian Progressive Youth.
Princip, "Gavroche" named after the boy from Hugo's Les Misérables, he was on the front line and was wounded in the student's protests.
Hamdija Nikšiæ from Travnik.
And Viktor Rupèiæ from Sarajevo.
When did you arrive to Sarajevo?
I haven't seen you on the promenade.
Two weeks ago.
I don't go out.
I study for my exam.
Are you prepared?
Not yet, but I try.
-I still keep that.
-What?
Don't pretend you don't know.
I like them.
The poems.
And the small bouquet.
It's not dry?
No, I pressed it and put it in the herbarium.
I read those books you suggested.
I liked most Sherlock Holmes, and the literary magazine, The Bosnian Fairy.
Andriæ wrote for that magazine.
I know.
She has something From my love
Something distant Warm and beautiful
She is like the Sarajevo dusk...
I wrote those verses three years ago while still in gymnasium.
Although, they sounds much better when someone like you tells them.
He is much wiser since he started to study philosophy.
I moved on from Zagreb and Vienna to the Krakow University.
Good for you.
You write poems, too, Gavro.
I know that.
You will go to the University.
-I don't think so.
-Well, I do.
Our dear colleagues!
In the name of the Serbo-Croatian Aid Board for Croatian schools in Istra,
I would like to thank all contributors, for the money, as well for the bingo items.
I also thank the delegates of the progressive youth from Tuzla,
Banja Luka, Mostar, Travnik, and Trebinje, as well as the Slovenian National Revival delegate.
We already surpassed the fundraising goal!
You didn't bring it, again?
Why?
You said you'll show me your poems.
I burned them all.
It's stupid to write poems at this moment of time.
Don't speak like that.
It doesn't have to be stupid.
It depends, Andriæ.
It depends.
I believe that it is time for action.
How do you expect me to believe that you and Princip were not collaborating?
How?
Coincidence?
What?
Maybe Princip planned assassination on his own, and I planned on my own.
Alright.
So, you know Princip?
Do the two of you share the same opinion?
Same ideals?
I don't know about him.
I'm an anarchist.
I don't know about him.
He's more of a Yugoslav nationalist.
Really?
You think that your hat makes you an anarchist?
-I am a true anarchist.
-Like who, for instance?
Like Sinðeliæ.
I have here your father's statement.
He says you stopped him from flying the Austrian flag, by hiding the flag pole.
You also said that next year, King Peter will be here.
-Is that true?
-Yes, it is.
How can you be an anarchist and call for the king?
Not just any king.
King Peter.
Let's move on.
Tell me the name of the third member of yours and Princip's group.
You told everyone, even your maid that you came from Belgrade with two friends.
So, the first one was you, the second one was Princip.
Who was the third man?
If they torture me again, I will say random names.
-Who tortured you?
-The police.
Trifko Grabež was the third man.
The police was already on his tail.
Èabrinoviæ used Trifko's passport when he entered Bosnia, that was the lead.
One day earlier, along with his friend Leposava, the teacher,
Trifko Grabež tried to reach Višegrad.
Those are hostages.
Follow me.
Who is that?
A Serbian teacher.
They brought her here this morning.
The teachers...
every single one of them is a traitor.
Yes?
You have a visitor.
Zistler!
Yes, as you can see, they put me in the garrison pharmacy.
I just wanted to thank you for that favour, with Ivasiuk.
He became a powerful man now, and I was careless.
No problem, that was nothing.
He's bothering me, too.
Yes.
That is what I wanted to tell you.
He is torturing a man called Trifko Grabež.
I'm afraid that he conducts his own investigation.
-Who told you that?
-Theresa, a secretary in the police.
At nights, he tortures Princip and Èabrinoviæ with lapis.
-He interrogates them.
-He can ruin everything.
He obstructs my investigation.
He tortures them until they sign whatever he wants them to sign.
A bunch of false confessions!
He can show results, while I can't.
I thought that...
You are against his methods.
Of course I am.
But no one asks about the methods.
All they want are results.
Alright.
Thank you for the information.
I'll arrange for new passwords every day, he won't be able to drag them out.
Sergeant!
Danilo Iliæ.
You are arrested because Princip lodged in your house.
And you're under suspicion for some time now.
Iliæ...
You are 24, you are not so young and reckless, you can see what's going on.
The police Chief Ivasiuk wants to shoot 200 Serbs from Sarajevo.
Potiorek's Schutzkorps are already on a killing spree.
Iliæ...
I know that you love your nation.
But look...
You know that the tension is great between Austria and Serbia.
You also know that the two of them came from Belgrade.
You also know that an assassination at this moment of time was an extremely foolish act.
You're not a child, like them.
You know what is happening.
Persecution of innocent people.
Those are the consequences.
And what about the political consequences?
Serbia's got nothing to do with this, and you know it.
-How should I know?
-It would be too stupid.
This is a Bosnian matter, not a Serbian matter.
Maybe.
If you tell me everything, maybe you will prove it to me.
I don't understand something.
The ones who had the courage to organize and carry out the assassination,
don't have the courage to take responsibility fortheir actions.
Guards!
Guards!
I want to go to the investigator judge!
Take me to the investigator!
You asked to be confronted with Iliæ.
Tell them everything.
They hurt the righteous.
Innocent people die.
I want to be confronted with Trifko Grabež, too.
He is still with the police.
Only when you confront me with him, I will answer all your questions.
Sit down.
So, Grabež is the third man.
Yes.
Alright.
I was against the assassination, eventually.
I felt that the assassination was a mistake.
Nevertheless, I organized it.
You?
How?
I made all the arrangements.
I found the additional three men.
I brought the weapons from Tuzla.
So, there were six of them?
Six assassins?
!
Yes.
Three more.
Vaso Èubriloviæ,
Cvetko Popoviæ, and Muhamed Mehmedbašiæ.
Trifko Grabež, eighteen years old, high school student.
Where did you hide the bomb?
Why did you turn against your own country?
Not against the country, against the state.
The state is yours, the county is ours.
Sergeant!
I asked for the confrontation.
Tell them everything.
Or innocent people will die.
We all acted on our own free will and we knew the risks.
-Is that all?
-Yes.
Tell me now where you hid the bomb.
We don't want innocent people to get hurt.
I will tell.
After such a spectacular display of devotion and commitment,
Pfeffer was certain that no one could take the investigation away from him.
I was still going to Pfeffer to ask about my attorney license.
That was the second time I saw Jovanka Èubriloviæ.
I was glad to see that she was not a hostage anymore, but I couldn't imagine what lied ahead of her.
There she is.
Come in.
What do you want?
My name is Jovanka Èubriloviæ, I am a teacher.
I am the wife of the arrested Veljko Èubriloviæ, the teacher from Priboj.
They say I'm allowed one visit, but you have to sign the permit.
What are you doing in Sarajevo?
I came to be with my husband.
I was arrested as a hostage and released.
You cannot obtain a permit before the end of all interrogations.
Can I leave this letter and the photo of the baby here for him?
We cannot show compassion for the assassins!
Go away.
Wait!
What is your Sarajevo address?
Oprkanj Street, 6.
Pfeffer decided to finish the investigation with confrontations.
Did Iliæ try to talk you out of the assassination?
-Yes, he did.
-Really?
And yet, he obtained the bombs.
Murat, take them away.
Veljko Èubriloviæ!
The three of you are in a much worse position than these kids.
You are not underage.
Never mind.
We are humans.
-Don't you worry about us.
-Quiet!
Miško Jovanoviæ, Veljko Èubriloviæ.
Are you Serbian National Defence commissioners?
Yes, we are.
So what?
Do you know Ciganoviæ and Tankosiæ?
Tankosiæ is a famous Komita from the Balkan Wars.
I don't know him personally.
Èubriloviæ... you're a teacher.
Your duty is to teach and educate your nation, not to assassinate people.
You can speak like that because you've got your state.
When we make our state and gain our freedom,
I will demonstrate my patriotism through my profession.
Yes...
Sign your statements.
Before you go, you should know this...
we arrested your brother Vaso.
Vaso?
He's just a child.
-What he's got to do with this?
-You don't know?
He was one of the six other men who planned the assassination.
-Murat, take them away!
-Let's go.
Pfeffer had only two names.
Ciganoviæ and Tankosiæ.
Nevertheless, on 23 July, Austria sends an ultimatum to Serbia.
Two days of suspense followed.
The ultimatum was written with the intent to be unacceptable.
Pfeffer paid a visit to me that very day.
The indictment against Serbia was drafted beforehand.
That was all they were interested in.
All my work... for nothing.
Not even a commendation.
I thought that someone would appreciate my work.
Yes, but we could expect this.
Ever since the annexation, Conrad looked for an excuse to declare war on Serbia.
But we are Rechtsstaat, a state of justice.
I don't understand one thing.
How did they manage to stop the car right in front of Princip?
Two shots... both, deadly.
Like some kind of... witchcraft.
Or maybe the fact that there were only 14 policemen there.
When Franz Joseph came here, the Army was there, plus 200 agents.
As if someone from Vienna deliberately sent Ferdinand on this trip.
Whatever.
I came to tell you that I recommended you to be appointed by the court as a defence lawyer.
This will open the way for you to obtain the license.
Thank you.
The trial will be held within two months from now.
By that time, the war will be over, and Serbia will be crushed.
Thank you, again.
Serbia accepted all of the terms of the ultimatum except a part in point 6 hat Austrian police be allowed to operate in Serbia.
Austria declared war.
The court appointed four defence lawyers, ex officio.
Premužiæ, a radical Croat nationalist, full of himself.
Perišiæ, also a Croat, a young lawyer with political ambitions.
Wenzel Malek.
A Czech, a court clerk, frightened and nervous.
And me.
As you know, gentlemen, we are here to put on trial Gavrilo Princip and his 24 friends.
The prosecution will be represented by
Mr. Franjo Svara and the investigator judge Pfeffer.
Gentlemen, you are appointed ex officio as defence lawyers as a formality.
I am sure that you are disgusted by the task that lies ahead of you.
Because this is not an ordinary trial.
However, this is a state of justice, and we have to follow the formalities.
Mr. Pfeffer will distribute the indictment.
You will also get the list of defendants appointed to each of you.
There are 25 accused men.
That is all.
Mr. Curinaldi, please release me from this, I'm just a court clerk.
And my doctor said my heart is too weak.
When I look at the papers, the threats, the pressure.
-I am just a foreigner here.
-You are at least a state clerk.
What about us, lawyers, who waste ourtime for free?
Malek, that's enough.
This is settled.
Mr. Curinaldi, I request to see the investigation files.
Dr. Zistler...
I believe that you still do not have a permanent license for work?
You will see the investigating files in due time.
What do you mean?
The trial is in two weeks.
I need the files now.
That would be all.
You are obliged by law to give me that, and I am obliged by law to prepare the best defence for my clients.
That would be all.
You will cool down and think about everything.
And I will help you.
My name is Jovanka Èubriloviæ, the wife of the accused Veljko Èubriloviæ.
Please, come in.
Veljko has sent me here.
He said that you are appointed as the defence lawyer.
It is not official yet.
Please, have a seat.
I don't want to get it all wet.
It was you... there, in the barracks.
In the military prison.
Yes.
I was going to a fellow lawyer Pfeffer.
I was there by chance.
It was easier there.
After that I spent five weeks in detention.
Why?
By the order of the investigator judge...
Pfeffer.
That's impossible.
I don't believe that.
Please, take that coat off and worm up a little.
Please.
I have to tell you that we don't have money.
You don't need it.
I was appointed by the court.
But why do you accept to defend enemies of Austria?
-What is your intention?
-The court decides about this.
But what do you aim to accomplish?
To play the role you were given?
To build a career over our ordeal?
Or you are driven by professional ambition and arrogance and we are expendable.
Cannon fodder.
Does this low opinion come from you, or from Veljko?
Veljko says he heard that you are a good and honest man.
But then, Veljko believes that all men are good.
I'm sorry, but...
After all I've been through, what can I expect from a man called Rudolf Zistler?
My name, yes...
It always leads to wrong conclusion.
Please, have a seat.
Never judge a man by his name.
Prejudices are a bad guideline.
Prejudices emerge from bad experience.
Austria and Serbia are at war.
What can I expect?
I will follow the law.
I will do my best.
By doing this, I will fight for the only thing that is good in this state.
I must tell you something else.
I don't think that Veljko will be willing to show remorse in this court.
Even if he does feel remorse.
This will make the defence much more difficult.
Try to understand him.
To understand us.
Believe me, I try.
I can give you these earrings as a fee.
That's what is left.
Veljko's father brought this from Paris, from the World Fair.
No, I told you.
I cannot accept this.
It is still soaking wet.
My bridesmaid Ljubica would like to hire you to defend Miško Jovanoviæ.
She has money.
But I'm still not a licenesed lawyer, so... but I'll ask.
Do you believe that you can save Veljko from death?
I do.
I do believe.
I made a beginner's mistake.
I gave her hope.
A made a promise I was not sure I could keep.
No, Veljko, don't!
Shut up, you nitwit!
I'll beat you up, once I get my hands on you!
What have you done?
What?
The same as you.
-I wanted to kill him.
-You?
How can you kill anyone, you numskull!
You don't know a thing!
Don't you say a word about it!
And I paid for your schooling in Sarajevo...
What about the failed math exam?
What about that?
That's enough!
Yes?
He's my brother.
Let us be.
It's too late for smacking now.
I can do it myself.
That was the first time I saw him.
He looked me straight in the eye.
It was a photo of a troubled boy with narrow shoulders.
The coat was too large for him, and his eyes were deep-set.
It was the photo that went around the world.
Oh, Dr. Zistler, you are the first one to visit his defendants.
Devoted to work.
I take photos, again.
This is the specimen.
This is Princip.
I waited for their beards to grow, now they look like werewolves.
It is effective.
They will be werewolves for us, too.
Yes.
I can see that you are a passionate photographer.
You understand me, because you are a man of the new age, just like me.
Photography and press can be much more effective than sheer force.
-And cheaper than police, right?
-Yes.
May I speak with my client now, please?
Of course.
I will soon be over.
Guard...
show lawyer Zistler the way.
I refused a lawyer.
I am Veljko Èubriloviæ's defending lawyer.
But I wanted to speak with you.
Help Veljko, if you can.
He's got no blood on his hands.
He is just an honourable man.
I've got nothing else to say to you.
I will try to defend all of you.
I don't need defence.
I don't want to defend myself.
I would've never started this if I wasn't prepared to die.
-Anyway, I would like to...
-No!
Take care.
Be careful what you do.
You could lose your life.
Come on!
I told them all to say everything.
I don't want the righteous to suffer.
You are not righteous?
I am the avenger.
Hurry up!
You are the righteous one.
Everything turned into misfortune.
The time was not right.
I wanted first to build a revolutionary organization.
Not like this.
See what is happening?
Everywhere, we just die.
The war...
the camps, the hangings.
We didn't want people to die.
I heard about you, from the older socialists in the printing shop.
You delivered a speech on a worker's convention, back in 1908.
You understand!
I am a Sarajevo native.
A foreigner, a German expelled me from Sarajevo fortaking part in a strike.
If I only had a revolver,
I'd fire all six shots at him!
Princip and the others thought that I was not serious.
But I was the first to throw the bomb!
The judge said you could see only your clients, not all the accused.
Good luck.
That teacher of yours...
He's the worst of them all.
Murat the Sultan, is it you?
If I don't see you, I don't feel well.
Every day, he just babbles like this.
It's been a while since I shook hands with someone.
You've got a strong grip.
-You're not a weakling.
-Neither are you.
-I heard all the best about you.
-How come?
We've got the shackles alphabet.
We tap on the wall.
The schoolboys learnt it from the Russian books.
From the anarchists.
It is convenient, but pray that you'll never need it.
Have a seat.
It's a pity I cannot offer you a drink, to celebrate.
-What would you celebrate?
-My daughter's first birthday.
Well... at least I got to be with her for a couple of months.
But my best man Miško just had a daughter.
Will he ever see her?
Who will be her godfather when they hang me?
Maybe you, as my lawyer?
I don't understand your humour at all.
I came to defend you.
Hope is the mother of fools.
There is not much time, we have to go through the indictment.
Pack this up.
No use.
You've got a wife and a child.
Did you come here just to rub in my trouble?
No, I came here to help.
And I think I can do that.
Don't give me false hope.
Not to me, not to Jovanka.
Unless you really mean what you say.
I say what I mean.
And this is not false hope.
-Is that so?
-Yes, it is.
Alright.
Alright.
I'm sorry, I arrange things in my head, to make it easier for me, and so...
Leave the papers.
I will study them later.
But...
What about the war?
How is Serbia doing?
And the Allies?
You're doing well.
Serbia is putting up a good fight.
After Cer, Potiorek's army was thrown away, back here.
On this side of the Drina river.
-I'm sorry, I forgot you were...
-I'm a lawyer.
My patriotism is social.
All the states are same to me, as long as they follow justice.
Without justice what else is the state but a great band of robbers?
Not my words.
That was St. Augustine.
For my wife.
Please.
I know it's odd.
Secret letters between husband and wife.
Doctor...
The time is up.
This is the only thing I entirely understand.
I am glad you defend us.
Because of my kid brother, Vaso.
Shut up.
Although we were completely different,
I felt strangely close to Veljko.
The circumstances gave us somewhat similar roles to play.
But at the moment, I was not yet aware of that.
Hello.
Dr. Zistler!
From Veljko.
Come in, please!
-I'd rather not...
-Please!
Please, come in.
I'm sorry.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
Please, take some.
-No, thanks.
-Please.
It's her birthday, and I didn't bring her anything.
You brought a letter from Veljko.
That is the greatest present of all.
Thank you.
I'm sorry for being so rude the last time we met.
Can I tell Ljubica that you will defend Miško?
No, unfortunately.
He is assigned to Premožiæ.
He is a lawyer, while I'm still a candidate of law.
-He is a Croat nationalist.
-Yes, but...
Tell her that I will try to defend all the accused.
I still don't know how, but believe me.
They say that the verdicts are already written down.
That the trial will be just a show.
Let me tell you something.
Austria is a state of justice.
The inscription on the Vienna palace says
"Justice is the foundation of kingdoms."
I remember.
"Justitia Fundamentum Regnorum."
I lived in St. Pölten, near Vienna.
My aunt is married to a retired Austrian officer.
But, you know...
being a Serbian teacher from Bosnia...
It is not easy for me to believe in an inscription on a Vienna palace.
Yes, but this is the 20th century.
Europe.
I understand you.
You are an attorney of law.
I spent five weeks in detention, separated from my child.
This offends you, since you believe in law, but I'm just tormented by...
Love.
-Good bye.
-Good bye.
I was desperate.
I had to think of a defence.
I didn't know where to start.
I couldn't count on any help from my rebellious defenders.
They didn't even think of mitigate their deed or their role in it.
Never again was I in a situation like that.
Austria's justice system has already been shaken.
The power that held it together has been worn out.
I knew that.
But I didn't know how to use it in my case.
And then, it dawned upon me.
Bosnia!
Bosnia was everybody's and nobody's.
It is a cursed country.
Everyone claimed it, but all they got from it was death, war and calamity.
In the Monarchy, Bosnia was the apple of discord between Austria and Hungary.
This led to a crack in the Austrian law.
Just like the beech peg my father used for breaking massive stones.
Once soaked in water, that small peace of wood cracks even the largest stone.
My defence will be based on that.
I see him!
There he is!
I'm here!
Goddamn Komitas!
They ruined my photo of the century!
Take your clothes off.
Don't just stand there!
Take it off!
From the very first day, they made the accused take all their clothes off.
They kept them standing in a cold room, allegedly to inspect their clothes, although they brought them from a nearby military prison.
-Are you alright?
-I've seen better days.
-Have they let anyone of the family in?
-Only the once with the pass.
Gentlemen of the press, you may take notes, but at the end of each day you will get an official statement.
That is all you are allowed to print.
That is the decision of this court.
Do you understand?
-Don't treat them like that.
-They are my clients.
-This is not an ordinary trial.
-I see that.
With bayonettes.
Get up on your feet!
Come on!
I announce the start of the hearing against Gavrilo Princip and others, for the crime of high treason!
The President of the Court is Alois von Curinaldi.
Gavrilo Princip.
Present.
Approach the bench.
-Age?
-Nineteen.
-Born?
-Grahovo, the village of Obljaj.
-Faith?
-Serbian Orthodox.
-Any previous convictions?
-No.
Do you consider yourself guilty?
I am not a criminal, because I eliminated the one who did evil.
My intentions were good.
Order.
Order!
What about Duchess Sophie?
I didn't mean to kill her.
I wanted to kill Potiorek.
Order in the courtroom!
He gives the cue to everyone.
The rest of them follow.
Order!
Order.
What is your political ideology?
I am a Yugoslav nationalist.
I strive for the unification of all South Slavs in whatever form of state.
-And to be free from Austria.
-Hear, hear!
How did you think to realize it?
To kill from above.
To eliminate those who do evil, who stand in the way of unification.
And this is how you wanted to realize all your objectives?
Another motive was revenge for all torments Austria imposed upon us.
So...
You shot with the intent to kill the Archduke?
Yes.
In general he did evil to all things.
He started "special measures" against the Serbs here, and the high treason trial against the 53 Serbs in Zagreb.
Hear, hear!
The high treason trial cannot be evil.
It's nothing but evil!
It results in the suffering of the people.
Order.
Order in the courtroom!
Lead all the accused out except Princip.
Get out!
They could might as well put us on trial while we are away.
They can just inform us about the result.
You are right about that.
Of what do the sufferings of the people consist?
They are completely impoverished.
They are treated like cattle.
The peasant is impoverished.
They destroy him completely.
I am a peasant's son.
I know that.
That is why I wanted to take revenge.
And I don't feel sorry for that.
During the investigation, you said, that the schoolboys are enthusiastic about the idea of unification?
But we differ in the ways of realizing those ideas.
I demonstrated my way.
Also, you said,
"that the mission of Serbia is to help the unification."
Serbia as the free part of the South Slavs.
As the Piedmont was to Italy.
Do you know that in 1908, after the annexation of Bosnia,
Austria almost went into war against Serbia?
I know.
You thought that bringing weapons from Serbia will not bring consequences?
Serbia cannot be responsible if private individuals have weapons.
I conclude the hearing of Princip.
I rode from Tobut.
A peasant jumps in front of me.
He says that some schoolboys are looking for me.
And...?
They want me to take them to Miško in Tuzla.
They carry cyanide, to poison themselves after the assassination.
I took them to Keroviæ house to spend the night there.
Tomorrow, they will take them to Tuzla.
They are sleeping now.
I look at their young heads.
One of them...
Trifko is his name, black curly hair, a handsome lad.
They are going to sacrifice their lives.
I was disgusted with our safe, calculated life.
Shame on you!
We live a modest, hard working and dedicated life.
You are wanted by the police.
How can you speak like that?
Èabrinoviæ, did you share the same ideas as Princip?
Not on all counts.
I am an anarchist socialist.
My ideal was a South Slav republic.
All I wanted was for King Peter to remain a king while he lives.
After that, to create a Yugoslav republic.
What was the cause of quarrel between you, Princip and Grabež in Koviljaèa?
I drew the maps and on one, I wrote down these verses,
"River Drina, the border between Bosnia and Serbia,
Soon, the time will come When I will cross this river,
And I will reach Bosnia."
Karaðorðe wrote that.
Princip was annoyed by my casual behaviour and we didn't speak.
They took the weapons from me sent me away with Trifko's passport.
Who initiated the assassination?
-I am.
-I was first.
I got the news that Ferdinand is coming!
Order!
Both of you initiated.
Please!
Is Tankosiæ, who gave you the weapons, maybe a freemason?
Yes, he is.
Both him and Ciganoviæ.
Are you a member of a freemason lodge?
I cannot answer that.
Do freemasons recommend assassinations of rulers?
Yes!
Ciganoviæ said that the freemasons sentenced Ferdinand to death two years ago.
And...
The court is adjourned for a 10 minute recess.
The investigation doesn't mention this at all.
Don't you see that Èabrinoviæ made this up?
He saw that we want to involve Serbia, he picked it up and went on.
He is mocking us?
They asked for it.
When I saw the effect...
like a bomb.
The Komitas are our only hope.
They will take on us the defeat at Cer.
This war won't last for long.
Both of us got daughters.
They say, when girls are being born, the war stops.
Veljko...
Come here.
For a moment.
From now on, your life is at stake, and the life of your wife and child.
You will say that you acted under threat.
Please.
Princip said so, anyway.
I acted under threat?
From that skinny Princip?
Alright.
Trifko Grabež.
-Age?
-Eighteen.
What did you have against the heir presumptive?
He brought all evils on Bosnia.
He was the demon for the Slavs.
As a German, he was against the grand idea of Yugoslavia.
Many Slavs fight for Austria.
When Slavs fight for Austria, they are ignorant crowd.
Let this be noted please, I will raise charges for this.
You considered him a great military leader, and you feared him in case of war against Serbia?
I wasn't afraid of him.
I didn't have Serbia in mind, only Bosnia.
If I knew that this will lead to a European war,
I would've never taken part in the assassination.
Is your ideal too, the unification of South Slavs?
Yes, it is.
And solely in the Karaðorðeviæ manner.
Under the name of one Yugoslavia, a republic, or a federative republic.
Among the three of you why did you go to Tankosiæ to pick up the weapons?
Princip is too small.
Èabrinoviæ laughs even in the most serious situations.
His face features are not strong.
That is why I went there.
When I arrived, he asked,
"Are you one of them?"
"Are you determined?" I am.
"Do you know how to shoot?" I don't.
"How do you plan to do it?" To use a revolver.
Yes.
-Alright.
Sit down.
-Please.
-I have a question.
-Proceed.
Did you know that among you will be Muhamed Mehmedbašiæ, a Muslim?
I didn't know.
-Were you surprised?
-No, I wasn't.
-Were you glad?
-Yes, I was.
Why?
Because this is matter of whole Bosnia, not just Serbs.
Zistler, questioning in this direction is not in concord with the charges.
But the indictment insists on ties with Serbia...
The court finds irrelevant further questioning in this direction.
Sit down.
If I remember well, he is your protégé.
-He was.
-Sit down.
I conclude the hearing of Grabež.
Next...
Danilo Iliæ.
You were in Serbia during the Balkan War?
-You were a volunteer?
-Yes, a medic.
Education Minister Jovanoviæ, said that the schoolboys were more valuable alive.
You gave the revolvers to Vaso Èubriloviæ and Cvetko Popoviæ?
You fired at a wall and said,
"Where this bullet hits, no one will be alive."
"Where this hits, no remedy will be needed."
Njegoš.
And so it was.
Yes?
Princip and Grabež...
Is it true that Iliæ tried to talk you out of the assassination?
Yes.
He said that the consequences will be bad.
That it is not the time yet.
He thought that he managed to persuade me not to take part in it.
I figured that the others were not ready, so I tried to talk them out.
You may sit down.
Miško Jovanoviæ.
You own a cinema theatre.
You are the president of "Soko" in Tuzla.
Member of the Serbian Bank board, and yet you keep bombs in the attic.
Then Iliæ came for the bombs.
You are a wealthy man.
You earned your wealth under Austria, and had a good life?
Yes.
You are a German student, you speak German.
Why did you do all this?
Why did you become a commissioner of National Defence, a Serbian association?
In Germany, I saw that associations helping their respective nations.
That is especially the duty of educated and wealthy citizens.
Some wealthy Serbian merchants swore their allegiance to Austria-Hungary.
Ask them about that.
I was educated in Germany and this is what I know.
Sit down.
Veljko Èubriloviè.
You are a teacher in Priboj, on the Majevica river.
Did you write for the Serbian Academy about the geography of your area and about the Serbian population?
Yes.
That way, whole Serbia is covered.
Is Serbia...
every place where Serbs live?
It is not the Serbian state.
Did you say to the peasants that the schoolboys risk their lives for you, Serbs?
Yes, I did.
You said that the Bosnian Serbs are one nation with the Serbs across the border?
We are one nation.
We speak the same language.
Yes, Zistler?
You are married.
Was this a marriage out of love?
-Yes.
-Did you take any dowry?
No.
After four years of marriage, last year you finally had a daughter.
Were you happy?
Yes.
Princip says he threatened you.
That you took him under threat.
You knew that you and your family will die if you don't obey him.
Please Zistler, only questions.
Why did you sacrifice your personal and marital happiness?
-Were you afraid of something?
-I was afraid of the threats.
I didn't want my family destroyed.
But now you are not afraid?
I risk only my own life now, and not my family.
Why didn't you defend yourself in this manner earlier?
I couldn't.
I was afraid.
How could you be afraid of this Princip?
And Grabež?
They are just schoolboys.
I wasn't afraid of Princip and Grabež.
I was afraid of schoolboys who carried weapons and bombs.
Did you say to them that you were against violence?
Yes...
I did say that.
I said that I don't believe in assassinations and revolutions.
That all they do is leave blood traces behind.
I said that I believe in the evolution of souls and thought.
Court is adjourned.
We will hear the rest of them tomorrow.
Sit down.
How was I?
I saw how much you hope to save me, so I started to hope myself.
Good, very good.
Hope is the best ally.
-The only one.
-Not the only one.
You've got law and me on your side, too.
Look... tomorrow, I've got Vaso.
Please, try to reason with him.
My Vaso...
He is the youngest schoolboy and the greatest fool of them all!
Look at this...
Some intestines... not boiled.
Faeces all over..
look.
Come on, now...
Under every government, we get quickly used to eat shit.
Let me tell you this.
Whoever laid his ass on Bosnia, went bust.
So will the Germans.
I'm sorry, nothing personal.
It's alright.
Why do they insist on high treason through Great Serbia propaganda, and the Yugoslav idea?
What about the assassination, the murder?
Because of politics.
They want to justify the war.
And because of you.
Why me?
They altered the charges so they could convict more people and more severely.
They cannot deliver a death sentence for assassination.
All three of them are under age.
You and the others are just accomplices.
This is why they manufacture high treason.
As if we are accused for our ideas, not for the assassination.
This is why the charges are unsupported.
I will overturn high treason.
My defence will be based on that.
Take care.
That's my job.
I've got my principles.
You're a strange man, my doctor.
If you can...
Bring some tobacco from Jovanka.
And a photo of the child.
If you can.
Talk to her.
The way only you can talk.
Let her believe... give her hope.
Don't worry.
She is a brave woman.
Much more than you think.
But the next day, on the second day of the trial,
I saw the true passion of the younger assassins.
I saw Vaso Èubriloviæ.
A peasant from Kreševo he was going back home, it was about nine in the evening.
Suddenly the road was so brightly lit that you could thread a needle.
He looked at the skies, and he saw a flying ball.
Suddenly, a branch stretched out of the ball, and a Serbian flag waved on the branch.
At that moment, he saw another ball flying from the other side.
A branch stretched out of the ball, and a Croatian flag waved on the branch.
This is where the miracle starts.
The flags came closer and four times entangled with each other.
They were intertwined.
Then they split and went to the Moon.
First the Serbian, then the Croatian flag enveloped the Moon.
The peasant testified under oath.
Many other men from the same county confirmed this.
And even a guard from the Zavidoviæ valley, at exactly the same moment
he saw both flags enveloping the Moon.
He saw the end of the occurrence.
That was in March.
It was in all the papers.
And you, Germans were frightened, because it was officially confirmed.
Sit down.
Ivo Kranjèeviæ.
This Vaso Èubriloviæ gave you weapons to hide?
Yes.
You are a Croat?
-What is your political ideology?
-I am a nationalist.
-Meaning what?
-Harmony between Serbs and Croats.
You knew about the assassination.
-Why didn't you report it?
-I didn't report...
Because we have to protest against German influence that is killing us.
All the persecutions against the Slavs come from Germany.
Where are the persecutions?
High treason trials in Sarajevo, in Zagreb, in Ukraine.
During the investigation, you said, you didn't report because nobody will ever speak with you again.
What did Vaso Èubriloviæ say?
He said that Serbia is a free country.
That King Peter associates with the people, he speaks informally, and that everything is much more nicer than here, where everything is... stiff.
Sit down.
Cvetko Popoviæ.
You were a good student?
-One of the best?
-Yes.
Always.
And?
Were you misled?
Do you feel sorry?
I feel sorry for her.
I don't feel sorry for him.
I was determined to assassin him, too.
Sit down.
Yes?
Vaso Èubriloviæ.
You didn't fire a shot.
And yet, you told everyone that you did.
Why?
I was joking.
Just bragging around.
But you quit earlier because you felt sorry for the Archduke.
I didn't feel sorry for him, and I didn't quit.
I felt sorry for her.
This is why I didn't pull out the gun.
Have you ever fired a shot from a gun?
I haven't.
But that's not so hard.
You said you failed your math exam.
That you wanted to end your life, and that is when you decided to assassin the Archduke?
Yes.
But another motive was the pulling down of Serb and Croat flags at Ilidža.
Did Perin mock with you saying, "This is the man who will kill Ferdinand"?
Yes, but what does he know?
Do you feel sorry for the Archduke as a human being?
I can feel sorry for him as a man, but not as the heir of the Austria-Hungarian throne.
I can feel sorry for millions of our peasants, and millions of others who die all over Europe.
Court is adjourned.
We will continue tomorrow at nine o'clock.
You don't need to be so keen.
There are already too many comments.
I told you this is not an ordinary trial.
I can see that.
Is this an official report from the trial?
SERBlA GULTY - assassins linked to the Serbian government
This is not the report I sent, and it has nothing to do with me.
This is bigger than you and me both.
-Do you understand?
-I understand.
The photo wouldn't be ready before tomorrow.
I know that Veljko asked for the package because of the photo.
I don't think this is good enough.
Don't worry, I've got the old photo, the only one with all of us together.
You are doing a strange thing.
I'm sorry, but...
When I look at you, I feel as if you are my friend.
I have to remind myself about the wall that stands between us.
If it wasn't like this, we could be friends, that's for sure.
No use, I need more time.
I know that you're taking a great risk with the package and I appreciate it very much.
I would like for you to know that.
I know that this is against the rules you like to follow.
It's not like that.
I don't see it that way.
They never taught you this in German school.
Prejudices again.
I'm sorry.
Again.
What an incredible set of coincidences.
The assassination didn't fail, Princip's shot...
Many hands held Princip's hand.
Millions of them, impoverished, humiliated, downgraded.
Poor peasants, enslaved Slavs.
Millions.
There was no way he could fail.
You really believe that?
And you?
What do you believe in?
I don't know anymore.
Not good?
On the contrary, it's beautiful.
I feel ashamed for my prejudice against you.
I should go now.
Tell me openly, what are Veljko's chances?
Good.
From the legal point of view, good.
I think that the law and the court can't go along with the press and the war.
Thank you.
You are a good man, but...
I don't know.
That is St. George.
The victor, our patron saint, the warrior.
He slays the dragon.
Straight through the jaws.
-Good bye.
-Good bye.
I almost lost hope that you'd come.
Did you bring it?
The photo is not ready yet.
But I have the old one.
I'm sorry about Vaso.
He didn't listen to you.
Schoolboys...
They want to be like grown-ups.
I'm sorry I got involved.
Only the schoolboys should've done this.
So you are sorry, after all.
Of course.
I'd be more useful with a rifle.
I know Majevica like the back of my hand.
I thought you dream about freedom, but you...
You'd rather kill the Germans on Majevica.
Don't you think that's freedom?
-Who gave you this?
-Murat.
No, the lawyer smuggled it in!
No, Murat, it was you.
Confess Murat, you'll feel better.
Shut up.
Murat, confess.
Did you smuggle a package for the accused Veljko Èubriloviæ?
-Yes.
-Nice!
Nice of you to confess.
You know that I will have to take disciplinary action against you?
Zistler, how can you be so close with a traitor who will be hanged soon?
You're a judge, how can you say that to a defence lawyer, before the trial ends?
Maybe you will have to set him free in the end.
Alright.
You are dismissed.
Go, we have to start.
Mitar Keroviæ.
Are you guilty?
God willing, I'm not.
Do you think that you are guilty?
Sir, I don't know.
How should I know that?
The law and you know that.
Alright.
The schoolboys arrive at your home, with bombs.
You must have thought that this was something bad.
How can I think at all when smart men work?
Smart men, with bombs?
Anyone who wears a city suit, just like the one you wear, must be some kind of an official.
Alright.
-What did they say?
-They said...
They risk their lives for us, Serbs, and...
And?
That's about all.
-What else?
-I don't know.
I was drunk.
How much did you drink?
How much?
My good sir, I drink way too much.
I started at noon, with the men working on my barn.
Then I drank from the flask, as much as I could.
Sit down.
Thank you.
This concludes the hearings.
We commence with the evidentiary proceeding.
We start with the witnesses accounts.
Witness number 16.
Count Harrach's statement.
"On the curve to Franz Joseph Street, I saw the first car going there.
I warned the driver not to follow him, because the route was changed.
I stood on the running board to protect the high couple from shots.
But when the car stopped, the shots were fired from the other side.
Immediately after that, the Duchess fell into the lap of the Archduke.
He said to her, "Sophie, don't die.
Stay alive for the children."
I asked the Archduke if he was in pain.
He answered me, "It is nothing!"
He went on repeating, six or seven times, ever more faintly,
"It's nothing."
When we reached the residence, he died.
Afew minutes later, she died, too."
Princip.
Did this statement make any impression on you?
I'm not a beast.
But you don't feel guilty.
No.
Doctor...
I'm sorry about the troubles with the package.
Is this your last visit?
Yes.
I am not allowed to visit you after the statement of defence.
I wanted to ask for one more favour.
-This time it is not dangerous.
-What is it?
Don't get angry, please.
But I believe that they will sentence me to death tomorrow.
No, no.
I saw the way they look at me.
So, I thought...
If you can arrange that my coat goes to Vaso.
He hasn't got one, and the nights are cold.
How can you speak like that to me?
Tomorrow I have to defend you.
They want heads to roll, and mine is at hand.
You think that justice can do something about it?
Veljko, this is not Turkey!
Don't you see that they made their minds up?
We have to be ready to die, anyway.
Such are the times...
we are helpless.
We just have to act our roles.
-Veljko.
-Please, don't be foolish.
Don't get in deeper trouble because of us... because of me.
Princip was right to refuse a lawyer.
Shame on you!
How dare you speak to me like that?
After all I've done, all I get is ingratitude and contempt!
Doctor...
Now you act just like one of us.
You're pursuing justice where there is none.
You're flogging a dead horse.
You want to sacrifice yourself for the lost cause.
Let me explain.
If there will be no more people who see the law as I see it, we'll have permanent wars, and people like you will die in those wars!
Don't be angry with me.
I look at you and I think to myself...
If only Jovanka could find someone brave and honest.
Someone like you.
Even if...
Even if he's a German.
There.
Take care.
Murat, where are you?
The coat...
don't forget about it.
Let us hear now the argument of the defence, Dr. Zistler.
Gentlemen.
This trial is being held in a historic and a fateful moment.
The entire Europe is dragged into a whirlpool of blood.
We hear the rattling of weapons here, we see the wounded.
Our entire public life, the entire press it boils with hatred towards the assassin and his nation.
They all yell, "Kill them!
Hang them!"
At this moment, when the crowds are angry, when throwing stones at them is not a bad thing, but a patriotic act, we, the defence, must strive to a just verdict,
based entirely on law.
A big and a defining task lies before you too, honourable judges.
You have to be deaf to the shouting from the street.
The court must stay isolated from politics and its opportunism, which acts only according to the current political needs.
Because you are the priests of that blind-folded goddess holding a sward in one hand and a set of scales in the other.
She made all people equal before the law.
Let's see what has happened here.
The royal couple falls victim to the assassination, and yet this murder, legally speaking, is just another murder.
According to our law, the heir of the throne is equal to the others.
And yet, the prosecutor's office charged them for high treason by assassination.
Another high treason trial.
It has become a chronic disease here!
Note this down, please.
It is regrettable, but since 1848, we have to recognize the process of forming national states and...
Please, do not go in that direction, stick to the main hearing.
The Serb nationalism is related to the national states in Europe.
I warn you again, stick to the subject of the main hearing, or you will sit down, and I will press charges.
Honourable judges,
I will make an assertion that at first glance might seem... bold.
Maybe even absurd.
But it is a firm fact.
I assert that the effort to break away Bosnia Herzegovina from the Austria-Hungary as the prosecution incriminates, according to our law,
is not an act of high treason, and is not a punishable offence at all.
I will explain!
According to the Treaty of Berlin, signed in 1878,
Austria-Hungary occupies Bosnia Herzegovina.
With the proclamation in 1908,
Bosnia was annexed.
Despite that, legally speaking,
Bosnia was not incorporated into Austria-Hungary because there is no legal approval from both parts of the Monarchy.
The motions have been filed in the Vienna and Pest Parliaments but until this day were not adopted.
Therefore, the relations between Bosnia HerzegovinaandAustria-Hungary stand on factual grounds, but not legal grounds!
They enjoy the protection of power, but not the protection of law.
Annexation is an illegal condition.
I am not alone in this.
The Vienna Professor, Dr. Finger, says the same.
So, you cannot construct the accusation for high treason for plotting against annexation, because it is an illegal condition.
Any verdict that would accept the charge under section 112, would not be based on law, but on force.
This would mark the self-destruction of Austria-Hungary as a state of justice!
Since the defence lawyer has violated the legislation under section 245, I issue a reprimand.
And under section 245, point two,
I warn him, if he continues to behave like this, I will silence him, and call on clients to find a new defence lawyer.
I just wanted to say that our law has some flaws, but the court is obliged to judge by that very law.
Next, I refuse the mention of various Serb associations, to illustrate some alleged high treason.
This has nothing to do with the incriminating act, the assassination.
In the case of my defendant Veljko Èubriloviæ, this is obvious.
Veljko Èubriloviæ was an excellent high school student.
After the death of his parents, he was the oldest member of the family.
Instead of going to the University, he sacrificed himself for the family and became a teacher to earn his daily bread.
With his poor salary, he supported four children.
Finally, he married out of love, with no dowry at all.
In search for income, he started doing science work.
He explored ancient Serbian elements in Bosnia.
He didn't do that for some dangerous political party in Belgrade.
He did for the Geography Department of the Serbian Academy!
This has become an act of high treason!
Regarding your doubt about Veljko taking Princip under threat,
I believe that you too, must be impressed by the stoic calm Princip demonstrated all these days.
Regarding Princip and his age,
I inform you that there is a list of newborns, made by priest Bilbija and according to that, Princip was not yet 20 in time of the assassination.
The Orthodox priest are well-known traitors.
Many of them were shot these days.
Princip is not your client.
That was all, with regard to him.
Next.
My client is Vaso Èubriloviæ.
He is just 17.
His wish to assassin the Archduke was a desperate act.
He failed the math exam.
But he didn't do it.
His "enemy" ideas are real not more than Plato's Republic.
So...
The Prosecutor calls for death penalty for all adult defendants, including my client, Veljko Èubriloviæ.
I am against the death penalty as a barbarian institution based on revenge and we heard the prosecutor calling for revenge.
But, having in mind that the accusation for high treason is unfounded,
Veljko's offence is just knowledge about a murder.
If we would accept the charges under section 112, that would be legal murder!
I will finish now.
Gentlemen...
We must have in mind that this is a historic trial.
The whole world waits for the verdict brought here.
History and future generations will talk about this trial.
Therefore I call not for a brutal verdict, but for a just verdict.
A verdict based on law, to serve as the bright page in the legislative annals because the future will be our judge, as well as the civilization that we, despite all, will reach some day.
Thank you.
The defence lawyer Malek will speak now.
Honourable judges... when we were schoolboys, we studied science, not assassinations.
I remember the Latin proverb that stayed in my mind from that time.
Fiat justitia, "Let justice be done".
Gentlemen...
I fully support the words of my predecessor, Dr. Zistler,
that the annexation of Bosnia Herzegovina is not grounded in law, and that the accusation for high treason is therefore unsustainable.
Malek, I warn you.
Since my words may not carry much weight,
I prepared some authorities in this field proving the claim made by Dr. Zistler.
I will start with Dr. Finger.
The book is Strafrecht, volume 2, page 768.
He writes here...
I never found out how Malek knew the bases of my defence, and prepared his thorough support.
I conclude the trial.
The verdicts will be delivered tomorrow, on 29 October at 8 o'clock, here.
Officers with their swords out are at the gates.
Waiting for you.
You mustn't go there.
I know a certain corridor...
I will take you out.
Malek...
Do you know what are you getting yourself into?
I know.
They will probably fire me.
I already bought the ticket.
I am going away tomorrow.
I'm going home.
To Bohemia.
I'm sick of Bosnia.
I am a timid man.
Yes.
Žerajiè, the hero, was right.
Who wants to live, has to die.
Who wants to die, has to live.
Murat, apple of my eye, do you know the fate of Murat on Kosovo?
I know.
That same fate awaits for you, tomorrow.
Never mind.
Never mind.
You died on Kosovo and we lost our freedom.
If I die tomorrow, maybe we shall get our freedom.
Teach...
You will die stupid.
What is it, you are making?
The shackles around his hands,
I'm making an underlayer.
He asked for this.
I hope he'll need it.
If not him, Vaso could use it.
It's late.
I have to go.
Yes.
You'd better go.
I will wait for the verdict at the gates.
I don't know why, but I always imagined that I will hear it from you.
Take it, please.
Will he protect me, now?
He already protects you.
Before I deliver the verdict,
I ask the accused for the last time, do any of you have anything to say?
Before we part,
I don't want you to take a bad impression about us with you.
We loved our nation.
We thought, if there are no men among us to do what we have done, we will never prosper.
I would like to add this.
Although Princip puts up a brave face, although all of us put up a brave face
we are all very sorry.
We didn't know that the late Franz Ferdinand was a father.
We were greatly impressed by the words he had spoken to his wife.
"Sophie, don't die.
Stay alive for the children."
We can be whatever you want, but we are not villains.
In my name and the name of my friends, I beg his children to forgive us.
We are not villains, we meant good.
We died for our ideals.
Èabrinoviæ doesn't have the authority to speak on my behalf.
Next.
About insinuations that someone else instigated this.
That is not true.
The idea was born in our minds, and we carried out the assassination.
We loved our nation.
I won't say a thing in my defence.
Read the verdicts, please.

TRAITORS!
You know that it is not wise to come here.
Maybe they plan to kill me right now.
Before he left, Malek passed on his instructions for escape to Italy.
In an empty barrel with an oil transport.
The Government has just finished its session.
They discussed your case.
You are accused for acts against the Monarchy and the dynasty.
The Hungarians saved you.
Dr. Mandiæ and all the Croats wanted you to face the court-martial.
Which means...
you lose your head.
Which means, a bigger Catholic than the Pope.
You were lucky.
Exile.
You've got 24 hours to leave the county, you will be under police escort.
You dug your own grave.
With that speech...
Austria-Hungary dug its own grave with verdicts like that!
It destroyed the foundations on which it was built.
Vienna confirmed the death sentences.
The hanging is tomorrow morning.
My dear wife, my angel.
When you receive this letter, my body will be dead, but my soul will embrace and kiss both of you.
Find comfort in our child.
Forgive, just as I forgive the ones who caused my death.
You are the most perfect woman of this century.
At the end, I shout to you, "I don't regret".
Be happy.
Ljubica... my pet.
Farewell.
Kisses from Daddy.
Dear Mother, don't be too sad.
I don't need extra clothes.
Say hello to Auntie.
Your Danilo.
My dear Jovanka, my life companion.
I am going, and I don't leave anything to you and our child except my endless love.
Don't grieve too much.
It had to be this way.
I hold picture of you and Nada in front of me.
I kiss you both.
Some inner voice tells me that after my tragic end, you will be blessed by God's grace.
Be happy.
Time will heal this severe wound.
But darling, if you find the road too difficult for you to walk alone, find someone who will understand you the way I did, and you have my blessing.
Forgive me if you find these thoughts offending.
They are guided by love.
When Nada grows up enough to understand, tell her everything about her father and the turbulent times he lived in.
I take it that she will understand and forgive her father for being an orphan.
Yes...
I ask and beg for her forgiveness.
My child.
All your father could leave behind was an honest and unblemished name.
May God grant you long lives.
Love, your Daddy Veljko.
It is easy for me, because I know I die for the national cause.
And you, and the ones you serve, may tremble before the nation who's sons die like we do now!
Long live freedom!
-Long live freedom!
-Long live!
Long live freedom!
Is your name Murat?
Veljko left this...
for you and the other guards.
He said, have a drink.
I didn't know one thing.
I rode on the same train with Princip and the others on their way to prison.
Until this day I don't know how all those people found out about it and stood along the railway.
For many kilometres.

The National Trust has more than four million members.
It's Britain's largest landowner.
As English as cream teas.
Or is it?
Because it all began... in Wales.
Where it continues to look after the treasures of this beautiful country.
But I want to find out what the future holds for this guardian of our shared past.
Gorgeous, isn't it?
That's prime Welsh countryside behind me - but it's also in a fundamental way a sort of museum of our own history.
A living, working museum.
'The National Trust has taken on the role of curator of that museum 'for the 231 tenanted farms it owns here in Wales.
'What does it take to be one of their farmers?
'
I couldn't just pop up as an ex-comedian and say, "Sorry, I want I look after a farm"!
?
'How do they cope with all those redundant farm buildings?
'
Can't cost a lot to restore, can it?
'And how do they encourage nature, provide access 'and help this living museum to pay its way?
'
What sort of landlord does it want to be?
The National Trust owns farmland all over Wales but it owns a slightly disproportionate amount in high uplands - in Snowdonia, places like that, because it's beautiful and romantic land.
It was as a result of owning coastland and buying up coastland that it started to acquire a slightly wider portfolio of types of farms and it's now become of interest to it to expand that portfolio and cover more of the history of farming in Wales.
One of the places where the Trust is addressing that history is here in Treleddyd Fawr, close to St David's in North Pembrokeshire.
I've come to see the Trust's latest bequest - it was left to them on the death of its owner, Mr Griffiths.
They've accepted it, which according to the Trust director,
Justin Albert, is unusual.
I get offered a lot of properties on an almost weekly basis and people presume that the National Trust can take things on - we can't.
As a charity we can't take on things that will be a financial drain unless it is of such cultural importance and so at risk and nobody else can take it on, we will then have to take it on.
So, what is so special about this little farm worker's cottage?
Less than 100 years ago cottages like this littered the Welsh landscape, almost literally, because over here there was a sort of system of dispersed villages with labourers living in little cottages out in the fields.
But it's extraordinary how much of that has been swept away.
Farming is now done by far fewer people.
As a result, many fell into ruin.
The rest?
Well, they were either turned into holiday cottages or they were converted.
And we can't exactly blame people.
Because this is a very wet and windy area.
You need a sealed roof, you need windows that shut, you want a proper central-heating system, bathroom... and all those things changed cottages completely.
As a result this simple place is very rare.
Mr Griffiths who used to live here, he was bathing in a tin bath in front of the fire up until the day he left.
Nathan Goss, the National Trust's building consultant, is showing me around.
The porch is fantastic - it's one piece of slate up on the top here,
I absolutely love that detail.
I love to see a man, you see, in love with things which other people might not even notice.
This is in the eye of the beholder.
So I or anybody else might come here and go "Oh, well, it's all right, interesting."
But this to you is something you just don't see any more?
I believe that this is the only traditional tythan - small homestead - left in Northern Pembrokeshire untouched.
Nathan, it's clear to see, loves it - every bit of it.
I believe it needs to be a holiday cottage and it needs to be an experience.
And if Nathan gets his way it will certainly be a hell of an experience.
And that is the only bit of modern plumbing in the entire place?
- Yes.
That's everything - there!
- Really?
- This is the bathroom!
- Nothing inside at all?
- Nothing at all.
And you're going to preserve that?
- I'd like to, yes.
- Would you?
- Ooh, yeah.
You'd like people to come here and stay in this cottage and have to go out in the middle of the night to use...?
100%.
In your dreams.
This is my favourite window in the whole cottage.
I challenge you to walk past this and not smile.
Perfectly proportioned window.
OK, let's have a look at the roof here, Nathan.
Tell me about this roof.
The top section of the roof, as you can see, is the traditional.
Pembrokeshire roof - it's slate with lime slurry poured over the top.
- OK, and that's called a grouted roof?
- A grouted roof.
And why did they pour the lime over the slate?
Pembrokeshire slate is traditionally poor, it will last about ten years, you might be lucky if you get 20 out of it.
They came up with a mix they could pour straight over the top and put on with a brush.
Once a year get up on the roof, tie yourself to the chimney and away to go.
This is a tradition unique to this part of the world and the roof is one of the reasons the Trust has agreed to take it on.
Your ideal would be to save as much of this... bodge as possible?
The back section we might.
The front section, I'm saying no.
But I can only say from what I've seen from the outside.
So you have to hold up the whole building at the moment?
Yeah, the whole building is extremely dangerous at the moment.
The weight of the roof is coming straight down.
It's Welsh wallpaper mania in here.
I think there's 26 layers above that fireplace there.
Look at that!
One of the things that you find about Welsh cottages is that people loved their wallpaper and they just kept putting more of those...
Those are beautiful.
Going back in time.
Got to be careful.
- Got to preserve that and keep that!
- Oh, no.
- Now look what I've done.
Note to self - hands in pockets during site visits.
There are some significant features here unique to a farm labourer's cottage.
It's not even a cut beam.
Just a piece of branch to hold up the fireplace.
One of the traditional features is this internal porch that stops the draft from the front door.
This is a particular detail which you don't find in many buildings any more.
This partition.
And other more everyday details.
You missed one fantastic detail which is this wonderful cobweb.
- I saw the cobweb, you're not going to keep the cobweb?
- Well we could try.
But in the end you have to ask - what exactly are we saving here?
I know we love it but there's going to be an army of experts involved coming in to discuss it.
I mean, two-up-two-down.
There's going to be a legion of expert conservators coming - this isn't... this isn't built by Inigo Jones, no architect was involved here, this isn't a great 17th-century mansion that reflects the political history of our country - why,
why this place?
I think this place is probably more important than a 17th-century mansion to me and to the people in Pembrokeshire and to other architects.
It is the Brad Pitt of cottages.
It's the most photographed, filmed, drawn cottage in the whole of Pembrokeshire, probably in the whole of Wales.
If we lose this now then you've taken a... you've lost a whole section of history.
There are a number of conditions which any property that the National Trust takes on has to fulfil.
It has to be aesthetically interesting in some way, it to be rather beautiful.
I think this place is.
It has to have a conservation angle to it - it has to be saved because it's the last of its type or it's in danger of being lost for ever, and that's true about this place.
And perhaps most important of all, but sometimes the most difficult to fulfil - it has to find a way of paying for itself in the future.
Now, here that's quite difficult, because there's only an acre of land and that's hardly a rich endowment.
The Trust can't make money by farming here nor can they charge at the door like they do for, say, Powis Castle.
The only option is really to rent it to people looking for an authentic 18th-century experience.
Well, it's not a big place, which you might regard is the entire point, but it's not entirely in great nick.
Still, small - can't cost a lot to restore, can it?
I've, er, restored a cottage myself and, er, because we were on telly I absolutely wanted to do it right and...
I think it's probably the most expensive thing I've ever done because there are so many different ways of doing things and so many levels of heritage, er, conservation that you could get.
A fair criticism is that we would do something to such a degree of perfection that it became unsustainable for anyone else other than a reasonably spendthrift charity so, no, I think we will not do that at Treleddyd Fawr - we'll use traditional craft skills
and we'll make it wonderful but we're not going to turn it into a pit which we can throw money in to get the perfect join here.
I don't see it as my duty to do that, particularly if no-one can see it.
Sorry, I don't.
Boy, my conservators are going to kill me for saying this - but they're still wrong.
However the details of restoration are settled in the future, the big picture is that this acquisition shows a new way of thinking.
It's interesting from the point of view of the National Trust because buying this is part of a slightly different policy in relation to farms and the countryside.
A lot of the land they own is in the north of Wales and in romantic landscapes, landscapes which intellectuals associated with the sublime and the glorious, and hence you have hill farms and bits of Snowdonia and mountains.
But there's not much that tells the OTHER story of agriculture - the hard toil, the smallholding - and that's why this place is important.
Changes in priorities are affecting the way the Trust manages the land as well as the buildings they own.
One of the things that's rather interesting about the National Trust is that it is a form of autocracy.
Essentially somebody needs to be there setting standards and saying, "This is EXACTLY what will happen."
To understand more about setting those standards I've come to Trehill Farm in South Pembrokeshire.
Jonathan Hughes is the Trust's land manager here.
- Would you tell me what to do?
- No, we wouldn't tell you what to do, we would agree broad parameters right at the outset and say these are the type of things we're looking for from, you know, this particular farm.
What ones have you had where you go, "That's a good idea, let's do that"?
One of them would be around public access and enjoyment, so if you can accommodate people coming there, whether it's for education groups or people camping, something like that.
I think we'd be very open to ideas which introduce people into the landscape.
I think we'd be very interested in broadening biodiversity, so widening hedge banks, creating ponds, that type of thing.
Right.
If there were areas that would traditionally have been wet but have been drained in the last 50 years and you could allow those to become wetter and broaden the range of flowers and insects that would grow there, we would be very supportive of that.
Here at Trehill they farm 600 acres and at first glance it looks like any other farm but it's a trust tenancy and things are never that simple.
Appearances can be deceptive.
About two weeks ago my son came in laughing and he said to me,
"Mum, Mum, I'm not quite sure what's going on but there's a lady outside
"who's just asked if she could use the bathroom.
"So I've just shown her into the house."
And I just wish I'd been a bit quicker to ask her if she was a member as she left!
Because she'd seen the National Trust sign at the entrance and decided that as a National Trust member she could come into our home and use the facilities.
This misconception might be caused by the fact that most people don't realise that the Trust runs working farms.
There are three main reasons why it owns own agricultural land.
Firstly, as part of the endowment on a stately home.
Secondly, in areas where they need to preserve a traditional way of life.
And thirdly...
This farm here arrived with the National Trust almost by default - they were after the coastline and they got the farm to go with it.
So they then had to face the question - what do they do with it?
How are they going to farm it?
In order to answer this we need to understand a little about the recent history of farming.
Most commercial farmers today have been educated into the post-war consensus which sees extra productivity, trying to get the most out of their land as the highest priority, as almost a sacred duty, but the NT doesn't quite see it that way.
It has other concerns - they might include tradition, biodiversity or even the look of the landscape, and that can be confusing to a farmer who just wants to earn an honest bob.
My father-in-law, father and mother-in-law came here in 1968 on the back of, um, er, the sort of "dig for victory" type, erm, ticket if you like.
They were into producing as much food as effectively as they possibly could - they drained land, they limed land, they improved the land, and I say "improved" insomuch as for production they improved it.
Today it has sheep, it has cattle, it has potatoes and a new set of priorities.
We've now moved into sort of balancing where we farm the land.
And that land which is most productive we throw a lot of inputs in - fertilisers, sprays, pesticides.
But there are other parts of our land that aren't quite so productive and those are the parts of land that we've identified and said, "Well, actually maybe there isn't much point in throwing all these high-value inputs,
"there's only a finite amount of resources, isn't it better
"to concentrate those resources onto the more productive land?"
Intensive farming is right in some places, it's not right everywhere.
Because it's not sustainable.
If you intensively farm and you do not leave wildlife corridors you will lose that land eventually, that land ceases to be productive - your rivers will die, the runoff will kill the rivers, kill the fish.
It is not a sensible way to perpetuate our...
our environment.
Recently this has become the Trust's mantra - it believes that if you only farm intensively too many species will die out and eventually the land will become barren.
So the Smithies were encouraged to try a different approach with several of their coastal fields.
I think it was probably quite hard for Dad at one stage definitely and he took a while to get his head round the fact that all that work, all that effort, all the drainage that he put in was being ripped out.
You know, when you see diggers in there and bulldozers in there pushing soil around, you know, it's quite an emotive thing.
I think he sort of reaps the rewards now and he started the environmental work with the one-field hofflands that he put into an environmental scheme in the mid 1980s.
What the Trust and the Smithies wanted to know is what would happen if the land was returned to what it was like before intensive farming and fertilisation?
In order to measure this, they treated the three sets of fields differently, each one having the soil nutrients removed.
What are the results so far?
One thing that very quickly was different was the birds - there's been a huge increase of skylarks and choughs.
The ones that were left without any treatment at all just, basically, grew grass, because there was grass there anyway, and it's just grown and it's outcompeted everything else.
The soil scraping and the light acidification with a light dose of sulphur are really the, sort of, ones I'll take you to see.
You know, they're the ones that look good.
They... they've got heather, they've got...
And all sorts of other things which I'm sure a botanist can tell you all about.
But the ones that are as interesting as those are the ones with the high levels of sulphur that really we don't quite know where they're going.
You know, it's a really long-term project, this isn't just ten years, this is, sort of, 50 years down the line.
But there are other sides to National Trust involvement too.
There's quite a complicated relationship going on here, because Peter and Gina pay the National Trust a fee in order to use their logo to advertise their potatoes.
We have to comply with quite a lot of quite stiff regulation as to the production of the potatoes and all the crops and all the animal welfare within the farm.
It's been worth it for us.
It gives us a market.
The potato trade is notoriously fickle - you can lose quite a lot of money very quickly.
People who belong to the National Trust or aspire to belong to the National Trust trust the brand.
And we're not at the whim of a merchant that says,
"Well, actually, today I'll give you £80 a ton,
"and tomorrow I'll give you 75 and the next day I'll give you 70 and..."
et cetera, et cetera.
So, Peter and Gina pay a fee and that helps to guarantee an income.
The Trust gets its rent, and the fee and the customer is buying into a brand or known package which includes a level of environmental concern.
I think as time goes on we're going to have an increasing pressure on balancing people paying for good conservation and people paying for amount of food.
And over the next 10 or 20 years that balance is going to change as to more money going to good conservation.
And I think one of the jobs of the Trust is to work with our tenants and other farmers to help that transition.
They're not particularly, as such, interested in the value - pound, shillings and pence value - of the land, they're more interested in the value, as in enjoyment and environmental enhancement.
And although they want the rent paid and so we've got to produce some things, you know, they are considerate in how they negotiate rentals, I suppose.
At Trehill the Smithies and the Trust have found a way to set aside marginal land to nature while still making an income from farming the other fields.
But there are other farms where making money in the modern age is a much more difficult prospect and the Trust's intentions here are different.
Like Llyndy Isaf, a 600-acre farm on the side of Snowdon.
What will you try to do there?
Llyndy Isaf is a kind of unique place.
The farmer who had it beforehand for 40 years maintained an extraordinarily environmentally sensitive...
Way before it was trendy to do, and he grazed it with natural cattle, he got rid of the rhododendrons, that were invasive, and we're going to keep on going with that.
The Trust are also investing in young farmers and shepherds so they can learn the traditional skills needed to farm this managed wilderness.
We joined Justin on a site visit with Arwyn Owen, the local farm manager.
There's two full-time shepherds and then Bryn is here...
permanently, actually.
Bryn is out on the hills permanently now.
Such investment costs money.
And if you can't charge on the door, as it were, how do you balance the books?
Well, the Trust are capitalising on Snowdonia's unique environment.
In high season, we're taking...
what, 6% out of the stream?
The hydroelectric turbine on this farm uses the high rainfall here to generate enough electricity to power over 400 homes.
I hope we can cover some our costs, if not most of our costs.
But farming on the side of Snowdon?
It's not one of the greatest investments you could make but it's important for the Trust because we have these three... the conservation, the finance and the social ambition to do it.
The Trust's social ambition takes many new forms but it also includes the oldest ideal of the National Trust - part of its founding ethos - access.
I'm moving on now to visit another farm, only this is one where they've taken on one of principles of National Trust ownership to such a degree that they've become farmers, who don't... who don't really farm any more.
I'm at Pwll Caerog, a Trust farm in the southwest of Pembrokeshire, just down the road from St David's.
It still looks like a working farm from the outside until you open that door and then you go inside and it's a completely different use to the buildings to what you'd expect.
With the Trust's approval, lan Griffiths and his late wife Judy started a bed and breakfast at their
250-acre farm, to supplement their farming income.
In the late '90s it was particularly tough, with cereal prices exceptionally low, and we were very much under the cosh as farmers.
The Trust helped lan develop a business plan.
That would give him an income while fulfilling one of the Trust's main interests - giving access to the land.
We decided to sell the beef herd, sell the machinery and the tractors and equipment and reinvest that into toilets and showers and kitchens and dining halls and more bunk beds.
Ian rents the land he doesn't use to neighbouring farmers.
So all these sheds were turned into places for people to bunk down - 300 at a time.
And they do come - they have a look round the farm, they may even dig a few spuds and go for a walk along the coastal path.
And this is not only a form of diversification for the farmer, giving him a bit of income from a different source, it's also an embodiment of the philosophy of the Trust - it allows access for people.
The Trust has embraced this in their.
Things To Do Before You're 11¾ initiative.
Children are encouraged in activities in the outdoors, like making a raft, or playing games.
This one child was gazing out to sea and he said, "What's that out there?"
We said, "What do you mean?"
He said, "Is that a fire out on the horizon?"
And she said, "No, that's the sunset."
To engage children with the countryside and with the sea and everything is quite rewarding - you feel valued again as a farmer.
The National Trust is a huge landlord.
It looks after a lot of property and, as a result, as well as just managing that property, clearly it has a series of responsibilities.
It wants to show that it's doing the right thing.
It has to help its tenant farmers to make a living while being mindful of the costs of intensive farming.
It has to decide where to invest in sensitive restoration of historic buildings and in new green technology.
But it also has to encourage maximum access.
Is there conflict within your own organisation about what example you should make?
I think there was a greater divergence 10, 20 years ago in the Trust between those who loved buildings and concrete and masonry and baroque furniture and those who liked getting naked and running and jumping into fields and celebrating Mother Earth.
And there were two pulls on the National Trust for a long time.
The Trust has come together and that difference between the people who wear sandals and brogues is less obvious now.
Whatever your shoe of choice, it's clear that the Trust is increasingly following a path back to traditional farming methods.
Originally the National Trust was founded to take into care places of either great historical interest or great natural beauty.
But today we're increasingly learning that you can't have one without the other.
That farmland like this has its great natural beauty only if you take account of its history.
The National Trust has more than four million members.
It's Britain's largest landowner.
As English as cream teas.
Or is it?
Because it all began...in Wales.
Where it continues to look after the treasures of this beautiful country.
But I want to find out what the future holds for this guardian of our shared past.
Gorgeous, isn't it?
That's prime Welsh countryside behind me - but it's also in a fundamental way a sort of museum of our own history - a living, working museum.
'The National Trust has taken on the role of curator of that museum 'for the 231 tenanted farms it owns here in Wales.
'What does it take to be one of their farmers?
'
I couldn't just pop up as an ex-comedian and say, "Sorry, I want I look after a farm"!
?
'How do they cope with all those redundant farm buildings?
'
Can't cost a lot to restore, can it?
'And how do they encourage nature, provide access 'and help this living museum to pay its way?
'
What sort of landlord does it want to be?
The National Trust owns farmland all over Wales but it owns a slightly disproportionate amount in high uplands - in Snowdonia, places like that, because it's beautiful and romantic land.
It was as a result of owning coastland and buying up coastland that it started to acquire a slightly wider portfolio of types of farms and it's now become of interest to it to expand that portfolio and cover more of the history of farming in Wales.
One of the places where the Trust is addressing that history is here in Treleddyd Fawr, close to St David's in North Pembrokeshire.
I've come to see the Trust's latest bequest - it was left to them on the death of its owner, Mr Griffiths.
They've accepted it, which according to the Trust director,
Justin Albert, is unusual.
I get offered a lot of properties on an almost weekly basis and people presume that the National Trust can take things on - we can't.
As a charity we can't take on things that will be a financial drain unless it is of such cultural importance and so at risk and nobody else can take it on, we will then have to take it on.
So, what is so special about this little farm worker's cottage?
Less than 100 years ago cottages like this littered the Welsh landscape, almost literally, because over here there was a sort of system of dispersed villages with labourers living in little cottages out in the fields.
But it's extraordinary how much of that has been swept away.
Farming is now done by far fewer people.
As a result, many fell into ruin.
The rest?
Well, they were either turned into holiday cottages or they were converted.
And we can't exactly blame people.
Because this is a very wet and windy area.
You need a sealed roof, you need windows that shut, you want a proper central-heating system, bathroom... and all those things changed cottages completely.
As a result this simple place is very rare.
Mr Griffiths who used to live here, he was bathing in a tin bath in front of the fire up until the day he left.
Nathan Goss, the National Trust's building consultant, is showing me around.
The porch is fantastic - it's one piece of slate up on the top here,
I absolutely love that detail.
I love to see a man, you see, in love with things which other people might not even notice.
This is in the eye of the beholder.
So I or anybody else might come here and go "Oh, well, it's all right, interesting."
But this to you is something you just don't see any more?
I believe that this is the only traditional tythan - small homestead - left in Northern Pembrokeshire untouched.
Nathan, it's clear to see, loves it - every bit of it.
I believe it needs to be a holiday cottage and it needs to be an experience.
And if Nathan gets his way it will certainly be a hell of an experience.
And that is the only bit of modern plumbing in the entire place?
- Yes.
That's everything - there!
- Really?
- This is the bathroom!
- Nothing inside at all?
- Nothing at all.
And you're going to preserve that?
- I'd like to, yes.
- Would you?
- Ooh, yeah.
You'd like people to come here and stay in this cottage and have to go out in the middle of the night to use...?
100%.
In your dreams.
THEY CHUCKLE
This is my favourite window in the whole cottage.
I challenge you to walk past this and not smile.
GRIFF CHUCKLES
Perfectly proportioned window.
OK, let's have a look at the roof here, Nathan.
Tell me about this roof.
The top section of the roof, as you can see, is the traditional
Pembrokeshire roof - it's slate with lime slurry poured over the top.
- OK, and that's called a grouted roof?
- A grouted roof.
And why did they pour the lime over the slate?
Pembrokeshire slate is traditionally poor, it will last about ten years, you might be lucky if you get 20 out of it.
They came up with a mix they could pour straight over the top and put on with a brush.
Once a year get up on the roof, tie yourself to the chimney and away to go.
This is a tradition unique to this part of the world and the roof is one of the reasons the Trust has agreed to take it on.
Your ideal would be to save as much of this... bodge as possible?
The back section we might.
The front section, I'm saying no.
But I can only say from what I've seen from the outside.
So you have to hold up the whole building at the moment?
Yeah, the whole building is extremely dangerous at the moment.
The weight of the roof is coming straight down.
It's Welsh wallpaper mania in here.
I think there's 26 layers above that fireplace there.
Look at that!
One of the things that you find about Welsh cottages is that people loved their wallpaper and they just kept putting more of those...
Those are beautiful.
Going back in time.
Got to be careful.
- Got to preserve that and keep that!
- Oh, no.
- Now look what I've done.
Note to self - hands in pockets during site visits.
There are some significant features here unique to a farm labourer's cottage.
It's not even a cut beam.
Just a piece of branch to hold up the fireplace.
One of the traditional features is this internal porch that stops the draft from the front door.
This is a particular detail which you don't find in many buildings any more.
This partition.
And other more everyday details.
You missed one fantastic detail which is this wonderful cobweb.
- I saw the cobweb, you're not going to keep the cobweb?
- Well...
HE LAUGHS
..we could try.
But in the end you have to ask - what exactly are we saving here?
I know we love it but there's going to be an army of experts involved coming in to discuss it.
I mean, two-up-two-down.
There's going to be a legion of expert conservators coming - this isn't... this isn't built by Inigo Jones, no architect was involved here, this isn't a great 17th-century mansion that reflects the political history of our country - why,
why this place?
I think this place is probably more important than a 17th-century mansion to me and to the people in Pembrokeshire and to other architects.
It is the Brad Pitt of cottages.
It's the most photographed, filmed, drawn cottage in the whole of Pembrokeshire, probably in the whole of Wales.
If we lose this now then you've taken a... you've lost a whole section of history.
There are a number of conditions which any property that the National Trust takes on has to fulfil.
It has to be aesthetically interesting in some way, it to be rather beautiful.
I think this place is.
It has to have a conservation angle to it - it has to be saved because it's the last of its type or it's in danger of being lost for ever, and that's true about this place.
And perhaps most important of all, but sometimes the most difficult to fulfil - it has to find a way of paying for itself in the future.
Now, here that's quite difficult, because there's only an acre of land and that's hardly a rich endowment.
The Trust can't make money by farming here nor can they charge at the door like they do for, say, Powis Castle.
The only option is really to rent it to people looking for an authentic 18th-century experience.
Well, it's not a big place, which you might regard is the entire point, but it's not entirely in great nick.
Still, small - can't cost a lot to restore, can it?
CASH REGISTER RINGS
COINS RATTLE
I've, er, restored a cottage myself and, er, because we were on telly I absolutely wanted to do it right and...
I think it's probably the most expensive thing I've ever done because there are so many different ways of doing things and so many levels of heritage, er, conservation that you could get.
A fair criticism is that we would do something to such a degree of perfection that it became unsustainable for anyone else other than a reasonably spendthrift charity so, no, I think we will not do that at Treleddyd Fawr - we'll use traditional craft skills
and we'll make it wonderful but we're not going to turn it into a pit which we can throw money in to get the perfect join here
- I don't see it as my duty to do that, particularly if no-one can see it.
Sorry, I don't.
HE CHUCKLES
Boy, my conservators are going to kill me for saying this - but they're still wrong.
However the details of restoration are settled in the future, the big picture is that this acquisition shows a new way of thinking.
It's interesting from the point of view of the National Trust because buying this is part of a slightly different policy in relation to farms and the countryside.
A lot of the land they own is in the north of Wales and in romantic landscapes, landscapes which intellectuals associated with the sublime and the glorious, and hence you have hill farms and bits of Snowdonia and mountains.
But there's not much that tells the OTHER story of agriculture - the hard toil, the smallholding - and that's why this place is important.
Changes in priorities are affecting the way the Trust manages the land as well as the buildings they own.
One of the things that's rather interesting about the National Trust is that it is a form of autocracy.
Essentially somebody needs to be there setting standards and saying, "This is EXACTLY what will happen."
To understand more about setting those standards I've come to Trehill Farm in South Pembrokeshire.
Jonathan Hughes is the Trust's land manager here.
- Would you tell me what to do?
- No, we wouldn't tell you what to do, we would agree broad parameters right at the outset and say these are the type of things we're looking for from, you know, this particular farm.
What ones have you had where you go, "That's a good idea, let's do that"?
One of them would be around public access and enjoyment, so if you can accommodate people coming there, whether it's for education groups or people camping, something like that.
I think we'd be very open to ideas which introduce people into the landscape.
I think we'd be very interested in broadening biodiversity, so widening hedge banks, creating ponds, that type of thing.
Right.
If there were areas that would traditionally have been wet but have been drained in the last 50 years and you could allow those to become wetter and broaden the range of flowers and insects that would grow there, we would be very supportive of that.
Here at Trehill they farm 600 acres and at first glance it looks like any other farm but it's a trust tenancy and things are never that simple.
Appearances can be deceptive.
About two weeks ago my son came in laughing and he said to me,
"Mum, Mum, I'm not quite sure what's going on but there's a lady outside
"who's just asked if she could use the bathroom.
"So I've just shown her into the house."
And I just wish I'd been a bit quicker to ask her if she was a member as she left!
Because she'd seen the National Trust sign at the entrance and decided that as a National Trust member she could come into our home and use the facilities.

250-acre farm, to supplement their farming income.
In the late '90s it was particularly tough, with cereal prices exceptionally low, and we were very much under the cosh as farmers.
The Trust helped Ian develop a business plan.
That would give him an income while fulfilling one of the Trust's main interests - giving access to the land.
CHEERING
We decided to sell the beef herd, sell the machinery and the tractors and equipment and reinvest that into toilets and showers and kitchens and dining halls and more bunk beds.
Ian rents the land he doesn't use to neighbouring farmers.
So all these sheds were turned into places for people to bunk down - 300 at a time.
And they do come - they have a look round the farm, they may even dig a few spuds and go for a walk along the coastal path.
And this is not only a form of diversification for the farmer, giving him a bit of income from a different source, it's also an embodiment of the philosophy of the Trust - it allows access for people.
The Trust has embraced this in their
Things To Do Before You're 11¾ initiative.
Children are encouraged in activities in the outdoors, like making a raft, or playing games.
This one child was gazing out to sea and he said, "What's that out there?"
We said, "What do you mean?"
He said, "Is that a fire out on the horizon?"
And she said, "No, that's the sunset."
To engage children with the countryside and with the sea and everything is quite rewarding - you feel valued again as a farmer.
The National Trust is a huge landlord.
It looks after a lot of property and, as a result, as well as just managing that property, clearly it has a series of responsibilities.
It wants to show that it's doing the right thing.
It has to help its tenant farmers to make a living while being mindful of the costs of intensive farming.
It has to decide where to invest in sensitive restoration of historic buildings and in new green technology.
But it also has to encourage maximum access.
Is there conflict within your own organisation about what example you should make?
I think there was a greater divergence 10, 20 years ago in the Trust between those who loved buildings and concrete and masonry and baroque furniture and those who liked getting naked and running and jumping into fields and celebrating Mother Earth.
And there were two pulls on the National Trust for a long time.
The Trust has come together and that difference between the people who wear sandals and brogues is less obvious now.
Whatever your shoe of choice, it's clear that the Trust is increasingly following a path back to traditional farming methods.
Originally the National Trust was founded to take into care places of either great historical interest or great natural beauty.
But today we're increasingly learning that you can't have one without the other.
That farmland like this has its great natural beauty only if you take account of its history.
Hey, hey, Tuck, dude.
- Okay, we're rolling.
- Okay, hold on.
Before you go, look-look at my coat.
- It's cool, huh?
- What is that?
Can we do another take with it on, though?
No.
Okay.
Ready when you are.
Okay.
How do I smell?
Or I mean, look, or you know?
Yeah, you can't smell a video.
Okay.
Ruckus, dude, you got to get out of here.
Hi, I'm Reginald.
I don't really get friends much, but it's probably because I'm a bit of... an acquired taste.
That's what my mom says.
And I'm sure whatever school I'm forced to go to no one will acquire it.
So... thanks for paving a road over, really, the only place I've ever had any real friends.
Okay.
We good?
- Uh, say your name.
- I thought you knew my name.
You know what I mean;
for the video.
Dude, we've been hanging out for years.
- Come on.
- Dude, stop fronting.
Just tell the camera.
You're upset, right?
You don't want to move.
I've never gone a day without seeing my friends.
They're, like, the only people in the world who get me.
And now it's just all over, you know?
Good luck finding that again.
So wherever Munch is going, man...
Look, you people listen to me, all right?
He's a really good kid.
So don't just assume that he's weird and that's it.
And Alex, man...
He's a foster kid.
He's been moved all over.
I mean, it's like, why do you have to build a freeway right through?
You know, can't you just go around or something?
You're going along feeling like your own person with your own friends, and then something like this comes along that you have no power to stop because you're just a kid.
You're just a kid.
Yeah, hey, man.
Yeah, yeah, I'm up, I'm up.
Whoa, whoa, man, slow down.
What's the problem?
Yeah, my phone's good.
Why?
What happened?
Wait, what?
This is when everything started to change.
So, being me,
I kept filming.
I'm Tuck.
What you're about to see happened to me and my best friends one year ago.
This is the story of our last week together.
Phones all over our neighborhood are freaking out.
We've done everything we could possibly do with this phone.
We threw it at the wall, we took it to the phone guy, we took it to the store where we got it from, and they say it's a problem.
So you know it's serious.
It looks like your phone basically barfed on the screen.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I was just eating dinner, and all of a sudden, all the phones in the house just did this.
At exactly the same time.
Dude.
What?
It's freaky.
- De hello?
- Hey, Alex.
Oh, Munch, you're outside.
Get over here, over here, down the street.
Ask him if his phone barfed yet.
Did your phone barf yet?
- Phones are still working.
- Cool.
Keep going, and we'll meet you in the backyard.
Okay, copy that.
I'll take swift steps.
When I look back at that day,
I realize the clues were all around us.
We had no idea.
Dude, they all still work.
See?
Dude, you know if this whole thing works,
- these phones are done.
- No, I know.
I have 14 spares; it's okay.
I bet you do.
Okay.
All right, anyways, let's spread out.
- Okay.
- Alex, go by the gate.
Munch, go on the far end,
- Yeah, I got it, and I'll stay right here by my camera.
- Just watch out!
- Okay, okay.
Okay, it's good.
It's good...
It's good...
Whoa, okay, it went out.
Whoa, whoa, it barfed!
All right, people, if you go to Alex's house, your phones will spew chunks all over his screen.
My mom said the Murphys' phones and the Churleys' changed, too.
So what do you think this is?
Whoa!
These dudes.
Hi.
- Is that on?
- I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Oh.
We had an electrical short over at the site, and it may be disrupting people's phone service, and we're wondering if that happened
- to anybody in this house?
- Oh, no, my phone is good.
- 'Cause we're offering new phone vouchers
- Uh-huh.
In exchange for any device in this area here
- that may be displaying
- That's weird, that's weird.
- Faulty messages or images?
- I don't know.
See you.
No, listen, I...
Okay, so you-you really don't think this is a little bit weird?
These dudes come here to build a freeway
- and now they want our phones?
- Well, I think it's gonna work.
No.
Clean your room.
Oh, my...
I'm not gonna have a room if we don't do something.
- Right, I think...
- No, Mom, seriously.
These guys want our houses.
Maybe if we expose them for illegal property, then...
- Yo!
- Aw, you don't like how things are, do you?
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
Dude, it's a map to the desert.
Like, what is that?
What do we do with this?
I guess most maps are made to be followed.
Exactly.
It could go to, like, some crazy headquarters, and we find out that these construction clowns are spies and we expose them to the world.
It's 20 miles away.
What...
No, we're not...
we're not gonna go.
No, obviously not.
Look, whatever it is, this Saturday, we're going to sneak behind our parents' backs and find out.
I'm moving Saturday.
All right, all right, so Friday night.
Our last night together?
It doesn't have to be;
that's what I'm saying.
Like, I don't want to move, and these clowns are making us do it.
Maybe we can stop them.
Now, are you in?
Yeah, all right.
- All right.
- I'm in.
Munch, don't you bail out on us now.
Dude, I'm not.
Me?
No... pfft!
I'm in.
Yeah!
All right!
That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, all right.
Bring it in.
- Oh, oops!
- Munch!
So, why would you be organizing your ketchups?
- Because.
- Who does that?
So I can get to them easier, and then it's more organized,
- and it's better.
- And you are my friend.
Guys, guys, it's time to practice the big lie.
Hey, Mom, I'm spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a neat, brand-new video game.
And I'm sleeping over at Tuck's house so we can play a new video game.
And I'm sleeping in your mom's bed,
- not playing a video game.
- Oh, my God, all right, dude.
Stop talking about my mother, thank you.
All right, the camera's are gonna be on 24 hours a day, nonstop.
Dude, can you stop touching, please?
It attaches to my bike, and it's also a pretty good way to get footage on the fly.
Spy glasses.
I love these;
I love them.
And last, camera, but definitely not least...
What up, camcorder?
Keeping it tight.
Looking pretty good these days.
Tuck, these are the ugliest things I've ever seen.
Dude, what?
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Those are...
They're sweet.
- The camera's undetectable,
- Wow.
- And the ladies love them.
- Prove it.
Prove it?
This guy, all right?
Give me my glasses, man.
Those are stealth.
Now I'm gonna prove to you guys spy glasses get you girls.
Oh, my gosh, he's going over there.
- I can't see who he's talking to.
- Shut up, Munch.
Uh, hi, uh...
Hey, um, Em-Emma, right?
Emma?
I was just...
Okay, uh, can I borrow a piece of paper, please?
He has something.
- I can't see who he got it from.
- We're about to see right now.
Look, look, look, look.
He has a paper.
You did not get her number.
Totally got her number.
Right there.
You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.
You, too, you're a sellout.
No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.
Yes, I did.
Mannequin Girl?
What kind of name is that?
What?
That's what I call her.
I think mannequins are hot.
I'll leave my house at 6:00.
15 minutes later, I pick up Alex.
- Munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Tonight, we're no longer boys.
We're men.
- Dude, what the...?
- I didn't see you, man.
Tuck, you all right?
Let's go.
Our whole lives we've been nobodies.
In visible.
The good kids.
Not anymore.
All right, Ma.
I'm leaving.
Spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a new video game.
Have whatever you want, honey.
You know what, I lied, actually.
We're gonna ride our bikes out into the desert at night alone.
Without supervision.
We got that;
we're going to state.
Okay, see you then, sweetie.
- We could go.
- Also rob a bank.
- All the way.
State.
- What?
Go to Mexico.
Maybe even start a new life.
- Right, I know.
- Wrestling!
You're trying to act like I don't know what I'm talking about.
What's up, Stumpy?
Yo, man, I told you to stop to calling me that.
You know what, man, look, my girl's throwing this huge party later tonight, if you want to come by.
You serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
Because not a lady in the world can resist a natty old BMX bike.
What's the zero to 60 on that bad boy, huh?
Two, three days?
Come on, come on, dude, you ready?
Let's go.
I can't even tell a difference.
This looks exactly the way it looked before you packed.
All your stuff fitting in one box?
What are you, a drifter?
Who told you?
Look, all I'm saying is, when you get to your new house, put a poster up, put some shelves on the wall, frame a photo.
Look, there's a painting right there.
Put something on a shelf...
That's not a painting.
That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt, smudged it and called it art.
I'm going to Munch's house to play a video game, all right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure, buddy.
- Bye, Dylan.
- Have fun with your friends.
- Hey, hey, Tuck.
- How are you?
Uh, good luck with the move to New York, buddy.
- Maybe we'll come see you.
- All right, cool.
The moving truck is coming at 10:00.
Make sure you're back, okay?
I don't get it.
If your foster parents already have a baby of their own, why do they need you?
There's no sense in having two babies.
- Shut up, dude.
- One baby cries all the time, the other one listens to indie rock.
Let's go.
Yeow!
Guys, would you please help my son with his room, before I go crazy?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I don't think he's started...
Honey, have you even started packing your room?
I told you a thousand times,
I'm alphabetizing!
Yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.
Shh.
...they're flexible, they're "dynamical, "
they can be curved, they can bend, and this opens up a whole new universe of possibilities, and one of the possibilities is that there can be shortcuts through space and through time.
So that's really just what a Wormhole is.
It's taking advantage...
What are you...
Aah!
- Why don't you stop doing that?
!
- I'm sorry!
You guys are gonna give me a heart attack one day.
- I'm sorry.
- Turn that off, dude.
I created a substation for each of our parents' phones that's wired to the router, which is wired to the transmitter, which transmits to the receiver, which is...
- my phone.
- Okay, so basically, no matter who our parents call, it goes to your phone.
Yeah.
My mom's friends always say that I sound just like my mom, you know,
- when I pick up the phone...
- Yeah.
So I figured, I can be Betty.
Bye, Betty.
Thank you.
Um, I'm going to Alex's...
or Munch's... or Tuck's house, and we're gonna play a video game and sleep over.
Wait, what's all that stuff?
Honey?
Good job, Munch.
You did it.
Here we come.
17.6 miles.
Munch, what are you doing?
Guys, guys, just hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Dude...
- I'm not backing out or anything,
- He wants to quit right when we - ...just hear me out.
- Been waiting for this forever.
- Dude, listen, come on, okay.
This is crazy what we're doing.
Dude, I don't want to punk out or back out or anything... it's just, my mom, you know, she just got divorced.
- Munch...
- She's already had enough guys lying to her.
If you didn't want to come, then why didn't you tell us earlier?
You do understand this is our last night together.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Look, Munch, if we don't go now, we'll never go.
We won't even be here.
This is our last chance to try and do something.
Even-even if it is stupid.
- Yeah.
- You know what,
I say we put a vote to it.
All in favor raise your hand.
Well, now I have to raise my hand.
Munch, just...
Fine, fine.
Okay, whatever.
I'll go.
But only under one condition.
- I call the black!
- Mine!
No, no, give it!
It's so weird, no one's gonna be in these houses next week.
Dude, you're so full of it.
- When did you kiss her?
- Dude, trust me.
After pre-algebra, she pulled me into the bathroom.
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Mannequin Girl?
- Yeah!
- Was she good at it?
Uh, eh, B minus.
You know, I've kissed better in better locations.
No, how do I know you're not lying?
Trust me.
I don't even have to reply to you.
- You're last!
- Hey, you got a head start!
That's not fair!
Oh, so what, there's a Wing Stop?
I never been to a Wing Stop.
We followed a map out in the middle of nowhere.
It might be, like, a CIA prison.
We were miles from home.
No one in the world knew it.
No one said it... but we were scared.
We haven't seen a car in, like, half an hour.
We were on our own.
This-this is the way, right?
You have the map, right?
- Can I see the map?
- Left.
Left?
Are you sure?
Because right looks a little bit more promising.
Did you guys hear that?
Just a couple more miles.
Hold on.
What is that?
It's the map.
Are we close?
I never understood why people like the outdoors.
Will you stop freaking out?
Yo, this is too steep, man.
Let's go, man.
We're getting pretty far from the road, guys.
Almost there.
Is it this thing?
I don't think so.
Wait, what was that?
- I don't know.
- Well, hold on.
What'd you see, dude?
Over here!
We're almost there.
Come on.
Oh.
What?
What do you think it is?
How would I know?
Why does it look all burnt?
Hey, just be careful.
- Careful!
- Yeah, don't touch that thing.
Could be...
Could be...
I don't know, I don't know.
A part of a satellite?
All right, all right, um, Munch, film me while I'm...
- while I'm touching this thing.
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Let me try it.
Thank you.
It's dusty.
It's a piece of crap.
What?
Forget about it.
Just turn off the camera.
Well, it's not a national treasure, but it could be used for something.
It's crap.
What happened to filming 'cause it's our last night, huh?
Um, in case you haven't noticed, obviously, the map led to squat.
Got it.
So all you cared about was getting your stupid hits on your stupid video?
- Dude, why don't you just...
- Whoa, guys, guys, guys.
Come on!
I know we're all frustrated...
It's Alex's mom.
- Are you serious?
- Um, it'll be fine.
Just, um, be Betty, okay?
- Oh, man.
- Oh, crap.
Yo, I thought I could do this, but I can't.
Maybe you can answer it.
She just likes to check up on things, okay?
All right.
Betty, are you there?
Go.
This is Betty.
I was thinking maybe I could bring over some pizzas?
Dude, go.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No coming over.
- Just hang up.
- No way.
No, it's really no trouble.
We have a coupon.
- I said no!
No pizzas!
- What?
- No, uh...
- Don't yell at her, man.
Maybe you and your husband should go to bed.
Stop saying words!
Are you sure everything's okay?
Have a good night.
Go to sleep.
That could've gone better.
That was horrible.
"Your husband should go to sleep"?
Was that really something smart to say?
Munch.
Don't look at me like I'm a hoarder.
That's rude.
Who are they?
I don't...
I don't know.
I'm picking up some spikes in the readings...
Get down, get down.
Turn your flashlight off, dummy.
Let's go.
Why would they be out this far?
Who cares?
The night's blown.
- Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
Munch?
- You're a character.
- There's something in there!
What?
Dude, are you kidding me right now?
Something is in that bag.
It touched me.
Go check.
Be-be careful.
- What?
- Did it poke you, too?
What, dude?
Say something!
What did you see?
There-There's something in there.
Yeah, a bunch of crap Munch brought.
- You guys are funny.
- All I know is it beeped.
You know, why don't you go in there and just see.
Beeped?
What are you talking about?
Babies.
I'll do it myself.
Dang, how much stuff do you have in your bag, dude?
Geez.
Oh, boy, are you guys talking about this?
It's garbage.
It's nothing.
What are you talking about, you heard something?
It made a noise.
Hey, hey, do something!
See, it's not doing anything.
What are you talking about?
Beep.
Do that again, do that again.
Do what again?
Do what you just did.
Beep.
Whoa, hold on.
Let me...
Let me try this for myself.
Beep.
Beep?
Why is it making noise only for you and not me?
Make it beep again.
Beep.
Whoa!
This is it!
It's a bomb!
No, no, oh, God, no!
No, no, no!
Guys, I think...
I think it might have defused.
I don't know.
Man, nothing's happening.
All right, hold on, hold on.
I got an idea.
Tuck!
What?
Okay, it didn't do anything, but just don't do it again.
Are you insane, Tuck?
!
Are you sure you guys know what you're doing?
Yes, trust me.
When it's a bomb, you have to act quick.
I seen it on some TV show or some movie or something.
- Saw what?
- Check it out.
What are you doing?
!
Disarming it.
Are you crazy?
!
It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.
That's not what you do with a bomb!
Are you insane?
!
What was that?
It's not my phone.
It's the thing, whatever that is.
- What are you talking about?
- It's that.
That's what just made that noise.
I, uh...
It, like, imitated my ring-tone.
This is what made our phones barf?
Did you hear that?
Whoa, whoa.
All right, so, a couple of seconds ago, our phones went crazy.
Bananas, insane.
I don't know what to call it.
Look.
You see that?
It's a new map, but on my phone this time.
To me?
All right, him, or...
Dude, Munch's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and, ugh, I don't even know what that is.
Alex's phone, it just turned on by itself and started filming.
We can't even turn them off.
Oh, don't try to act like it's not cool.
That is weird.
It's showing us where we are.
And you don't find that creepy?
What do you think that is?
You think that's a road?
We should follow the map.
How about no.
How about yes?
We wanted a last night together, so what do you call this?
A trap?
Didn't you guys see the "No Trespassing" sign?
Oops.
I didn't see anything.
This is where the map says to go.
Stop stepping on leaves.
There's leaves everywhere.
Shh.
What was that?
Where do you think it's taking us to?
Maybe another one of those beepy things.
What was that?
I don't know.
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Get down!
Oh, geez!
Munch, watch out!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
What's going on?
Dude, Munch, what was that?
Where is it?
Is it over?
Oh, geez.
Dude!
Tuck, stay back.
- Whoa.
- Stay back.
What's...
Dude!
Wait, wait, be careful.
Your phone just got a new map.
What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait, why is it opening?
Hold on, hold on.
Did you see that just now?
What is that?
- Whoa!
What is that?
- What is that?
- What is that?
- Oh, my...
Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.
It-It's moving.
There's something in there right now.
What's in there?
Oh, don't tell me.
Are those... eyes?
Dude, dude, it's looking dead at us right now.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
It's trembling like it's hurt.
Good.
My heart's beating so fast right now.
Wow.
Almost got us killed, like, three times already.
Yeah, but it was worth it, dude.
Incredible.
All right, so...
I just figured out why Alex's camera was on this whole time.
So this thing, whatever it is, it's eyes are, like, all screwed up, completely.
You see?
So, basically, it uses his phone to see.
That's insane.
You think he can see us right now?
Munch, you have to check this out.
This is amazing.
Is it?
Is it amazing?
'Cause I think it's scary as balls.
I mean, obviously people are looking for it.
- Munch...
- It has access to our voicemails and our texts and our ringtones.
How do you even know it's a he?
Are you a dude?
Wait... you understood us.
Whoa.
All right, here's how it goes.
One beep is yes, two beeps are no.
Watch.
Is one beep yes?
Yo, that's so tight.
Are we in a barn?
Is Munch really a woman?
Oh, come on, man, this thing is broken.
Everybody knows Munch is a woman.
Okay, I have a question.
Are we gonna die tonight?
Why isn't it answering?
What...
Well, that's not good, right?
20 questions with an alien.
Tuck Simms exclusive.
- Let's do this.
- Check it out.
All right, um, are you from space?
Ooh!
Are you a robot?
Do you eat humans?
Do you like Earth?
Why?
Why doesn't he like Earth?
Do you like us?
You see?
I told you.
We're cool like that.
Come on.
Are you hurt?
- Oh.
- He's hurt.
Well, his lights seem brighter, so...
Did that piece help you?
Oh.
Can we help fix you or something?
Or...
Like, what is this?
Are you trying to build something?
Oh, he's trying to build...
Building something.
Right there.
- What could he be building?
- Yeah.
So, wait, what are, what are you building?
Lasers?
A portal?
Minions?
A cloaking device?
It's an army.
Ignore him.
Spaceship?
Oh, my God!
Hold up, hold up.
So let me get this right.
So you're building a spaceship,
- He's building a spaceship, - and you need our help building the spaceship?
Oh, man.
This guy is building a spaceship.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Let me make sure I don't have any plans.
Nope!
We're building a spaceship!
He's building a spaceship.
We asked him questions for almost two hours.
Where he came from.
If there were others here like him.
We found out he was lost... and alone.
He was out in the middle of nowhere, on his own, like us.
All we really knew was that he crashed, and now he needed us to rebuild him.
The map says up ahead.
Are we going the right way?
Look, look, look, look, whatever that is, the map goes to it.
All right, so wait-wait a minute.
Let me get this right.
Dude comes from a million light-years away, and he wants to come here?
I don't know, the map said so.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You got to look both ways before you cross the street.
Munch.
So are you... snoopy.
Ten dollars?
- I said no deal.
- $7.50.
I don't want it.
It's tchotchke trash.
If you give it to me as a gift, I'd still throw it away.
- It's trash.
- No, it's vintage.
No.
You don't get to say the word "vintage."
I'm the one who gets to say when what is vintage.
Excuse me, sir, you have a very, very lovely shop.
Come on, you sure?
Hey.
Oh, man, look at the hand painting.
It's all crafted right there.
- One of a kind.
- It's trash.
Uh, uh...
What was that?
F-sharp?
No, no, no!
Come on!
Watch out!
Watch out!
What was it?
Whoa.
Is everybody okay?
Hey, Nichols, are you alive?
They broke my girlfriend's lamp!
Wait, what is he doing?
- Oh.
Whoa, whoa.
- Is that...
Sweet babushka.
You want to sell it?
- Tuck, let's go!
Come on!
- Run!
What are you waiting for?
Dude, that place was wrecked!
Sorry again, sir!
Go!
Go!
Down here!
Let's get somewhere so we can look at him.
He's shaking.
Whoa, he's letting you touch him.
- I wouldn't, guys.
- Hey, what about here?
Here, set him on here.
He looks scared.
Yeah, why is he all balled up?
Can't you stand?
You all right?
Maybe he's... maybe he's just shy.
- Ooh, can you fly?
- Can you do X-ray vision?
How?
He can't see.
He doesn't even know where to look.
All right, all right, I think the question is, what can you do?
Okay, so Dr. Nichols is doing a surgical procedure with very sophisticated technology.
Pen caps.
Clear.
Wait, I don't get it.
How is that sophisticated?
It's kind of just, like, pen caps.
I got it.
Be careful.
His legs are fragile.
Whoa.
Get this.
Are you getting this?
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Oh, that's crazy!
So you can't fly, but you can float.
That is so crazy!
I saw you.
I saw you grinning, man.
Stop trying to pretend like that wasn't cool.
- That was hot.
- This is crazy.
I mean, it's just crazy.
Whoa.
Don't drop it.
Huh.
Can you see me?
Huh, I think he likes you.
Will you show us where you live?
All right.
Beep faster if I'm getting close.
Is that it, right there?
Why don't I go first.
Hi.
Um, my name's Alex, and... you're in...
Munch, no... you're in my hand right now.
You know my ring-tone, which is, like, insane and awesome.
Okay, um...
Hi.
I'm Tuck.
What's up?
I don't even know what to say, but, uh... but, uh, I'm from...
I'm from New York.
Uh, this is Nevada.
I don't even know, like, I like donuts,
- um...
- Donuts?
Really?
Okay, can somebody else do this?
I know, I'm going.
My name's M...
My real name is Reginald, but my friends call me Munch.
I hope we can be friends, too.
Do you have a name?
Oh, we could call him Beep.
Dude, what-what kind of name is Beep?
Word.
We got to give him a name that's powerful, like... like Master Blaster.
He doesn't blast anything.
Peter.
Peter.
What about Peter?
Something cool, like Space Ninja or something.
Well, how is there a ninja in space?
He wouldn't be able to breathe.
- All right, all right...
- Dude, you don't know that.
Have you ever been to space?
Which name do you like?
Uh, Beep.
Why?
There it is.
- Hello.
Watch this.
Watch this.
- You can't echo...
Watch this.
Just...
Beep.
See?
Echo.
That's what we should call it.
Echo.
- Oh, 'cause it echoes.
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Echo, Echo, Echo.
- Echo.
Your name... is Echo.
Echo...
Echo...
I don't think he's supposed to come out of that cylinder thing.
He looks... dead.
Echo?
So then we didn't know how broken he was.
The crash hurt him worse than we thought.
Okay, little guy... where do you want us to go?
Guys?
You know this is considered being a burglar, right?
With each new piece, he got strong.
And that's what we were gonna do... make him stronger.
Which way?
Around.
- In the house?
!
- Dude!
Maybe we should just knock on the door and...
We just need you to listen, sweetheart.
-
- Oh, man.
- You're grounding me?
Tuck, what are you doing?
Munch, go.
It's the man... the man should choose his dance partner.
It's a stupid tradition.
Really, it's about meeting new people, and many of those were our friends' sons.
And it's embarrassing when you ignore them.
And these are life skills that we are teaching you.
- Tuck, get back.
- Putting on this dress for you doesn't change me into some perfect little homecoming queen!
Okay, no one's asking you to act like a homecoming queen.
It's at least three years away.
Now.
Go, go, go.
...by the company you keep.
It's a cliché for a reason.
I'm sure this all seems...
Guys, what are we doing?
We're gonna be trapped up here.
Everybody be quiet.
Yeah, everyone!
You got to be kidding me.
Aw, you know what?
Everyone just follow me, all right?
Don't look at anything.
Just hurry.
- Hey, Tuck, did you see this?
- No, don't...
Dude, Tuck, this is Mannequin Girl's house.
Now we can ask for permission to steal stuff, 'cause, you know, you guys are kissing buddies.
Aw, man...
It was a couple of days ago.
She probably forgot about it by now, you know?
Like, yeah, it's...
yeah, she probably forgot.
- How would she forget about it?
- I almost forgot about it...
- Oh, boy, get ready.
- Uh-oh.
Close the door.
Close the door.
- Guys...
- Dude, we just got to keep it from going crazy.
It's gonna get loud.
We'll catch it in a blanket.
- What?
- Whoa!
- Get down!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Stop letting it move!
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
How to unfold a napkin?
!
- Who cares!
- Fine!
And in no time in my life am I gonna be somewhere
- that even plays the foxtrot!
- Close the door.
Yo, put it away, man.
Shh.
Be quiet.
What the...?
Wait, I know you.
Hey.
It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey, we're with Tuck.
Tuck Simms.
You know?
Remember you guys kissed?
- We what?
- Yeah, what are you talking about, huh?
Why is my room destroyed?
Why are you filming this?
- And what is that?
- Um, it's a... it's a car muffler.
No.
I want to know what that is.
It's actually a spaceship.
- Munch!
- Sorry.
Uh, well, we-we were following maps, and it just happened to lead here, so we were trying to help our friend Echo...
well, he's an alien
- Oh, God...
- ...that we're trying to get him on a ship.
See, look, it used to have six symbols, but now it has three, so that means we're almost there.
Crazy, right?
Munch, will you shut up?
An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?
- Nope.
- No, no.
- You did not just see that.
- Yeah, I did.
Yeah, she definitely saw it.
- Wait.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, I want to go.
- Really?
Sounds great.
What?
No.
- Dude...
- You're not part of our group, so why don't you just go play with your super rich friends...
That's kind of harsh and your ball gowns and just go eat steak or something.
- What the hell?
- Go, go, go.
Dang, dude, what was that upstairs?
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you so mad.
Yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.
All right, let's just...
don't talk about...
Nothing happened in there, all right?
You know, they say the girls you argue with are the ones you like.
Don't go there, Bro.
Tuck, it's over there.
Wait, it wants us to go to a bar?
Man, I say we climb in a window or find a door.
There's got to be another way.
Um, before-before we go...
I really need to get the pee out of my body.
Let's just hope the next place isn't a bank.
I can't believe you told that girl to get lost.
- You're so dramatic.
- What about you?
You invented a whole kiss, didn't you?
Uh, first of all, for your info, it's called aspirational thinking.
You're thinking it one moment, you're living it the next.
- How's that working out?
- Oh, excuse me.
Go to the bikes.
Oh, God, oh, God.
- Why is the construction man...
- Shut...
- Excuse me.
- Aw...
Hey.
I know you guys.
You're the guys... you're from the construction site, right?
Uh, with the, uh, with the camera?
Whoa-ho, wait, wait.
Why aren't you guys at home right now?
You guys weren't riding your bikes out around the desert, were you?
- No, of course not.
- Yes.
Uh, no.
That doesn't sound too... clear.
- Uh...
- Thank God.
There you are.
- What?
- Who-who are you?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Exactly!
It's like I don't even know anymore.
My mom had to drag my dad from the bar... again!
- What?
- He likes to go there more than he likes to tuck in his own kids at night.
At least that's what my mom says.
What's she talking about?
That's her.
Eating a burrito.
She east when she's stressed.
I ask myself if that's gonna be me one day.
What do you think?
Is it?
We make mistakes and we get married and we go to bars.
And these... these are my only friends in the world,
- 'cause they see me
- Uh... for who I really am.
That's your mom over there?
- Do you want to meet her?
- No.
No.
No, no.
Just get home safe!
Told you guys I wanted to go.
What the...?
Okay, so this girl, man, she'd been tailing us since her house, spying on us like some creepy stalker.
- She'd overheard our whole plan.
- She... she's crazy.
- I need the bag!
- I think I like it.
Oh, boy, get ready.
All right, try to blend in.
Look old.
That must've been some good fake I.D.'s.
What's up, baby face?
What are you doing in here, little man?
Oh, uh, I, uh...
- Are you Randy's kid?
- Uh,
- yes, he is.
- Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's my dad... or mom.
- You know, dad.
Mom.
- Okay, dude, just go.
Hurry up.
Emma?
Emma?
I was hanging out with this really pretty chick.
She's almost as pretty as you.
I mean... you're not pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.
Come over here.
Hop up on that stool.
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Oh, and one for his buddy here, too.
No, no, I'm all right.
Seriously, I'm all right.
- Sure, you'll like it.
- Sorry, I'm a...
I'm allergic.
Oh, you're gonna love it.
- Uh, no, no.
- You're gonna get one.
So, what happens next?
- Just give me back my bag.
- No.
Give it.
I'm serious.
Give me the bag.
Why are you being mean to me?
- Here, honey.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Yeah.
Wow, a lot of people with beards and mustaches in here, you know?
You don't understand.
Whenever you get close to the next piece, it goes crazy.
Oh, my God!
Whoa!
Aah!
- Uh...
- Are you kidding me?
Do you guys just go around town breaking stuff?
Just keep running!
Go, go!
What was that?
I think the ship's trying to take off!
Whoa, whoa!
Are you seeing this?
This thing is flying a ship... in your backpack?
I think he's getting better.
Oh.
So, you don't know how he crashed, or when, or why he came here with a spaceship in the first place?
Look, he only answers yes or no... it's not that simple.
Is this how I talk to him?
So, you crashed.
Did someone cause you to crash?
Dude, what's she doing?
- I don't know.
- Someone on Earth?
Do you think they're looking for you?
It's not those guys in trucks from the convenience store, is it?
The construction man?
Those are the guys that shot you down?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We got to take a step back.
This is way bigger and shadier than before, okay?
This is not good.
If those dudes are looking for Echo, they're looking for us, you know?
Echo?
You need some help there, buddy?
Hey, it's okay.
Shh.
Breathe like me, okay?
It's okay.
Dude, he'll be fine.
No.
We're not leaving him.
My whole life, I've been left.
I know how it feels.
We're all he's got.
- Uh, left?
- We could find a shortcut.
The map says up ahead.
This map's confusing.
I was a mind ninja back there...
- So, what was it like kissing me?
- Give me my camera.
Did your legs get all wobbly?
Was there soft music playing?
Please remind me, Tuck.
I totally forgot.
- What was it like?
- You're close.
Is this your first imaginary kiss?
The map says for us to go inside.
I'm confused.
- Huh?
- Didn't you guys kiss?
Anyway, the point is,
Emma was being annoying...
she kept walking off with Echo like she owned him, and talking to him about
I don't know what, I don't even know.
You know what?
Delete.
Man, are we sure there's no security guards or...
You know, that door wasn't even looked.
Hey, uh, guys, I was just thinking, you know,
I... haven't got to actually hold the, you know, the ship, before we did the thing, so can I do it?
- You know, before it gets crazy?
- Sure, but... it's not a ship.
What?
What are you talking about?
He told us it was a ship.
It's a key to your ship, right?
Well, if this is just the key, where's the spaceship?
All right, Munch, put it down.
Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.
Okay, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to put it down
- before you hurt both of us.
- I need this, man.
That's weird.
- Does it know her?
- I don't know.
Munch!
Whoa!
Whoa!
You okay?
- Yeah.
- What are you guys doing?
- Wow.
- Um, she was gonna get hit by the piece, so I saved her.
Hey!
You four!
Freeze!
- Run!
- Which way?
- Tuck!
- Stop right there!
Stop!
Go, go!
Hurry up!
Hold up, hold up!
Did Alex get out?
Uh, I d...
I don't know.
- We have to go back.
- Uh...
- Come on, you guys.
- Okay.
Look.
Whoa, whoa.
She's being stupid.
There's a guard in there, you know?
You can't just go running in, acting crazy.
We need a plan, or...
S... right?
Breaking and entering, destruction of property.
Those are felonies, kid.
Okay, Echo, I need your help.
Um, I need you to...
do something.
I have a minor here; he's 13.
Caught him breaking in with his friends.
If you could send an officer down.
Stay put.
Hello?
Anybody there?
Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
...there...
Is anybody there... there...
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Alex.
Alex.
- Wh...
Where's Tuck?
- We got to go.
- We should've gone back.
- All right, you know what?
Calm down, because if people would've listened to me, then Alex never would have gotten caught.
Didn't I say there would be security guards?
Alex!
Dude!
You're all right!
Are you all right?
Hey, Alex, we're good, man.
All right?
- Buddy?
- We're good, man?
Alex.
Come on, dude.
Alex!
We could've gone home, but we didn't.
- We were outside.
- Turn off the camera.
Not till you admit you're acting mopey for no reason.
You're always freaking out if anyone's gonna leave you behind.
Do you know how expensive that is?
I'm glad I'm moving.
You were never my friend.
- Is that right?
Is that right?
- Guys, guys,
- come on, just-just chill out.
- Come on!
Have you lost your mind?
I acted like I didn't know what I'd done.
But I knew exactly.
I know we're all tired and stuff, and hungry.
I saw this awesome diner.
We can totally just go grab
- a bite to eat or something.
- Real awesome, guys.
Real macho.
So, that's it?
The night's over?
Doesn't have to be.
Right?
Well, I mean, if it is, uh, we could...
I don't know, I guess we can keep the mood going, yeah?
Or we can do it another time, right?
Good times, the continuation, part two.
Right?
Hmm.
You know what?
I'm gonna talk about Sandra.
Man, that girl used to beat the crap out of you.
Me, too.
We were both little, small and scrawny.
She was a big girl, and she knew it.
But then I had a growth spurt, and you didn't, and I finally did something.
You remember that?
You told herl had polio.
Yeah, I told her that, and did she beat you up after that?
She still beat me up.
'Cause I always get your back, man.
I never let you down;
I always get your back.
Most of the time.
Just when I'm not freaked out about security guards, all right?
I'm sorry, man.
Are we good?
Yeah.
Dude.
Faster.
Sure are doing some traveling tonight.
My parents are in the bathroom.
Uh-huh.
Let it go.
What are you doing?
- Dude!
Hey, what are you doing?
!
- Oh, God!
Don't grab our stuff like that!
- Stop!
- Hey, give me the backpack!
- Who do you think you are?
- The police have been instructed to come and pick up these kids and take them home.
He can't just walk away.
What was it?
- The phone.
- No, no, no!
- Munch!
- Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
Oh, my...
Munch!
This is not real, this is not real, this is not real right now.
Don't let them see you.
Now!
Munch!
Do you see the truck?
Munch!
Munch!
That guy is not a construction worker.
- It's Munch.
- I need help, guys.
I really didn't think this through.
We're here, we're here.
Are you hurt?
Can you guys hear me...?
- Are you okay?
- Where are you, Munch?
We'll find you, all right?
I promise.
I think I'm at the construction site.
- Come on, buddy.
- Munch!
I can see the big lights and up at those... the white trucks...
How far is your neighborhood?
It's way over an hour.
All right, I think I got a faster way.
Who wants to go to a party?
Are you sure he'll even be here?
Better be.
His girlfriend's throwing it.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Sophomores.
Hey, sweet party.
Sweet jams.
Guys, what are we doing here?
We can't be...
Just look for my brother.
Look for his keys.
- Oh, my gosh, it's the cops.
- Okay.
Oh, God, the keys, the keys.
I lost my keys.
I have a Porsche.
Marcus!
Oh, not you, sorry.
I wasn't trying to stop the fun...
I like it.
Whoa...!
Hi.
Uh, sorry to bother everyone.
Have you seen my brother, Marcus?
Tall guy?
You seen his car keys?
- Uh, anyone?
- Guys, the cops are here!
- What?
- Yeah, the cops are here.
- Turn it down, turn it down.
- Dude, stop...
No, I'm serious, the cops are here right now.
Alex!
Alex!
We have to go now.
All right, just come on, come on.
We got to move.
Hurry, hurry.
We can't hide here.
Look, look, just stay here.
He's my brother;
I'll find him.
Just... don't let the cops take the footage.
All right?
You live here, right?
The cops!
Marcus?
Marcus, we're here.
The party's shut down.
That's enough.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Tuck's gonna freak.
Uh, here, check his pockets.
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.
Cops are gone.
- Uh, Tuck, Tuck?
- I have no idea where Marcus is.
Yeah.
Tell me you got that on tape?
My name is Reginald "Munch" Barrett.
This is my...
kind of my final message.
To my best friends...
I love you, guys.
You're Googling it?
Really?
Oh, come on, this is what the Internet is for.
Um, "step one, get a driver's license."
- Do we have one of those?
- Oh, wow.
All right, am I good?
Stop!
Stop!
All right, all right.
Dude, do you even know what you're doing?
No, I don't.
"Step two, be calm."
What are you doing?
!
- Sorry, sorry.
- Be calm is step two?
All right, all right, all right.
I got it, I got it.
Hold on a Sec..
- Stop!
- Tuck, Tuck, turn!
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.
- Uh...
- Oh, my God.
We're good, we're good.
All right, I'm excited.
Should I gun it?
- No, no, no, don't.
- No, Tuck.
I need, I need music.
Somebody just play some music.
All right.
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my God.
Change it.
Everywhere we'd been that night, shot by us like a rocket.
All we wanted was our friends back.
I'm gonna miss it here, man.
Yeah, me too.
Here we go.
I don't know about this.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
That does not look like a freeway.
Get down.
Shh, Shh.
All right, so what's the plan?
I don't know.
Get him out?
So, in other words, we don't have a plan.
Go, go, go.
I'm just gonna call Munch's phone and see if his phone rings.
Wait a minute.
Dude, my camera's not a doorstop.
I hear his voice.
Shh.
I knew it was you guys 'cause I saw the same truck from my neighborhood.
Tell us the truth.
I had a lot of adrenaline rush, and...
I...
I didn't want the night to end.
And I... and it was the last night with Alex.
Oh, shit, Munch.
Stop crying and talk to us.
This is not good.
I'm not...
I'm not crying!
What?
Where is that?
We got to find him and get him out of there, man.
Just don't kill me!
Did he access your phones at all?
Were there others like it or was this the only one you found?
What are they doing?
Dude, they're breaking him!
Guys?
Guys, someone's coming.
We should go.
Go, go.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, construction man!
- Give me the camera.
- Listen...
This is not your camera.
Hey, guys, go!
- And find Munch!
- Let go of me!
Get off of us, man, this isn't...
- My camera!
- Let go.
Is that thing still on?
Okay, no more lies.
No more sneaking around.
No more cameras, understand?
Son, look at me.
Look at me.
Oh, I see better with my glasses on, you know?
This signal has been transmitting for a very long time, from a ship that we believe is located right here in your neighborhood.
- What?
- Wait, what's he talking about?
Six days ago, an object entered our atmosphere at 20,000 miles an hour, on a direct course for that ship.
We shot it down.
What you found activates the ship, and if that ship takes off, it could kill everyone.
He just wants to go home.
Okay, that will not happen.
He is far too valuable.
This is crazy, this is crazy.
So... we are gonna follow this map and you are gonna help us get that thing operational, and it will lead us back to its ship, and we will disable it permanently.
Am I clear?
Am I clear?
Y...
Yeah.
Good.
Check the doors, check the doors.
It's locked;
it's not just looked.
They don't have a handle on it.
- Someone help!
- Where are they taking us?
Hey, yo!
Let us out, man!
Someone!
Well, the sun's up.
Our parents are gonna find out.
I think we got bigger problems than our parents.
Where are we?
Let's go!
All right, everybody knows the drill.
Let's set it up.
- He's not moving.
- Stop!
Can you see me?
Beep?
We're all here.
We're gonna get you home, all right?
We'll find a way.
Nichols, man, it's not there.
No.
Please, you have to work.
Just try.
Echo?
Don't!
Echo!
You can't go; you can't!
It's over.
Let's keep them quiet.
Come on, man.
It's...
It's time to go.
What's happening?
What is that?
Here he goes.
Back up.
Get ready.
Whoa.
Okay, now!
Where are we going?
Home!
His ship's in Mulberry Woods.
Dude, go!
How do I drive?
Will you drive?
!
Please drive!
Just hurry up!
Alex, dude, you don't have your seat belt on!
.Just speed up!
- Just go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
They're right there!
You have to speed!
- I'm trying!
- You're driving...!
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
- Tuck, you're gonna get us killed!
- Where do I go?
- Just go around them.
- No, hold on.
- Don't go on the wrong side!
Dude, stop, stop!
- Oh!
- What the...?
- Oh, my gosh.
- Whoa, whoa!
Are you...
Are you seeing this?
Thanks, buddy.
I need an Advil.
We can't afford this right now.
We really can't afford this right now.
Dude, look, there's a new map.
A what?
Here, here, give me the phones back.
I think that's his ship.
Whoa, that's a big ship.
Alex, I don't want to stress you out or anything, but they're right there!
Oh, my God.
Alex, it's your mom.
- Don't answer it.
- Why would I answer it?
- Betty?
- Dude.
- Munch.
- Betty?
Hi.
- Sorry about my tone last night.
- Oh, I just thought it would be nice to have the boys have a nice night
- together before we're all uprooted.
- You're crying.
- Munch, it's your mom.
- What?
!
Look, look, look, look.
Dude.
- You okay?
- So, Janice, gotta go... on my jog.
Can we act like we never had this conversation?
Uh, uh, just come over this wall.
Are you up?
- Guys, they're here.
- Jump.
- Move!
- Faster!
They can't catch us in our own backyard.
Let's cut them off.
Munch, hurry up!
- Okay, okay.
- Munch!
Well, I don't jump walls very much, man!
Here, hold my camera.
Dude, come on, come on, come on.
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Tuck, wait!
They're right behind us!
Come on, guys, we got to go, we got to go.
Let's go, right now.
It's down the hill.
Come on, let's go!
Shh.
Go, go, go.
It says the ship is up ahead.
This is the way to your house, man.
- Go, go, go, guys!
- Are your parents awake?
I think we...
I think we lost them.
Okay.
I don't...
I don't get it.
I...
This is where the map ends.
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship.
Maybe it's invisible.
What is it?
Wait, what-what's he talking about?
What do you want us to...
Dude, what?
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa...
- Oh.
Everybody good?
What's down there?
Be careful, man.
What?
That's it.
Dude, it-it's underneath.
So this whole time...
That's why they want all our houses.
They were digging.
Yo, Alex, I know what you're thinking.
Alex!
Alex, man!
Th...
The only way that thing can take off is to come up out of the ground through us.
That's a really bad idea.
Dude, what are you doing?
This is not just about us anymore.
It's about other people now, a whole community still asleep in their beds.
Let's just think this through first.
- I trust him.
- Listen to us.
Alex!
Alex!
Alex!
Is this where we're supposed to be?
Make up a plan.
- No, we got to run.
- What are you talking about?
- If the ship's right under...
- We can't leave.
- I know we can't leave him.
- What about Alex?
What about everyone up here that's gonna die?
Alex!
Dude, say something!
Oh, my God.
I left you behind once.
I'm not doing it again.
Hi, guys.
Whoa.
Whoa.
This... this is in-insane.
So, um, beep.
Uh, um,
I don't really know how to say good-bye... so I'm not gonna.
And, um...
Um...
You're my friend, you know?
Even when I'm old, even when... even when you think I've forgotten...
I'm always gonna be there.
Do you feel that?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, we need to go now!
We have to go.
Bye.
Go, go, go!
Wait, wait, wait, my camera!
Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Dude, are you all right?
- Everybody good?
- Are you all right?
Okay.
That was so close.
What the heck?
- Oh, my...
- What the...?
Yeah!
Oh, my God.
Dude, this is amazing.
I think you're gonna want to get this.
Oh!
We did it, dude.
We did it.
Dude!
Did you see that?
Did you see...
- Wow.
We did that!
- You're like...
That's insane.
We just did that!
That's...
Look, come on.
Look, look, people want to know what happened.
If we told them what happened, they wouldn't believe us.
Guys, it's morning.
Oh, crap, I gotta get home.
- My dad is gonna kill me.
- I think I need a ride.
We should go because people, they'll start asking...
Hey, buddy...
Did you guys feel that earthquake?
- Were you okay?
- No, Mom, I'm fine.
- Let me see.
- He's fine.
Honey, he's fine.
Did no one just see the giant spaceship?
!
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, a spaceship.
What just happened?
!
Oh, oh, okay, okay.
I know it's been really hard lately,
- and we've all been really overwhelmed.
- Just...
Why don't we... why don't we just go in and relax.
Maybe we can, um, go get that-that pizza we talked about.
- All right?
Yeah.
- Pizza?
- If we don't play along,
- Yeah, his mom saw the ship.
- Nobody's gonna get it okay?
- How could I play along?
- So just...
- Yes, I'm sure.
I found them here at Alex's.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, no, no.
Actually, uh, we found him here.
I thought he was staying with you.
No, I was told they were at Munch's.
I'll call you back, babe.
Yeah, yeah, they were at my house.
We-we played this game where you play as a guy with the soul of a dragon, and it had really good voices.
The voices were great, so...
Who's this?
That's Emma.
I'm, uh, he's my boyfriend.
I mean, friend who's a boy.
- Um...
- Awkward.
She's hot, right?
Knock it off, you.
Six hours later, Alex moved.
I just got grounded for, like, life.
Me, too.
Might as well move now.
Not gonna be seeing anyone for a while.
Yeah.
But this... what really happened tonight... no one knows but us.
Hey, Alex!
Time to go, buddy.
I'm gonna miss you guys.
You guys smell really bad.
Our last night together, we did a lot.
A whole lot.
But there's some things we couldn't do.
Alex's parents had already bought a new home.
Most of the neighborhood had.
Munch's, too.
So, one by one, people started to move.
My parents hadn't, so we got to stay.
New people started moving in, and Mulberry Wood started again,
but not the one that had my friends in it.
When you're a kid, you think you're invisible.
You think you can't make a difference.
We're not kids anymore.
We know now... that we can do anything.
Having a friend light-years away taught us that distance is just a state of mind.
If you're best friends, then you always will be no matter where you are in the universe.
Guys, my just...
my phone just...
You guys got to see this.
Hey, hey, Tuck, dude.
- Okay, we're rolling.
- Okay, hold on.
B-Before you go, look-look at my coat.
- It's cool, huh?
- What is that?
Can we do another take with it on, though?
No.
Okay.
Ready when you are.
Okay.
How do I smell?
Or I mean, look, or you know?
Yeah, you can't smell a video.
Okay.
Ruckus, dude, you got to get out of here.
Hi, I'm Reginald.
I don't really get friends much, but it's probably because I'm a bit of... an acquired taste.
That's what my mom says.
And I'm sure whatever school I'm forced to go to no one will acquire it.
So... thanks for paving a road over, really, the only place I've ever had any real friends.
Okay, we good?
- Uh, say your name.
- I thought you knew my name.
You know what I mean; for the video.
Dude, we've been hanging out for years.
- Come on.
- Dude, stop fronting.
Just tell the camera.
You're upset, right?
You don't want to move.
I've never gone a day without seeing my friends.
They're, like, the only people in the world who get me.
And now it's just all over, you know?
Good luck finding that again.
So wherever-wherever Munch is going, man...
Look, you people listen to me, all right?
He's-he's a really good kid.
So don't just assume that he's weird and that's it.
And Alex, man...
He's a foster kid.
He's been moved all over.
I mean, it's like, why do you have to build a freeway right through?
You know, can't you just go around or something?
You're going along feeling like your own person with your own friends, and then something like this comes along... that you have no power to stop... because you're just a kid.
You're just a kid.
Yeah, hey, man.
Yeah, yeah, I'm up, I'm up.
Whoa, whoa, man, slow down.
What's the problem?
Yeah, my-my phone's good.
Why?
What happened?
Wait, what?
This is when everything started to change.
So, being me,
I kept filming.
I'm Tuck.
What you're about to see happened to me and my best friends one year ago.
This is the story of our last week together.
Phones all over our neighborhood are freaking out.
We've done everything we could possibly do with this phone.
We threw it at the wall, we took it to the phone guy, we took it to the store where we got it from, and they say it's a problem.
So you know it's serious.
It looks like your phone basically barfed on the screen.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I was just eating dinner, and all of a sudden, all the phones in the house just did this.
At exactly the same time.
Dude.
What?
It's freaky.
- De hello?
- Hey, Alex.
Oh, Munch, you're outside.
Get over here, over here, down the street.
Ask him if his phone barfed yet.
Did your phone barf yet?
- Phones are still working.
- Cool.
Keep going, and we'll meet you in the backyard.
Okay, copy that.
I'll take swift steps.
When I look back at that day,
I realize the clues were all around us.
We had no idea.
Dude, they all still work.
See?
Dude, you know if this whole thing works,
- these phones are done.
- No, I know.
I have 14 spares; it's okay.
- I bet you do.
- Okay.
All right, anyways, let's spread out.
- Okay.
- Alex, go by the gate.
Munch, go on the far end,
- Yeah, I got it.
- And I'll stay right here by my camera.
- Just watch out!
- Okay, okay.
Okay, it's good.
It's good...
It's good...
Whoa, okay, it went out.
Whoa, whoa, it barfed!
All right, people, if you go to Alex's house, your phones will spew chunks all over his screen.
My mom said the Murphys' phones and the Churleys' changed, too.
So what do you think this is?
Whoa!
These dudes.
Hi.
- Is that on?
- I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Oh.
We had an electrical short over at the site, and it may be disrupting people's phone service, and we're wondering if that happened
- to anybody in this house?
- Oh, no, my phone is good.
- 'Cause we're offering new phone vouchers
- Uh-huh.
in exchange for any device in this area here
- that may be displaying
- That's weird, that's weird.
- Faulty messages or images?
- I don't know.
See you.
No, listen, I...
Okay, so you-you really don't think this is a little bit weird?
These dudes come here to build a freeway
- and now they want our phones?
- Well, I think it's gonna work.
No.
Clean your room.
Oh, my...
I'm not gonna have a room if we don't do something.
- Right, I think...
- No, Mom, seriously.
These guys want our houses.
Maybe if we expose them for illegal property, then...
- Yo!
- Aw, you don't like how things are, do you?
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
Dude, it's a map to the desert.
Like, what is that?
What do we do with this?
I guess most maps are made to be followed.
Exactly.
It could go to, like, some crazy headquarters, and we find out that these construction clowns are spies and we expose them to the world.
It's 20 miles away.
What...
No, we're not... we're not gonna go.
No, obviously not.
Look, whatever it is, this Saturday, we're going to sneak behind our parents' backs and find out.
I'm moving Saturday.
All right, all right, so Friday night.
Our last night together?
It doesn't have to be;
that's what I'm saying.
Like, I don't want to move, and these clowns are making us do it.
Maybe we can stop them.
Now, are you in?
Yeah, all right.
- A ll right.
- I'm in.
Munch, don't you bail out on us now.
Dude, I'm not.
Me?
No... pfft!
I'm in.
Yeah!
All right!
That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, all right.
Bring it in.
- Oh, oops!
- Munch!
So, why would you be organizing your ketchups?
- Because.
- Who does that?
So I can get to them easier, and then it's more organized,
- and it's better.
- And you are my friend.
Guys, guys, it's time to practice the big lie.
Hey, Mom, I'm spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a neat, brand-new video game.
And I'm sleeping over at Tuck's house so we can play a new video game.
And I'm sleeping in your mom's bed,
- not playing a video game.
- Oh, my God, all right, dude.
Stop talking about my mother, thank you.
All right, the camera's are gonna be on 24 hours a day, nonstop.
Dude, can you stop touching, please?
It attaches to my bike, and it's also a pretty good way to get footage on the fly.
Spy glasses.
I love these;
I love them.
And last, camera, but definitely not least...
What up, camcorder?
Keeping it tight.
Looking pretty good these days.
Tuck, these are the ugliest things I've ever seen.
Dude, what?
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Those are...
They're sweet.
- The camera's undetectable,
- Wow.
- And the ladies love them.
- Prove it.
Prove it?
This guy, all right?
Give me my glasses, man.
Those are stealth.
Now I'm gonna prove to you guys spy glasses get you girls.
Oh, my gosh, he's going over there.
- I can't see who he's talking to.
- Shut up, Munch.
Uh, hi, uh...
Hey, um, Em-Emma, right?
Emma?
I was just...
Okay, uh, can I borrow a piece of paper, please?
He has something.
- I can't see who he got it from.
- We're about to see right now.
Look, look, look, look.
He has a paper.
You did not get her number.
Totally got her number.
Right there.
You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.
You, too, you're a sellout.
No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.
Yes, I did.
Mannequin Girl?
What kind of name is that?
What?
That's what I call her.
I think mannequins are hot.
I'll leave my house at 6:00.
15 minutes later, I pick up Alex.
- Munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Tonight, we're no longer boys.
We're men.
- Dude, what the...?
- I didn't see you, man.
Tuck, you all right?
Let's go.
Our whole lives we've been nobodies.
In visible.
The good kids.
Not anymore.
All right, Ma.
I'm leaving.
Spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a new video game.
Have whatever you want, honey.
You know what, I lied, actually.
We're gonna ride our bikes out into the desert at night alone.
Without supervision.
We got that; we're going to state.
Okay, see you then, sweetie.
- We could go.
- Also rob a bank.
- All the way.
State.
- What?
Go to Mexico.
Maybe even start a new life.
- Right, I know.
- Wrestling!
You're trying to act like I don't know what I'm talking about.
What's up, Stumpy?
Yo, man, I told you to stop to calling me that.
You know what, man, look, my girl's throwing this huge party later tonight, if you want to come by.
You serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
Because not a lady in the world can resist a natty old BMX bike.
What's the zero to 60 on that bad boy, huh?
Two, three days?
Come on, come on, dude, you ready?
Let's go.
I can't even tell a difference.
This looks exactly the way it looked before you packed.
All your stuff fitting in one box?
What are you, a drifter?
Who told you?
Look, all I'm saying is, when you get to your new house, put a poster up, put some shelves on the wall, frame a photo.
Look, there's a painting right there.
Put something on a shelf...
That's not a painting.
That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt, smudged it and called it art.
I'm going to Munch's house to play a video game, all right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure, buddy.
- Bye, Dylan.
- Have fun with your friends.
- Hey, hey, Tuck.
- How are you?
Uh, good luck with the move to New York, buddy.
- Maybe we'll come see you.
- All right, cool.
The moving truck is coming at 10:00.
Make sure you're back, okay?
I-I don't get it.
If your foster parents already have a baby of their own, why do they need you?
There's no sense in having two babies.
- Shut up, dude.
- One baby cries all the time, the other one listens to indie rock.
Let's go.
Yeow!
Guys, would you please help my son with his room, before I go crazy?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I don't think he's started...
Honey, have you even started packing your room?
I told you a thousand times,
I'm alphabetizing!
Yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.
Shh.
...they're flexible, they're "dynamical,"
they can be curved, they can bend, and this opens up a whole new universe of possibilities, and one of the possibilities is that there can be shortcuts through space and through time.
So that's really just what a Wormhole is.
It's taking advantage...
What are you...
Aah!
- Why don't you stop doing that?
!
- I'm sorry!
You guys are gonna give me a heart attack one day.
- I'm sorry.
- Turn that off, dude.
I created a substation for each of our parents' phones that's wired to the router, which is wired to the transmitter, which transmits to the receiver, which is...
- my phone.
- Okay, so basically, no matter who our parents call, it goes to your phone.
Yeah.
My mom's friends always say that I sound just like my mom, you know,
- when I pick up the phone...
- Yeah.
So I figured, I can be Betty.
Bye, Betty.
Thank you.
Um, I'm going to Alex's...
or Munch's... or Tuck's house, and we're gonna play a video game and sleep over.
Wait, what's all that stuff?
Honey?
Good job, Munch.
You did it.
Here we come.
17.6 miles.
Going to the desert...
Munch, what are you doing?
Guys, guys, just hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Dude...
- I'm not backing out or anything,
- He wants to quit right when we - ...just-just hear me out.
- Been waiting for this forever.
- Dude, listen, come on, okay.
This is crazy what we're doing.
Dude, I don't want to punk out or back out or anything... it's just, my mom, you know, she just got divorced.
- Munch...
- She's already had enough guys lying to her.
If you didn't want to come, then why didn't you tell us earlier?
You do understand this is our last night together.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Look, Munch, if we don't go now, we'll never go.
We won't even be here.
This is our last chance to try and do something.
Even-even if it is stupid.
- Yeah.
- You know what,
I say we put a vote to it.
All in favor raise your hand.
Well, now I have to raise my hand.
Munch, just...
Fine, fine.
Okay, whatever.
I'll go.
But only under one condition.
- I call the black!
- Mine!
No, no, give it!
It's so weird, no one's gonna be in these houses next week.
Dude, you're so full of it.
- When did you kiss her?
- Dude, trust me.
After pre-algebra, she pulled me into the bathroom.
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Mannequin Girl?
- Yeah!
- Was she good at it?
Uh, eh, B minus.
You know, I've kissed better in better locations.
No, how do I know you're not lying?
Trust me.
I don't even have to reply to you.
- You're last!
- Hey, you got a head start!
That's not fair!
Oh, so what, there's a Wing Stop?
I never been to a Wing Stop.
We followed a map out in the middle of nowhere.
It might be, like, a CIA prison.
We were miles from home.
No one in the world knew it.
No one said it... but we were scared.
We haven't seen a car in, like, half an hour.
We were on our own.
This-this is the way, right?
You have the map, right?
- Can I see the map?
- Left.
Left?
Are you sure?
Because right looks a little bit more promising.
Did you guys hear that?
Just a couple more miles.
Hold on.
What is that?
It's the map.
Are we close?
I never understood why people like the outdoors.
Will you stop freaking out?
Yo, this is too steep, man.
Let's go, man.
We're getting pretty far from the road, guys.
Almost there.
Is it this thing?
I don't think so.
Wait, what was that?
- I don't know.
- Well, hold on.
What'd you see, dude?
Over here!
We're almost there.
Come on.
Oh.
What?
What do you think it is?
How would I know?
Why does it look all burnt?
Hey, just be careful.
- Careful!
- Yeah, don't touch that thing.
Could be...
C-Could be...
I don't know, I don't know.
A part of a satellite?
All right, all right, um, Munch, film me while I'm...
- while I'm touching this thing.
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Let me try it.
Thank you.
It's dusty.
It's a piece of crap.
What?
Forget about it.
Just turn off the camera.
Well, it's not a national treasure, but it could be used for something.
It's crap.
What happened to filming 'cause it's our last night, huh?
Um, in case you haven't noticed, obviously, the map led to squat.
Got it.
So all you cared about was getting your stupid hits on your stupid video?
- Dude, why don't you just...
- Whoa, guys, guys, guys.
Come on!
I know we're all frustrated...
It's Alex's mom.
- Are you serious?
- Um, it'll be fine.
Just, um, be Betty, okay?
- Oh, man.
- Oh, crap.
Yo, I thought I could do this, but I can't.
Maybe you can answer it.
She just likes to check up on things, okay?
All right.
Betty, are you there?
Go.
This is Betty.
I was thinking maybe I could bring over some pizzas?
Dude, go.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No coming over.
- Just hang up.
- No way.
No, it's really no trouble.
We have a coupon.
- I said no!
No pizzas!
- What?
- No, uh...
- Don't yell at her, man.
Maybe you and your husband should go to bed.
Stop saying words!
Are you sure everything's okay?
Have a good night.
Go to sleep.
That could've gone better.
That was horrible.
"Your husband should go to sleep"?
Was that really something smart to say?
Munch.
Don't look at me like I'm a hoarder.
That's rude.
Who are they?
I don't...
I don't know.
I'm picking up some spikes in the readings...
Get down, get down.
Turn your flashlight off, dummy.
Let's go.
Why would they be out this far?
Who cares?
The night's blown.
- Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
Munch?
- You're a character.
- There's something in there!
What?
Dude, are you kidding me right now?
Something is in that bag.
It-it touched me.
Go check.
Be-be careful.
- What?
- Did it poke you, too?
What, dude?
Say something!
What did you see?
There-There's something in there.
Yeah, a bunch of crap Munch brought.
- You guys are funny.
- All I know is it beeped.
You know, why don't you go in there and just see.
Beeped?
What are you talking about?
Babies.
I'll do it myself.
Dang, how much stuff do you have in your bag, dude?
Geez.
Oh, boy, are you guys talking about this?
It's garbage.
It's nothing.
What are you talking about, you heard something?
It made a noise.
Hey, hey, do something!
See, it's not doing anything.
What are you talking about?
Beep.
Do that again, do that again.
Do what again?
Do what you just did.
Beep.
Whoa, hold on.
Let me...
Let me try this for myself.
Beep.
Beep?
Why is it making noise only for you and not me?
Make it beep again.
Beep.
Whoa!
This is it!
It's a bomb!
No, no, oh, God, no!
No, no, no!
Guys, I think...
I think it might have defused.
I don't know.
Man, nothing's happening.
All right, hold on, hold on.
I got an idea.
Tuck!
What?
Okay, it didn't do anything, but j-just don't do it again.
Are you insane, Tuck?
!
Are you sure you guys know what you're doing?
Yes, trust me.
When it's a bomb, you have to act quick.
I seen it on some TV show or some movie or something.
- Saw what?
- Check it out.
What are you doing?
!
Disarming it.
Are you crazy?
!
It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.
That's not what you do with a bomb!
Are you insane?
!
What was that?
It's not my phone.
It's the thing, whatever that is.
- What are you talking about?
- It's that.
That's what just made that noise.
I, uh...
It, like, imitated my ringtone.
This is what made our phones barf?
Did you hear that?
All right, so, a couple of seconds ago, our phones went crazy.
Bananas, insane.
I don't know what to call it.
Look.
You see that?
It's a new map, but on my phone this time.
To me?
All right, him, or...
Dude, Munch's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and, ugh, I don't even know what that is.
Alex's phone, it just turned on by itself and started filming.
We can't even turn them off.
Oh, don't try to act like it's not cool.
That is weird.
It's showing us where we are.
And you don't find that creepy?
What do you think that is?
You think that's a road?
We should follow the map.
How about no.
How about yes?
We wanted a last night together, so what do you call this?
A trap?
Didn't you guys see the "No Trespassing" sign?
Oops.
I didn't see anything.
This is where the map says to go.
Stop stepping on leaves.
There's leaves everywhere.
Shh.
What was that?
Where do you think it's taking us to?
Maybe another one of those beepy things.
What was that?
I don't know.
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Get down!
Oh, geez!
Munch, watch out!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
What's going on?
Dude, Munch, what was that?
Where is it?
Is it over?
Oh, geez.
Dude!
Tuck, stay back.
- Whoa.
- Stay back.
What's...
Dude!
Wait, wait, be careful.
Your phone just got a new map.
What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait, why is it opening?
Hold on, hold on.
Did you see that just now?
What is that?
- Whoa!
What is that?
- What is that?
- What is that?
- Oh, my...
Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.
It-it's moving.
There's something in there right now.
What's in there?
Oh, don't tell me.
Are those... eyes?
Dude, dude, it's looking dead at us right now.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
It's trembling like it's hurt.
Good.
My heart's beating so fast right now.
Wow.
Almost got us killed, like, three times already.
Yeah, but it was worth it, dude.
Incredible.
All right, so...
I just figured out why Alex's camera was on this whole time.
So this thing, whatever it is, it's eyes are, like, all screwed up, completely.
You see?
So, basically, it uses his phone to see.
That's insane.
You think he can see us right now?
Munch, you have to check this out.
This is amazing.
Is it?
Is it amazing?
'Cause I think it's scary as balls.
I mean, obviously people are looking for it.
- Munch...
- It has access to our voicemails and our texts and our ringtones.
How do you even know it's a he?
Are you a dude?
Wait... you understood us.
Whoa.
All right, here's how it goes.
One beep is yes, two beeps are no.
Watch.
Is one beep yes?
Yo, that's so tight.
Are we in a barn?
Is Munch really a woman?
Oh, come on, man, this thing is broken.
Everybody knows Munch is a woman.
Okay, I have a question.
Are we gonna die tonight?
Why isn't it answering?
What...
Well, that's not good, right?
20 questions with an alien.
Tuck Simms exclusive.
- Let's do this.
- Check it out.
All right, um, are you from space?
Ooh!
Are you a robot?
Do you eat humans?
Do you like Earth?
Why?
Why doesn't he like Earth?
Do you like us?
You see?
I told you.
We're cool like that.
Come on.
Are you hurt?
- Oh.
- He's hurt.
Well, his lights seem brighter, so...
Did that piece help you?
Oh.
Can we help fix you or something?
Or...
Like, what is this?
Are-are you trying to build something?
Oh, he's trying to build...
Building something.
Right there.
- What could he be building?
- Yeah.
So, wait, what are, what are you building?
Lasers?
A portal?
Minions?
A cloaking device?
It's an army.
Ignore him.
Spaceship?
Oh, my God!
Hold up, hold up.
So let me get this right.
So you're building a spaceship,
- He's building a spaceship.
- And you need our help building the spaceship?
Oh, man.
This guy is building a spaceship.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Let me make sure I don't have any plans.
Nope!
We're building a spaceship!
He's building a spaceship.
We asked him questions for almost two hours.
Where he came from.
If there were others here like him.
We found out he was lost... and alone.
He was out in the middle of nowhere, on his own, like us.
All we really knew was that he crashed, and now he needed us to rebuild him.
The map says up ahead.
Are we going the right way?
Look, look, look, look, whatever that is, the map goes to it.
All right, so wait-wait a minute.
Let me get this right.
Dude comes from a million light-years away, and he wants to come here?
I don't know, the map said so.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You got to look both ways before you cross the street.
Munch.
So are you... snoopy.
Ten dollars?
- I said no deal.
- $7.50.
I don't want it.
It's tchotchke trash.
If you give it to me as a gift, I'd still throw it away.
- It's trash.
- No, it's vintage.
No.
You don't get to say the word "vintage."
I'm the one who gets to say when what is vintage.
Excuse me, sir, you have a very, very lovely shop.
Come on, you sure?
Hey.
Oh, man, look at the hand painting.
It's all crafted right there.
- One of a kind.
- It's trash.
Uh, uh...
What was that?
F-sharp?
No, no, no!
Come on!
Watch out!
Watch out!
What was it?
Whoa.
Is everybody okay?
Hey, Nichols, are you alive?
They broke my girlfriend's lamp!
Wait, what is he doing?
- Oh.
Whoa, whoa.
- Is-is that...
Sweet babushka.
You want to sell it?
- Tuck, let's go!
Come on!
- Run!
What are you waiting for?
Dude, that place was wrecked!
Sorry again, sir!
Go!
Go!
Down here!
Let's get somewhere so we can look at him.
He's shaking.
Whoa, he's letting you touch him.
- I wouldn't, guys.
- Hey, what about here?
Here, set him on here.
He looks scared.
Yeah, why is he all balled up?
Can't you stand?
You all right?
Maybe he's... maybe he's just shy.
- Ooh, can you fly?
- Can you do X-ray vision?
How?
He can't see.
He doesn't even know where to look.
All right, all right, I think the question is, what can you do?
Okay, so Dr. Nichols is doing a surgical procedure with very sophisticated technology.
Pen caps.
Clear.
Wait, I don't get it.
How is that sophisticated?
It's kind of just, like, pen caps.
I got it.
Be careful.
His legs are fragile.
Get this.
Are you getting this?
Oh, that's crazy!
So you can't fly, but you can float.
That is so crazy!
I saw you.
I saw you grinning, man.
Stop trying to pretend like that wasn't cool.
- That was hot.
- This is crazy.
I mean, it's-it's just crazy.
Whoa.
Don't drop it.
Huh.
Can you see me?
Huh, I think he likes you.
Will you show us where you live?
All right.
Beep faster if I'm getting close.
Is that it, right there?
Why don't I go first.
Hi.
Um, my name's Alex, and... you're-you're in...
Munch, no... you're in my hand right now.
You know my ringtone, which is, like, insane and awesome.
Okay, um...
Hi.
I'm Tuck.
What's up?
I don't even know what to say, but, uh... but, uh, I'm from...
I'm from New York.
Uh, this is Nevada.
I don't even know, like, I like donuts,
- um...
- Donuts?
Really?
Okay, can somebody else do this?
I know, I'm going.
My name's M...
My real name is Reginald, but my friends call me Munch.
I hope we can be friends, too.
Do you have a name?
Oh, we could call him Beep.
Dude, what-what kind of name is Beep?
Word.
We got to give him a name that's powerful, like... like Master Blaster.
He doesn't blast anything.
Peter.
Peter.
What about Peter?
Something cool, like Space Ninja or something.
Well, how is there a ninja in space?
He wouldn't be able to breathe.
- All right, all right...
- Dude, you don't know that.
Have you ever been to space?
Which name do you like?
Uh, Beep.
Why?
There it is.
- Hello.
Watch this.
Watch this.
- You can't echo...
Watch this.
Just...
Beep.
See?
Echo.
That's what we should call it.
Echo.
- Oh, 'cause it echoes.
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Echo, Echo, Echo.
- Echo.
Your name... is Echo.
Echo...
Echo...
I don't think he's supposed to come out of that cylinder thing.
He looks... dead.
Echo?
So then we didn't know how broken he was.
The crash hurt him worse than we thought.
Okay, little guy... where do you want us to go?
Guys?
You know this is considered being a burglar, right?
With each new piece, he got strong.
And that's what we were gonna do... make him stronger.
- Which way?
- Around.
- In the house?
!
- Dude!
Maybe we should just knock on the door and...
We just need you to listen, sweetheart.
- Oh, man.
- You're grounding me?
Tuck, what are you doing?
Munch, go.
It's the man... the man should choose his dance partner.
It's a stupid tradition.
Really, it's about meeting new people, and many of those were our friends' sons.
And it's embarrassing when you ignore them.
And these are life skills that we are teaching you.
- Tuck, get back.
- Putting on this dress for you doesn't change me into some perfect little homecoming queen!
Okay, no one's asking you to act like a homecoming queen.
It's at least three years away.
Now.
Go, go, go.
...by the company you keep.
It's a cliché for a reason.
I'm sure this all seems...
Guys, what are we doing?
We're gonna be trapped up here.
Everybody be quiet.
Yeah, everyone!
You got to be kidding me.
Aw, you know what?
Everyone just follow me, all right?
Don't look at anything.
Just hurry.
- Hey, Tuck, did you see this?
- No, don't...
Dude, Tuck, this is Mannequin Girl's house.
Now we can ask for permission to steal stuff, 'cause, you know, you guys are kissing buddies.
Aw, man...
It was a couple of days ago.
She probably forgot about it by now, you know?
Like, yeah, it's... yeah, she probably forgot.
- How would she forget about it?
- I almost forgot about it...
- Oh, boy, get ready.
- Uh-oh.
Close the door.
Close the door.
Dude, we just got to keep it from going crazy.
It's gonna get loud.
We'll catch it in a blanket.
- What?
- Whoa!
- Get down!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Stop letting it move!
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
How to unfold a napkin?
!
- Who cares!
- Fine!
And in no time in my life am I gonna be somewhere
- that even plays the foxtrot!
- Close the door.
Yo, put it away, man.
Shh.
Be quiet.
What the...?
Wait, I know you.
Hey.
It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey, we're with Tuck.
Tuck Simms.
You know?
Remember you guys kissed?
- We what?
- Yeah, what are you talking about, huh?
Why is my room destroyed?
Why are you filming this?
- And what is that?
- Um, it's a... it's a-a car muffler.
No.
I want to know what that is.
It's actually a spaceship.
- Munch!
- Sorry.
Uh, well, we-we were following maps, and it just happened to lead here, so we were trying to help our friend Echo...
well, he's an alien
- Oh, God...
- ...that we're trying to get him on a ship.
See, look, it used to have six symbols, but now it has three, so that means we're almost there.
Crazy, right?
Munch, will you shut up?
An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?
- Nope.
- No, no.
- You did not just see that.
- Yeah, I did.
Yeah, she definitely saw it.
- Wait.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, I want to go.
- Really?
Sounds great.
What?
No.
- Dude...
- You're not part of our group, so why don't you just go play with your super rich friends...
That's kind of harsh... and your ball gowns and just go eat steak or something.
- What the hell?
- Go, go, go.
Dang, dude, what was that upstairs?
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you so mad.
Yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.
All right, let's just...
don't talk about...
Nothing happened in there, all right?
You know, they say the girls you argue with are the ones you like.
Don't go there, bro.
Tuck, it's over there.
Wait, it wants us to go to a bar?
Man, I say we climb in a window or find a door.
There's got to be another way.
Um, before-before we go...
I really need to get the pee out of my body.
Let's just hope the next place isn't a bank.
I can't believe you told that girl to get lost.
- You're so dramatic.
- What about you?
You invented a whole kiss, didn't you?
Uh, first of all, for your info, it's called aspirational thinking.
You're thinking it one moment, you're living it the next.
- How's that working out?
- Oh, excuse me.
Go to the bikes.
Oh, God, oh, God.
- Why is the construction man...
- Shut...
- Excuse me.
- Aw...
Hey.
I know you guys.
You're the guys... you're from the construction site, right?
Uh, with the, uh, with the camera?
Whoa-ho, wait, wait.
Why aren't you guys at home right now?
You guys weren't riding your bikes out around the desert, were you?
- No, of course not.
- Yes.
Uh, no.
That doesn't sound too... clear.
- Uh...
- Thank God.
There you are.
- What?
- Who-who are you?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Exactly!
It's like I don't even know anymore.
My mom had to drag my dad from the bar... again!
- What?
- He likes to go there more than he likes to tuck in his own kids at night.
At least that's what my mom says.
What's she talking about?
That's her.
Eating a burrito.
She east when she's stressed.
I ask myself if that's gonna be me one day.
What do you think?
Is it?
We make mistakes and we get married and we go to bars.
And these... these are my only friends in the world,
- 'cause they see me
- Uh... for who I really am.
That's your mom over there?
- Do you want to meet her?
- No.
No.
No, no.
Just get home safe!
Told you guys I wanted to go.
What the...?
Okay, so this girl, man, she'd been tailing us since her house, spying on us like some creepy stalker.
- She'd overheard our whole plan.
- She... she's crazy.
- I need the bag!
- I think I like it.
Oh, boy, get ready.
All right, try to blend in.
Look old.
That must've been some good fake I.D.'s.
What's up, baby face?
What are you doing in here, little man?
Oh, uh, I, uh...
- Are you Randy's kid?
- Uh,
- yes, he is.
- Um, y-yeah, yeah, yeah, he's my dad... or mom.
- You know, dad.
Mom.
- Okay, dude, just go.
Hurry up.
Emma?
Emma?
I was hanging out with this really pretty chick.
She's almost as pretty as you.
I mean... you're not pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.
Come over here.
Hop up on that stool.
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Oh, and one for his buddy here, too.
No, no, I'm all right.
Seriously, I'm all right.
- Sure, you'll like it.
- Sorry, I'm a...
I'm allergic.
Oh, you're gonna love it.
- Uh, no, no.
- You're gonna get one.
So, what happens next?
- Just give me back my bag.
- No.
Give it.
I'm serious.
Give me the bag.
Why are you being mean to me?
- Here, honey.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.
Wow, a lot of people with beards and mustaches in here, you know?
You don't understand.
Whenever you get close to the next piece, it goes crazy.
Oh, my God!
Whoa!
Aah!
- Uh...
- Are you kidding me?
Do you guys just go around town breaking stuff?
Just keep running!
Go, go!
What was that?
I think the ship's trying to take off!
Are you seeing this?
This thing is flying a ship... in your backpack?
I think he's getting better.
Oh.
So, you don't know how he crashed, or when, or why he came here with a spaceship in the first place?
Look, he only answers yes or no... it's not that simple.
Is this how I talk to him?
So, you crashed.
Did someone cause you to crash?
Dude, what's she doing?
- I don't know.
- Someone on Earth?
Do you think they're looking for you?
It's not those guys in trucks from the convenience store, is it?
The construction man?
Those are the guys that shot you down?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We got to take a step back.
This is way bigger and shadier than before, okay?
This is not good.
If those dudes are looking for Echo, they're looking for us, you know?
Echo?
You need some help there, buddy?
Hey, it's okay.
Shh.
Breathe like me, okay?
It's okay.
Dude, h-he'll be fine.
No.
We're not leaving him.
My whole life, I've been left.
I know how it feels.
We're all he's got.
- Uh, left?
- We could find a shortcut.
The map says up ahead.
This map's confusing.
I was a mind ninja back there...
- So, what was it like kissing me?
- Give me my camera.
Did your legs get all wobbly?
Was there soft music playing?
Please remind me, Tuck.
I totally forgot.
- What was it like?
- You're close.
Is this your first imaginary kiss?
The map says for us to go inside.
I'm confused.
- Huh?
- Didn't you guys kiss?
Anyway, the point is,
Emma was being annoying...
she kept walking off with Echo like she owned him, and talking to him about
I don't know what, I don't even know.
You know what?
Delete.
Man, are we sure there's no security guards or...
You know, that door wasn't even locked.
Hey, uh, guys, I was just thinking, you know,
I... haven't got to actually hold the, you know, the ship, before we did the thing, so can I do it?
- You know, before it gets crazy?
- Sure, but... it's not a ship.
What?
What are you talking about?
He told us it was a ship.
It's a key to your ship, right?
Well, if this is just the key, where's the spaceship?
All right, Munch, put it down.
Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.
Okay, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to put it down
- before you hurt both of us.
- I need this, man.
That's weird.
- Does it know her?
- I don't know.
Munch!
Whoa!
Whoa!
You okay?
- Yeah.
- What are you guys doing?
- Wow.
- Um, she was gonna get hit by the piece, so I-I saved her.
Hey!
You four!
Freeze!
- Run!
- Which way?
- Tuck!
- Stop right there!
Stop!
Go, go!
Hurry up!
Hold up, hold up!
Did Alex get out?
Uh, I d...
I don't know.
- We have to go back.
- Uh...
- Come on, you guys.
- Okay.
Look.
Whoa, whoa.
She's being stupid.
There's a guard in there, you know?
You can't just go running in, acting crazy.
We need a-a plan, or...
S... right?
Breaking and entering, destruction of property.
Those are felonies, kid.
Okay, Echo, I need your help.
Um, I need you to... do something.
I have a minor here; he's 13.
Caught him breaking in with his friends.
If you could send an officer down.
Stay put.
Hello?
Anybody there?
Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
...there...
Is anybody there... there...
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Alex.
Alex.
- Wh-Where's Tuck?
- We got to go.
- We should've gone back.
- All right, you know what?
Calm down, because if people would've listened to me, then Alex never would have gotten caught.
Didn't I say there would be security guards?
Alex!
Dude!
You're all right!
Are you all right?
Hey, Alex, we're good, man.
All right?
- Buddy?
- We're good, man?
Alex.
Come on, dude.
Alex!
We could've gone home, but we didn't.
- We were outside.
- Turn off the camera.
Not till you admit you're acting mopey for no reason.
You're always freaking out if anyone's gonna leave you behind.
Do you know how expensive that is?
I'm glad I'm moving.
You were never my friend.
- Is that right?
Is that right?
- Guys, guys,
- come on, just-just chill out.
- Come on!
Have you lost your mind?
I acted like I didn't know what I'd done.
But I knew exactly.
I know we're all tired and stuff, and hungry.
I saw this awesome diner.
We can totally just go grab
- a bite to eat or something.
- Real awesome, guys.
Real macho.
So, that's it?
The night's over?
Doesn't have to be.
Right?
Well, I mean, if it is, uh, we could...
I don't know, I guess we can keep the mood going, yeah?
Or we can do it another time, right?
Good times, the continuation, part two.
Right?
Hmm.
You know what?
I'm gonna talk about Sandra.
Man, that girl used to beat the crap out of you.
Me, too.
We were both little, small and scrawny.
She was a big girl, and she knew it.
But then I had a growth spurt, and you didn't, and I finally did something.
You remember that?
You told her I had polio.
Yeah, I told her that, and did she beat you up after that?
She still beat me up.
'Cause I-I always get your back, man.
I never let you down;
I always get your back.
Most of the time.
Just when I'm not freaked out about security guards, all right?
I'm sorry, man.
Are we good?
Yeah.
Dude.
Faster.
Sure are doing some traveling tonight.
My parents are in the bathroom.
Uh-huh.
Let it go.
What are you doing?
- Dude!
Hey, what are you doing?
!
- Oh, God!
Don't grab our stuff like that!
- Stop!
- Hey, give me the backpack!
- Who do you think you are?
- The police have been instructed to come and pick up these kids and take them home.
He can't just walk away.
What was it?
- The phone.
- No, no, no!
- Munch!
- Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
Oh, my...
Munch!
This is not real, this is not real, this is not real right now.
Don't let them see you.
Now!
Munch!
Do you see the truck?
Munch!
Munch!
That guy is not a construction worker.
- It's Munch.
- I need help, guys.
I really didn't think this through.
We're here, we're here.
Are you hurt?
Can you guys hear me...?
- Are you okay?
- Where are you, Munch?
We'll find you, all right?
I promise.
I think I'm at the construction site.
- Come on, buddy.
- Munch!
I can see the big lights and up at those... the white trucks...
How far is your neighborhood?
It's way over an hour.
All right, I think I got a faster way.
Who wants to go to a party?
Are you sure he'll even be here?
Better be.
His girlfriend's throwing it.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Sophomores.
Hey, sweet party.
Sweet jams.
Guys, what are we doing here?
We can't be...
Just look for my brother.
Look for his keys.
- Oh, my gosh, it's the cops.
- Okay.
Oh, God, the keys, the keys.
I lost my keys.
I have a Porsche.
Marcus!
Oh, not you, sorry.
I wasn't trying to stop the fun...
I like it.
Whoa...!
Hi.
Uh, sorry to bother everyone.
Have you seen my brother, Marcus?
Tall guy?
You seen his car keys?
- Uh, anyone?
- Guys, the cops are here!
- What?
- Yeah, the cops are here.
- Turn it down, turn it down.
- Dude, stop...
No, I'm serious, the cops are here right now.
Alex!
Alex!
We have to go now.
All right, just come on, come on.
We got to move.
Hurry, hurry.
We can't hide here.
Look, look, just stay here.
He's my brother;
I'll find him.
Just... don't let the cops take the footage.
All right?
You live here, right?
The cops!
Marcus?
Marcus, we're here.
The party's shut down.
That's enough.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Tuck's gonna freak.
Uh, here, check his pockets.
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.
Cops are gone.
- Uh, Tuck, Tuck?
- I have no idea where Marcus is.
Yeah.
Tell me you got that on tape?
My name is Reginald "Munch" Barrett.
This is my... kind of my final message.
To my best friends...
I love you, guys.
You're Googling it?
Really?
Oh, come on, this is what the Internet is for.
Um, "step one, get a driver's license."
- Do we have one of those?
- Oh, wow.
All right, am I good?
Stop!
Stop!
All right, all right.
Dude, do you even know what you're doing?
No, I don't.
"Step two, be calm."
What are you doing?
!
- Sorry, sorry.
- Be calm is step two?
All right, all right, all right.
I got it, I got it.
Hold on a sec..
- Stop!
- Tuck, Tuck, turn!
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.
- Uh...
- Oh, my God.
We're good, we're good.
All right, I'm excited.
Should I gun it?
- No, no, no, don't.
- No, Tuck.
I need, I need music.
Somebody just play some music.
All right.
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my God.
Change it.
Everywhere we'd been that night, shot by us like a rocket.
All we wanted was our friends back.
I'm gonna miss it here, man.
Yeah, me too.
Here we go.
I don't know about this.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
That does not look like a freeway.
Get down.
Shh, Shh.
All right, so what's the plan?
I don't know.
Get him out?
So, in other words, we don't have a plan.
Go, go, go.
I'm just gonna call Munch's phone and see if his phone rings.
Wait a minute.
Dude, my camera's not a doorstop.
I hear his voice.
Shh.
I-I knew it was you guys 'cause I saw the same truck from my neighborhood.
Tell us the truth.
I-I had a lot of adrenaline rush, and...
I...
I didn't want the night to end.
And I... and it was the last night with Alex.
Oh, shit, Munch.
Stop crying and talk to us.
This is not good.
I'm not...
I'm not crying!
What?
Where is that?
We got to find him and get him out of there, man.
Just don't kill me!
Did he access your phones at all?
Were there others like it or was this the only one you found?
What are they doing?
Dude, they're breaking him!
Guys?
Guys, someone's coming.
We should go.
Go, go.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, construction man!
- Give me the camera.
- Listen...
This is not your camera.
Hey, guys, go!
- And find Munch!
- Let go of me!
Get off of us, man, this isn't...
- My camera!
- Let go.
Is that thing still on?
Okay, no more lies.
No more sneaking around.
No more cameras, understand?
Son, look at me.
Look at me.
Oh, I-I see better with my glasses on, you know?
This signal has been transmitting for a very long time, from a ship that we believe is located right here in your neighborhood.
- What?
- Wait, what's he talking about?
Six days ago, an object entered our atmosphere at 20,000 miles an hour, on a direct course for that ship.
We shot it down.
What you found activates the ship, and if that ship takes off, it could kill everyone.
He just wants to go home.
Okay, that will not happen.
He is far too valuable.
This is crazy, this is crazy.
So... we are gonna follow this map and you are gonna help us get that thing operational, and it will lead us back to its ship, and we will disable it permanently.
Am I clear?
Am I clear?
Y-Yeah.
Good.
Check the doors, check the doors.
It's locked; it's not just locked.
They don't have a handle on it.
- Someone help!
- Where are they taking us?
Hey, yo!
Let us out, man!
Someone!
Well, the sun's up.
Our parents are gonna find out.
I think we got bigger problems than our parents.
Where are we?
Let's go!
All right, everybody knows the drill.
Let's set it up.
- He's not moving.
- Stop!
Can you see me?
Beep?
We're all here.
We're gonna get you home, all right?
We'll find a way.
Nichols, man, it's not there.
No.
Please, you have to work.
Just try.
Echo?
Don't!
Echo!
You can't go; you can't!
It's over.
Let's keep them quiet.
Come on, man.
It's...
It's time to go.
What's happening?
What is that?
Here he goes.
Back up.
Get ready.
Whoa.
Okay, now!
Where are we going?
Home!
His ship's in Mulberry Woods.
Dude, go!
How do I drive?
Will you drive?
!
Please drive!
Just hurry up!
Alex, dude, you don't have your seat belt on!
- Just speed up!
- Just go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
They're right there!
You have to speed!
- I'm trying!
- You're driving...!
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
- Tuck, you're gonna get us killed!
- Where do I go?
- Just go around them.
- No, hold on.
- Don't go on the wrong side!
Dude, stop, stop!
- Oh!
- What the...?
- Oh, my gosh.
- Whoa, whoa!
Are you...
Are you seeing this?
Thanks, buddy.
I need an Advil.
We can't afford this right now.
We really can't afford this right now.
Dude, look, there's a new map.
A what?
Here, here, give me the phones back.
I think that's his ship.
Whoa, that's a big ship.
Alex, I don't want to stress you out or anything, but they're right there!
Oh, my God.
Alex, it's your mom.
- Don't answer it.
- Why would I answer it?
- Betty?
- Dude.
- Munch.
- Betty?
Hi.
- Sorry about my tone last night.
- Oh, I just thought it would be nice to have the boys have a nice night
- together before we're all uprooted.
- You're crying.
- Munch, it's your mom.
- What?
!
Look, look, look, look.
Dude.
- You okay?
- So, Janice, gotta go... on my jog.
Can we act like we never had this conversation?
Uh, uh, just come over this wall.
Are you up?
- Guys, they're here.
- Jump.
- Move!
- Faster!
They can't catch us in our own backyard.
Let's cut them off.
Munch, hurry up!
- Okay, okay.
- Munch!
Well, I don't jump walls very much, man!
Here, hold my camera.
Dude, come on, come on, come on.
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Tuck, wait!
They're right behind us!
Come on, guys, we got to go, we got to go.
Let's go, right now.
It's down the hill.
Come on, let's go!
Shh.
Go, go, go.
It says the ship is up ahead.
This is the way to your house, man.
- Go, go, go, guys!
- Are your parents awake?
I think we...
I think we lost them.
Okay.
I don't...
I don't get it.
I...
This is where the map ends.
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship.
Maybe it's invisible.
What is it?
Wait, what-what's he talking about?
What do you want us to...
Dude, what?
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa...
- Oh.
Everybody good?
What's down there?
Be careful, man.
What?
That's it.
Dude, it-it's underneath.
So this whole time...
That's why they want all our houses.
They were digging.
Yo, Alex, I know what you're thinking.
Alex!
Alex, man!
Th-The only way that thing can take off is to come up out of the ground through us.
That's a really bad idea.
Dude, what are you doing?
This is not just about us anymore.
It's about other people now, a whole community still asleep in their beds.
Let's just think this through first.
- I trust him.
- Listen to us.
Alex!
Alex!
Alex!
Is this where we're supposed to be?
Make up a plan.
- No, we got to run.
- What are you talking about?
- If the ship's right under...
- We can't leave.
- I know we can't leave him.
- What about Alex?
What about everyone up here that's gonna die?
Alex!
Dude, say something!
Oh, my God.
I left you behind once.
I'm not doing it again.
Hi, guys.
Whoa.
Whoa.
This... this is in-insane.
So, um, beep.
Uh, um,
I don't really know how to say good-bye... so I'm not gonna.
And, um...
Um...
You're my friend, you know?
Even when I'm old, even when... even when you think I've forgotten...
I'm always gonna be there.
Do you feel that?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, we need to go now!
We have to go.
Bye.
Go, go, go!
Wait, wait, wait, my camera!
Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Dude, are you all right?
- Everybody good?
- Are you all right?
Okay.
That was so close.
What the heck?
- Oh, my...
- What the...?
Yeah!
Oh, my God.
Dude, this is amazing.
I think you're gonna want to get this.
Oh!
We did it, dude.
We did it.
Dude!
Did you see that?
Did you see...
- Wow.
We did that!
- You're like...
That's insane.
We just did that!
That's...
Look, come on.
Look, look, people want to know what happened.
if we told them what happened, they wouldn't believe us.
Guys, it's morning.
Oh, crap, I gotta get home.
- My dad is gonna kill me.
- I think I need a ride.
We should go because people, they'll start asking...
Hey, buddy...
Did you guys feel that earthquake?
- Were you okay?
- No, Mom, I'm fine.
- Let me see.
- He's fine.
Honey, he's fine.
Did no one just see the giant spaceship?
!
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, a spaceship.
What just happened?
!
Oh, oh, okay, okay.
I know it's been really hard lately,
- and we've all been really overwhelmed.
- Just...
Why don't we... why don't we just go in and relax.
Maybe we can, um, go get that-that pizza we talked about.
- All right?
Yeah.
- Pizza?
- If we don't play along,
- Yeah, his mom saw the ship.
- Nobody's gonna get it okay?
- How could I play along?
- So just...
- Yes, I'm sure.
I found them here at Alex's.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, no, no.
Actually, uh, we found him here.
I thought he was staying with you.
No, I was told they were at Munch's.
I'll call you back, babe.
Yeah, yeah, they were at my house.
We-we played this game where you play as a guy with the soul of a dragon, and it had really good voices.
The voices were great, so...
Who's this?
That's Emma.
I'm, uh, he's my boyfriend.
I mean, friend who's a boy.
- Um...
- Awkward.
She's hot, right?
Knock it off, you.
Six hours later, Alex moved.
I just got grounded for, like, life.
Me, too.
Might as well move now.
Not gonna be seeing anyone for a while.
Yeah.
But this... what really happened tonight... no one knows but us.
Hey, Alex!
Time to go, buddy.
I'm gonna miss you guys.
You guys smell really bad.
Our last night together, we did a lot.
A whole lot.
But there's some things we couldn't do.
Alex's parents had already bought a new home.
Most of the neighborhood had.
Munch's, too.
So, one by one, people started to move.
My parents hadn't, so we got to stay.
New people started moving in, and Mulberry Wood started again, but not the one that had my friends in it.
When you're a kid, you think you're invisible.
You think you can't make a difference.
We're not kids anymore.
We know now... that we can do anything.
Having a friend light-years away taught us that distance is just a state of mind.
If you're best friends, then you always will be... no matter where you are in the universe.
I see this life like a swingin' vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing' signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so right
At doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong
At doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars We'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be, counting stars
Take that money Watch it burn
Sink in the river The lessons I learned
Take that money Watch it burn
Sink in the river The lessons I learned
Take that money Watch it burn
Sink in the river The lessons I learned
Take that money Watch it burn
Sink in the river The lessons I learned
Guys, my just... my phone just...
You guys got to see this.
TCS Subtitling
Hey, hey, Tuck, dude.
- Okay, we're rolling.
- Okay, hold on.
B-Before you go, look-look at my coat.
- It's cool, huh?
- What is that?
Can we do another take with it on, though?
No.
Okay.
- Ready when you are.
Okay.
How do I smell?
Or I mean, look, or you know?
Yeah, you can't smell a video.
Okay.
- Ruckus, dude, you got to get out of here.
Hi, I'm Reginald.
I don't really get friends much, but it's probably because I'm a bit of... an acquired taste.
That's what my mom says.
And I'm sure whatever school I'm forced to go to no one will acquire it.
So... thanks for paving a road over, really, the only place I've ever had any real friends.
Okay, we good?
- Uh, say your name.
- I thought you knew my name.
You know what I mean;
for the video.
Dude, we've been hanging out for years.
- Come on.
- Dude, stop fronting.
Just tell the camera.
You're upset, right?
You don't want to move.
I've never gone a day without seeing my friends.
They're, like, the only people in the world who get me.
And now it's just all over, you know?
Good luck finding that again.
So wherever-wherever Munch is going, man...
Look, you people listen to me, all right?
He's-he's a really good kid.
So don't just assume that he's weird and that's it.
And Alex, man...
He's a foster kid.
He's been moved all over.
I mean, it's like, why do you have to build a freeway right through?
You know, can't you just go around or something?
You're going along feeling like your own person with your own friends, and then something like this comes along that you have no power to stop because you're just a kid.
You're just a kid.
Yeah, hey, man.
Yeah, yeah, I'm up, I'm up.
Whoa, whoa, man, slow down.
What's the problem?
Yeah, my-my phone's good.
Why?
What happened?
- Wait, what?
This is when everything started to change.
So, being me,
I kept filming.
I'm Tuck.
What you're about to see happened to me and my best friends one year ago.
This is the story of our last week together.
-
- Phones all over our neighborhood are freaking out.
We've done everything we could possibly do with this phone.
We threw it at the wall, we took it to the phone guy, we took it to the store where we got it from, and they say it's a problem.
So you know it's serious.
It looks like your phone basically barfed on the screen.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I was just eating dinner, and all of a sudden, all the phones in the house just did this.
At exactly the same time.
Dude.
- What?
It's freaky.
- De hello?
- Hey, Alex.
Oh, Munch, you're outside.
Get over here, over here, down the street.
Ask him if his phone barfed yet.
Did your phone barf yet?
- Phones are still working.
- Cool.
Keep going, and we'll meet you in the backyard.
Okay, copy that.
I'll take swift steps.
When I look back at that day,
I realize the clues were all around us.
We had no idea.
Dude, they all still work.
See?
Dude, you know if this whole thing works,
-these phones are done.
- No, I know.
- I have 14 spares; it's okay.
- I bet you do.
- Okay.
All right, anyways, let's spread out.
- Okay.
- Alex, go by the gate.
Munch, go on the far end,
- Yeah, I got it.
-and I'll stay right here by my camera.
- Just watch out!
- Okay, okay.
Okay, it's good.
It's good...
It's good...
-
- Whoa, okay, it went out.
Whoa, whoa, it barfed!
All right, people, if you go to Alex's house, your phones will spew chunks all over his screen.
My mom said the Murphys' phones and the Churleys' changed, too.
So what do you think this is?
Whoa!
These dudes.
-
- Hi.
- Is that on?
- I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Oh.
We had an electrical short over at the site, and it may be disrupting people's phone service, and we're wondering if that happened
-to anybody in this house?
- Oh, no, my phone is good.
-'Cause we're offering new phone vouchers
- Uh-huh.
In exchange for any device in this area here
-that may be displaying
- That's weird, that's weird.
- Faulty messages or images?
- I don't know.
See you.
No, listen, I...
Okay, so you-you really don't think this is a little bit weird?
These dudes come here to build a freeway
-and now they want our phones?
- Well, I think it's gonna work.
No.
Clean your room.
Oh, my...
I'm not gonna have a room if we don't do something.
- Right, I think...
- No, Mom, seriously.
These guys want our houses.
Maybe if we expose them for illegal property, then...
- Yo!
- Aw, you don't like how things are, do you?
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
-
- Dude, it's a map to the desert.
Like, what is that?
What do we do with this?
I guess most maps are made to be followed.
Exactly.
It could go to, like, some crazy headquarters, and we find out that these construction clowns are spies and we expose them to the world.
It's 20 miles away.
What...
No, we're not...
we're not gonna go.
No, obviously not.
Look, whatever it is, this Saturday, we're going to sneak behind our parents' backs and find out.
I'm moving Saturday.
All right, all right, so Friday night.
Our last night together?
It doesn't have to be;
that's what I'm saying.
Like, I don't want to move, and these clowns are making us do it.
Maybe we can stop them.
Now, are you in?
Yeah, all right.
- All right.
-I'm in.
Munch, don't you bail out on us now.
Dude, I'm not.
Me?
No... pfft!
I'm in.
Yeah!
All right!
That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, all right.
Bring it in.
- Oh, oops!
-Munch!
So, why would you be organizing your ketchups?
- Because.
- Who does that?
So I can get to them easier, and then it's more organized,
-and it's better.
- And you are my friend.
Guys, guys, it's time to practice the big lie.
Hey, Morn, I'm spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a neat, brand-new video game.
And I'm sleeping over at Tuck's house so we can play a new video game.
And I'm sleeping in your mom's bed,
-not playing a video game.
- Oh, my God, all right, dude.
Stop talking about my mother, thank you.
All right, the camera's are gonna be on 24 hours a day, nonstop.
Dude, can you stop touching, please?
It attaches to my bike, and it's also a pretty good way to get footage on the fly.
Spy glasses.
I love these;
I love them.
And last, camera, but definitely not least...
What up, camcorder?
Keeping it tight.
Looking pretty good these days.
Tuck, these are the ugliest things I've ever seen.
Dude, what?
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Those are...
They're sweet.
- The camera's undetectable,
- Wow.
- And the ladies love them.
- Prove it.
Prove it?
This guy, all right?
Give me my glasses, man.
Those are stealth.
Now I'm gonna prove to you guys spy glasses get you girls.
Oh, my gosh, he's going over there.
- I can't see who he's talking to.
- Shut up, Munch.
Uh, hi, uh...
Hey, um, Em-Emma, right?
Emma?
I was just...
Okay, uh, can I borrow a piece of paper, please?
He has something.
- I can't see who he got it from.
- We're about to see right now.
Look, look, look, look.
He has a paper.
You did not get her number.
Totally got her number.
Right there.
You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.
You, too, you're a sellout.
No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.
Yes, I did.
Mannequin Girl?
What kind of name is that?
What?
That's what I call her.
I think mannequins are hot.
I'll leave my house at 6:00.
15 minutes later, I pick up Alex.
- Munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Tonight, we're no longer boys.
We're men.
- Dude, what the...?
- I didn't see you, man.
Tuck, you all right?
Let's go.
Our whole lives we've been nobodies.
Invisible.
The good kids.
Not anymore.
All right, Ma.
I'm leaving.
Spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a new video game.
Have whatever you want, honey.
You know what, I lied, actually.
We're gonna ride our bikes out into the desert at night alone.
Without supervision.
We got that;
we're going to state.
Okay, see you then, sweetie.
- We could go.
- Also rob a bank.
- All the way.
State.
- What?
Go to Mexico.
Maybe even start a new life.
- Right, I know.
- Wrestling!
You're trying to act like I don't know what I'm talking about.
What's up, Stumpy?
Yo, man, I told you to stop to calling me that.
You know what, man, look, my girl's throwing this huge party later tonight, if you want to come by.
You serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
Because not a lady in the world can resist a natty old BMX bike.
What's the zero to 6O on that bad boy, huh?
Two, three days?
Come on, come on, dude, you ready?
Let's go.
I can't even tell a difference.
This looks exactly the way it looked before you packed.
All your stuff fitting in one box?
What are you, a drifter?
Who told you?
Look, all I'm saying is, when you get to your new house, put a poster up, put some shelves on the wall, frame a photo.
Look, there's a painting right there.
Put something on a shelf...
That's not a painting.
That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt, smudged it and called it art.
I'm going to Munch's house to play a video game, all right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure, buddy.
- Bye, Dylan.
- Have fun with your friends.
- Hey, hey, Tuck.
- How are you?
Uh, good luck with the move to New York, buddy.
- Maybe we'll come see you.
- All right, cool.
The moving truck is coming at 10:00.
Make sure you're back, okay?
I-l don't get it.
If your foster parents already have a baby of their own, why do they need you?
There's no sense in having two babies.
- Shut up, dude.
- One baby cries all the time, the other one listens to indie rock.
Let's go.
Yeow!
Guys, would you please help my son with his room, before I go crazy?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I don't think he's started...
Honey, have you even started packing your room?
I told you a thousand times,
I'm alphabetizing!
Yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.
Shh.
...they're ﬂexible, they're "dynamical,"
they can be curved, they can bend, and this opens up a whole new universe of possibilities, and one of the possibilities is that there can be shortcuts through space and through time.
So that's really just what a Wormhole is.
It's taking advantage...
What are you...
Aah!
- Why don't you stop doing that?
!
- I'm sorry!
You guys are gonna give me a heart attack one day.
- I'm sorry.
- Turn that off, dude.
-
- I created a substation for each of our parents' phones that's wired to the router, which is wired to the transmitter, which transmits to the receiver, which is...
- my phone.
- Okay, so basically, no matter who our parents call, it goes to your phone.
Yeah.
My mom's friends always say that I sound just like my mom, you know,
-when I pick up the phone...
- Yeah.
So I figured, I can be Betty.
Bye, Betty.
Thank you.
Um, I'm going to Alex's...
or Munch's... or Tuck's house, and we're gonna play a video game and sleep over.
Wait, what's all that stuff?
Honey?
Good job, Munch.
You did it.
Here we come.
17.6 miles.
♪ Going to the desert... a'
Munch, what are you doing?
Guys, guys, just hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Dude...
- I'm not backing out or anything,
- He wants to quit right when we -...just-just hear me out.
- Been waiting for this forever.
- Dude, listen, come on, okay.
This is crazy what we're doing.
Dude, I don't want to punk out or back out or anything-- it's just, my mom, you know, she just got divorced.
- Munch...
- She's already had enough guys lying to her.
If you didn't want to come, then why didn't you tell us earlier?
You do understand this is our last night together.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Look, Munch, if we don't go now, we'll never go.
We won't even be here.
This is our last chance to try and do something.
Even-even if it is stupid.
- Yeah.
- You know what,
I say we put a vote to it.
All in favor raise your hand.
Well, now I have to raise my hand.
Munch, just...
Fine, fine.
Okay, whatever.
I'll go.
But only under one condition.
- I call the black!
- Mine!
No, no, give it!
It's so weird, no one's gonna be in these houses next week.
Dude, you're so full of it.
- When did you kiss her?
- Dude, trust me.
After pre-algebra, she pulled me into the bathroom.
Wait, wait, wait, wait-- Mannequin Girl?
- Yeah!
- Was she good at it?
Uh, eh, B minus.
You know, I've kissed better in better locations.
No, how do I know you're not lying?
Trust me.
I don't even have to reply to you.
- You're last!
- Hey, you got a head start!
That's not fair!
Oh, so what, there's a Wing Stop?
I never been to a Wing Stop.
We followed a map out in the middle of nowhere.
It might be, like, a CIA prison.
We were miles from home.
No one in the world knew it.
No one said it... but we were scared.
We haven't seen a car in, like, half an hour.
We were on our own.
This-this is the way, right?
You have the map, right?
- Can I see the map?
- Left.
Left?
Are you sure?
Because right looks a little bit more promising.
-
- Did you guys hear that?
Just a couple more miles.
Hold on.
What is that?
It's the map.
Are we close?
I never understood why people like the outdoors.
Will you stop freaking out?
Yo, this is too steep, man.
Let's go, man.
We're getting pretty far from the road, guys.
Almost there.
Is it this thing?
I don't think so.
Wait, what was that?
- I don't know.
- Well, hold on.
What'd you see, dude?
- Over here!
We're almost there.
Come on.
Oh.
What?
What do you think it is?
How would I know?
Why does it look all burnt?
Hey, just be careful.
- Careful!
- Yeah, don't touch that thing.
Could be...
C-Could be...
I don't know, I don't know.
A part of a satellite?
All right, all right, um, Munch, film me while I'm...
-while I'm touching this thing.
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Let me try it.
Thank you.
It's dusty.
It's a piece of crap.
What?
Forget about it.
Just turn off the camera.
Well, it's not a national treasure, but it could be used for something.
It's crap.
What happened to filming 'cause it's our last night, huh?
Um, in case you haven't noticed, obviously, the map led to squat.
Got it.
So all you cared about was getting your stupid hits on your stupid video?
- Dude, why don't you just...
- Whoa, guys, guys, guys.
Come on!
I know we're all frustrated...
--it's Alex's mom.
- Are you serious?
- Um, it'll be fine.
Just, um, be Betty, okay?
- Oh, man.
- Oh, crap.
Yo, I thought I could do this, but I can't.
Maybe you can answer it.
She just likes to check up on things, okay?
All right.
WOMAN".
Betty, are you there'?
Go.
This is Betty.
I was thinking maybe I could bring over some pizzas?
Dude, go.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No coming over.
- Just hang up.
- No way.
No, it's really no trouble.
We have a coupon.
- I said no!
No pizzas!
- What?
- No, uh...
- Don't yell at her, man.
Maybe you and your husband should go to bed.
Stop saying words!
Are you sure everything's okay?
Have a good night.
Go to sleep.
That could've gone better.
That was horrible.
"Your husband should go to sleep"?
Was that really something smart to say?
Munch.
Don't look at me like I'm a hoarder.
That's rude.
Who are they?
I don't...
I don't know.
I'm picking up some spikes in the readings...
Get down, get down.
Turn your flashlight off, dummy.
Let's go.
Why would they be out this far?
Who cares?
The night's blown.
- Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
Munch?
- You're a character.
- There's something in there!
What?
Dude, are you kidding me right now?
Something is in that bag.
It-it touched me.
Go check.
Be-be careful.
- What?
- Did it poke you, too?
What, dude?
Say something!
What did you see?
There-There's something in there.
Yeah, a bunch of crap Munch brought.
- You guys are funny.
- All I know is it beeped.
You know, why don't you go in there and just see.
Beeped?
What are you talking about?
Babies.
I'll do it myself.
Dang, how much stuff do you have in your bag, dude?
Geez.
Oh, boy, are you guys talking about this?
It's garbage.
It's nothing.
What are you talking about, you heard something?
It made a noise.
Hey, hey, do something!
See, it's not doing anything.
What are you talking about?
Beep.
Do that again, do that again.
Do what again?
Do what you just did.
- Beep.
Whoa, hold on.
Let me...
Let me try this for myself.
Beep.
Beep?
Why is it making noise only for you and not me?
Make it beep again.
Beep.
-
- Whoa!
This is it!
It's a bomb!
No, no, oh, God, no!
No, no, no!
Guys, I think...
I think it might have defused.
I don't know.
Man, nothing's happening.
All right, hold on, hold on.
I got an idea.
Tuck!
What?
Okay, it didn't do anything, but j-just don't do it again.
Are you insane, Tuck?
!
Are you sure you guys know what you're doing?
Yes, trust me.
When it's a bomb, you have to act quick.
I seen it on some TV show or some movie or something.
- Saw what?
- Check it out.
What are you doing?
!
Disarming it.
Are you crazy?
!
It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.
That's not what you do with a bomb!
Are you insane?
!
-
- What was that?
It's not my phone.
It's the thing, whatever that is.
- What are you talking about?
-It's that.
That's what just made that noise.
I, uh...
It, like, imitated my ringtone.
This is what made our phones barf?
Did you hear that?
- Whoa, whoa.
All right, so, a couple of seconds ago, our phones went crazy.
Bananas, insane.
I don't know what to call it.
Look.
You see that?
It's a new map, but on my phone this time.
To me?
All right, him, or...
Dude, Munch's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and, ugh, I don't even know what that is.
Alex's phone, it just turned on by itself and started filming.
We can't even turn them off.
Oh, don't try to act like it's not cool.
That is weird.
It's showing us where we are.
And you don't find that creepy?
What do you think that is?
You think that's a road?
We should follow the map.
How about no.
How about yes?
We wanted a last night together, so what do you call this?
A trap?
Didn't you guys see the "No Trespassing" sign?
Oops.
I didn't see anything.
This is where the map says to go.
Stop stepping on leaves.
There's leaves everywhere.
-
- Shh.
What was that?
Where do you think it's taking us to?
Maybe another one of those beepy things.
What was that?
I don't know.
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Get down!
Oh, geez!
Munch, watch out!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
What's going on?
Dude, Munch, what was that?
Where is it?
Is it over?
- Oh, geez.
Dude!
Tuck, stay back.
- Whoa.
- Stay back.
- What's...
Dude!
- Wait, wait, be careful.
Your phone just got a new map.
What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait, why is it opening?
Hold on, hold on.
Did you see that just now?
- What is that?
- TUCKI Whoa!
What is that?
- MUNCHI What is that?
- What is that?
- Oh, my...
Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.
it-it's moving.
There's something in there right now.
What's in there?
Oh, don't tell me.
Are those... eyes?
Dude, dude, it's looking dead at us right now.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
It's trembling like it's hurt.
Good.
My heart's beating so fast right now.
Wow.
Almost got us killed, like, three times already.
Yeah, but it was worth it, dude.
Incredible.
All right, so...
I just figured out why Alex's camera was on this whole time.
So this thing, whatever it is, it's eyes are, like, all screwed up, completely.
You see?
So, basically, it uses his phone to see.
That's insane.
You think he can see us right now?
Munch, you have to check this out.
This is amazing.
Is it?
Is it amazing?
'Cause I think it's scary as balls.
I mean, obviously people are looking for it.
- Munch...
-it has access to our voicemails and our texts and our ringtones.
How do you even know it's a he?
Are you a dude?
Wait... you understood us.
Whoa.
All right, here's how it goes.
One beep is yes, two beeps are no.
Watch.
Is one beep yes?
Yo, that's so tight.
Are we in a barn?
ls Munch really a woman?
Oh, come on, man, this thing is broken.
Everybody knows Munch is a woman.
Okay, I have a question.
Are we gonna die tonight?
Why isn't it answering?
What...
Well, that's not good, right?
2O questions with an alien.
Tuck Simms exclusive.
- Let's do this.
- Check it out.
All right, urn, are you from space?
'
- Ooh!
Are you a robot?
Do you eat humans?
Do you like Earth?
Why?
Why doesn't he like Earth?
Do you like us?
You see?
I told you.
We're cool like that.
Come on.
Are you hurt?
- Oh.
- He's hurt.
Well, his lights seem brighter, so...
Did that piece help you?
Uh.
Can we help fix you or something?
Or...
Like, what is this?
Are-are you trying to build something?
-
- Oh, he's trying to build...
Building something.
Right there.
- What could he be building?
- Yeah.
So, wait, what are, what are you building?
- Lasers?
'A POFtal?
- Minions?
- A cloaking device?
- it's an army.
Ignore him.
- Spaceship?
Oh, my God!
Hold up, hold up.
So let me get this right.
So you're building a spaceship,
- He's building a spaceship.
-and you need our help building the spaceship?
-
- Oh, man.
This guy is building a spaceship.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Let me make sure I don't have any plans.
Nope!
We're building a spaceship!
He's building a spaceship.
We asked him questions for almost two hours.
Where he came from.
If there were others here like him.
We found out he was lost... and alone.
He was out in the middle of nowhere, on his own, like us.
All we really knew was that he crashed, and now he needed us to rebuild him.
The map says up ahead.
Are we going the right way?
Look, look, look, look, whatever that is, the map goes to it.
All right, so wait-wait a minute.
Let me get this right.
Dude comes from a million light-years away, and he wants to come here?
I don't know, the map said so.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You got to look both ways before you cross the street.
Munch.
So are you... snoopy.
Ten dollars?
- I said no deal.
- $7.50.
I don't want it.
It's tchotchke trash.
If you give it to me as a gift, I'd still throw it away.
- It's trash.
- No, it's vintage.
No.
You don't get to say the word "vintage."
I'm the one who gets to say when what is vintage.
Excuse me, sir, you have a very, very lovely shop.
Come on, you sure?
H6)'-
Oh, man, look at the hand painting.
It's all crafted right there.
- One of a kind.
- It's trash.
Uh, uh...
- What was that?
F-sharp?
No, no, no!
Come on!
Watch out!
Watch out!
- What was it?
Whoa. is everybody okay?
- Hey, Nichols, are you alive?
They broke my girlfriend's lamp!
Wait, what is he doing?
Oh.
Whoa, whoa.
ls-is that...
- Sweet babushka.
You want to sell it?
- Tuck, let's go!
Come on!
- Run!
What are you waiting for?
Dude, that place was wrecked!
Sorry again, sir!
Go!
Go!
Down here!
Let's get somewhere so we can look at him.
He's shaking.
Whoa, he's letting you touch him.
- I wouldn't, guys.
- Hey, what about here?
Here, set him on here.
- He looks scared.
Yeah, why is he all balled up?
Can't you stand?
You all right?
- Maybe he's... maybe he's just shy.
- Ooh, can you fly?
- Can you do X-ray vision?
How?
He can't see.
He doesn't even know where to look.
All right, all right, I think the question is, what can you do?
Okay, so Dr. Nichols is doing a surgical procedure with very sophisticated technology.
- Pen caps.
Clear.
Wait, I don't get it.
How is that sophisticated?
It's kind of just, like, pen caps.
I got it.
Be careful.
His legs are fragile.
- Whoa.
Get this.
Are you getting this?
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Oh, that's crazy!
So you can't fly, but you can float.
- That is so crazy!
I saw you.
I saw you grinning, man.
Stop trying to pretend like that wasn't cool.
- That was hot.
- This is crazy.
I mean, it's-it's just crazy.
- Whoa.
Don't drop it.
Huh.
- Can you see me?
- Huh, I think he likes you.
Will you show us where you live?
-
- All right.
Beep faster if I'm getting close.
-
- Is that it, right there?
Why don't I go first.
Hi.
Um, my name's Alex, and... you're-you're in-- Munch, no-- you're in my hand right now.
You know my ringtone, which is, like, insane and awesome.
Okay, um...
Hi.
I'm Tuck.
What's up?
I don't even know what to say, but, uh... but, uh, I'm from...
I'm from New York.
Uh, this is Nevada.
I don't even know, like, I like donuts,
- um...
- Donuts?
Really?
Okay, can somebody else do this?
I know, I'm going.
My name's M...
My real name is Reginald, but my friends call me Munch.
I hope we can be friends, too.
-
- Do you have a name?
Oh, we could call him Beep.
Dude, what-what kind of name is Beep?
Word.
We got to give him a name that's powerful, like... like Master Blaster.
He doesn't blast anything.
Peter.
Peter.
What about Peter?
Something cool, like Space Ninja or something.
Well, how is there a ninja in space?
He wouldn't be able to breathe.
- All right, all right...
- Dude, you don't know that.
Have you ever been to space?
Which name do you like?
Uh, Beep.
Why?
There it is.
- Hello.
Watch this.
Watch this.
- You can't echo...
Watch this.
Just...
Beep.
'See?
- Echo.
That's what we should call it.
Echo.
- Oh, 'cause it echoes.
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Echo,Echo,Echo.
- Echo.
Your name... is Echo.
Echo...
Echo...
I don't think he's supposed to come out of that cylinder thing.
He looks... dead.
Echo?
So then we didn't know how broken he was.
The crash hurt him worse than we thought.
- Okay, little guy... where do you want us to go?
Guys?
You know this is considered being a burglar, right?
With each new piece, he got strong.
And that's what we were gonna do-- make him stronger.
Which way?
- Around.
- In the house?
!
- Dude!
Maybe we should just knock on the door and...
We just need you to listen, sweetheart.
- Oh, man.
- You're grounding me?
Tuck, what are you doing?
Munch, go.
It's the man-- the man should choose his dance partner.
It's a stupid tradition.
Really, it's about meeting new people, and many of those were our friends' sons.
And it's embarrassing when you ignore them.
And these are life skills that we are teaching you.
- Tuck, get back.
- Putting on this dress for you doesn't change me into some perfect little homecoming queen!
Okay, no one's asking you to act like a homecoming queen.
It's at least three years away.
Now.
Go, go, go.
...by the company you keep.
It's a cliché for a reason.
I'm sure this all seems...
Guys, what are we doing?
We're gonna be trapped up here.
Everybody be quiet.
Yeah, everyone!
You got to be kidding me.
Aw, you know what?
Everyone just follow me, all right?
Don't look at anything.
Just hurry.
- Hey, Tuck, did you see this?
- No, don't...
Dude, Tuck, this is Mannequin Girl's house.
Now we can ask for permission to steal stuff, 'cause, you know, you guys are kissing buddies.
Aw, man...
It was a couple of days ago.
She probably forgot about it by now, you know?
Like, yeah, it's...
yeah, she probably forgot.
- How would she forget about it?
- I almost forgot about it...
- Oh, boy, get ready.
- Uh-oh.
Close the door.
Close the door.
--Guys...
- Dude, we just got to keep it from going crazy.
It's gonna get loud.
We'll catch it in a blanket.
- What?
- Whoa!
- Get down!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Stop letting it move!
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
How to unfold a napkin?
!
- Who cares!
- Fine!
And in no time in my life am I gonna be somewhere
- that even plays the foxtrot!
- Close the door.
-
- Yo, put it away, man.
Shh.
Be quiet.
- What the...?
Wait, I know you.
- Hey.
It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey, we're with Tuck.
Tuck Simms.
You know?
Remember you guys kissed?
- We what?
- Yeah, what are you talking about, huh?
Why is my room destroyed?
- Why are you filming this?
- And what is that?
- Um, it's a... it's a-a car muffler.
No.
I want to know what that is.
It's actually a spaceship.
- Munch!
- Sorry.
Uh, well, we-we were following maps, and it just happened to lead here, so we were trying to help our friend Echo-- well, he's an alien
- Oh, God...
- ...that we're trying to get him on a ship.
See, look, it used to have six symbols, but now it has three, so that means we're almost there.
Crazy, right?
Munch, will you shut up?
An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?
- Nope.
- No, no.
- You did not just see that.
- Yeah, I did.
Yeah, she definitely saw it.
- Wait.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, I want to go.
- Really?
Sounds great.
What?
No.
- Dude...
- You're not part of our group, so why don't you just go play with your super rich friends...
That's kind of harsh and your ball gowns and just go eat steak or something.
- What the hell?
- Go, go, go.
Dang, dude, what was that upstairs?
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you so mad.
Yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.
All right, let's just...
don't talk about...
Nothing happened in there, all right?
You know, they say the girls you argue with
- are the ones you like.
Don't go there, bro.
-
- Tuck, it's over there.
Wait, it wants us to go to a bar?
Man, I say we climb in a window or find a door.
There's got to be another way.
Um, before-before we go...
I really need to get the pee out of my body.
-
- Let's just hope the next place isn't a bank.
I can't believe you told that girl to get lost.
- You're so dramatic.
- What about you?
You invented a whole kiss, didn't you?
Uh, first of all, for your info, it's called aspirational thinking.
You're thinking it one moment, you're living it the next.
- How's that working out?
- Oh, excuse me.
Go to the bikes.
Oh, God, oh, God.
- Why is the construction man...
- Shut...
- Excuse me.
- Aw...
H6)'-
I know you guys.
You're the guys... you're from the construction site, right?
Uh, with the, uh, with the camera?
Whoa-ho, wait, wait.
Why aren't you guys at home right now?
You guys weren't riding your bikes out around the desert, were you?
- No, of course not.
- Yes.
Uh, no.
That doesn't sound too... clear.
- Uh...
- Thank God.
There you are.
- What?
Who-who are you?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Exactly!
It's like I don't even know anymore.
My mom had to drag my dad from the bar-- again!
- What?
- He likes to go there more than he likes to tuck in his own kids at night.
At least that's what my mom says.
What's she talking about?
That's her.
Eating a burrito.
She east when she's stressed.
I ask myself if that's gonna be me one day.
What do you think?
Is it?
We make mistakes and we get married and we go to bars.
And these... these are my only friends in the world,
- 'cause they see me Uh... for who I really am.
That's your mom over there?
- Do you want to meet her?
- No.
No.
No, no.
Just get home safe!
Told you guys I wanted to go.
- What the...?
Okay, so this girl, man, she'd been tailing us since her house, spying on us like some creepy stalker.
- She'd overheard our whole plan.
-She... she's crazy.
- I need the bag!
- I think I like it.
- Oh, boy, get ready.
All right, try to blend in.
Look old.
That must've been some good fake I.D.'s.
What's up, baby face?
What are you doing in here, little man?
Oh, uh, I, uh...
- Are you Randy's kid?
- Uh,
-yes, he is.
- Um, y-yeah, yeah, yeah, he's my dad... or mom.
- You know, dad.
Mom.
- Okay, dude, just go.
- Hurry up.
Emma?
Emma?
I was hanging out with this really pretty chick.
She's almost as pretty as you.
I mean... you're not pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.
Come over here.
Hop up on that stool.
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Oh, and one for his buddy here, too.
No, no, I'm all right.
Seriously, I'm all right.
- Sure, you'll like it.
- Sorry, I'm a...
I'm allergic.
Oh, you're gonna love it.
- Uh, no, no.
- You're gonna get one.
So, what happens next?
- Just give me back my bag.
- No.
Give it.
I'm serious.
Give me the bag.
Why are you being mean to me?
- Here, honey.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.
Wow, a lot of people with beards and mustaches in here, you know?
You don't understand.
Whenever you get close to the next piece, it goes crazy.
Oh, my God!
- Whoa!
Aah!
- Uh...
- Are you kidding me?
Do you guys just go around town breaking stuff?
Just keep running!
Go, go!
What was that?
I think the ship's trying to take off!
- Whoa, whoa!
Are you seeing this?
This thing is flying a ship... in your backpack?
I think he's getting better.
Oh.
So, you don't know how he crashed, or when, or why he came here with a spaceship in the first place?
Look, he only answers yes or no-- it's not that simple.
Is this how I talk to him?
- So, you crashed.
Did someone cause you to crash?
- Dude, what's she doing?
- I don't know.
- Someone on Earth?
Do you think they're looking for you?
It's not those guys in trucks from the convenience store, is it?
- The construction man?
Those are the guys that shot you down?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We got to take a step back.
This is way bigger and shadier than before, okay?
This is not good.
If those dudes are looking for Echo, they're looking for us, you know?
Echo?
You need some help there, buddy?
Hey, it's okay.
Shh.
Breathe like me, okay?
It's okay.
Dude, h-he'll be fine.
No.
We're not leaving him.
My whole life, I've been left.
I know how it feels.
We're all he's got.
- Uh, left?
- We could find a shortcut.
The map says up ahead.
This map's confusing.
I was a mind ninja back there...
- So, what was it like kissing me?
- Give me my camera.
- Did your legs get all wobbly?
Was there soft music playing?
Please remind me, Tuck.
I totally forgot.
- What was it like?
- You're close.
Is this your first imaginary kiss?
The map says for us to go inside.
I'm confused.
- Huh?
- Didn't you guys kiss?
Anyway, the point is,
Emma was being annoying-- she kept walking off with Echo like she owned him, and talking to him about
I don't know what, I don't even know.
You know what?
Delete.
Man, are we sure there's no security guards or...
You know, that door wasn't even locked.
Hey, uh, guys, I was just thinking, you know,
I... haven't got to actually hold the, you know, the ship, before we did the thing, so can I do it?
- You know, before it gets crazy?
- Sure, but... it's not a ship.
What?
What are you talking about?
He told us it was a ship.
It's a key to your ship, right?
Well, if this is just the key, where's the spaceship?
-
- All right, Munch, put it down.
-
- Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.
Okay, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to put it down
-before you hurt both of us.
- I need this, man.
- That's weird.
- Does it know her?
- I don't know.
Munch!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- What are you guys doing?
- Wow.
- Um, she was gonna get hit by the piece, so I-l saved her.
Hey!
You four!
Freeze!
- Run!
- Which way?
- Tuck!
- Stop right there!
Stop!
Go, go!
Hurry up!
Hold up, hold up!
Did Alex get out?
Uh, I d...
I don't know.
- We have to go back.
- Uh...
- Come on, you guys.
- Okay.
Look.
Whoa, whoa.
She's being stupid.
There's a guard in there, you know?
You can't just go running in, acting crazy.
We need a-a plan, or...
S... right?
Breaking and entering, destruction of property.
Those are felonies, kid.
Okay, Echo, I need your help.
Um, I need you to...
do something.
I have a minor here; he's 13.
Caught him breaking in with his friends.
If you could send an officer down.
Stay put.
Hello?
-
- Anybody there?
- Hello?
Hello?
ls anybody there?
...there...
ls anybody there... there...
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Alex.
Alex.
- Wh-Where's Tuck?
- We got to go.
- We should've gone back.
- All right, you know what?
Calm down, because if people would've listened to me, then Alex never would have gotten caught.
Didn't I say there would be security guards?
Alex!
Dude!
You're all right!
Are you all right?
Hey, Alex, we're good, man.
All right?
- Buddy?
- We're good, man?
Alex.
Come on, dude.
Alex!
We could've gone home, but we didn't.
- We were outside.
- Turn off the camera.
Not till you admit you're acting mopey for no reason.
You're always freaking out if anyone's gonna leave you behind.
Do you know how expensive that is?
I'm glad I'm moving.
You were never my friend.
- Is that right?
Is that right?
- Guys, guys,
- come on, just-just chill out.
- Come on!
Have you lost your mind?
TUCK woke-every.
I acted like I didn't know what I'd done.
But I knew exactly.
I know we're all tired and stuff, and hungry.
I saw this awesome diner.
We can totally just go grab
- a bite to eat or something.
- Real awesome, guys.
- Real macho.
So, that's it?
The night's over?
Doesn't have to be.
Right?
Well, I mean, if it is, uh, we could...
I don't know, I guess we can keep the mood going, yeah?
Or we can do it another time, right?
Good times, the continuation, part two.
Right?
Hmm.
You know what?
I'm gonna talk about Sandra.
Man, that girl used to beat the crap out of you.
Me, too.
We were both little, small and scrawny.
She was a big girl, and she knew it.
But then I had a growth spurt, and you didn't, and I finally did something.
You remember that?
You told her I had polio.
Yeah, I told her that, and did she beat you up after that?
She still beat me up.
'Cause I-l always get your back, man.
I never let you down;
I always get your back.
Most of the time.
Just when I'm not freaked out about security guards, all right?
I'm sorry, man.
Are we good?
Yeah.
Dude.
Faster.
Sure are doing some traveling tonight.
My parents are in the bathroom.
Uh-huh.
Let it go.
What are you doing?
- Dude!
Hey, what are you doing?
!
- Oh, God!
Don't grab our stuff like that!
- Stop!
- Hey, give me the backpack!
- Who do you think you are?
- The police have been instructed to come and pick up these kids and take them home.
He can't just walk away.
- What was it?
- The phone.
- No, no, no!
- Munch!
- Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
Oh, my...
Munch!
This is not real, this is not real, this is not real right now.
- Don't let them see you.
-
- Now!
Munch!
Do you see the truck?
Munch!
Munch!
That guy is not a construction worker.
- it's Munch.
- I need help, guys.
I really didn't think this through.
We're here, we're here.
Are you hurt?
Can you guys hear me...?
- Are you okay?
- Where are you, Munch?
We'll find you, all right?
I promise.
I think I'm at the construction site.
- Come on, buddy.
- Munch!
I can see the big lights and up at those...
- the white trucks...
How far is your neighborhood?
It's way over an hour.
All right, I think I got a faster way.
Who wants to go to a party?
Are you sure he'll even be here?
Better be.
His girlfriend's throwing it.
A'?
I can't believe we're doing this.
Sophomores.
Hey, sweet party.
Sweet jams.
Guys, what are we doing here?
We can't be...
Just look for my brother.
Look for his keys.
- Oh, my gosh, it's the cops.
- Okay.
Oh, God, the keys, the keys.
I lost my keys.
I have a Porsche.
Marcus!
Oh, not you, sorry.
I wasn't trying to stop the fun-
- I like it.
- Whoa...!
Hi.
Uh, sorry to bother everyone.
Have you seen my brother, Marcus?
Tall guy?
You seen his car keys?
- Uh, anyone?
- Guys, the cops are here!
- What?
- Yeah, the cops are here.
- Turn it down, turn it down.
- Dude, stop...
No, I'm serious, the cops are here right now.
Alex!
Alex!
-
- We have to go now.
All right, just come on, come on.
We got to move.
Hurry, hurry.
We can't hide here.
Look, look, just stay here.
He's my brother;
I'll find him.
Just... don't let the cops take the footage.
All right?
You live here, right?
The cops!
Marcus?
Marcus, we're here.
The party's shut down.
That's enough.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Tuck's gonna freak.
Uh, here, check his pockets.
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.
Cops are gone.
- Uh, Tuck, Tuck?
- I have no idea where Marcus is.
Yeah.
Tell me you got that on tape?
My name is Reginald "Munch" Barrett.
This is my...
kind of my final message.
To my best friends...
I love you, guys.
You're Googling it?
Really?
Oh, come on, this is what the Internet is for.
Um, "step one, get a driver's license."
- Do we have one of those?
- Oh, wow.
All right, am I good?
'
- Stop!
Stop!
All right, all right.
Dude, do you even know what you're doing?
No, I don't.
"Step two, be calm."
-
- What are you doing?
!
- Sorry, sorry.
- Be calm is step two?
All right, all right, all right.
I got it, I got it.
- Hold on a sec..
- Stop!
- Tuck, Tuck, turn!
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.
- Uh...
- Oh, my God.
We're good, we're good.
All right, I'm excited.
Should I gun it?
- No, no, no, don't.
- No, Tuck.
I need, I need music.
Somebody just play some music.
- All right.
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my God.
Change it.
A'?
Everywhere we'd been that night, shot by us like a rocket.
All we wanted was our friends back.
A'?
A'?
I'm gonna miss it here, man.
Yeah, me too.
Here we go.
I don't know about this.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
That does not look like a freeway.
- Get down.
Shh, Shh.
All right, so what's the plan?
I don't know.
Get him out?
So, in other words, we don't have a plan.
Go, go, go.
I'm just gonna call Munch's phone and see if his phone rings.
Wait a minute.
Dude, my camera's not a doorstop.
I hear his voice.
Shh.
MUNCH".
I-l knew it was you guys 'cause I saw the same truck from my neighborhood.
Tell us the truth.
l-l had a lot of adrenaline rush, and...
I...
I didn't want the night to end.
And I... and it was the last night with Alex.
Oh, shit, Munch.
Stop crying and talk to us.
This is not good.
I'm not...
I'm not crying!
What?
Where is that?
We got to find him and get him out of there, man.
- Just don't kill me!
Did he access your phones at all?
Were there others like it or was this the only one you found?
What are they doing?
Dude, they're breaking him!
Guys?
Guys, someone's coming.
We should go.
Go, go.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, construction man!
- Give me the camera.
- Listen...
This is not your camera.
Hey, guys, go!
- And find Munch!
- Let go of me!
Get off of us, man, this isn't...
- My camera!
- Let go.
Is that thing still on?
Okay, no more lies.
No more sneaking around.
No more cameras, understand?
Son, look at me.
Look at me.
Oh, I-l see better with my glasses on, you know?
This signal has been transmitting for a very long time, from a ship that we believe is located right here in your neighborhood.
- What?
- Wait, what's he talking about?
Six days ago, an object entered our atmosphere at 20,000 miles an hour, on a direct course for that ship.
We shot it down.
What you found activates the ship, and if that ship takes off, it could kill everyone.
He just wants to go home.
Okay, that will not happen.
He is far too valuable.
This is crazy, this is crazy.
So... we are gonna follow this map and you are gonna help us get that thing operational, and it will lead us back to its ship, and we will disable it permanently.
Am I clear?
-
- Am I clear?
Y-Yeah.
Good.
Check the doors, check the doors.
It's locked;
it's not just locked.
They don't have a handle on it.
- Someone help!
- Where are they taking us?
-
- Hey, yo!
Let us out, man!
Someone!
Well, the sun's up.
Our parents are gonna find out.
I think we got bigger problems than our parents.
A'?
A'?
Where are we?
Let's go!
All right, everybody knows the drill.
Let's set it up.
- He's not moving.
- Stop!
A'?
Can you see me?
Beep?
We're all here.
We're gonna get you home, all right?
We'll find a way.
Nichols, man, it's not there.
No.
Please, you have to work.
Just try.
Echo?
Don't!
Echo!
You can't go; you can't!
It's over.
Let's keep them quiet.
Come on, man.
It's...
It's time to go.
What's happening?
What is that?
Here he goes.
Back up.
Get ready.
Whoa.
Okay, now!
Where are we going?
Home!
His ship's in Mulberry Woods.
Dude, go!
How do I drive?
Will you drive?
!
Please drive!
Just hurry up!
Alex, dude, you don't have your seat belt on!
.Just speed up!
- Just go!
--30, go, go, go, go!
They're right there!
You have to speed!
- I'm trying!
- You're driving...!
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
- Tuck, you're gonna
- get us killed!
- Where do I go?
- Just go around them.
- No, hold on.
- Don't go on the wrong side!
Dude, stop, stop!
- Oh!
- What the...?
- Oh, my gosh.
- Whoa, whoa!
Are you...
Are you seeing this?
Thanks, buddy.
I need an Advil.
We can't afford this right now.
We really can't afford this right now.
Dude, look, there's a new map.
A what?
Here, here, give me the phones back.
I think that's his ship.
Whoa, that's a big ship.
Alex, I don't want to stress you out or anything, but they're right there!
- Oh, my God.
Alex, it's your morn.
- Don't answer it.
- Why would I answer it?
- Betty?
- Dude.
- Munch.
- Betty?
Hi.
- Sorry about my tone last night.
- Oh, I just thought it would be nice to have the boys have a nice night
-together before we're all uprooted.
- You're crying.
- Munch, it's your mom.
- What?
!
Look, look, look, look.
Dude.
- You okay?
- So, Janice, gotta go-- on my jog.
Can we act like we never had this conversation?
Uh, uh, just come over this wall.
Are you up?
- Guys, they're here.
- Jump.
- Move!
- Faster!
They can't catch us in our own backyard.
Let's cut them off.
Munch, hurry UP!
- Okay, okay.
- Munch!
Well, I don't jump walls very much, man!
Here, hold my camera.
Dude, come on, come on, come on.
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Tuck, wait!
They're right behind us!
Come on, guys, we got to go, we got to go.
Let's go, right now.
It's down the hill.
Come on, let's go!
Shh.
Go, go, go.
It says the ship is up ahead.
This is the way to your house, man.
- Go, 90, 90, guys!
- Are your parents awake?
I think we...
I think we lost them.
-
- Okay_
I don't...
I don't get it.
I...
This is where the map ends.
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship.
Maybe it's invisible.
What is it?
Wait, what-what's he talking about?
What do you want us to...
Dude, what?
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa...
- Oh.
Everybody good?
What's down there?
Be careful, man.
What?
That's it.
Dude, it-it's underneath.
So this whole time...
That's why they want all our houses.
They were digging.
Yo, Alex, I know what you're thinking.
Alex!
Alex, man!
Th-The only way that thing can take off is to come up out of the ground through us.
That's a really bad idea.
Dude, what are you doing?
This is not just about us anymore.
It's about other people now, a whole community still asleep in their beds.
Let's just think this through first.
- I trust him.
- Listen to us.
Alex!
Alex!
Alex!
A'?
A'?
Is this where we're supposed to be?
Make up a plan.
- No, we got to run.
- What are you talking about?
- If the ship's right under...
- We can't leave.
- I know we can't leave him.
- What about Alex?
What about everyone up here that's gonna die?
Alex!
Dude, say something!
Oh, my God.
A'?
I left you behind once.
I'm not doing it again.
Hi, guys.
Whoa.
Whoa.
This... this is in-insane.
A'?
A'?
So, um, beep.
Uh, um,
I don't really know how to say good-bye... so I'm not gonna.
And, um...
Um...
You're my friend, you know?
Even when I'm old, even when... even when you think I've forgotten...
I'm always gonna be there.
Do you feel that?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, we need to go now!
We have to go.
Bye.
Go, go, go!
Wait, wait, wait, my camera!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Dude, are you all right?
- Everybody good?
- Are you all right?
Okay.
That was so close.
What the heck?
- Oh, my...
- What the...?
Yeah!
Oh, my God.
Dude, this is amazing.
I think you're gonna want to get this.
Oh!
We did it, dude.
We did it.
Dude!
Did you see that?
Did you see...
- Wow.
We did that!
- You're like...
That's insane.
We just did that!
That's...
Look, come on.
Look, look, people want to know what happened.
if we told them what happened, they wouldn't believe us.
Guys, it's morning.
Oh, crap, I gotta get home.
- My dad is gonna kill me.
- I think I need a ride.
We should go because people, they'll start asking--
Hey, buddy...
Did you guys feel that earthquake?
- Were you okay?
- No, Mom, I'm fine.
- Let me see.
- He's fine.
Honey, he's fine.
Did no one just see the giant spaceship?
!
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, a spaceship.
What just happened?
!
Oh, oh, okay, okay.
I know it's been really hard lately,
-and we've all been really overwhelmed.
- Just...
Why don't we... why don't we just go in and relax.
Maybe we can, um, go get that-that pizza we talked about.
- All right?
Yeah.
- Pizza?
- If we don't play along,
- Yeah, his mom saw the ship.
- Nobody's gonna get it okay?
- How could I play along?
- So just...
- Yes, I'm sure.
I found them here at Alex's.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, no, no.
Actually, uh, we found him here.
I thought he was staying with you.
No, I was told they were at Munch's.
I'll call you back, babe.
Yeah, yeah, they were at my house.
We-we played this game where you play as a guy with the soul of a dragon, and it had really good voices.
The voices were great, so...
Who's this?
That's Emma.
I'm, uh, he's my boyfriend.
I mean, friend who's a boy.
- Urn...
- Awkward.
She's hot, right?
Knock it off, you.
A'?
Six hours later, Alex moved.
I just got grounded for, like, life.
Me, too.
Might as well move now.
Not gonna be seeing anyone for a while.
Yeah.
But this... what really happened tonight-- no one knows but us.
Hey, Alex!
Time to go, buddy.
A'?
I'm gonna miss you guys.
You guys smell really bad.
Our last night together, we did a lot.
A whole lot.
But there's some things we couldn't do.
Alex's parents had already bought a new home.
Most of the neighborhood had.
Munch 's, too.
So, one by one, people started to move.
My parents hadn't, so we got to stay.
New people started moving in, and Mulberry Wood started again,
but not the one that had my friends in it.
When you're a kid, you think you're invisible.
You think you can't make a difference.
We're not kids anymore.
We know now... that we can do anything.
A'?
Having a friend light-years away taught us that distance is just a state of mind.
If you're best friends, then you always will be no matter where you are in the universe.

You guys got to see this.
TCS Subtitling
Hey, hey, Tuck, dude.
- Okay, we're rolling.
- Okay, hold on.
B-Before you go, look-look at my coat.
- It's cool, huh?
- What is that?
Can we do another take with it on, though?
No.
Okay.
- (clears throat)
- TUCK:
Ready when you are.
(sniffs) Okay.
How do I smell?
Or I mean, look, or you know?
Yeah, you can't smell a video.
Okay.
(clears throat)
- Ruckus, dude, you got to get out of here.
- (barks)
Hi, I'm Reginald.
I don't really get friends much, but it's probably because I'm a bit of... an acquired taste.
That's what my mom says.
And I'm sure whatever school I'm forced to go to no one will acquire it.
So... thanks for paving a road over, really, the only place I've ever had any real friends.
Okay, we good?
- TUCK:
Uh, say your name.
- I thought you knew my name.
You know what I mean;
for the video.
Dude, we've been hanging out for years.
- Come on.
- Dude, stop fronting.
Just tell the camera.
You're upset, right?
You don't want to move.
TUCK (voice-over):
I've never gone a day without seeing my friends.
They're, like, the only people in the world who get me.
And now it's just all over, you know?
Good luck finding that again.
So wherever-wherever Munch is going, man...
Look, you people listen to me, all right?
He's-he's a really good kid.
So don't just assume that he's weird and that's it.
And Alex, man...
He's a foster kid.
He's been moved all over.
I mean, it's like, why do you have to build a freeway right through?
You know, can't you just go around or something?
You're going along feeling like your own person with your own friends, and then something like this comes along that you have no power to stop because you're just a kid.
(scoffs)
You're just a kid.
(phone rings)
Yeah, hey, man.
(sniffs)
Yeah, yeah, I'm up, I'm up.
Whoa, whoa, man, slow down.
What's the problem?
Yeah, my-my phone's good.
Why?
What happened?
- Wait, what?
- (click)
(voice-over):
This is when everything started to change.
So, being me,
I kept filming.
I'm Tuck.
What you're about to see happened to me and my best friends one year ago.
This is the story of our last week together.
- (static buzzes, crackles)
- Phones all over our neighborhood are freaking out.
We've done everything we could possibly do with this phone.
We threw it at the wall, we took it to the phone guy, we took it to the store where we got it from, and they say it's a problem.
So you know it's serious.
It looks like your phone basically barfed on the screen.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I was just eating dinner, and all of a sudden, all the phones in the house just did this.
At exactly the same time.
Dude.
- What?
It's freaky.
- (phone rings)
- De hello?
- Hey, Alex.
Oh, Munch, you're outside.
MUNCH:
Get over here, over here, down the street.
TUCK:
Ask him if his phone barfed yet.
ALEX:
Did your phone barf yet?
- Phones are still working.
- ALEX:
Cool.
Keep going, and we'll meet you in the backyard.
Okay, copy that.
I'll take swift steps.
TUCK (voice-over):
When I look back at that day,
I realize the clues were all around us.
(chuckles) We had no idea.
Dude, they all still work.
See?
(panting)
Dude, you know if this whole thing works,
- these phones are done.
- No, I know.
- I have 14 spares; it's okay.
- (phone chirps)
- (scoffs) I bet you do.
- Okay.
All right, anyways, let's spread out.
- Okay.
- Alex, go by the gate.
Munch, go on the far end,
- Yeah, I got it.
- And I'll stay right here by my camera.
- Just watch out!
- Okay, okay.
Okay, it's good.
It's good...
It's good...
- (static screeching)
- Whoa, okay, it went out.
TUCK:
Whoa, whoa, it barfed!
All right, people, if you go to Alex's house, your phones will spew chunks all over his screen.
My mom said the Murphys' phones and the Churleys' changed, too.
So what do you think this is?
TUCK:
Whoa!
- (Tuck chuckles) - (doorbell rings)
(Tuck groans)
These dudes.
- (low, indistinct radio chatter)
- Hi.
- Is that on?
- I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Oh.
We had an electrical short over at the site, and it may be disrupting people's phone service, and we're wondering if that happened
- to anybody in this house?
- Oh, no, my phone is good.
- 'Cause we're offering new phone vouchers
- Uh-huh.
In exchange for any device in this area here
- that may be displaying
- That's weird, that's weird.
- Faulty messages or images?
- I don't know.
See you.
No, listen, I...
Okay, so you-you really don't think this is a little bit weird?
These dudes come here to build a freeway
- and now they want our phones?
- Well, I think it's gonna work.
No.
Clean your room.
Oh, my...
I'm not gonna have a room if we don't do something.
- Right, I think...
- No, Mom, seriously.
These guys want our houses.
Maybe if we expose them for illegal property, then...
- TUCK:
Yo!
- Aw, you don't like how things are, do you?
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
- (electronic chime)
- Dude, it's a map to the desert.
Like, what is that?
What do we do with this?
I guess most maps are made to be followed.
Exactly.
It could go to, like, some crazy headquarters, and we find out that these construction clowns are spies and we expose them to the world.
It's 20 miles away.
What...
No, we're not...
we're not gonna go.
No, obviously not.
Look, whatever it is, this Saturday, we're going to sneak behind our parents' backs and find out.
I'm moving Saturday.
All right, all right, so Friday night.
Our last night together?
It doesn't have to be;
that's what I'm saying.
Like, I don't want to move, and these clowns are making us do it.
Maybe we can stop them.
Now, are you in?
Yeah, all right.
- All right.
- I'm in.
Munch, don't you bail out on us now.
Dude, I'm not.
Me?
No... pfft!
I'm in.
Yeah!
All right!
That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, all right.
Bring it in.
- Oh, oops!
- Munch!
So, why would you be organizing your ketchups?
- Because.
- Who does that?
So I can get to them easier, and then it's more organized,
- and it's better.
- And you are my friend.
Guys, guys, it's time to practice the big lie.
Hey, Morn, I'm spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a neat, brand-new video game.
And I'm sleeping over at Tuck's house so we can play a new video game.
And I'm sleeping in your mom's bed,
- not playing a video game.
- Oh, my God, all right, dude.
Stop talking about my mother, thank you.
All right, the camera's are gonna be on 24 hours a day, nonstop.
Dude, can you stop touching, please?
It attaches to my bike, and it's also a pretty good way to get footage on the fly.
Spy glasses.
I love these;
I love them.
And last, camera, but definitely not least...
What up, camcorder?
Keeping it tight.
Looking pretty good these days.
Tuck, these are the ugliest things I've ever seen.
Dude, what?
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Those are...
They're sweet.
- The camera's undetectable,
- Wow.
- And the ladies love them.
- Prove it.
Prove it?
(scoffs)
This guy, all right?
Give me my glasses, man.
Those are stealth.
Now I'm gonna prove to you guys spy glasses get you girls.
MUNCH:
Oh, my gosh, he's going over there.
- I can't see who he's talking to.
- Shut up, Munch.
TUCK:
Uh, hi, uh...
Hey, um, Em-Emma, right?
Emma?
I was just... (Tuck sputters)
Okay, uh, can I borrow a piece of paper, please?
MUNCH:
He has something.
- I can't see who he got it from.
- We're about to see right now.
Look, look, look, look.
He has a paper.
ALEX:
You did not get her number.
Totally got her number.
Right there.
You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.
You, too, you're a sellout.
No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.
Yes, I did.
Mannequin Girl?
(Alex laughs)
What kind of name is that?
What?
That's what I call her.
I think mannequins are hot.
- (school bell ringing)
- TUCK:
I'll leave my house at 6:00.
15 minutes later, I pick up Alex.
- Munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Tonight, we're no longer boys.
We're men.
(grunts)
- TUCK:
Dude, what the...?
- I didn't see you, man.
(Tuck sighs)
ALEX:
Tuck, you all right?
Let's go.
TUCK (voice-over):
Our whole lives we've been nobodies.
Invisible.
The good kids.
(chuckles) Not anymore.
(indistinct conversation)
All right, Ma.
I'm leaving.
Spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a new video game.
Have whatever you want, honey.
- (conversation continues) - (Tuck sighs)
You know what, I lied, actually.
We're gonna ride our bikes out into the desert at night alone.
Without supervision.
We got that;
we're going to state.
Okay, see you then, sweetie.
- We could go.
- Also rob a bank.
- All the way.
State.
- What?
TUCK:
Go to Mexico.
Maybe even start a new life.
- Right, I know.
- Wrestling!
TUCK'S MOM:
You're trying to act like I don't know what I'm talking about.
(conversation and laughter continue)
What's up, Stumpy?
Yo, man, I told you to stop to calling me that.
You know what, man, look, my girl's throwing this huge party later tonight, if you want to come by.
(engine starts)
You serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
Because not a lady in the world can resist a natty old BMX bike.
What's the zero to 60 on that bad boy, huh'?
Two, three days?
(tires squealing, engine rumbling)
(humming)
Come on, come on, dude, you ready?
Let's go.
(laughs) I can't even tell a difference.
This looks exactly the way it looked before you packed.
All your stuff fitting in one box?
What are you, a drifter?
Who told you?
Look, all I'm saying is, when you get to your new house, put a poster up, put some shelves on the wall, frame a photo.
Look, there's a painting right there.
Put something on a shelf...
That's not a painting.
That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt, smudged it and called it art.
I'm going to Munch's house to play a video game, all right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure, buddy.
- Bye, Dylan.
- Have fun with your friends.
- Hey, hey, Tuck.
- TUCK:
How are you?
Uh, good luck with the move to New York, buddy.
- Maybe we'll come see you.
- All right, cool.
The moving truck is coming at 10:00.
Make sure you're back, okay?
TUCK:
I-l don't get it.
If your foster parents already have a baby of their own, why do they need you?
There's no sense in having two babies.
- Shut up, dude.
- One baby cries all the time, the other one listens to indie rock.
Let's go.
- (Alex whooping) - (Tuck humming)
ALEX:
Yeow!
WOMAN:
Guys, would you please help my son with his room, before I go crazy?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I don't think he's started...
Honey, have you even started packing your room?
MUNCH:
I told you a thousand times,
I'm alphabetizing!
(Alex chuckles)
TUCK:
Yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.
Shh.
(door creaks)
(video playing indistinctly)
MAN (on video): ...they're flexible, they're "dynamical,"
they can be curved, they can bend, and this opens up a whole new universe of possibilities, and one of the possibilities is that there can be shortcuts through space and through time.
So that's really just what a Wormhole is.
It's taking advantage... (boys whispering indistinctly)
(screaming)
What are you...
Aah!
- Why don't you stop doing that?
!
- I'm sorry!
You guys are gonna give me a heart attack one day.
- I'm sorry.
- Turn that off, dude.
(muttering)
- (beeping)
- I created a substation for each of our parents' phones that's wired to the router, which is wired to the transmitter, which transmits to the receiver, which is...
- my phone.
- TUCK:
Okay, so basically, no matter who our parents call, it goes to your phone.
Yeah.
My mom's friends always say that I sound just like my mom, you know,
- when I pick up the phone...
- Yeah.
So I figured, I can be Betty.
(computers and gadgets beeping)
ALEX:
Bye, Betty.
Thank you.
Um, I'm going to Alex's...
or Munch's... or Tuck's house, and we're gonna play a video game and sleep over.
BETTY:
Wait, what's all that stuff?
Honey?
(sighs)
ALEX:
Good job, Munch.
You did it.
TUCK:
Here we come.
17.6 miles.
(Tuck humming happily)
♪ Going to the desert... ♪
Munch, what are you doing?
Guys, guys, just hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Dude...
- I'm not backing out or anything,
- He wants to quit right when we - ...just-just hear me out.
- Been waiting for this forever.
- Dude, listen, come on, okay.
This is crazy what we're doing.
Dude, I don't want to punk out or back out or anything... it's just, my mom, you know, she just got divorced.
- Munch...
- She's already had enough guys lying to her.
If you didn't want to come, then why didn't you tell us earlier?
TUCK:
You do understand this is our last night together.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Look, Munch, if we don't go now, we'll never go.
We won't even be here.
This is our last chance to try and do something.
Even-even if it is stupid.
- Yeah.
- You know what,
I say we put a vote to it.
All in favor raise your hand.
Well, now I have to raise my hand.
Munch, just...
Fine, fine.
Okay, whatever.
I'll go.
But only under one condition.
- TUCK:
I call the black!
- ALEX:
Mine!
No, no, give it!
MUNCH:
It's so weird, no one's gonna be in these houses next week.
ALEX:
Dude, you're so full of it.
- When did you kiss her?
- TUCK:
Dude, trust me.
After pre-algebra, she pulled me into the bathroom.
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Mannequin Girl?
- TUCK:
Yeah!
- Was she good at it?
TUCK:
Uh, eh, B minus.
You know, I've kissed better in better locations.
No, how do I know you're not lying?
TUCK:
Trust me.
I don't even have to reply to you.
- You're last!
- MUNCH:
Hey, you got a head start!
That's not fair!
TUCK:
Oh, so what, there's a Wing Stop?
I never been to a Wing Stop.
(birds squawking)
TUCK (voice-over):
We followed a map out in the middle of nowhere.
MUNCH:
It might be, like, a CIA prison.
TUCK (voice-over):
We were miles from home.
(boys talking indistinctly)
No one in the world knew it.
No one said it... but we were scared.
ALEX:
We haven't seen a car in, like, half an hour.
TUCK (voice-over):
We were on our own.
MUNCH:
This-this is the way, right?
You have the map, right?
- Can I see the map?
- ALEX:
Left.
MUNCH:
Left?
Are you sure?
Because right looks a little bit more promising.
- (coyotes howling, yipping)
- Did you guys hear that?
ALEX:
Just a couple more miles.
(steady electronic pulsing)
TUCK:
Hold on.
What is that?
It's the map.
TUCK:
Are we close?
MUNCH:
I never understood why people like the outdoors.
TUCK:
Will you stop freaking out?
(electronic pulsing continues)
Yo, this is too steep, man.
Let's go, man.
(electronic pulsing continues)
MUNCH:
We're getting pretty far from the road, guys.
ALEX:
Almost there.
(electronic pulsing slows)
TUCK:
Is it this thing?
(sighs)
(electronic trilling, then static crackling)
ALEX:
I don't think so.
(electronic pulsing and trilling stop)
TUCK:
Wait, what was that?
- ALEX:
I don't know.
- Well, hold on.
What'd you see, dude?
- (pulsing resumes)
- TUCK:
Over here!
ALEX:
We're almost there.
Come on.
(electronic pulsing stops)
MUNCH:
Oh.
TUCK:
What?
TUCK:
What do you think it is?
How would I know?
TUCK:
Why does it look all burnt?
MUNCH:
Hey, just be careful.
- Careful!
- Yeah, don't touch that thing.
Could be...
MUNCH:
C-Could be...
I don't know, I don't know.
A part of a satellite?
TUCK:
All right, all right, um, Munch, film me while I'm...
- while I'm touching this thing.
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Let me try it.
Thank you.
It's dusty.
It's a piece of crap.
MUNCH:
What?
Forget about it.
Just turn off the camera.
MUNCH:
Well, it's not a national treasure, but it could be used for something.
(Tuck scoffs) It's crap.
What happened to filming 'cause it's our last night, huh?
Um, in case you haven't noticed, obviously, the map led to squat.
ALEX:
Got it.
So all you cared about was getting your stupid hits on your stupid video?
- Dude, why don't you just...
- MUNCH:
Whoa, guys, guys, guys.
Come on!
I know we're all frustrated...
- (phone ringing, gasps) - it's Alex's mom.
- TUCK:
Are you serious?
- ALEX:
Um, it'll be fine.
Just, um, be Betty, okay?
- Oh, man.
- MUNCH:
Oh, crap.
Yo, I thought I could do this, but I can't.
Maybe you can answer it.
She just likes to check up on things, okay?
All right. (gasps)
WOMAN:
Betty, are you there'?
(whispering):
Go.
This is Betty.
WOMAN:
I was thinking maybe I could bring over some pizzas?
TUCK:
Dude, go.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No coming over.
- Just hang up.
- No way.
No, it's really no trouble.
We have a coupon.
- I said no!
No pizzas!
- What?
- No, uh...
- TUCK:
Don't yell at her, man.
Maybe you and your husband should go to bed.
TUCK:
Stop saying words!
ALEX'S MOM:
Are you sure everything's okay?
Have a good night.
Go to sleep.
(line disconnects, beeps)
(chuckles) That could've gone better.
TUCK:
That was horrible.
"Your husband should go to sleep"?
Was that really something smart to say?
Munch.
Don't look at me like I'm a hoarder.
That's rude.
(distant voices)
ALEX (whispering):
Who are they?
MUNCH:
I don't...
I don't know.
MAN (over radio):
I'm picking up some spikes in the readings...
ALEX:
Get down, get down.
Turn your flashlight off, dummy.
Let's go.
MUNCH:
Why would they be out this far?
TUCK:
Who cares?
The night's blown.
(static crackles)
- Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
(panting)
ALEX:
Munch?
(chuckles)
- You're a character.
- There's something in there!
ALEX:
What?
TUCK:
Dude, are you kidding me right now?
MUNCH:
Something is in that bag.
It-it touched me.
TUCK:
Go check.
MUNCH:
Be-be careful.
(harsh screeching)
- TUCK:
What?
- Did it poke you, too?
TUCK:
What, dude?
Say something!
What did you see?
There-There's something in there.
Yeah, a bunch of crap Munch brought.
(chuckles)
- You guys are funny.
- All I know is it beeped.
You know, why don't you go in there and just see.
TUCK:
Beeped?
What are you talking about?
Babies.
I'll do it myself.
Dang, how much stuff do you have in your bag, dude?
Geez.
Oh, boy, are you guys talking about this?
It's garbage.
It's nothing.
What are you talking about, you heard something?
It made a noise.
Hey, hey, do something!
See, it's not doing anything.
What are you talking about?
Beep.
(snarling, snapping)
(Tuck laughs)
Do that again, do that again.
Do what again?
Do what you just did.
- Beep.
- (snarling, snapping)
Whoa, hold on.
Let me...
Let me try this for myself.
Beep.
Beep?
Why is it making noise only for you and not me?
Make it beep again.
Beep.
- (clank, hissing)
- Whoa!
MUNCH:
This is it!
It's a bomb!
(fading into distance):
No, no, oh, God, no!
No, no, no!
(chittering)
ALEX:
Guys, I think...
I think it might have defused.
I don't know.
TUCK:
Man, nothing's happening.
All right, hold on, hold on.
I got an idea.
MUNCH:
Tuck!
What?
MUNCH:
Okay, it didn't do anything, but j-just don't do it again.
Are you insane, Tuck?
!
Are you sure you guys know what you're doing?
TUCK:
Yes, trust me.
When it's a bomb, you have to act quick.
I seen it on some TV show or some movie or something.
- ALEX:
Saw what?
- Check it out.
MUNCH:
What are you doing?
!
Disarming it.
MUNCH:
Are you crazy?
!
It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.
That's not what you do with a bomb!
Are you insane?
!
- (electronic chirp, pinging)
- What was that?
It's not my phone.
It's the thing, whatever that is.
- What are you talking about?
- It's that.
That's what just made that noise.
(electronic pinging)
I, uh...
It, like, imitated my ringtone.
TUCK:
This is what made our phones barf?
(electronic chittering)
ALEX:
Did you hear that?
- (static crackles)
- ALL:
Whoa, whoa.
All right, so, a couple of seconds ago, our phones went crazy.
Bananas, insane.
I don't know what to call it.
Look.
You see that?
It's a new map, but on my phone this time.
To me?
All right, him, or...
Dude, Munch's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and, ugh, I don't even know what that is.
Alex's phone, it just turned on by itself and started filming.
We can't even turn them off.
Oh, don't try to act like it's not cool.
That is weird.
ALEX:
It's showing us where we are.
MUNCH:
And you don't find that creepy?
What do you think that is?
You think that's a road?
We should follow the map.
MUNCH:
How about no.
TUCK:
How about yes?
We wanted a last night together, so what do you call this?
A trap?
MUNCH:
Didn't you guys see the "No Trespassing" sign?
TUCK:
Oops.
I didn't see anything.
(electronic tone pulsing, stuttering)
This is where the map says to go.
(leaves crunching)
Stop stepping on leaves.
MUNCH:
There's leaves everywhere.
(indistinct talking)
- (grunting)
- Shh.
What was that?
(electronic tone pulsing, stuttering)
Where do you think it's taking us to?
(indistinct talking continues)
(electronic tone continues)
MUNCH:
Maybe another one of those beepy things.
(tone continues, louder)
(electronic tone continues, pulsing slows)
(electronic tone stops)
(static crackles)
(static buzzes, crackles)
(deep rumbling)
(metal creaking)
What was that?
I don't know.
(creaking continues, rumbling fades)
(rattling, clanking, quiet warbling)
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Get down!
Oh, geez!
Munch, watch out!
Aah!
Aah!
TUCK:
Aah!
ALEX:
What's going on?
Dude, Munch, what was that?
(clattering, rumbling)
(boys scream)
TUCK:
Where is it?
Is it over?
- Oh, geez.
- (screaming)
Dude!
MUNCH:
Tuck, stay back.
- TUCK:
Whoa.
- MUNCH:
Stay back.
- (electronic warbling)
- MUNCH:
What's...
TUCK:
Dude!
(whirring, beeping)
- Wait, wait, be careful.
- (electronic chittering)
MUNCH:
Your phone just got a new map.
ALEX:
What?
(electronic whirring)
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait, why is it opening?
TUCK:
Hold on, hold on.
Did you see that just now?
- (electronic chittering)
- ALEX:
What is that?
- TUCK:
Whoa!
What is that?
- MUNCH:
What is that?
- What is that?
- Oh, my...
Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.
ALEX:
it-it's moving.
TUCK:
There's something in there right now.
MUNCH:
What's in there?
Oh, don't tell me.
ALEX:
Are those... eyes?
(electronic chittering)
Dude, dude, it's looking dead at us right now.
MUNCH:
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
ALEX:
It's trembling like it's hurt.
MUNCH:
Good.
TUCK:
My heart's beating so fast right now.
Wow.
MUNCH:
Almost got us killed, like, three times already.
Yeah, but it was worth it, dude.
Incredible.
All right, so...
I just figured out why Alex's camera was on this whole time.
So this thing, whatever it is, it's eyes are, like, all screwed up, completely.
You see?
So, basically, it uses his phone to see.
That's insane.
(Alex chuckles)
ALEX (distorted):
You think he can see us right now?
(electronic chittering)
Munch, you have to check this out.
This is amazing.
(click, electronic snarl)
MUNCH:
Is it?
Is it amazing?
'Cause I think it's scary as balls.
I mean, obviously people are looking for it.
- Munch...
- it has access to our voicemails and our texts and our ringtones.
TUCK:
How do you even know it's a he?
Are you a dude?
(beeps)
(chuckles)
Wait... you understood us.
(beeps, warbles)
Whoa. (chuckles)
All right, here's how it goes.
One beep is yes, two beeps are no.
Watch.
Is one beep yes?
(beeps once)
TUCK:
Yo, that's so tight.
Are we in a barn?
(beeps once) ls Munch really a woman?
(beeps twice)
Oh, come on, man, this thing is broken.
Everybody knows Munch is a woman.
Okay, I have a question.
Are we gonna die tonight?
Why isn't it answering?
What...
Well, that's not good, right?
20 questions with an alien.
Tuck Simms exclusive.
- Let's do this.
- Check it out.
All right, urn, are you from space?
- (beeps once)
- Ooh!
Are you a robot?
(beeps twice)
Do you eat humans?
(beeps twice)
(sighs)
Do you like Earth?
(beeps twice)
Why?
Why doesn't he like Earth?
Do you like us?
(beeps once)
You see?
I told you.
We're cool like that.
Come on.
Are you hurt?
(beeps once)
- Oh.
- He's hurt.
Well, his lights seem brighter, so...
Did that piece help you?
(beeps once)
Uh.
Can we help fix you or something?
Or...
Like, what is this?
Are-are you trying to build something?
- (beeps once)
- Oh, he's trying to build...
Building something.
Right there.
- What could he be building?
- Yeah.
So, wait, what are, what are you building?
- Lasers?
- (beeps twice)
- A portal?
- (beeps twice)
- Minions?
- (beeps twice)
- A cloaking device?
- (beep twice)
- it's an army.
- (beeps twice)
Ignore him.
- Spaceship?
- (deep electronic whir)
Oh, my God!
Hold up, hold up.
So let me get this right.
So you're building a spaceship,
- He's building a spaceship.
- And you need our help building the spaceship?
- (beeps once)
- Oh, man.
This guy is building a spaceship.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Let me make sure I don't have any plans.
Nope!
We're building a spaceship!
He's building a spaceship.
TUCK (voice-over):
We asked him questions for almost two hours.
Where he came from.
If there were others here like him.
We found out he was lost... and alone.
He was out in the middle of nowhere, on his own, like us.
All we really knew was that he crashed, and now he needed us to rebuild him.
ALEX:
The map says up ahead.
MUNCH:
Are we going the right way?
(horns honking, distorted)
Look, look, look, look, whatever that is, the map goes to it.
All right, so wait-wait a minute.
Let me get this right.
Dude comes from a million light-years away, and he wants to come here?
I don't know, the map said so.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You got to look both ways before you cross the street.
ALEX:
Munch.
(electronic doorbell dinging)
(Tuck chuckles)
So are you... snoopy.
CUSTOMER:
Ten dollars?
- OWNER:
I said no deal.
- $7.50.
OWNER:
I don't want it.
It's tchotchke trash.
If you give it to me as a gift, I'd still throw it away.
- It's trash.
- CUSTOMER:
No, it's vintage.
OWNER:
No.
You don't get to say the word "vintage."
I'm the one who gets to say when what is vintage.
Excuse me, sir, you have a very, very lovely shop.
MAN:
Come on, you sure?
Hey-
Oh, man, look at the hand painting.
It's all crafted right there.
- One of a kind.
- OWNER:
It's trash.
(static buzzing)
(phones buzzing)
- (thumping, rumbling) - (boys gasp)
- (rumbling) - (sustained, high-pitched tone)
Uh, uh...
- (tone fades)
- TUCK:
What was that?
F-sharp?
- (metallic creaking) - (horns blow, squeak)
(note fades slowly)
- (instruments popping, sounding) - (gasping, exclaiming)
No, no, no!
Come on!
ALEX:
Watch out!
Watch out!
(chaotic tooting, banging)
(owner exclaims in native language)
- (Tuck laughs)
- OWNER:
What was it?
MUNCH:
Whoa. is everybody okay?
- (Alex coughing)
- TUCK:
Hey, Nichols, are you alive?
CUSTOMER:
They broke my girlfriend's lamp!
TUCK:
Wait, what is he doing?
- MUNCH:
Oh.
Whoa, whoa.
- TUCK:
ls-is that...
- OWNER:
Sweet babushka.
- (Tuck laughs)
You want to sell it?
- Tuck, let's go!
Come on!
- Run!
What are you waiting for?
TUCK:
Dude, that place was wrecked!
MUNCH:
Sorry again, sir!
ALEX:
Go!
Go!
Down here!
TUCK:
Let's get somewhere so we can look at him.
(electronic chittering)
ALEX:
He's shaking.
(electronic chittering)
TUCK:
Whoa, he's letting you touch him.
- MUNCH:
I wouldn't, guys.
- Hey, what about here?
Here, set him on here.
- (Alex laughs)
- MUNCH:
He looks scared.
TUCK:
Yeah, why is he all balled up?
Can't you stand?
You all right?
- (electronic chittering)
- MUNCH:
Maybe he's... maybe he's just shy.
- Ooh, can you fly?
- TUCK:
Can you do X-ray vision?
MUNCH:
How?
He can't see.
ALEX (chuckles):
He doesn't even know where to look.
TUCK:
All right, all right, I think the question is, what can you do?
TUCK:
Okay, so Dr. Nichols is doing a surgical procedure with very sophisticated technology.
- Pen caps.
- (Tuck laughs)
Clear.
MUNCH:
Wait, I don't get it.
How is that sophisticated?
It's kind of just, like, pen caps.
I got it.
(quiet electronic warbling)
TUCK:
Be careful.
His legs are fragile.
- (Alex laughs)
- MUNCH:
Whoa.
Get this.
Are you getting this?
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
(Tuck laughs)
TUCK:
Oh, that's crazy!
So you can't fly, but you can float.
- (electronic chirp)
- TUCK:
That is so crazy!
(all laughing)
I saw you.
I saw you grinning, man.
Stop trying to pretend like that wasn't cool.
- That was hot.
- This is crazy.
I mean, it's-it's just crazy.
- (electronic chirp)
- ALEX:
Whoa.
Don't drop it.
Huh.
(electronic chirp, low whirring)
(zaps)
(chirps)
- Can you see me?
- (chirping, pinging)
(Alex imitates pinging)
- (pinging)
- TUCK:
Huh, I think he likes you.
Will you show us where you live?
- (chirps)
- All right.
Beep faster if I'm getting close.
(beeping)
- (rapid beeping)
- Is that it, right there?
(quiet electronic warbling)
Why don't I go first.
Hi.
Um, my name's Alex, and... you're-you're in...
Munch, no... you're in my hand right now.
You know my ringtone, which is, like, insane and awesome.
(electronic pinging)
(whirring)
(chirping)
Okay, um...
Hi.
I'm Tuck.
What's up?
I don't even know what to say, but, uh... but, uh, I'm from...
I'm from New York.
Uh, this is Nevada.
I don't even know, like, I like donuts,
- um...
- ALEX:
Donuts?
Really?
Okay, can somebody else do this?
I know, I'm going.
My name's M...
My real name is Reginald, but my friends call me Munch.
I hope we can be friends, too.
- (electronic chirping)
- Do you have a name?
Oh, we could call him Beep.
Dude, what-what kind of name is Beep?
Word.
We got to give him a name that's powerful, like... like Master Blaster.
He doesn't blast anything.
Peter.
Peter.
What about Peter?
Something cool, like Space Ninja or something.
MUNCH:
Well, how is there a ninja in space?
He wouldn't be able to breathe.
- All right, all right...
- Dude, you don't know that.
Have you ever been to space?
Which name do you like?
- MUNCH:
Uh, Beep.
Why?
- (beeps)
There it is.
- Hello.
Watch this.
Watch this.
- You can't echo...
Watch this.
Just...
Beep.
- (beeps)
- See?
- Echo.
- (chirps)
That's what we should call it.
Echo.
- (chirps)
- Oh, 'cause it echoes.
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Echo, Echo, Echo.
- Echo.
Your name... is Echo.
ECHO (distorted):
Echo...
Echo... (voice distorting unintelligibly)
ALEX:
I don't think he's supposed to come out of that cylinder thing.
MUNCH:
He looks... dead.
TUCK (faintly):
Echo?
TUCK (voice-over):
So then we didn't know how broken he was.
(electronic chirping)
The crash hurt him worse than we thought.
- (weak chirp)
- ALEX:
Okay, little guy... where do you want us to go?
(chirps)
(electronic whirring)
(dog barks in distance)
MUNCH:
Guys?
You know this is considered being a burglar, right?
TUCK (voice-over):
With each new piece, he got strong.
And that's what we were gonna do... make him stronger.
(tone pulses briefly)
- (whispers):
Which way?
- Around.
- MUNCH:
In the house?
!
- TUCK:
Dude!
(Munch groans)
MUNCH:
Maybe we should just knock on the door and...
MAN:
We just need you to listen, sweetheart.
- TUCK (sighs):
Oh, man.
- GIRL:
You're grounding me?
ALEX:
Tuck, what are you doing?
Munch, go.
MAN:
It's the man... the man should choose his dance partner.
GIRL:
It's a stupid tradition.
WOMAN:
Really, it's about meeting new people, and many of those were our friends' sons.
And it's embarrassing when you ignore them.
MEN:
And these are life skills that we are teaching you.
- MUNCH:
Tuck, get back.
- Putting on this dress for you doesn't change me into some perfect little homecoming queen!
MAN:
Okay, no one's asking you to act like a homecoming queen.
WOMAN:
It's at least three years away.
MUNCH:
Now.
Go, go, go.
WOMAN:
...by the company you keep.
It's a cliché for a reason.
I'm sure this all seems...
MUNCH:
Guys, what are we doing?
We're gonna be trapped up here.
TUCK:
Everybody be quiet.
- (electronic whirring) - (woman continues indistinctly)
GIRL:
Yeah, everyone!
(woman and man continue indistinctly)
TUCK:
You got to be kidding me.
Aw, you know what?
Everyone just follow me, all right?
Don't look at anything.
Just hurry.
- Hey, Tuck, did you see this?
- No, don't...
Dude, Tuck, this is Mannequin Girl's house.
Now we can ask for permission to steal stuff, 'cause, you know, you guys are kissing buddies.
Aw, man...
TUCK:
It was a couple of days ago.
She probably forgot about it by now, you know?
Like, yeah, it's...
yeah, she probably forgot.
- How would she forget about it?
- I almost forgot about it... (deep rumbling)
- TUCK:
Oh, boy, get ready.
- Uh-oh.
Close the door.
Close the door.
- (rumbling, clattering)
-Guys...
- Dude, we just got to keep it from going crazy.
It's gonna get loud.
We'll catch it in a blanket.
- What?
(gasps)
- Whoa!
- Get down!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Stop letting it move!
MUNCH:
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
GIRL:
How to unfold a napkin?
!
- Who cares!
- MAN:
Fine!
GIRL:
And in no time in my life am I gonna be somewhere
- that even plays the foxtrot!
- TUCK:
Close the door.
- (low electronic warble)
- Yo, put it away, man.
ALEX:
Shh.
Be quiet.
- (door opens)
- GIRL:
What the...?
Wait, I know you.
- Hey.
It's okay.
- (gasps)
Hey, hey, hey, we're with Tuck.
Tuck Simms.
You know?
Remember you guys kissed?
- We what?
- Yeah, what are you talking about, huh?
Why is my room destroyed?
- Why are you filming this?
- (electronic chirping)
- And what is that?
- Um, it's a... it's a-a car muffler.
No.
I want to know what that is.
MUNCH:
It's actually a spaceship.
- Munch!
- Sorry.
Uh, well, we-we were following maps, and it just happened to lead here, so we were trying to help our friend Echo...
well, he's an alien
- TUCK:
Oh, God...
- ...that we're trying to get him on a ship.
See, look, it used to have six symbols, but now it has three, so that means we're almost there.
Crazy, right?
ALEX:
Munch, will you shut up?
An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?
- ALEX:
Nope.
- TUCK:
No, no.
(Echo chirps "no")
(electronic chirping)
- You did not just see that.
- Yeah, I did.
MUNCH:
Yeah, she definitely saw it.
- GIRL:
Wait.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, I want to go.
- Really?
Sounds great.
ALEX:
What?
No.
- Dude...
- You're not part of our group, so why don't you just go play with your super rich friends...
TUCK:
That's kind of harsh and your ball gowns and just go eat steak or something.
- GIRL:
What the hell?
- TUCK:
Go, go, go.
(dog barking in distance)
TUCK:
Dang, dude, what was that upstairs?
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you so mad.
MUNCH:
Yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.
ALEX:
All right, let's just...
don't talk about...
Nothing happened in there, all right?
TUCK:
You know, they say the girls you argue with
- are the ones you like.
- (Alex sighs)
ALEX:
Don't go there, bro.
- (electronic whirring)
- Tuck, it's over there.
TUCK:
Wait, it wants us to go to a bar?
Man, I say we climb in a window or find a door.
There's got to be another way.
MUNCH:
Um, before-before we go...
I really need to get the pee out of my body.
- (Tuck groans)
- Let's just hope the next place isn't a bank.
(Echo beeping)
TUCK:
I can't believe you told that girl to get lost.
- You're so dramatic.
- ALEX:
What about you?
You invented a whole kiss, didn't you?
Uh, first of all, for your info, it's called aspirational thinking.
You're thinking it one moment, you're living it the next.
- How's that working out?
- MAN:
Oh, excuse me.
(indistinct radio communication)
(gasps)
TUCK:
Go to the bikes.
MUNCH:
Oh, God, oh, God.
- TUCK:
Why is the construction man...
- Shut...
- MAN:
Excuse me.
- TUCK:
Aw...
Hey-
I know you guys.
You're the guys... you're from the construction site, right?
Uh, with the, uh, with the camera?
Whoa-ho, wait, wait.
Why aren't you guys at home right now?
You guys weren't riding your bikes out around the desert, were you?
- No, of course not.
- MUNCH:
Yes.
Uh, no.
That doesn't sound too... clear.
- MUNCH:
Uh...
- GIRL:
Thank God.
There you are.
- TUCK:
What?
- MAN:
Who-who are you?
Who am I?
(dramatic sobbing):
Who am I?
Exactly!
It's like I don't even know anymore.
My mom had to drag my dad from the bar... again!
- TUCK:
What?
- He likes to go there more than he likes to tuck in his own kids at night.
At least that's what my mom says.
MUNCH:
What's she talking about?
That's her.
Eating a burrito.
She east when she's stressed.
I ask myself if that's gonna be me one day.
What do you think?
Is it?
We make mistakes and we get married and we go to bars.
And these... these are my only friends in the world,
- 'cause they see me
- TUCK:
Uh... for who I really am.
MAN:
That's your mom over there?
- Do you want to meet her?
- No.
No.
No, no.
Just get home safe!
Told you guys I wanted to go.
- (Echo chirps "Oh...!")
- TUCK:
What the...?
TUCK (voice-over):
Okay, so this girl, man, she'd been tailing us since her house, spying on us like some creepy stalker.
- She'd overheard our whole plan.
- She... she's crazy.
- ALEX:
I need the bag!
- I think I like it.
(engine revs)
- (music blaring)
- ALEX:
Oh, boy, get ready.
TUCK:
All right, try to blend in.
Look old.
WOMAN:
That must've been some good fake l.
D.'s.
MAN:
What's up, baby face?
What are you doing in here, little man?
Oh, uh, I, uh...
- Are you Randy's kid?
- TUCK:
Uh,
- yes, he is.
- Um, y-yeah, yeah, yeah, he's my dad... or mom.
- You know, dad.
Mom.
- Okay, dude, just go.
- Hurry up.
- (Echo warbling)
ALEX:
Emma?
Emma?
I was hanging out with this really pretty chick.
She's almost as pretty as you.
I mean... you're not pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.
Come over here.
Hop up on that stool.
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Oh, and one for his buddy here, too.
TUCK:
No, no, I'm all right.
Seriously, I'm all right.
- Sure, you'll like it.
- Sorry, I'm a...
I'm allergic.
Oh, you're gonna love it.
- Uh, no, no.
- You're gonna get one.
So, what happens next?
- Just give me back my bag.
- No.
Give it.
I'm serious.
Give me the bag.
Why are you being mean to me?
- Here, honey.
- TUCK:
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- (chuckles):
Yeah.
MUNCH:
Wow, a lot of people with beards and mustaches in here, you know?
(deep rumbling, rattling)
ALEX:
You don't understand.
Whenever you get close to the next piece, it goes crazy.
(people gasping, shouting)
ALEX:
Oh, my God!
- Whoa!
Aah!
- (gasping, shouting)
(gasping, shouting stop)
(Echo warbles)
- TUCK:
Uh...
- MAN:
Are you kidding me?
- (excited chatter) - (whoops)
Do you guys just go around town breaking stuff?
TUCK:
Just keep running!
Go, go!
EMMA:
What was that?
I think the ship's trying to take off!
- (whirring, clicking)
- TUCK:
Whoa, whoa!
(Alex laughing)
TUCK:
Are you seeing this?
This thing is flying a ship... in your backpack?
I think he's getting better.
MUNCH:
Oh.
So, you don't know how he crashed, or when, or why he came here with a spaceship in the first place?
Look, he only answers yes or no... it's not that simple.
Is this how I talk to him?
(Echo chirping)
- So, you crashed.
- (chirps once)
Did someone cause you to crash?
- (chirps once)
- ALEX:
Dude, what's she doing?
- TUCK:
I don't know.
- Someone on Earth?
(chirps once)
Do you think they're looking for you?
(chirps once)
It's not those guys in trucks from the convenience store, is it?
- (chirps, chitters)
- TUCK:
The construction man?
MUNCH:
Those are the guys that shot you down?
TUCK:
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We got to take a step back.
This is way bigger and shadier than before, okay?
This is not good.
If those dudes are looking for Echo, they're looking for us, you know?
- (siren wailing in distance) - (thumping in Dumpster)
- (rustling) - (echoing whirr)
(excited chirping)
- ALEX:
Echo?
- (excited chirping continues)
You need some help there, buddy?
(chirping)
Hey, it's okay.
Shh.
Breathe like me, okay?
(inhales)
(exhales)
(imitates breathing)
(exhales)
It's okay.
TUCK:
Dude, h-he'll be fine.
No.
We're not leaving him.
My whole life, I've been left.
I know how it feels.
(quiet electronic purr)
(crickets chirping)
ALEX:
We're all he's got.
(Echo beeping, warbling)
(train whistle blows in distance)
- MUNCH:
Uh, left?
- EMMA:
We could find a shortcut.
ALEX:
The map says up ahead.
MUNCH:
This map's confusing.
I was a mind ninja back there...
- EMMA:
So, what was it like kissing me?
- Give me my camera.
- Did your legs get all wobbly?
- (Tuck scoffs)
Was there soft music playing?
Please remind me, Tuck.
I totally forgot.
- What was it like?
- You're close.
Is this your first imaginary kiss?
TUCK:
The map says for us to go inside.
EMMA:
I'm confused.
- Huh?
- Didn't you guys kiss?
TUCK (voice-over):
Anyway, the point is,
Emma was being annoying...
she kept walking off with Echo like she owned him, and talking to him about
I don't know what, I don't even know.
You know what?
Delete.
TUCK:
Man, are we sure there's no security guards or...
You know, that door wasn't even locked.
Hey, uh, guys, I was just thinking, you know,
I... haven't got to actually hold the, you know, the ship, before we did the thing, so can I do it?
- You know, before it gets crazy?
- EMMA:
Sure, but... it's not a ship.
TUCK:
What?
What are you talking about?
He told us it was a ship.
It's a key to your ship, right?
(Echo chirps)
(low electronic warbling)
Well, if this is just the key, where's the spaceship?
- (clattering, crackling)
- All right, Munch, put it down.
- (Echo chirps)
- Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.
TUCK:
Okay, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to put it down
- before you hurt both of us.
- I need this, man.
- (electronic blipping)
- TUCK:
That's weird.
- Does it know her?
- TUCK:
I don't know.
Munch!
(Munch gasps)
TUCK:
Whoa!
MUNCH:
Whoa!
- (Tuck laughs)
- ALEX:
You okay?
- EMMA:
Yeah.
- MUNCH:
What are you guys doing?
- TUCK:
Wow.
- ALEX:
Um, she was gonna get hit by the piece, so I-l saved her.
- GUARD:
Hey!
You four!
Freeze!
- (alarm ringing)
- Run!
- Which way?
- Tuck!
- Stop right there!
Stop!
TUCK:
Go, go!
Hurry up!
(alarm continues ringing)
EMMA:
Hold up, hold up!
Did Alex get out?
(Echo chirps)
Uh, I d...
I don't know.
- We have to go back.
- Uh...
- Come on, you guys.
- Okay.
Look.
Whoa, whoa.
She's being stupid.
There's a guard in there, you know?
You can't just go running in, acting crazy.
We need a-a plan, or... s... right?
GUARD:
Breaking and entering, destruction of property.
Those are felonies, kid.
(whispers):
Okay, Echo, I need your help.
Um, I need you to...
do something.
GUARD:
I have a minor here; he's 13.
Caught him breaking in with his friends.
If you could send an officer down.
GUARD:
Stay put.
Hello?
(Emma panting)
- (arcade game music playing)
- Anybody there?
(game music tempo accelerating)
(phone ringing)
- GUARD:
Hello?
- (Echo chirps)
Hello?
(echoing loudly):
ls anybody there?
...there...
ls anybody there... there... (Echo chirping)
- (rumbling) - (guard gasps)
GUARD:
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
EMMA:
Alex.
Alex.
- Wh-Where's Tuck?
- We got to go.
(arcade game music continues)
- We should've gone back.
- All right, you know what?
Calm down, because if people would've listened to me, then Alex never would have gotten caught.
Didn't I say there would be security guards?
Alex!
Dude!
You're all right!
Are you all right?
Hey, Alex, we're good, man.
All right?
- MUNCH:
Buddy?
- We're good, man?
TUCK:
Alex.
Come on, dude.
Alex!
We could've gone home, but we didn't.
- We were outside.
- Turn off the camera.
Not till you admit you're acting mopey for no reason.
You're always freaking out if anyone's gonna leave you behind.
TUCK:
Do you know how expensive that is?
ALEX:
I'm glad I'm moving.
You were never my friend.
- Is that right?
Is that right?
- MUNCH:
Guys, guys,
- come on, just-just chill out.
- EMMA:
Come on!
EMMA:
Have you lost your mind?
TUCK woke-every.
I acted like I didn't know what I'd done.
But I knew exactly.
MUNCH:
I know we're all tired and stuff, and hungry.
I saw this awesome diner.
We can totally just go grab
- a bite to eat or something.
- EMMA:
Real awesome, guys.
- Real macho.
- (Tuck and Alex grunting)
So, that's it?
The night's over?
Doesn't have to be.
Right?
Well, I mean, if it is, uh, we could...
I don't know, I guess we can keep the mood going, yeah?
Or we can do it another time, right?
Good times, the continuation, part two.
Right?
(Tuck scoffs)
(sighs) Hmm.
You know what?
I'm gonna talk about Sandra.
Man, that girl used to beat the crap out of you.
Me, too.
We were both little, small and scrawny.
She was a big girl, and she knew it.
But then I had a growth spurt, and you didn't, and I finally did something.
You remember that?
You told her I had polio.
Yeah, I told her that, and did she beat you up after that?
MUNCH:
She still beat me up.
'Cause I-l always get your back, man.
I never let you down;
I always get your back.
(Tuck sighs)
Most of the time.
Just when I'm not freaked out about security guards, all right?
I'm sorry, man.
Are we good?
(softly):
Yeah.
(Echo warbles weakly)
Dude.
(electronic chittering)
Faster.
(radio hisses, blips;
static crackles)
Sure are doing some traveling tonight.
EMMA:
My parents are in the bathroom.
Uh-huh.
(rhythmic beeping)
(Echo beeping back)
(Echo chittering)
(chittering continues)
Let it go.
TUCK:
What are you doing?
- Dude!
Hey, what are you doing?
!
- MUNCH:
Oh, God!
Don't grab our stuff like that!
- Stop!
- Hey, give me the backpack!
- Who do you think you are?
- The police have been instructed to come and pick up these kids and take them home.
He can't just walk away.
- (phone rings)
- ALEX:
What was it?
- EMMA:
The phone.
- No, no, no!
- Munch!
- Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
Oh, my...
Munch!
(engine revs, tires squeal)
TUCK:
This is not real, this is not real, this is not real right now.
- (sirens wailing)
- ALEX:
Don't let them see you.
- (siren chirps)
- Now!
ALEX:
Munch!
Do you see the truck?
TUCK:
Munch!
ALEX:
Munch!
That guy is not a construction worker.
(phone ringing)
- it's Munch.
- MUNCH:
I need help, guys.
I really didn't think this through.
TUCK:
We're here, we're here.
Are you hurt?
(staticky):
Can you guys hear me...?
- EMMA:
Are you okay?
- ALEX:
Where are you, Munch?
TUCK:
We'll find you, all right?
I promise.
(staticky):
I think I'm at the construction site.
- ALEX:
Come on, buddy.
- TUCK:
Munch!
(staticky):
I can see the big lights and up at those...
- the white trucks...
- (line disconnects)
How far is your neighborhood?
It's way over an hour.
TUCK:
All right, I think I got a faster way.
Who wants to go to a party?
ALEX:
Are you sure he'll even be here?
Better be.
His girlfriend's throwing it.
(music thumping from distance)
♪♪
EMMA:
I can't believe we're doing this.
TUCK (sighing):
Sophomores.
Hey, sweet party.
Sweet jams.
Guys, what are we doing here?
We can't be...
Just look for my brother.
Look for his keys.
- Oh, my gosh, it's the cops.
- Okay.
Oh, God, the keys, the keys.
TUCK:
I lost my keys.
I have a Porsche.

Six days ago, an object entered our atmosphere at 20,000 miles an hour, on a direct course for that ship.
We shot it down.

What you found activates the ship, and if that ship takes off, it could kill everyone.
He just wants to go home.

Okay, that will not happen.
He is far too valuable.

- that may be displaying
- That's weird, that's weird.
- Faulty messages or images?
- I don't know.
See you.
No, listen, I...
Okay, so you-you really don't think this is a little bit weird?
These dudes come here to build a freeway
- and now they want our phones?
- Well, I think it's gonna work.
No.
Clean your room.
Oh, my...
I'm not gonna have a room if we don't do something.
- Right, I think...
- No, Mom, seriously.
These guys want our houses.
Maybe if we expose them for illegal property, then...
TUCK:
- Yo!
- Aw, you don't like how things are, do you?
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
(ELECTRONIC CHIME) Dude, it's a map to the desert.
Like, what is that?
What do we do with this?
I guess most maps are made to be followed.
Exactly.
It could go to, like, some crazy headquarters, and we find out that these construction clowns are spies and we expose them to the world.
It's 20 miles away.
What...
No, we're not...
we're not gonna go.
No, obviously not.
Look, whatever it is, this Saturday, we're going to sneak behind our parents' backs and find out.
I'm moving Saturday.
All right, all right, so Friday night.
Our last night together?
It doesn't have to be;
that's what I'm saying.
Like, I don't want to move, and these clowns are making us do it.
Maybe we can stop them.
Now, are you in?
Yeah, all right.
- All right.
- I'm in.
Munch, don't you bail out on us now.
Dude, I'm not.
Me?
No... pfft!
I'm in.
Yeah!
All right!
That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, all right.
Bring it in.
- Oh, oops!
- Munch!
So, why would you be organizing your ketchups?
- Because.
- Who does that?
So I can get to them easier, and then it's more organized,
- and it's better.
- And you are my friend.
Guys, guys, it's time to practice the big lie.
Hey, Mom, I'm spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a neat, brand-new video game.
And I'm sleeping over at Tuck's house so we can play a new video game.
And I'm sleeping in your mom's bed,
- not playing a video game.
- Oh, my God, all right, dude.
Stop talking about my mother, thank you.
All right, the camera's are gonna be on 24 hours a day, nonstop.
Dude, can you stop touching, please?
It attaches to my bike, and it's also a pretty good way to get footage on the fly.
Spy glasses.
I love these;
I love them.
And last, camera, but definitely not least...
What up, camcorder?
Keeping it tight.
Looking pretty good these days.
Tuck, these are the ugliest things I've ever seen.
Dude, what?
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Those are...
They're sweet.
- The camera's undetectable,
- Wow.
- And the ladies love them.
- Prove it.
Prove it?
(SCOFFS)
This guy, all right?
Give me my glasses, man.
Those are stealth.
Now I'm gonna prove to you guys spy glasses get you girls.
MUNCH:
Oh, my gosh, he's going over there.
- I can't see who he's talking to.
- Shut up, Munch.
TUCK:
Uh, hi, uh...
Hey, um, Em-Emma, right?
Emma?
I was just... (TUCK SPUTTERS)
Okay, uh, can I borrow a piece of paper, please?
MUNCH:
He has something.
- I can't see who he got it from.
- We're about to see right now.
Look, look, look, look.
He has a paper.
ALEX:
You did not get her number.
Totally got her number.
Right there.
You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.
You, too, you're a sellout.
No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.
Yes, I did.
Mannequin Girl?
(ALEX LAUGHS)
What kind of name is that?
What?
That's what I call her.
I think mannequins are hot.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING) TUCK:
I'll leave my house at 6:00.
15 minutes later, I pick up Alex.
- Munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Tonight, we're no longer boys.
We're men.
(GRUNTS)
TUCK:
- Dude, what the...?
- I didn't see you, man.
(TUCK SIGHS)
ALEX:
Tuck, you all right?
Let's go.
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) Our whole lives we've been nobodies.
In visible.
The good kids.
(CHUCKLES) Not anymore.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
All right, Ma.
I'm leaving.
Spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a new video game.
Have whatever you want, honey.
(CONVERSATION CONTINUES) (TUCK SIGHS)
You know what, I lied, actually.
We're gonna ride our bikes out into the desert at night alone.
Without supervision.
We got that;
we're going to state.
Okay, see you then, sweetie.
- We could go.
- Also rob a bank.
- All the way.
State.
- What?
TUCK:
Go to Mexico.
Maybe even start a new life.
- Right, I know.
- Wrestling!
TUCK'S MOM:
You're trying to act like I don't know what I'm talking about.
(CONVERSATION AND LAUGHTER CONTINUE)
What's up, Stumpy?
Yo, man, I told you to stop to calling me that.
You know what, man, look, my girl's throwing this huge party later tonight, if you want to come by.
(ENGINE STARTS)
You serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
Because not a lady in the world can resist a natty old BMX bike.
What's the zero to 60 on that bad boy, huh?
Two, three days?
(TIRES SQUEALING, ENGINE RUMBLING)
(HUMMING)
Come on, come on, dude, you ready?
Let's go.
(LAUGHS) I can't even tell a difference.
This looks exactly the way it looked before you packed.
All your stuff fitting in one box?
What are you, a drifter?
Who told you?
Look, all I'm saying is, when you get to your new house, put a poster up, put some shelves on the wall, frame a photo.
Look, there's a painting right there.
Put something on a shelf...
That's not a painting.
That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt, smudged it and called it art.
I'm going to Munch's house to play a video game, all right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure, buddy.
- Bye, Dylan.
- Have fun with your friends.
- Hey, hey, Tuck.
TUCK:
- How are you?
Uh, good luck with the move to New York, buddy.
- Maybe we'll come see you.
- All right, cool.
The moving truck is coming at 10:00.
Make sure you're back, okay?
TUCK:
I don't get it.
If your foster parents already have a baby of their own, why do they need you?
There's no sense in having two babies.
- Shut up, dude.
- One baby cries all the time, the other one listens to indie rock.
Let's go.
(ALEX WHOOPING) (TUCK HUMMING)
ALEX:
Yeow!
WOMAN:
Guys, would you please help my son with his room, before I go crazy?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I don't think he's started...
Honey, have you even started packing your room?
MUNCH:
I told you a thousand times,
I'm alphabetizing!
(ALEX CHUCKLES)
TUCK:
Yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.
Shh.
(DOOR CREAKS)
(VIDEO PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)
MAN: (ON VIDEO) ...they're flexible, they're "dynamical, "
they can be curved, they can bend, and this opens up a whole new universe of possibilities, and one of the possibilities is that there can be shortcuts through space and through time.
So that's really just what a Wormhole is.
It's taking advantage... (BOYS WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
(SCREAMING)
What are you...
Aah!
- Why don't you stop doing that?
!
- I'm sorry!
You guys are gonna give me a heart attack one day.
- I'm sorry.
- Turn that off, dude.
(MUTTERING)
(BEEPING) I created a substation for each of our parents' phones that's wired to the router, which is wired to the transmitter, which transmits to the receiver, which is...
- my phone.
TUCK:
- Okay, so basically, no matter who our parents call, it goes to your phone.
Yeah.
My mom's friends always say that I sound just like my mom, you know,
- when I pick up the phone...
- Yeah.
So I figured, I can be Betty.
(COMPUTERS AND GADGETS BEEPING)
ALEX:
Bye, Betty.
Thank you.
Um, I'm going to Alex's...
or Munch's... or Tuck's house, and we're gonna play a video game and sleep over.
BETTY:
Wait, what's all that stuff?
Honey?
(SIGHS)
ALEX:
Good job, Munch.
You did it.
TUCK:
Here we come.
17.6 miles.
(TUCK HUMMING HAPPILY)
♪ Going to the desert... ♪
Munch, what are you doing?
Guys, guys, just hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Dude...
- I'm not backing out or anything,
- He wants to quit right when we - ...just hear me out.
- Been waiting for this forever.
- Dude, listen, come on, okay.
This is crazy what we're doing.
Dude, I don't want to punk out or back out or anything... it's just, my mom, you know, she just got divorced.
- Munch...
- She's already had enough guys lying to her.
If you didn't want to come, then why didn't you tell us earlier?
TUCK:
You do understand this is our last night together.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Look, Munch, if we don't go now, we'll never go.
We won't even be here.
This is our last chance to try and do something.
Even-even if it is stupid.
- Yeah.
- You know what,
I say we put a vote to it.
All in favor raise your hand.
Well, now I have to raise my hand.
Munch, just...
Fine, fine.
Okay, whatever.
I'll go.
But only under one condition.
TUCK:
- I call the black!
ALEX:
- Mine!
No, no, give it!
MUNCH:
It's so weird, no one's gonna be in these houses next week.
ALEX:
Dude, you're so full of it.
- When did you kiss her?
TUCK:
- Dude, trust me.
After pre-algebra, she pulled me into the bathroom.
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Mannequin Girl?
TUCK:
- Yeah!
- Was she good at it?
TUCK:
Uh, eh, B minus.
You know, I've kissed better in better locations.
No, how do I know you're not lying?
TUCK:
Trust me.
I don't even have to reply to you.
- You're last!
MUNCH:
- Hey, you got a head start!
That's not fair!
TUCK:
Oh, so what, there's a Wing Stop?
I never been to a Wing Stop.
(BIRDS SQUAWKING)
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) We followed a map out in the middle of nowhere.
MUNCH:
It might be, like, a CIA prison.
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) We were miles from home.
(BOYS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
No one in the world knew it.
No one said it... but we were scared.
ALEX:
We haven't seen a car in, like, half an hour.
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) We were on our own.
MUNCH:
This-this is the way, right?
You have the map, right?
- Can I see the map?
ALEX:
- Left.
MUNCH:
Left?
Are you sure?
Because right looks a little bit more promising.
(COYOTES HOWLING, YIPPING) Did you guys hear that?
ALEX:
Just a couple more miles.
(STEADY ELECTRONIC PULSING)
TUCK:
Hold on.
What is that?
It's the map.
TUCK:
Are we close?
MUNCH:
I never understood why people like the outdoors.
TUCK:
Will you stop freaking out?
(ELECTRONIC PULSING CONTINUES)
Yo, this is too steep, man.
Let's go, man.
(ELECTRONIC PULSING CONTINUES)

We're getting pretty far from the road, guys.
ALEX:
Almost there.

Is it this thing?

I don't think so.

Wait, what was that?
ALEX:
- I don't know.
- Well, hold on.
What'd you see, dude?
(PULSING RESUMES) TUCK:
Over here!
ALEX:
We're almost there.
Come on.
(ELECTRONIC PULSING STOPS)
MUNCH:
Oh.
TUCK:
What?
TUCK:
What do you think it is?
How would I know?
TUCK:
Why does it look all burnt?
MUNCH:
Hey, just be careful.
- Careful!
- Yeah, don't touch that thing.
Could be...
MUNCH:
Could be...
I don't know, I don't know.
A part of a satellite?
TUCK:
All right, all right, um, Munch, film me while I'm...
- while I'm touching this thing.
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Let me try it.
Thank you.
It's dusty.
It's a piece of crap.
MUNCH:
What?
Forget about it.
Just turn off the camera.
MUNCH:
Well, it's not a national treasure, but it could be used for something.
(TUCK SCOFFS) It's crap.
What happened to filming 'cause it's our last night, huh?
Um, in case you haven't noticed, obviously, the map led to squat.
ALEX:
Got it.
So all you cared about was getting your stupid hits on your stupid video?
- Dude, why don't you just...
MUNCH:
- Whoa, guys, guys, guys.
Come on!
I know we're all frustrated... (PHONE RINGING, GASPS) It's Alex's mom.
TUCK:
- Are you serious?
ALEX:
- Um, it'll be fine.
Just, um, be Betty, okay?
- Oh, man.
MUNCH:
- Oh, crap.
Yo, I thought I could do this, but I can't.
Maybe you can answer it.
She just likes to check up on things, okay?
All right. (GASPS)
WOMAN:
Betty, are you there?
(WHISPERING) Go.
This is Betty.
WOMAN:
I was thinking maybe I could bring over some pizzas?
TUCK:
Dude, go.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No coming over.
- Just hang up.
- No way.
No, it's really no trouble.
We have a coupon.
- I said no!
No pizzas!
- What?
- No, uh...
TUCK:
- Don't yell at her, man.
Maybe you and your husband should go to bed.
TUCK:
Stop saying words!
ALEX'S MOM:
Are you sure everything's okay?
Have a good night.
Go to sleep.
(LINE DISCONNECTS, BEEPS)
(CHUCKLES) That could've gone better.
TUCK:
That was horrible.
"Your husband should go to sleep"?
Was that really something smart to say?
Munch.
Don't look at me like I'm a hoarder.
That's rude.
(DISTANT VOICES)
ALEX: (WHISPERING) Who are they?
MUNCH:
I don't...
I don't know.
MAN: (OVER RADIO) I'm picking up some spikes in the readings...
ALEX:
Get down, get down.
Turn your flashlight off, dummy.
Let's go.
MUNCH:
Why would they be out this far?
TUCK:
Who cares?
The night's blown.
(STATIC CRACKLES)
- Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
(PANTING)
ALEX:
Munch?
(CHUCKLES)
- You're a character.
- There's something in there!
ALEX:
What?
TUCK:
Dude, are you kidding me right now?
MUNCH:
Something is in that bag.
It touched me.
TUCK:
Go check.
MUNCH:
Be-be careful.
(HARSH SCREECHING)
TUCK:
- What?
- Did it poke you, too?
TUCK:
What, dude?
Say something!
What did you see?
There-There's something in there.
Yeah, a bunch of crap Munch brought.
(CHUCKLES)
- You guys are funny.
- All I know is it beeped.
You know, why don't you go in there and just see.
TUCK:
Beeped?
What are you talking about?
Babies.
I'll do it myself.
Dang, how much stuff do you have in your bag, dude?
Geez.
Oh, boy, are you guys talking about this?
It's garbage.
It's nothing.
What are you talking about, you heard something?
It made a noise.
Hey, hey, do something!
See, it's not doing anything.
What are you talking about?
Beep.
(SNARLING, SNAPPING)
(TUCK LAUGHS)
Do that again, do that again.
Do what again?
Do what you just did.
Beep.
(SNARLING, SNAPPING)
Whoa, hold on.
Let me...
Let me try this for myself.
Beep.
Beep?
Why is it making noise only for you and not me?
Make it beep again.
Beep.
(CLANK, HISSING) Whoa!
MUNCH:
This is it!
It's a bomb!
(FADING INTO DISTANCE) No, no, oh, God, no!
No, no, no!
(CHITTERING)
ALEX:
Guys, I think...
I think it might have defused.
I don't know.
TUCK:
Man, nothing's happening.
All right, hold on, hold on.
I got an idea.
MUNCH:
Tuck!
What?
MUNCH:
Okay, it didn't do anything, but just don't do it again.
Are you insane, Tuck?
!
Are you sure you guys know what you're doing?
TUCK:
Yes, trust me.
When it's a bomb, you have to act quick.
I seen it on some TV show or some movie or something.
ALEX:
- Saw what?
- Check it out.
MUNCH:
What are you doing?
!
Disarming it.
MUNCH:
Are you crazy?
!
It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.
That's not what you do with a bomb!
Are you insane?
!
(ELECTRONIC CHIRP, PINGING) What was that?
It's not my phone.
It's the thing, whatever that is.
- What are you talking about?
- It's that.
That's what just made that noise.
(ELECTRONIC PINGING)
I, uh...
It, like, imitated my ring-tone.
TUCK:
This is what made our phones barf?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
ALEX:
Did you hear that?
(STATIC CRACKLES) ALL:
Whoa, whoa.
All right, so, a couple of seconds ago, our phones went crazy.
Bananas, insane.
I don't know what to call it.
Look.
You see that?
It's a new map, but on my phone this time.
To me?
All right, him, or...
Dude, Munch's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and, ugh, I don't even know what that is.
Alex's phone, it just turned on by itself and started filming.
We can't even turn them off.
Oh, don't try to act like it's not cool.
That is weird.
ALEX:
It's showing us where we are.
MUNCH:
And you don't find that creepy?
What do you think that is?
You think that's a road?
We should follow the map.
MUNCH:
How about no.
TUCK:
How about yes?
We wanted a last night together, so what do you call this?
A trap?
MUNCH:
Didn't you guys see the "No Trespassing" sign?
TUCK:
Oops.
I didn't see anything.
(ELECTRONIC TONE PULSING, STUTTERING)
This is where the map says to go.
(LEAVES CRUNCHING)
Stop stepping on leaves.
MUNCH:
There's leaves everywhere.
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
(GRUNTING) Shh.
What was that?
(ELECTRONIC TONE PULSING, STUTTERING)
Where do you think it's taking us to?
(INDISTINCT TALKING CONTINUES)
(ELECTRONIC TONE CONTINUES)
MUNCH:
Maybe another one of those beepy things.

- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Get down!
Oh, geez!
Munch, watch out!
Aah!
Aah!
TUCK:
Aah!
ALEX:
What's going on?
Dude, Munch, what was that?
(CLATTERING, RUMBLING)
(BOYS SCREAM)
TUCK:
Where is it?
Is it over?
Oh, geez.
(SCREAMING)
Dude!
MUNCH:
Tuck, stay back.
TUCK:
- Whoa.
MUNCH:
- Stay back.
(ELECTRONIC WARBLING) MUNCH:
What's...
TUCK:
Dude!
(WHIRRING, BEEPING)
Wait, wait, be careful.
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
MUNCH:
Your phone just got a new map.
ALEX:
What?
(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait, why is it opening?
TUCK:
Hold on, hold on.
Did you see that just now?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING) ALEX:
What is that?
TUCK:
- Whoa!
What is that?
MUNCH:
- What is that?
- What is that?
- Oh, my...
Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.
ALEX:
It-It's moving.
TUCK:
There's something in there right now.
MUNCH:
What's in there?
Oh, don't tell me.
ALEX:
Are those... eyes?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
Dude, dude, it's looking dead at us right now.
MUNCH:
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
ALEX:
It's trembling like it's hurt.
MUNCH:
Good.
TUCK:
My heart's beating so fast right now.
Wow.
MUNCH:
Almost got us killed, like, three times already.
Yeah, but it was worth it, dude.
Incredible.
All right, so...
I just figured out why Alex's camera was on this whole time.
So this thing, whatever it is, it's eyes are, like, all screwed up, completely.
You see?
So, basically, it uses his phone to see.
That's insane.
(ALEX CHUCKLES)
ALEX: (DISTORTED) You think he can see us right now?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
Munch, you have to check this out.
This is amazing.
(CLICK, ELECTRONIC SNARL)
MUNCH:
Is it?
Is it amazing?
'Cause I think it's scary as balls.
I mean, obviously people are looking for it.
- Munch...
- It has access to our voicemails and our texts and our ringtones.
TUCK:
How do you even know it's a he?
Are you a dude?
(BEEPS)
(CHUCKLES)
Wait... you understood us.
(BEEPS, WARBLES)
Whoa. (CHUCKLES)
All right, here's how it goes.
One beep is yes, two beeps are no.
Watch.
Is one beep yes?
(BEEPS ONCE)
TUCK:
Yo, that's so tight.
Are we in a barn?
(BEEPS ONCE)
Is Munch really a woman?
(BEEPS TWICE)
Oh, come on, man, this thing is broken.
Everybody knows Munch is a woman.
Okay, I have a question.
Are we gonna die tonight?
Why isn't it answering?
What...
Well, that's not good, right?
20 questions with an alien.
Tuck Simms exclusive.
- Let's do this.
- Check it out.
All right, um, are you from space?
(BEEPS ONCE) Ooh!
Are you a robot?
(BEEPS TWICE)
Do you eat humans?
(BEEPS TWICE)
(SIGHS)
Do you like Earth?
(BEEPS TWICE)
Why?
Why doesn't he like Earth?
Do you like us?
(BEEPS ONCE)
You see?
I told you.
We're cool like that.
Come on.
Are you hurt?
(BEEPS ONCE)
- Oh.
- He's hurt.
Well, his lights seem brighter, so...
Did that piece help you?
(BEEPS ONCE)
Oh.
Can we help fix you or something?
Or...
Like, what is this?
Are you trying to build something?
(BEEPS ONCE) Oh, he's trying to build...
Building something.
Right there.
- What could he be building?
- Yeah.
So, wait, what are, what are you building?
Lasers?
(BEEPS TWICE)
A portal?
(BEEPS TWICE)
Minions?
(BEEPS TWICE)
A cloaking device?
(BEEP TWICE)
It's an army.
(BEEPS TWICE)
Ignore him.
Spaceship?
(DEEP ELECTRONIC WHIR)
Oh, my God!
Hold up, hold up.
So let me get this right.
So you're building a spaceship,
- He's building a spaceship, - and you need our help building the spaceship?
(BEEPS ONCE) Oh, man.
This guy is building a spaceship.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Let me make sure I don't have any plans.
Nope!
We're building a spaceship!
He's building a spaceship.
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) We asked him questions for almost two hours.
Where he came from.
If there were others here like him.
We found out he was lost... and alone.
He was out in the middle of nowhere, on his own, like us.
All we really knew was that he crashed, and now he needed us to rebuild him.
ALEX:
The map says up ahead.
MUNCH:
Are we going the right way?
(HORNS HONKING, DISTORTED)
Look, look, look, look, whatever that is, the map goes to it.
All right, so wait-wait a minute.
Let me get this right.
Dude comes from a million light-years away, and he wants to come here?
I don't know, the map said so.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You got to look both ways before you cross the street.
ALEX:

If you give it to me as a gift, I'd still throw it away.
- It's trash.

Here, set him on here.
(ALEX LAUGHS) MUNCH:
He looks scared.
TUCK:
Yeah, why is he all balled up?
Can't you stand?
You all right?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING) MUNCH:
Maybe he's... maybe he's just shy.
- Ooh, can you fly?
TUCK:
- Can you do X-ray vision?
MUNCH:
How?
He can't see.
ALEX: (CHUCKLES) He doesn't even know where to look.
TUCK:
All right, all right, I think the question is, what can you do?
TUCK:
Okay, so Dr. Nichols is doing a surgical procedure with very sophisticated technology.
Pen caps.
(TUCK LAUGHS)
Clear.
MUNCH:
Wait, I don't get it.
How is that sophisticated?
It's kind of just, like, pen caps.
I got it.
(QUIET ELECTRONIC WARBLING)
TUCK:
Be careful.
His legs are fragile.
(ALEX LAUGHS) MUNCH:
Whoa.
Get this.
Are you getting this?
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
(TUCK LAUGHS)
TUCK:
Oh, that's crazy!
So you can't fly, but you can float.
(ELECTRONIC CHIRP) TUCK:
That is so crazy!

I saw you.
I saw you grinning, man.
Stop trying to pretend like that wasn't cool.

(QUIET ELECTRONIC WARBLING)
Why don't I go first.

Hi.
I'm Tuck.
What's up?
I don't even know what to say, but, uh... but, uh, I'm from...
I'm from New York.
Uh, this is Nevada.
I don't even know, like, I like donuts,

ALEX:
- Donuts?
Really?
Okay, can somebody else do this?
I know, I'm going.
My name's M...
My real name is Reginald, but my friends call me Munch.
I hope we can be friends, too.
(ELECTRONIC CHIRPING) Do you have a name?
Oh, we could call him Beep.
Dude, what-what kind of name is Beep?
Word.
We got to give him a name that's powerful, like... like Master Blaster.
He doesn't blast anything.
Peter.
Peter.
What about Peter?
Something cool, like Space Ninja or something.
MUNCH:
Well, how is there a ninja in space?
He wouldn't be able to breathe.
- All right, all right...
- Dude, you don't know that.
Have you ever been to space?
Which name do you like?
MUNCH:
Uh, Beep.
Why?
(BEEPS)
There it is.
- Hello.
Watch this.
Watch this.
- You can't echo...
Watch this.
Just...
Beep.
(BEEPS) See?
Echo.
(CHIRPS)
That's what we should call it.
Echo.
(CHIRPS)
- Oh, 'cause it echoes.
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Echo, Echo, Echo.
- Echo.
Your name... is Echo.
ECHO: (DISTORTED) Echo...
Echo... (VOICE DISTORTING UNINTELLIGIBLY)

I don't think he's supposed to come out of that cylinder thing.
MUNCH:
He looks... dead.
TUCK: (FAINTLY) Echo?
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) So then we didn't know how broken he was.

MAN:
We just need you to listen, sweetheart.
TUCK: (SIGHS)
- Oh, man.
GIRL:
- You're grounding me?
ALEX:
Tuck, what are you doing?
Munch, go.
MAN:
It's the man... the man should choose his dance partner.
GIRL:
It's a stupid tradition.
WOMAN:
Really, it's about meeting new people, and many of those were our friends' sons.
And it's embarrassing when you ignore them.
MEN:
And these are life skills that we are teaching you.
MUNCH:
- Tuck, get back.
- Putting on this dress for you doesn't change me into some perfect little homecoming queen!
MAN:
Okay, no one's asking you to act like a homecoming queen.
WOMAN:
It's at least three years away.
MUNCH:
Now.
Go, go, go.
WOMAN: ...by the company you keep.
It's a cliché for a reason.
I'm sure this all seems...
MUNCH:
Guys, what are we doing?
We're gonna be trapped up here.
TUCK:
Everybody be quiet.

You got to be kidding me.
Aw, you know what?
Everyone just follow me, all right?
Don't look at anything.
Just hurry.
- Hey, Tuck, did you see this?
- No, don't...
Dude, Tuck, this is Mannequin Girl's house.
Now we can ask for permission to steal stuff, 'cause, you know, you guys are kissing buddies.
Aw, man...
TUCK:
It was a couple of days ago.
She probably forgot about it by now, you know?
Like, yeah, it's...
yeah, she probably forgot.
- How would she forget about it?
- I almost forgot about it... (DEEP RUMBLING)

It's gonna get loud.
We'll catch it in a blanket.

Wait, I know you.
Hey.
It's okay.
(GASPS)
Hey, hey, hey, we're with Tuck.
Tuck Simms.
You know?
Remember you guys kissed?
- We what?
- Yeah, what are you talking about, huh?
Why is my room destroyed?
Why are you filming this?
(ELECTRONIC CHIRPING)
- And what is that?
- Um, it's a... it's a car muffler.
No.
I want to know what that is.
MUNCH:
It's actually a spaceship.
- Munch!
- Sorry.
Uh, well, we-we were following maps, and it just happened to lead here, so we were trying to help our friend Echo...
well, he's an alien
TUCK:
- Oh, God...
- ...that we're trying to get him on a ship.
See, look, it used to have six symbols, but now it has three, so that means we're almost there.
Crazy, right?
ALEX:
Munch, will you shut up?
An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?
ALEX:
- Nope.
TUCK:
- No, no.
(ECHO CHIRPS "NO")
(ELECTRONIC CHIRPING)
- You did not just see that.
- Yeah, I did.
MUNCH:
Yeah, she definitely saw it.
GIRL:
- Wait.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, I want to go.
- Really?
Sounds great.
ALEX:
What?
No.
- Dude...
- You're not part of our group, so why don't you just go play with your super rich friends...
TUCK:
That's kind of harsh and your ball gowns and just go eat steak or something.

- What the hell?
TUCK:
- Go, go, go.
(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE)
TUCK:
Dang, dude, what was that upstairs?
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you so mad.
MUNCH:
Yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.
ALEX:
All right, let's just...
don't talk about...
Nothing happened in there, all right?
TUCK:
You know, they say the girls you argue with are the ones you like.
(ALEX SIGHS)
ALEX:
Don't go there, Bro.
(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING) Tuck, it's over there.
TUCK:
Wait, it wants us to go to a bar?
Man, I say we climb in a window or find a door.
There's got to be another way.
MUNCH:
Um, before-before we go...
I really need to get the pee out of my body.
(TUCK GROANS) Let's just hope the next place isn't a bank.
(ECHO BEEPING)
TUCK:
I can't believe you told that girl to get lost.
- You're so dramatic.
ALEX:
- What about you?
You invented a whole kiss, didn't you?
Uh, first of all, for your info, it's called aspirational thinking.
You're thinking it one moment, you're living it the next.
- How's that working out?
MAN:
- Oh, excuse me.
(INDISTINCT RADIO COMMUNICATION)

TUCK:
Go to the bikes.

Hey.
I know you guys.
You're the guys... you're from the construction site, right?
Uh, with the, uh, with the camera?
Whoa-ho, wait, wait.
Why aren't you guys at home right now?
You guys weren't riding your bikes out around the desert, were you?
- No, of course not.
MUNCH:
- Yes.
Uh, no.
That doesn't sound too... clear.
MUNCH:
- Uh...
GIRL:
- Thank God.
There you are.
TUCK:
- What?
MAN:
- Who-who are you?
Who am I?
(DRAMATIC SOBBING) Who am I?
Exactly!
It's like I don't even know anymore.
My mom had to drag my dad from the bar... again!
TUCK:
- What?
- He likes to go there more than he likes to tuck in his own kids at night.
At least that's what my mom says.
MUNCH:
What's she talking about?
That's her.
Eating a burrito.
She east when she's stressed.
I ask myself if that's gonna be me one day.
What do you think?
Is it?
We make mistakes and we get married and we go to bars.
And these... these are my only friends in the world,
- 'cause they see me TUCK:
- Uh... for who I really am.
MAN:
That's your mom over there?
- Do you want to meet her?
- No.
No.
No, no.
Just get home safe!
Told you guys I wanted to go.
(ECHO CHIRPS "OH...!") TUCK:
What the...?
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) Okay, so this girl, man, she'd been tailing us since her house, spying on us like some creepy stalker.
- She'd overheard our whole plan.
- She... she's crazy.
ALEX:
- I need the bag!
- I think I like it.

Oh, boy, get ready.

What are you doing in here, little man?
Oh, uh, I, uh...
- Are you Randy's kid?
TUCK:

Emma?
I was hanging out with this really pretty chick.
She's almost as pretty as you.
I mean... you're not pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.
Come over here.
Hop up on that stool.
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Oh, and one for his buddy here, too.
TUCK:
No, no, I'm all right.
Seriously, I'm all right.
- Sure, you'll like it.
- Sorry, I'm a...
I'm allergic.
Oh, you're gonna love it.
- Uh, no, no.
- You're gonna get one.
So, what happens next?
- Just give me back my bag.
- No.
Give it.
I'm serious.
Give me the bag.
Why are you being mean to me?
- Here, honey.

I think the ship's trying to take off!
(WHIRRING, CLICKING) TUCK:
Whoa, whoa!
(ALEX LAUGHING)
TUCK:
Are you seeing this?
This thing is flying a ship... in your backpack?
I think he's getting better.
MUNCH:
Oh.
So, you don't know how he crashed, or when, or why he came here with a spaceship in the first place?
Look, he only answers yes or no... it's not that simple.
Is this how I talk to him?
(ECHO CHIRPING)
So, you crashed.
(CHIRPS ONCE)
Did someone cause you to crash?
(CHIRPS ONCE) ALEX:
Dude, what's she doing?
TUCK:
- I don't know.
- Someone on Earth?
(CHIRPS ONCE)
Do you think they're looking for you?
(CHIRPS ONCE)
It's not those guys in trucks from the convenience store, is it?
(CHIRPS, CHITTERS) TUCK:
The construction man?
MUNCH:
Those are the guys that shot you down?
TUCK:
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We got to take a step back.
This is way bigger and shadier than before, okay?
This is not good.
If those dudes are looking for Echo, they're looking for us, you know?

I was a mind ninja back there...
EMMA:
- So, what was it like kissing me?
- Give me my camera.
Did your legs get all wobbly?
(TUCK SCOFFS)
Was there soft music playing?
Please remind me, Tuck.
I totally forgot.
- What was it like?
- You're close.
Is this your first imaginary kiss?
TUCK:
The map says for us to go inside.
EMMA:
I'm confused.
- Huh?
- Didn't you guys kiss?
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) Anyway, the point is,
Emma was being annoying...
she kept walking off with Echo like she owned him, and talking to him about
I don't know what, I don't even know.
You know what?
Delete.
TUCK:
Man, are we sure there's no security guards or...
You know, that door wasn't even looked.
Hey, uh, guys, I was just thinking, you know,
I... haven't got to actually hold the, you know, the ship, before we did the thing, so can I do it?
- You know, before it gets crazy?
EMMA:
- Sure, but... it's not a ship.
TUCK:
What?
What are you talking about?
He told us it was a ship.
It's a key to your ship, right?
(ECHO CHIRPS)
(LOW ELECTRONIC WARBLING)
Well, if this is just the key, where's the spaceship?
(CLATTERING, CRACKLING) All right, Munch, put it down.
(ECHO CHIRPS) Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.
TUCK:
Okay, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to put it down

Calm down, because if people would've listened to me, then Alex never would have gotten caught.
Didn't I say there would be security guards?

You're all right!
Are you all right?
Hey, Alex, we're good, man.
All right?
MUNCH:

Come on, dude.
Alex!
We could've gone home, but we didn't.
- We were outside.
- Turn off the camera.
Not till you admit you're acting mopey for no reason.
You're always freaking out if anyone's gonna leave you behind.

Do you know how expensive that is?

I'm glad I'm moving.
You were never my friend.

Have you lost your mind?
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) I acted like I didn't know what I'd done.
But I knew exactly.

I know we're all tired and stuff, and hungry.
I saw this awesome diner.
We can totally just go grab
- a bite to eat or something.

- Real awesome, guys.
Real macho.

So, that's it?
The night's over?
Doesn't have to be.

Well, I mean, if it is, uh, we could...
I don't know, I guess we can keep the mood going, yeah?
Or we can do it another time, right?
Good times, the continuation, part two.
Right?
(TUCK SCOFFS)
(SIGHS) Hmm.
You know what?
I'm gonna talk about Sandra.
Man, that girl used to beat the crap out of you.
Me, too.
We were both little, small and scrawny.
She was a big girl, and she knew it.
But then I had a growth spurt, and you didn't, and I finally did something.
You remember that?
You told herl had polio.
Yeah, I told her that, and did she beat you up after that?
MUNCH:
She still beat me up.
'Cause I always get your back, man.
I never let you down;
I always get your back.
(TUCK SIGHS)
Most of the time.
Just when I'm not freaked out about security guards, all right?
I'm sorry, man.

All right, people, if you go to Alex's house, your phones will spew chunks all over his screen.
My mom said the Murphys' phones and the Churleys' changed, too.
So what do you think this is?
TUCK:
Whoa!
-(Tuck chuckles) -(doorbell rings)
(Tuck groans)
These dudes.
-(low, indistinct radio chatter)
-Hi.
-Is that on?
-I don't know.
-Maybe.
-Oh.
We had an electrical short over at the site, and it may be disrupting people's phone service, and we're wondering if that happened
-to anybody in this house?
-Oh, no, my phone is good.
-'Cause we're offering new phone vouchers
-Uh-huh.
in exchange for any device in this area here
-that may be displaying
-That's weird, that's weird.
-faulty messages or images?
-I don't know.
See you.
No, listen, I...
Okay, so you-you really don't think this is a little bit weird?
These dudes come here to build a freeway
-and now they want our phones?
-Well, I think it's gonna work.
No.
Clean your room.
Oh, my...
I'm not gonna have a room if we don't do something.
-Right, I think...
-No, Mom, seriously.
These guys want our houses.
Maybe if expose them for illegal property, then...
-TUCK:
Yo!
-Aw, you don't like how things are, do you?
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
-(electronic chime)
-Dude, it's a map to the desert.
Like, what is that?
What do we do with this?
I guess most maps are made to be followed.
Exactly.
It could go to, like, some crazy headquarters, and we find out that these construction clowns are spies and we expose them to the world.
It's 20 miles away.
What...
No, we're not...
we're not gonna go.
No, obviously not.
Look, whatever it is, this Saturday, we're going to sneak behind our parents' backs and find out.
I'm moving Saturday.
All right, all right, so Friday night.
Our last night together?
It doesn't have to be;
that's what I'm saying.
Like, I don't want to move, and these clowns are making us do it.
Maybe we can stop them.
Now, are you in?
Yeah, all right.
-All right.
-I'm in.
Munch, don't you bail out on us now.
Dude, I'm not.
Me?
No... pfft!
I'm in.
Yeah!
All right!
That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, all right.
Bring it in.
-Oh, oops!
-Munch!
So, why would you be organizing your ketchups?
-Because.
-Who does that?
So I can get to them easier, and then it's more organized,
-and it's better.
-And you are my friend.
Guys, guys, it's time to practice the big lie.
Hey, Mom, I'm spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a neat, brand-new video game.
And I'm sleeping over at Tuck's house so we can play a new video game.
And I'm sleeping in your mom's bed,
-not playing a video game.
-Oh, my God, all right, dude.
Stop talking about my mother, thank you.
All right, the camera's are gonna be on 24 hours a day, nonstop.
Dude, can you stop touching, please?
It attaches to my bike, and it's also a pretty good way to get footage on the fly.
Spy glasses.
I love these;
I love them.
And last, camera, but definitely not least...
What up, camcorder?
Keeping it tight.
Looking pretty good these days.
Tuck, these are the ugliest things I've ever seen.
Dude, what?
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Those are...
They're sweet.
-The camera's undetectable,
-Wow.
-and the ladies love them.
-Prove it.
Prove it?
(scoffs)
This guy, all right?
Give me my glasses, man.
Those are stealth.
Now I'm gonna prove to you guys spy glasses get you girls.
MUNCH:
Oh, my gosh, he's going over there.
-I can't see who he's talking to.
-Shut up, Munch.
TUCK:
Uh, hi, uh...
Hey, um, Em-Emma, right?
Emma?
I was just... (Tuck sputters)
Okay, uh, can I borrow a piece of paper, please?
MUNCH:
He has something.
-I can't see who he got it from.
-We're about to see right now.
Look, look, look, look.
He has a paper.
ALEX:
You did not get her number.
Totally got her number.
Right there.
You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.
You, too, you're a sellout.
No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.
Yes, I did.
Mannequin Girl?
(Alex laughs)
What kind of name is that?
What?
That's what I call her.
I think mannequins are hot.
-(school bell ringing)
-TUCK:
I'll leave my house at 6:00.
15 minutes later, I pick up Alex.
-Munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
-Yeah.
Okay?
Tonight, we're no longer boys.
We're men.
(grunts)
-TUCK:
Dude, what the...?
-I didn't see you, man.
(Tuck sighs)
-ALEX:
Tuck, you all right?
-Let's go.
TUCK (voice-over):
Our whole lives we've been nobodies.
Invisible.
The good kids.
(chuckles) Not anymore.
(indistinct conversation)
All right, Ma.
I'm leaving.
Spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a new video game.
Have whatever you want, honey.
-(conversation continues) -(Tuck sighs)
You know what, I lied, actually.
We're gonna ride our bikes out into the desert at night alone.
Without supervision.
We got that;
we're going to state.
Okay, see you then, sweetie.
-We could go.
-Also rob a bank.
-All the way.
State.
-What?
TUCK:
Go to Mexico.
Maybe even start a new life.
-Right, I know.
-Wrestling!
TUCK'S MOM:
You're trying to act like I don't know what I'm talking about.
(conversation and laughter continue)
What's up, Stumpy?
Yo, man, I told you to stop to calling me that.
You know what, man, look, my girl's throwing this huge party later tonight, if you want to come by.
(engine starts)
You serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
Because not a lady in the world can resist a natty old BMX bike.
What's the zero to 60 on that bad boy, huh?
Two, three days?
(tires squealing, engine rumbling)
(humming)
Come on, come on, dude, you ready?
Let's go.
(laughs) I can't even tell a difference.
This looks exactly the way it looked before you packed.
All your stuff fitting in one box?
What are you, a drifter?
Who told you?
Look, all I'm saying is, when you get to your new house, put a poster up, put some shelves on the wall, frame a photo.
Look, there's a painting right there.
Put something on a shelf...
That's not a painting.
That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt, smudged it and called it art.
I'm going to Munch's house to play a video game, all right?
-Okay.
-Yeah, sure, buddy.
-Bye, Dylan.
-Have fun with your friends.
-Hey, hey, Tuck.
-TUCK:
How are you?
Uh, good luck with the move to New York, buddy.
-Maybe we'll come see you.
-All right, cool.
The moving truck is coming at 10:00.
Make sure you're back, okay?
TUCK:
I-I don't get it.
If your foster parents already have a baby of their own, why do they need you?
There's no sense in having two babies.
-Shut up, dude.
-One baby cries all the time, the other one listens to indie rock.
Let's go.
-(Alex whooping) -(Tuck humming)
ALEX:
Yeow!
WOMAN:
Guys, would you please help my son with his room, before I go crazy?
-Yeah, yeah, sure.
-I don't think he's started...
Honey, have you even started packing your room?
MUNCH:
I told you a thousand times,
I'm alphabetizing!
(Alex chuckles)
TUCK:
Yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.
Shh.
(door creaks)
(video playing indistinctly)
MAN (on video): ...they're flexible, they're "dynamical,"
they can be curved, they can bend, and this opens up a whole new universe of possibilities, and one of the possibilities is that there can be shortcuts through space and through time.
So that's really just what a wormhole is.
It's taking advantage... (boys whispering indistinctly)
(screaming)
What are you...
Aah!
-Why don't you stop doing that?
!
-I'm sorry!
You guys are gonna give me a heart attack one day.
-I'm sorry.
-Turn that off, dude.
(muttering)
-(beeping)
-I created substation for each of our parents' phones that's wired to the router, which is wired to the transmitter, which transmits to the receiver, which is...
-my phone.
-TUCK:
Okay, so basically, no matter who our parents call, it goes to your phone.
Yeah.
My mom's friends always say that I sound just like my mom, you know,
-when I pick up the phone...
-Yeah.
so I figured, I can be Betty.
(computers and gadgets beeping)
ALEX:
Bye, Betty.
Thank you.
Um, I'm going to Alex's...
or Munch's... or Tuck's house, and we're gonna play a video game and sleep over.
BETTY:
Wait, what's all that stuff?
Honey?
(sighs)
ALEX:
Good job, Munch.
You did it.
TUCK:
Here we come.
17.6 miles.
(Tuck humming happily)
¶ Going to the desert... ¶
Munch, what are you doing?
Guys, guys, just hold on, hold on, hold on.
-Dude...
-I'm not backing out or anything,
-He wants to quit right when we -...just-just hear me out.
-been waiting for this forever.
-Dude, listen, come on, okay.
This is crazy what we're doing.
Dude, I don't want to punk out or back out or anything-- it's just, my mom, you know, she just got divorced.
-Munch...
-She's already had enough guys lying to her.
If you didn't want to come, then why didn't you tell us earlier?
TUCK:
You do understand this is our last night together.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Look, Munch, if we don't go now, we'll never go.
We won't even be here.
This is our last chance to try and do something.
Even-even if it is stupid.
-Yeah.
-You know what,
I say we put a vote to it.
All in favor raise your hand.
Well, now I have to raise my hand.
Munch, just...
Fine, fine.
Okay, whatever.
I'll go.
But only under one condition.
-TUCK:
I call the black!
-ALEX:
Mine!
No, no!
No, give it!
MUNCH:
It's so weird, no one's gonna be in these houses next week.
ALEX:
Dude, you're so full of it.
-When did you kiss her?
-TUCK:
Dude, trust me.
After pre-algebra, she pulled me into the bathroom.
Wait, wait, wait, wait-- Mannequin Girl?
-TUCK:
Yeah!
-Was she good at it?
TUCK:
Uh, eh, B minus.
You know, I've kissed better in better locations.
No, how do I know you're not lying?
TUCK:
Trust me.
I don't even have to reply to you.
-You're last!
-MUNCH:
Hey, you got a head start!
That's not fair!
TUCK:
Oh, so what, there's a Wing Stop?
I never been to a Wing Stop.
(birds squawking)
TUCK (voice-over):
We followed a map out in the middle of nowhere.
MUNCH:
It might be, like, a CIA prison.
TUCK (voice-over):
We were miles from home.
(boys talking indistinctly)
No one in the world knew it.
No one said it... but we were scared.
ALEX:
We haven't seen a car in, like, half an hour.
TUCK (voice-over):
We were on our own.
MUNCH:
This-this is the way, right?
You have the map, right?
-Can I see the map?
-ALEX:
Left.
MUNCH:
Left?
Are you sure?
Because right looks a little bit more promising.
-(coyotes howling, yipping)
-Did you guys hear that?
ALEX:
Just a couple more miles.
(steady electronic pulsing)
TUCK:
Hold on.
What is that?
It's the map.
TUCK:
Are we close?
MUNCH:
I never understood why people like the outdoors.
TUCK:
Will you stop freaking out?
(electronic pulsing continues)
Yo, this is too steep, man.
Let's go, man.
(electronic pulsing continues)
MUNCH:
We're getting pretty far from the road, guys.
ALEX:
Almost there.
(electronic pulsing slows)
TUCK:
Is it this thing?
(sighs)
(electronic trilling, then static crackling)
ALEX:
I don't think so.
(electronic pulsing and trilling stop)
TUCK:
Wait, what was that?
-ALEX:
I don't know.
-Well, hold on.
What'd you see, dude?
-(pulsing resumes)
-TUCK:
Over here!
ALEX:
We're almost there.
Come on.
(electronic pulsing stops)
MUNCH:
Oh.
TUCK:
What?
TUCK:
What do you think it is?
How would I know?
TUCK:
Why does it look all burnt?
MUNCH:
Hey, just be careful.
-Careful!
-Yeah, don't touch that thing.
Could be...
MUNCH:
C-Could be...
I don't know, I don't know.
A part of a satellite?
TUCK:
All right, all right, um, Munch, film me while I'm...
-while I'm touching this thing.
-Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Let me try it.
Thank you.
It's dusty.
It's a piece of crap.
MUNCH:
What?
Forget about it.
Just turn off the camera.
MUNCH:
Well, it's not a national treasure, but it could be used for something.
(Tuck scoffs) It's crap.
What happened to filming 'cause it's our last night, huh?
Um, in case you haven't noticed, obviously, the map led to squat.
ALEX:
Got it.
So all you cared about was getting your stupid hits on your stupid video?
-Dude, why don't you just...
-MUNCH:
Whoa, guys, guys, guys.
Come on!
I know we're all frustrated...
-(phone ringing, gasps)
-It's Alex's mom.
-TUCK:
Are you serious?
-ALEX:
Um, it'll be fine.
Just, um, be Betty, okay?
-Oh, man.
-MUNCH:
Oh, crap.
Yo, I thought I could do this, but I can't.
Maybe you can answer it.
She just likes to check up on things, okay?
All right. (gasps)
WOMAN:
Betty, are you there?
(whispering):
Go.
This is Betty.
WOMAN:
I was thinking maybe I could bring over some pizzas?
TUCK:
Dude, go.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No coming over.
-Just hang up.
-No way.
No, it's really no trouble.
We have a coupon.
-I said no!
No pizzas!
-What?
-No, uh...
-TUCK:
Don't yell at her, man.
Maybe you and your husband should go to bed.
TUCK:
Stop saying words!
ALEX'S MOM:
Are you sure everything's okay?
Have a good night.
Go to sleep.
(line disconnects, beeps)
(chuckles) That could've gone better.
TUCK:
That was horrible.
"Your husband should go to sleep"?
Was that really something smart to say?
Munch.
Don't look at me like I'm a hoarder.
That's rude.
(distant voices)
ALEX (whispering):
Who are they?
MUNCH:
I don't...
I don't know.
MAN (over radio):
I'm picking up some spikes in the readings...
ALEX:
Get down, get down.
-They're turning a flashlight off, dummy.
-Let's go.
MUNCH:
Why would they be out this far?
TUCK:
Who cares?
The night's blown.
(static crackles)
-Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Whoa, whoa.
(panting)
ALEX:
Munch?
(chuckles)
-You're a character.
-There's something in there!
ALEX:
What?
TUCK:
Dude, are you kidding me right now?
MUNCH:
Something is in that bag.
It-it touched me.
TUCK:
Go check.
MUNCH:
Be-be careful.
(harsh screeching)
-TUCK:
What?
-Did it poke you, too?
TUCK:
What, dude?
Say something!
What did you see?
There-There's something in there.
Yeah, a bunch of crap Munch brought.
(chuckles)
-You guys are funny.
-All I know is it beeped.
You know, why don't you go in there and just see.
TUCK:
Beeped?
What are you talking about?
Babies.
I'll do it myself.
Dang, how much stuff do you have in your bag, dude?
Geez.
Oh, boy, are you guys talking about this?
It's garbage.
It's nothing.
What are you talking about, you heard something?
It made a noise.
Hey, hey, do something!
See, it's not doing anything.
What are you talking about?
Beep.
(snarling, snapping)
(Tuck laughs)
Do that again, do that again.
Do what again?
Do what you just did.
-Beep.
-(snarling, snapping)
Whoa, hold on.
Let me...
Let me try this for myself.
Beep.
Beep?
Why is it making noise only for you and not me?
Make it beep again.
Beep.
-(clank, hissing)
-Whoa!
MUNCH:
This is it!
It's a bomb!
(fading into distance):
No, no, oh, God, no!
No, no, no!
(chittering)
ALEX:
Guys, I think...
I think it might have defused.
I don't know.
TUCK:
Man, nothing's happening.
All right, hold on, hold on.
I got an idea.
MUNCH:
Tuck!
What?
MUNCH:
Okay, it didn't do anything, but j-just don't do it again.
Are you insane, Tuck?
!
Are you sure you guys know what you're doing?
TUCK:
Yes, trust me.
When it's a bomb, you have to act quick.
I seen it on some TV show or some movie or something.
-ALEX:
Saw what?
-Check it out.
MUNCH:
What are you doing?
!
Disarming it.
MUNCH:
Are you crazy?
!
It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.
That's not what you do with a bomb!
Are you insane?
!
-(electronic chirp, pinging)
-What was that?
It's not my phone.
It's the thing, whatever that is.
-What are you talking about?
-It's that.
That's what just made that noise.
(electronic pinging)
I, uh...
It, like, imitated my ringtone.
TUCK:
This is what made our phones barf?
(electronic chittering)
ALEX:
Did you hear that?
-(static crackles)
-Whoa!
-Whoa, whoa.
All right, so, a couple of seconds ago, our phones went crazy.
Bananas, insane.
I don't know what to call it.
Look.
You see that?
It's a new map, but on my phone this time.
To me?
All right, him, or...
Dude, Munch's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and, ugh, I don't even know what that is.
Alex's phone, it just turned on by itself and started filming.
We can't even turn them off.
Oh, don't try to act like it's not cool.
That is weird.
ALEX:
It's showing us where we are.
MUNCH:
And you don't find that creepy?
What do you think that is?
You think that's a road?
We should follow the map.
MUNCH:
How about no.
TUCK:
How about yes?
We wanted a last night together, so what do you call this?
A trap?
MUNCH:
Didn't you guys see the "No Trespassing" sign?
TUCK:
Oops.
I didn't see anything.
(electronic tone pulsing, stuttering)
This is where the map says to go.
(leaves crunching)
Stop stepping on leaves.
MUNCH:
There's leaves everywhere.
(indistinct talking)
-(grunting)
-Shh.
What was that?
(electronic tone pulsing, stuttering)
Where do you think it's taking us to?
(indistinct talking continues)
(electronic tone continues)
MUNCH:
Maybe another one of those beepy things.
(tone continues, louder)
(electronic tone continues, pulsing slows)
(electronic tone stops)
(static crackles)
(static buzzes, crackles)
(deep rumbling)
(metal creaking)
What was that?
I don't know.
(creaking continues, rumbling fades)
(rattling, clanking, quiet warbling)
-Whoa!
Whoa!
-Get down!
Oh, geez!
Munch, watch out!
Aah!
Aah!
TUCK:
Aah!
ALEX:
What's going on?
Dude, Munch, what was that?
(clattering, rumbling)
(boys scream)
TUCK:
Where is it?
Is it over?
-Oh, geez.
-(screaming)
Dude!
MUNCH:
Tuck, stay back.
-TUCK:
Whoa.
-MUNCH:
Stay back.
-(electronic warbling)
-MUNCH:
What's...
TUCK:
Dude!
(whirring, beeping)
-Wait, wait, be careful.
-(electronic chittering)
MUNCH:
Your phone just got a new map.
ALEX:
What?
(electronic whirring)
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Wait, why is it opening?
TUCK:
Hold on, hold on.
Did you see that just now?
-(electronic chittering)
-ALEX:
What is that?
-TUCK:
Whoa!
What is that?
-MUNCH:
What is that?
-What is that?
-Oh, my...
Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.
ALEX:
It-It's moving.
TUCK:
There's something in there right now.
MUNCH:
What's in there?
Oh, don't tell me.
ALEX:
Are those... eyes?
(electronic chittering)
Dude, dude, it's looking dead at us right now.
MUNCH:
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
ALEX:
It's trembling like it's hurt.
MUNCH:
Good.
TUCK:
My heart's beating so fast right now.
Wow.
MUNCH:
Almost got us killed, like, three times already.
Yeah, but it was worth it, dude.
Incredible.
All right, so...
I just figured out why Alex's camera was on this whole time.
So this thing, whatever it is, it's eyes are, like, all screwed up, completely.
You see?
So, basically, it uses his phone to see.
That's insane.
(Alex chuckles)
ALEX (distorted):
You think he can see us right now?
(electronic chittering)
Munch, you have to check this out.
This is amazing.
(click, electronic snarl)
MUNCH:
Is it?
Is it amazing?
'Cause I think it's scary as balls.
I mean, obviously people are looking for it.
-Munch...
-It has access to our voicemails and our texts and our ringtones.
TUCK:
How do you even know it's a he?
Are you a dude?
(beeps)
(chuckles)
Wait... you understood us.
(beeps, warbles)
Whoa. (chuckles)
All right, here's how it goes.
One beep is yes, two beeps are no.
Watch.
Is one beep yes?
(beeps once)
TUCK:
Yo, that's so tight.
Are we in a barn?
(beeps once)
Is Munch really a woman?
(beeps twice)
Oh, come on, man, this thing is broken.
Everybody knows Munch is a woman.
Okay, I have a question.
Are we gonna die tonight?
Why isn't it answering?
What...
Well, that's not good, right?
20 questions with an alien.
Tuck Simms exclusive.
-Let's do this.
-Check it out.
All right, um, are you from space?
-(beeps once)
-Ooh!
Are you a robot?
(beeps twice)
Do you eat humans?
(beeps twice)
(sighs)
Do you like Earth?
(beeps twice)
Why?
Why doesn't he like Earth?
Do you like us?
(beeps once)
You see?
I told you.
We're cool like that.
Come on.
Are you hurt?
(beeps once)
-Oh.
-He's hurt.
Well, his lights seem brighter, so...
Did that piece help you?
(beeps once)
Oh.
Can we help fix you or something?
Or...
Like, what is this?
Are-are you trying to build something?
-(beeps once)
-Oh, he's trying to build...
Building something.
Right there.
-What could he be building?
-Yeah.
So, wait, what are, what are you building?
-Lasers?
-(beeps twice)
-A portal?
-(beeps twice)
-Minions?
-(beeps twice)
-A cloaking device?
-(beep twice)
-It's an army.
-(beeps twice)
Ignore him.
-Spaceship?
-(deep electronic whirr)
Oh, my God!
Hold up, hold up.
So let me get this right.
So you're building a spaceship,
-He's building a spaceship.
-and you need our help building the spaceship?
-(beeps once)
-Oh, man.
This guy is building a spaceship.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Let me make sure I don't have any plans.
Nope!
We're building a spaceship!
He's building a spaceship.
TUCK (voice-over):
We asked him questions for almost two hours.
Where he came from.
If there were others here like him.
We found out he was lost... and alone.
He was out in the middle of nowhere, on his own, like us.
All we really knew was that he crashed, and now he needed us to rebuild him.
ALEX:
The map says up ahead.
MUNCH:
Are we going the right way?
(horns honking, distorted)
Look, look, look, look, whatever that is, the map goes to it.
All right, so wait-wait a minute.
Let me get this right.
Dude comes from a million light-years away, and he wants to come here?
I don't know, the map said so.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You got to look both ways before you cross the street.
ALEX:
Munch.
(electronic doorbell dinging)
(Tuck chuckles)
So are you... snoopy.
CUSTOMER:
Ten dollars?
-OWNER:
I said no deal.
-$7.50.
OWNER:
I don't want it.
It's tchotchke trash.
If you give it to me as a gift, I'd still throw it away.
-It's trash.
-CUSTOMER:
No, it's vintage.
OWNER:
No.
You don't get to say the word "vintage."
I'm the one who gets to say when what is vintage.
Excuse me, sir, you have a very, very lovely shop.
MAN:
Come on, you sure?
Hey.
Oh, man, look at the hand painting.
It's all crafted right there.
-One of a kind.
-OWNER:
It's trash.
(static buzzing)
(phones buzzing)
-(thumping, rumbling) -(boys gasp)
-(rumbling) -(sustained, high-pitched tone)
Uh, uh...
-(tone fades)
-TUCK:
What was that?
F-sharp?
-(metallic creaking) -(horns blow, squeak)
(note fades slowly)
-(instruments popping, sounding) -(gasping, exclaiming)
No, no, no!
Come on!
ALEX:
Watch out!
Watch out!
(chaotic tooting, banging)
(owner exclaims in native language)
-(Tuck laughs)
-OWNER:
What was it?
MUNCH:
Whoa.
Is everybody okay?
-(Alex coughing)
-TUCK:
Hey, Nichols, Nichols, are you alive?
CUSTOMER:
They broke my girlfriend's lamp!
TUCK:
Wait, what is he doing?
-MUNCH:
Oh.
Whoa, whoa.
-TUCK:
Is-is that...
-OWNER:
Sweet babushka.
-(Tuck laughs)
You want to sell it?
-Tuck, let's go!
Come on!
-Run!
What are you waiting for?
TUCK:
Dude, that place was wrecked!
MUNCH:
Sorry again, sir!
ALEX:
Go!
Go!
Down here!
TUCK:
Let's get somewhere so we can look at him.
(electronic chittering)
ALEX:
He's shaking.
(electronic chittering)
TUCK:
Whoa, he's letting you touch him.
-MUNCH:
I wouldn't, guys.
-Hey, what about here?
Here, set him on here.
-(Alex laughs)
-MUNCH:
He looks scared.
TUCK:
Yeah, why is he all balled up?
Can't you stand?
You all right?
-(electronic chittering)
-MUNCH:
Maybe he's... maybe he's just shy.
-Ooh, can you fly?
-TUCK:
Can you do X-ray vision?
MUNCH:
How?
He can't see.
ALEX (chuckles):
He doesn't even know where to look.
TUCK:
All right, all right, I think the question is, what can you do?
TUCK:
Okay, so Dr. Nichols is doing a surgical procedure with very sophisticated technology.
-Pen caps.
-(Tuck laughs)
Clear.
MUNCH:
Wait, I don't get it.
How is that sophisticated?
It's kind of just, like, pen caps.
I got it.
(quiet electronic warbling)
TUCK:
Be careful.
His legs are fragile.
-(Alex laughs)
-MUNCH:
Whoa.
Get this.
Are you getting this?
-Whoa!
-Whoa!
(Tuck laughs)
TUCK:
Oh, that's crazy!
So you can't fly, but you can float.
-(electronic chirp)
-TUCK:
That is so crazy!
(all laughing)
I saw you.
I saw you grinning, man.
Stop trying to pretend like that wasn't cool.
-That was hot.
-This is crazy.
I mean, it's-it's just crazy.
-(electronic chirp)
-ALEX:
Whoa.
Don't drop it.
Huh.
(electronic chirp, low whirring)
(zaps)
(chirps)
-Can you see me?
-(chirping, pinging)
(Alex imitates pinging)
-(pinging)
-TUCK:
Huh, I think he likes you.
Will you show us where you live?
-(chirps)
-All right.
Beep faster if I'm getting close.
(beeping)
-(rapid beeping)
-Is that it, right there?
(quiet electronic warbling)
Why don't I go first.
Hi.
Um, my name's Alex, and... you're-you're in-- Munch, no-- you're in my hand right now.
You know my ringtone, which is, like, insane and awesome.
(electronic pinging)
(whirring)
(chirping)
Okay, um...
Hi.
I'm Tuck.
What's up?
I don't even know what to say, but, uh... but, uh, I'm from...
I'm from New York.
Uh, this is Nevada.
I don't even know, like, I like donuts,
-um...
-ALEX:
Donuts?
Really?
Okay, can somebody else do this?
I know, I'm going.
My name's M...
My real name is Reginald, but my friends call me Munch.
I hope we can be friends, too.
-(electronic chirping)
-Do you have a name?
Oh, we could call him Beep.
Dude, what-what kind of name is Beep?
Word.
We got to give him a name that's powerful, like... like Master Blaster.
He doesn't blast anything.
Peter.
Peter.
What about Peter?
Something cool, like Space Ninja or something.
MUNCH:
Well, how is there a ninja in space?
He wouldn't be able to breathe.
-All right, all right...
-Dude, you don't know that.
Have you ever been to space?
Which name do you like?
-MUNCH:
Uh, Beep.
Why?
-(beeps)
There it is.
-Hello.
Watch this.
Watch this.
-You can't echo...
Watch this.
Just...
Beep.
-(beeps)
-See?
-Echo.
-(chirps)
That's what we should call it.
Echo.
-(chirps)
-Oh, 'cause it echoes.
-Wait, I don't get it.
-Echo, Echo, Echo.
-Echo.
Your name... is Echo.
ECHO (distorted):
Echo...
Echo... (voice distorting unintelligibly)
ALEX:
I don't think he's supposed to come out of that cylinder thing.
MUNCH:
He looks... dead.
TUCK (faintly):
Echo?
TUCK (voice-over):
So then we didn't know how broken he was.
(electronic chirping)
The crash hurt him worse than we thought.
-(weak chirp)
-ALEX:
Okay, little guy... where do you want us to go?
(chirps)
(electronic whirring)
(dog barks in distance)
MUNCH:
Guys?
You know this is considered being a burglar, right?
TUCK (voice-over):
With each new piece, he got strong.
And that's what we were gonna do-- make him stronger.
(tone pulses briefly)
-(whispers):
Which way?
-Around.
-MUNCH:
In the house?
!
-TUCK:
Dude!
(Munch groans)
MUNCH:
Maybe we should just knock on the door and...
MAN:
We just need you to listen, sweetheart.
-TUCK (sighs):
Oh, man.
-GIRL:
You're grounding me?
ALEX:
Tuck, what are you doing?
Munch, go.
MAN:
It's the man-- the man should choose his dance partner.
GIRL:
It's a stupid tradition.
WOMAN:
Really, it's about meeting new people, and many of those were our friends' sons.
And it's embarrassing when you ignore them.
MEN:
And these are life skills that we are teaching you.
-MUNCH:
Tuck, get back.
-Putting on this dress for you doesn't change me into some perfect little homecoming queen!
MAN:
Okay, no one's asking you to act like a homecoming queen.
WOMAN:
It's at least three years away.
MUNCH:
Now.
Go, go, go.
WOMAN:
...by the company you keep.
It's a cliché for a reason.
I'm sure this all seems...
MUNCH:
Guys, what are we doing?
We're gonna be trapped up here.
TUCK:
Everybody be quiet.
-(electronic whirring) -(woman continues indistinctly)
GIRL:
Yeah, everyone!
(woman and man continue indistinctly)
TUCK:
You got to be kidding me.
Aw, you know what?
Everyone just follow me, all right?
Don't look at anything.
Just hurry.
-Hey, Tuck, did you see this?
-No, don't...
Dude, Tuck, this is Mannequin Girl's house.
Now we can ask for permission to steal stuff, 'cause, you know, you guys are kissing buddies.
Aw, man...
TUCK:
It was a couple of days ago.
She probably forgot about it by now, you know?
Like, yeah, it's...
yeah, she probably forgot.
-How would she forget about it?
-I almost forgot about it... (deep rumbling)
-TUCK:
Oh, boy, get ready.
-Uh-oh.
Close the door.
Close the door.
-(rumbling, clattering)
-Guys...
-Dude, we just got to keep it from going crazy.
It's gonna get loud.
We'll catch it in a blanket.
-What?
(gasps)
-Whoa!
-Get down!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
-Stop letting it move!
MUNCH:
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
GIRL:
How to unfold a napkin?
!
-Who cares!
-MAN:
Fine!
GIRL:
And in no time in my life am I gonna be somewhere
-that even plays the foxtrot!
-TUCK:
Close the door.
-(low electronic warble)
-Yo, put it away, man.
ALEX:
Shh.
Be quiet.
-(door opens)
-GIRL:
What the...?
Wait, I know you.
-Hey.
It's okay.
-(gasps)
Hey, hey, hey, we're with Tuck.
Tuck Simms.
You know?
Remember you guys kissed?
-We what?
-Yeah, what are you talking about, huh?
Why is my room destroyed?
-Why are you filming this?
-(electronic chirping)
-And what is that?
-Um, it's a... it's a-a car muffler.
No.
I want to know what that is.
MUNCH:
It's actually a spaceship.
-Munch!
-Sorry.
Uh, well, we-we were following maps, and it just happened to lead here, so we were trying to help our friend Echo-- well, he's an alien
-TUCK:
Oh, God...
-...that we're trying to get him on a ship.
See, look, it used to have six symbols, but now it has three, so that means we're almost there.
Crazy, right?
ALEX:
Munch, will you shut up?
An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?
-ALEX:
Nope.
-TUCK:
No, no.
(Echo chirps "no")
(electronic chirping)
-You did not just see that.
-Yeah, I did.
MUNCH:
Yeah, she definitely saw it.
-GIRL:
Wait.
-Whoa, whoa.
-Hey, I want to go.
-Really?
Sounds great.
ALEX:
What?
No.
-Dude...
-You're not part of our group, so why don't you just go play with your super rich friends...
TUCK:
That's kind of harsh and your ball gowns and just go eat steak or something.
-GIRL:
What the hell?
-TUCK:
Go, go, go.
(dog barking in distance)
TUCK:
Dang, dude, what was that upstairs?
-What are you talking about?
-I've never seen you so mad.
MUNCH:
Yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.
ALEX:
All right, let's just...
don't talk about...
Nothing happened in there, all right?
TUCK:
You know, they say the girls you argue with
-are the ones you like.
-(Alex sighs)
ALEX:
Don't go there, bro.
-(electronic whirring)
-Tuck, it's over there.
TUCK:
Wait, it wants us to go to a bar?
Man, I say we climb in a window or find a door.
There's got to be another way.
MUNCH:
Um, before-before we go...
I really need to get the pee out of my body.
-(Tuck groans)
-Let's just hope the next place isn't a bank.
(Echo beeping)
TUCK:
I can't believe you told that girl to get lost.
-You're so dramatic.
-ALEX:
What about you?
You invented a whole kiss, didn't you?
Uh, first of all, for your info, it's called aspirational thinking.
You're thinking it one moment, you're living it the next.
-How's that working out?
-MAN:
Oh, excuse me.
(indistinct radio communication)
(gasps)
TUCK:
Go to the bikes.
MUNCH:
Oh, God, oh, God.
-TUCK:
Why is the construction man...
-Shut...
-MAN:
Excuse me.
-TUCK:
Aw...
Hey.
I know you guys.
You're the guys... you're from the construction site, right?
Uh, with the, uh, with the camera?
Whoa-ho, wait, wait.
Why aren't you guys at home right now?
You guys weren't riding your bikes out
-around the desert, were you?
-No, of course not.
-MUNCH:
Yes.
Uh, no.
That doesn't sound too... clear.
-MUNCH:
Uh...
-GIRL:
Thank God.
There you are.
-TUCK:
What?
-MAN:
Who-who are you?
Who am I?
(dramatic sobbing):
Who am I?
Exactly!
It's like I don't even know anymore.
My mom had to drag my dad from the bar-- again!
-TUCK:
What?
-He likes to go there more than he likes to tuck in his own kids at night.
At least that's what my mom says.
MUNCH:
What's she talking about?
That's her.
Eating a burrito.
She east when she's stressed.
I ask myself if that's gonna be me one day.
What do you think?
Is it?
We make mistakes and we get married and we go to bars.
And these... these are my only friends in the world,
-'cause they see me
-TUCK:
Uh... for who I really am.
MAN:
That's your mom over there?
-Do you want to meet her?
-No.
No.
No, no.
Just get home safe!
Told you guys I wanted to go.
-(Echo chirps "Oh...!")
-TUCK:
What the...?
TUCK (voice-over):
Okay, so this girl, man, she'd been tailing us since her house, spying on us like some creepy stalker.
-She'd overheard our whole plan.
-She... she's crazy.
-ALEX:
I need the bag!
-I think I like it.
(engine revs)
-(music blaring)
-ALEX:
Oh, boy, get ready.
TUCK:
All right, try to blend in.
Look old.
WOMAN:
That must've been some good fake I.D.'s.
MAN:
What's up, baby face?
What are you doing in here, little man?
Oh, uh, I, uh...
-Are you Randy's kid?
-TUCK:
Uh,
-yes, he is.
-Um, y-yeah, yeah, yeah, he's my dad... or mom.
-You know, dad.
Mom.
-Okay, dude, just go.
-Hurry up.
-(Echo warbling)
ALEX:
Emma?
Emma?
I was hanging out with this really pretty chick.
She's almost as pretty as you.
I mean... you're not pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.
Come over here.
Hop up on that stool.
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Oh, and one for his buddy here, too.
TUCK:
No, no, I'm all right.
Seriously, I'm all right.
-Sure, you'll like it.
-Sorry, I'm a...
I'm allergic.
Oh, you're gonna love it.
-Uh, no, no.
-You're gonna get one.
So, what happens next?
-Just give me back my bag.
-No.
Give it.
I'm serious.
Give me the bag.
Why are you being mean to me?
-Here, honey.
-TUCK:
Thank you.
-You're welcome.
-(chuckles):
Yeah.
MUNCH:
Wow, a lot of people with beards and mustaches in here, you know?
(deep rumbling, rattling)
ALEX:
You don't understand.
Whenever you get close to the next piece, it goes crazy.
(people gasping, shouting)
ALEX:
Oh, my God!
-Whoa!
Aah!
-(gasping, shouting)
(gasping, shouting stop)
(Echo warbles)
-TUCK:
Uh...
-MAN:
Are you kidding me?
-(excited chatter) -(whoops)
Do you guys just go around town breaking stuff?
TUCK:
Just keep running!
Go, go!
EMMA:
What was that?
I think the ship's trying to take off!
-(whirring, clicking)
-TUCK:
Whoa, whoa!
(Alex laughing)
TUCK:
Are you seeing this?
This thing is flying a ship... in your backpack?
I think he's getting better.
MUNCH:
Oh.
So, you don't know how he crashed, or when, or why he came here with a spaceship in the first place?
Look, he only answers yes or no-- it's not that simple.
Is this how I talk to him?
(Echo chirping)
-So, you crashed.
-(chirps once)
Did someone cause you to crash?
-(chirps once)
-ALEX:
Dude, what's she doing?
-TUCK:
I don't know.
-Someone on Earth?
(chirps once)
Do you think they're looking for you?
(chirps once)
It's not those guys in trucks from the convenience store, is it?
-(chirps, chitters)
-TUCK:
The construction man?
MUNCH:
Those are the guys that shot you down?
TUCK:
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We got to take a step back.
This is way bigger and shadier than before, okay?
This is not good.
If those dudes are looking for Echo, they're looking for us, you know?
-(siren wailing in distance) -(thumping in Dumpster)
-(rustling) -(echoing whirr)
(excited chirping)
-ALEX:
Echo?
-(excited chirping continues)
You need some help there, buddy?
(chirping)
Hey, it's okay.
Shh.
Breathe like me, okay?
(inhales)
(exhales)
(imitates breathing)
(exhales)
It's okay.
TUCK:
Dude, h-he'll be fine.
No.
We're not leaving him.
My whole life, I've been left.
I know how it feels.
(quiet electronic purr)
(crickets chirping)
ALEX:
We're all he's got.
(Echo beeping, warbling)
(train whistle blows in distance)
-MUNCH:
Uh, left?
-EMMA:
We could find a shortcut.
ALEX:
The map says up ahead.
MUNCH:
This map's confusing.
I was a mind ninja back there...
-EMMA:
So, what was it like kissing me?
-Give me my camera.
-Did your legs get all wobbly?
-(Tuck scoffs)
Was there soft music playing?
Please remind me, Tuck.
I totally forgot.
-What was it like?
-You're close.
Is this your first imaginary kiss?
TUCK:
The map says for us to go inside.
EMMA:
I'm confused.
-Huh?
-Didn't you guys kiss?
TUCK (voice-over):
Anyway, the point is,
Emma was being annoying-- she kept walking off with Echo like she owned him, and talking to him about
I don't know what, I don't even know.
You know what?
Delete.
TUCK:
Man, are we sure there's no security guards or...
You know, that door wasn't even locked.
Hey, uh, guys, I was just thinking, you know,
I... haven't got to actually hold the, you know, the ship, before we did the thing, so can I do it?
-You know, before it gets crazy?
-EMMA:
Sure, but... it's not a ship.
TUCK:
What?
What are you talking about?
You told us it was a ship.
It's a key to your ship, right?
(Echo chirps)
(low electronic warbling)
Well, if this is just the key, where's the spaceship?
-(clattering, crackling)
-All right, Munch, put it down.
-(Echo chirps)
-Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.
TUCK:
Okay, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to put it down
-before you hurt both of us.
-I need this, man.
-(electronic blipping)
-TUCK:
That's weird.
-Does it know her?
-TUCK:
I don't know.
Munch!
(Munch gasps)
TUCK:
Whoa!
MUNCH:
Whoa!
-(Tuck laughs)
-ALEX:
You okay?
-EMMA:
Yeah.
-MUNCH:
What are you guys doing?
-TUCK:
Wow.
-ALEX:
Um, she was gonna get hit by the piece, so I-I saved her.
-GUARD:
Hey!
You four!
Freeze!
-(alarm ringing)
-Run!
-Which way?
-Tuck!
-Stop right there!
Stop!
TUCK:
Go, go!
Hurry up!
(alarm continues ringing)
EMMA:
Hold up, hold up!
Did Alex get out?
(Echo chirps)
Uh, I d...
I don't know.
-We have to go back.
-Uh...
-Come on, you guys.
-Okay.
Look.
Whoa, whoa.
She's being stupid.
There's a guard in there, you know?
You can't just go running in, acting crazy.
We need a-a plan, or... s... right?
GUARD:
Breaking and entering, destruction of property.
Those are felonies, kid.
(whispers):
Okay, Echo, I need your help.
Um, I need you to...
do something.
GUARD:
I have a minor here; he's 13.
Caught him breaking in with his friends.
If you could send an officer down.
GUARD:
Stay put.
Hello?
(Emma panting)
-(arcade game music playing)
-Anybody there?
(game music tempo accelerating)
(phone ringing)
-GUARD:
Hello?
-(Echo chirps)
Hello?
(echoing loudly):
Is anybody there?
...there...
Is anybody there... there... (Echo chirping)
-(rumbling) -(guard gasps)
GUARD:
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
EMMA:
Alex.
Alex.
-Wh-Where's Tuck?
-We got to go.
(arcade game music continues)
-We should've gone back.
-All right, you know what?
Calm down, because if people would've listened to me, then Alex never would have gotten caught.
Didn't I say there would be security guards?
Alex!
Dude!
You're all right!
Are you all right?
Hey, Alex, we're good, man.
All right?
-MUNCH:
Buddy?
-We're good, man?
TUCK:
Alex.
Come on, dude.
Alex!
We could've gone home, but we didn't.
-We were outside.
-Turn off the camera.
Not till you admit you're acting mopey for no reason.
You're always freaking out if anyone's gonna leave you behind.
TUCK:
Do you know how expensive that is?
ALEX:
I'm glad I'm moving.
You were never my friend.
-Is that right?
Is that right?
-MUNCH:
Guys, guys,
-come on, just-just chill out.
-EMMA:
Come on!
EMMA:
Have you lost your mind?
TUCK (voice-over):
I acted like I didn't know what I'd done.
But I knew exactly.
MUNCH:
I know we're all tired and stuff, and hungry.
I saw this awesome diner.
We can totally just go grab
-a bite to eat or something.
-EMMA:
Real awesome, guys.
-Real macho.
-(Tuck and Alex grunting)
So, that's it?
The night's over?
Doesn't have to be.
Right?
Well, I mean, if it is, uh, we could...
I don't know, I guess we can keep the mood going, yeah?
Or we can do it another time, right?
Good times, the continuation, part two.
Right?
(Tuck scoffs)
(sighs) Hmm.
You know what?
I'm gonna talk about Sandra.
Man, that girl used to beat the crap out of you.
Me, too.
We were both little, small and scrawny.
She was a big girl, and she knew it.
But then I had a growth spurt, and you didn't, and I finally did something.
You remember that?
You told her I had polio.
Yeah, I told her that, and did she beat you up after that?
MUNCH:
She still beat me up.
'Cause I-I always get your back, man.
I never let you down;
I always get your back.
(Tuck sighs)
Most of the time.
Just when I'm not freaked out about security guards, all right?
I'm sorry, man.
Are we good?
(softly):
Yeah.
(Echo warbles weakly)
Dude.
(electronic chittering)
Faster.
(radio hisses, blips;
static crackles)
Sure are doing some traveling tonight.
EMMA:
My parents are in the bathroom.
Uh-huh.
(rhythmic beeping)
(Echo beeping back)
(Echo chittering)
(chittering continues)
Let it go.
TUCK:
What are you doing?
-Dude!
Hey, what are you doing?
!
-MUNCH:
Oh, God!
Don't grab our stuff like that!
-Stop!
-Hey, give me the backpack!
-Who do you think you are?
-The police have been instructed to come and pick up these kids and take them home.
He can't just walk away.
-(phone rings)
-ALEX:
What was it?
EMMA:
The phone.
-No, no, no!
-Munch!
-Munch!
-Munch!
Munch!
-Munch!
Munch!
Oh, my...
Munch!
(engine revs, tires squeal)
TUCK:
This is not real, this is not real, this is not real right now.
-(sirens wailing)
-ALEX:
Don't let them see you.
-(siren chirps)
-Now!
ALEX:
Munch!
Do you see the truck?
TUCK:
Munch!
ALEX:
Munch!
That guy is not a construction worker.
(phone ringing)
-It's Munch.
-MUNCH:
I need help, guys.
I really didn't think this through.
TUCK:
We're here, we're here.
Are you hurt?
(staticky):
Can you guys hear me...?
-EMMA:
Are you okay?
-ALEX:
Where are you, Munch?
TUCK:
We'll find you, all right?
I promise.
(staticky):
I think I'm at the construction site.
-ALEX:
Come on, buddy.
-TUCK:
Munch!
(staticky):
I can see the big lights and up at those...
-the white trucks...
-(line disconnects)
How far is your neighborhood?
It's way over an hour.
TUCK:
All right, I think I got a faster way.
Who wants to go to a party?
ALEX:
Are you sure he'll even be here?
Better be.
His girlfriend's throwing it.
(music thumping from distance)
¶ ¶
EMMA:
I can't believe we're doing this.
TUCK (sighing):
Sophomores.
Hey, sweet party.
Sweet jams.
Guys, what are we doing here?
We can't be...
Just look for my brother.
Look for his keys.
-Oh, my gosh, it's the cops.
-(laughter)
-Okay.
Oh, God, the keys, the keys.
TUCK:
I lost my keys.
I have a Porsche.
Marcus!
Oh, not you, sorry.
I wasn't trying to stop the fun-
- I like it.
-Whoa...!
-(laughter)
TUCK:
Hi.
Uh, sorry to bother everyone.
Have you seen my brother, Marcus?
Tall guy?
You seen his car keys?
-Uh, anyone?
-Guys, the cops are here!
-What?
-Yeah, the cops are here.
-Turn it down, turn it down.
-GUY:
Dude, stop...
No, I'm serious, the cops are here right now.
Alex!
Alex!
-(siren wailing)
-We have to go now.
TUCK:
All right, just come on, come on.
We got to move.
EMMA:
Hurry, hurry.
ALEX:
We can't hide here.
TUCK:
Look, look, just stay here.
He's my brother;
I'll find him.
Just... don't let the cops take the footage.
All right?
FEMALE OFFICER:
You live here, right?
ALEX:
The cops!
TUCK:
Marcus?
Marcus, we're here.
-(lock clicks) -(knocking on door)
(indistinct police radio communication)
MALE OFFICER (distant):
The party's shut down.
That's enough.
Come on.
(indistinct police radio communication)
(snoring)
ALEX:
Oh, my God.
(chuckles)
ALEX:
Tuck's gonna freak.
Uh, here, check his pockets.
-Yes.
-EMMA:
Oh, yeah.
Cops are gone.
-Uh, Tuck, Tuck?
-I have no idea where Marcus is.
(snoring continues)
ALEX:
Yeah.
Tell me you got that on tape?
(wind howling)
My name is Reginald "Munch" Barrett.
This is my...
kind of my final message.
To my best friends...
(grunts)
(crying)
I love you, guys.
-(brakes squeak) -(Munch gasps)
(footsteps approaching)
(Munch screams, grunts)
(indistinct radio communication)
(engine starts)
(chuckles)
EMMA:
You're Googling it?
Really?
Oh, come on, this is what the Internet is for.
Um, "step one, get a driver's license."
-Do we have one of those?
-Oh, wow.
All right, am I good?
-(engine roaring)
-Stop!
Stop!
All right, all right.
EMMA:
Dude, do you even know what you're doing?
No, I don't.
"Step two, be calm."
-(engine roaring)
-What are you doing?
!
-Sorry, sorry.
-Be calm is step two?
All right, all right, all right.
I got it, I got it.
-Hold on a sec..
-(engine revs, tires squeal)
-EMMA:
Stop!
-ALEX:
Tuck, Tuck, turn!
-Whoa!
-Oh, I'm sorry about that.
-Uh...
-EMMA:
Oh, my God.
ALEX:
We're good, we're good.
All right, I'm excited.
Should I gun it?
-EMMA:
No, no, no, don't.
-No, Tuck.
I need, I need music.
Somebody just play some music.
-All right.
-(music blaring)
-Oh, my!
-Oh, my God.
(different music playing)
Change it.
(different song playing)
(another melody playing)
(music changes to a different song)
¶ ¶
TUCK (voice-over):
Everywhere we'd been that night, shot by us like a rocket.
All we wanted was our friends back.
¶ ¶
¶ ¶
I'm gonna miss it here, man.
ALEX:
Yeah, me too.
(music stops)
(brakes squeak)
(engine stops)
Here we go.
I don't know about this.
(equipment rumbles, clatters)
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
-(thumps) -(grunts)
(indistinct announcement over P.A. in distance)
(indistinct shouting)
EMMA:
That does not look like a freeway.
(Tuck scoffs)
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)
(indistinct conversation in distance)
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)
-(Tuck exhales anxiously)
-ALEX:
Get down.
Shh, shh.
TUCK:
All right, so what's the plan?
ALEX:
I don't know.
Get him out?
So, in other words, we don't have a plan.
(indistinct radio communication)
(Tuck groans)
(panting)
TUCK:
Go, go, go.
I'm just gonna call Munch's phone and see if his phone rings.
(beeps)
(phone ringing)
Wait a minute.
(ringing continues in distance)
(Tuck gasps)
(indistinct conversations in distance)
TUCK:
Dude, my camera's not a doorstop.
(various indistinct radio conversations)
TUCK:
I hear his voice.
(Munch crying, talking indistinctly)
(machines beeping)
(crying continues)
TUCK:
Shh.
MUNCH:
I-I knew it was you guys 'cause I saw the same truck from my neighborhood.
MAN:
Tell us the truth.
MUNCH:
I-I had a lot of adrenaline rush, and... (sobs) I...
I didn't want the night to end.
And I... and it was the last night with Alex.
ALEX:
Oh, shit, Munch.
MAN:
Stop crying and talk to us.
TUCK:
This is not good.
I'm not... (sobs) I'm not crying!
EMMA:
What?
Where is that?
TUCK:
We got to find him and get him out of there, man.
-(electronic chittering)
-MUNCH:
Just don't kill me!
MAN:
Did he access your phones at all?
Were there others like it or was this the only one you found?
(electronic buzzing)
What are they doing?
(electronic chittering)
TUCK:
Dude, they're breaking him!
(frantic chittering)
EMMA:
Guys?
Guys, someone's coming.
We should go.
TUCK:
Go, go.
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Hey, construction man!
-Give me the camera.
-Listen...
This is not your camera.
Hey, guys, go!
-And find Munch!
-Let go of me!
Get off of us, man, this isn't...
-My camera!
-Let go.
Is that thing still on?
MAN:
Okay, no more lies.
No more sneaking around.
No more cameras, understand?
Son, look at me.
Look at me.
TUCK:
Oh, I-I see better with my glasses on, you know?
-(sighs) -(electronic tone stuttering)
This signal has been transmitting for a very long time, from a ship that we believe is located right here in your neighborhood.
-ALEX:
What?
-TUCK:
Wait, what-what's he talking about?
MAN:
Six days ago, an object entered our atmosphere at 20,000 miles an hour, on a direct course for that ship.
We shot it down.
(Tuck sighs)
What you found activates the ship, and if that ship takes off, it could kill everyone.
He just wants to go home.
MAN:
Okay, that will not happen.
He is far too valuable.
TUCK:
This is crazy, this is crazy.
So... we are gonna follow this map and you are gonna help us get that thing operational, and it will lead us back to its ship, and we will disable it permanently.
Am I clear?
-(thumps)
-Am I clear?
Y-Yeah.
Good.
TUCK:
Check the doors, check the doors.
It's locked;
it's not just locked.
They don't have a handle on it.
-Someone help!
-EMMA:
Where are they taking us?
-(engine starts)
-Hey, yo!
Let us out, man!
MUNCH:
Someone!
TUCK (sighs):
Well, the sun's up.
MUNCH:
Our parents are gonna find out.
(indistinct radio communication)
I think we got bigger problems than our parents.

Will you drive?

I need an Advil.

We can't afford this right now.
We really can't afford this right now.
MUNCH:
Dude, look, there's a new map.
A what?
TUCK:
Here, here, give me the phones back.
EMMA:
I think that's his ship.
TUCK:
Whoa, that's a big ship.
MUNCH:
Alex, I don't want to stress you out or anything, but they're right there!

Oh, my God.
Alex, it's your mom.

Betty?

Dude.

Munch.
-JANICE:
Betty?
-MUNCH:
Hi.
-Sorry about my tone last night.
-Oh, I just thought it would be nice to have the boys have a nice night
-together before we're all uprooted.
-You're crying.
-Munch, it's your mom.
-What?
!
Look, look, look, look.
Dude.
-JANICE:
You okay?
-MUNCH:
So, uh, Janice, gotta go-- on my jog.
Can we act like we never had this conversation?
Uh, uh, just come over this wall.
Are you up?
-Guys, they're here.
-ALEX:
Jump.
-TUCK:
Move!
-MUNCH:
Faster!
(grunting)
TUCK:
They can't catch us in our own backyard.
-MAN:
Let's cut them off.
-(pursuers shouting)
(Echo chattering)
Munch, hurry up!
-Okay, okay.
-Munch!
Well, I don't jump walls very much, man!
Here, hold my camera.
Dude, come on, come on, come on.
-No, no, no, no, no!
-Tuck, wait!
(dog snapping, barking)
EMMA:
They're right behind us!
Come on, guys, we got to go, we got to go.
Let's go, right now.
ALEX:
It's down the hill.
Come on, let's go!
(indistinct radio communication)
MUNCH:
Shh.
TUCK:
Go, go, go.
ALEX:
It says the ship is up ahead.
TUCK:
This is the way to your house, man.
-Go, go, go, guys!
-Are your parents awake?
I think we...
I think we lost them.
-(panting)
-Okay.
I don't...
I don't get it.
(electronic whirring)
ALEX:
I...
This is where the map ends.
(Echo chittering)
TUCK:
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship.
(Echo chitters)
MUNCH:
Maybe it's invisible.
(Echo chittering)
What is it?
Wait, what-what's he talking about?
What do you want us to...
TUCK:
Dude, what?
Whoa, whoa.
MUNCH:
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Whoa, whoa...
-TUCK:
Oh.
Everybody good?
MUNCH:
What's down there?
Be careful, man.
What?
ALEX:
That's it.
TUCK:
Dude, it-it's underneath.
(Echo chittering)
TUCK:
So this whole time...
ALEX:
That's why they want all our houses.
(electronic whirring)
They were digging.
TUCK:
Yo, Alex, I know what you're thinking.
Alex!
Alex, man!
Th-The only way that thing can take off is to come up out of the ground through us.
That's a really bad idea.
MUNCH:
Dude, what are you doing?
TUCK:
This is not just about us anymore.
It's about other people now, a whole community still asleep in their beds.
MUNCH:
Let's just think this through first.
-I trust him.
-EMMA:
Listen to us.

-We can't leave.

What about everyone up here that's gonna die?

Dude, say something!

Dude, this is amazing.
I think you're gonna want to get this.
TUCK:
Oh!
(whirring)
(rumbling)
(birds singing, car alarms blaring)
We did it, dude.
We did it.
(dogs barking in distance, car alarms continue blaring)
Dude, it...
Did you see that?
Did you see...
-Wow.
We did that!
-You're like...
That's insane.
We just did that!
That's...
Look, come on.
Look, look, people want to know what happened.
(shouting in distance)
If we told them what happened, they wouldn't believe us.
MUNCH:
Guys, it's morning.
Oh, crap, I gotta get home.
-My dad is gonna kill me.
-EMMA:
I think I need a ride.
ALEX:
We should go because people, they'll start asking--
Hey, buddy...
Did you guys feel that earthquake?
-Were you okay?
-No, Mom, I'm fine.
-Let me see.
-He's fine.
Honey, he's fine.
Did no one just see the giant spaceship?
!
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah, a spaceship.
What just happened?
!
JANICE:
Oh, oh, okay, okay.
I know it's been really hard lately,
-and we've all been really overwhelmed.
-Just...
Why don't we... why don't we just go in and relax.
Maybe we can, um, go get that-that pizza we talked about.
-All right?
Yeah.
-Pizza?
-If we don't play along,
-Yeah, his mom saw the ship.
-nobody's gonna get it okay?
-How could I play along?
-So just...
-Yes, I'm sure.
I found them here at Alex's.
Yeah, yeah.
ALEX'S DAD:
Uh, no, no.
Actually, uh, we found him here.
TUCK'S DAD:
I thought he was staying with you.
ALEX'S DAD:
No, I was told they were at Munch's.
I'll call you back, babe.
Yeah, yeah, they were at my house.
We-we played this game where you play as a guy with the soul of a dragon, and it had really good voices.
The voices were great, so...
JANICE:
Who's this?
That's Emma.
I'm, uh, he's my boyfriend.
I mean, friend who's a boy.
-ALEX:
Um...
-TUCK:
Awkward.
She's hot, right?
JANICE:
Knock it off, you.
¶ ¶
TUCK (voice-over):
Six hours later, Alex moved.
I just got grounded for, like, life.
(chuckles) Me, too.
TUCK:
Might as well move now.
Not gonna be seeing anyone for a while.
ALEX:
Yeah.
But this... what really happened tonight-- no one knows but us.
ALEX'S DAD:
Hey, Alex!
Time to go, buddy.
¶ ¶
I'm gonna miss you guys.
You guys smell really bad.
(chuckling)
TUCK (voice-over):
Our last night together, we did a lot.
A whole lot.
But there's some things we couldn't do.
Alex's parents had already bought a new home.
Most of the neighborhood had.
Munch's, too.
So, one by one, people started to move.
My parents hadn't, so we got to stay.
New people started moving in, and Mulberry Wood started again, but not the one that had my friends in it.
When you're a kid, you think you're invisible.
You think you can't make a difference.
We're not kids anymore.
We know now... that we can do anything.
¶ ¶
Having a friend light-years away taught us that distance is just a state of mind.
If you're best friends, then you always will be no matter where you are in the universe.

ALEX:
Guys, my just...
my phone just...
You guys got to see this.
(rumbling)
(electronic warbling)
Hey, hey, Tuck, dude.
- Okay, we're rolling.
- Okay, hold on.
Before you go, look-look at my coat.
- It's cool, huh?
- What is that?
Can we do another take with it on, though?
No.
Okay.
(CLEARS THROAT) TUCK:
Ready when you are.
(SNIFFS) Okay.
How do I smell?
Or I mean, look, or you know?
Yeah, you can't smell a video.
Okay.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Ruckus, dude, you got to get out of here.
(BARKS)
Hi, I'm Reginald.
I don't really get friends much, but it's probably because I'm a bit of... an acquired taste.
That's what my mom says.
And I'm sure whatever school I'm forced to go to no one will acquire it.
So... thanks for paving a road over, really, the only place I've ever had any real friends.
Okay.
We good?
TUCK:
- Uh, say your name.
- I thought you knew my name.
You know what I mean;
for the video.
Dude, we've been hanging out for years.
- Come on.
- Dude, stop fronting.
Just tell the camera.
You're upset, right?
You don't want to move.
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) I've never gone a day without seeing my friends.
They're, like, the only people in the world who get me.
And now it's just all over, you know?
Good luck finding that again.
So wherever Munch is going, man...
Look, you people listen to me, all right?
He's a really good kid.
So don't just assume that he's weird and that's it.
And Alex, man...
He's a foster kid.
He's been moved all over.
I mean, it's like, why do you have to build a freeway right through?
You know, can't you just go around or something?
You're going along feeling like your own person with your own friends, and then something like this comes along that you have no power to stop because you're just a kid.
(SCOFFS)
You're just a kid.
(PHONE RINGS)
Yeah, hey, man.
(SNIFFS)
Yeah, yeah, I'm up, I'm up.
Whoa, whoa, man, slow down.
What's the problem?
Yeah, my phone's good.
Why?
What happened?
Wait, what?
(CLICK)
(VOICE-OVER) This is when everything started to change.
So, being me,
I kept filming.
I'm Tuck.
What you're about to see happened to me and my best friends one year ago.
This is the story of our last week together.
(STATIC BUZZES, CRACKLES) Phones all over our neighborhood are freaking out.
We've done everything we could possibly do with this phone.
We threw it at the wall, we took it to the phone guy, we took it to the store where we got it from, and they say it's a problem.
So you know it's serious.
It looks like your phone basically barfed on the screen.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I was just eating dinner, and all of a sudden, all the phones in the house just did this.
At exactly the same time.
Dude.
What?
It's freaky.
(PHONE RINGS)
- De hello?
- Hey, Alex.
Oh, Munch, you're outside.
MUNCH:
Get over here, over here, down the street.
TUCK:
Ask him if his phone barfed yet.
ALEX:
Did your phone barf yet?
- Phones are still working.
ALEX:
- Cool.
Keep going, and we'll meet you in the backyard.
Okay, copy that.
I'll take swift steps.
TUCK : (VOICE-OVER) When I look back at that day,
I realize the clues were all around us.
(CHUCKLES) We had no idea.
Dude, they all still work.
See?
(PANTING)
Dude, you know if this whole thing works,
- these phones are done.
- No, I know.
I have 14 spares; it's okay.
(PHONE CHIRPS)
(SCOFFS) I bet you do.
Okay.
All right, anyways, let's spread out.
- Okay.
- Alex, go by the gate.
Munch, go on the far end,
- Yeah, I got it, and I'll stay right here by my camera.
- Just watch out!
- Okay, okay.
Okay, it's good.
It's good...
It's good... (STATIC SCREECHING) Whoa, okay, it went out.
TUCK:
Whoa, whoa, it barfed!
All right, people, if you go to Alex's house, your phones will spew chunks all over his screen.
My mom said the Murphys' phones and the Churleys' changed, too.
So what do you think this is?
TUCK:
Whoa!
(TUCK CHUCKLES) (DOORBELL RINGS)
(TUCK GROANS)
These dudes.
(LOW, INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Hi.
- Is that on?
- I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Oh.
We had an electrical short over at the site, and it may be disrupting people's phone service, and we're wondering if that happened
- to anybody in this house?
- Oh, no, my phone is good.
- 'Cause we're offering new phone vouchers
- Uh-huh.
In exchange for any device in this area here
- that may be displaying
- That's weird, that's weird.
- Faulty messages or images?
- I don't know.
See you.
No, listen, I...
Okay, so you-you really don't think this is a little bit weird?
These dudes come here to build a freeway
- and now they want our phones?
- Well, I think it's gonna work.
No.
Clean your room.
Oh, my...
I'm not gonna have a room if we don't do something.
- Right, I think...
- No, Mom, seriously.
These guys want our houses.
Maybe if we expose them for illegal property, then...
TUCK:
- Yo!
- Aw, you don't like how things are, do you?
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
(ELECTRONIC CHIME) Dude, it's a map to the desert.
Like, what is that?
What do we do with this?
I guess most maps are made to be followed.
Exactly.
It could go to, like, some crazy headquarters, and we find out that these construction clowns are spies and we expose them to the world.
It's 20 miles away.
What...
No, we're not...
we're not gonna go.
No, obviously not.
Look, whatever it is, this Saturday, we're going to sneak behind our parents' backs and find out.
I'm moving Saturday.
All right, all right, so Friday night.
Our last night together?
It doesn't have to be;
that's what I'm saying.
Like, I don't want to move, and these clowns are making us do it.
Maybe we can stop them.
Now, are you in?
Yeah, all right.
- All right.
- I'm in.
Munch, don't you bail out on us now.
Dude, I'm not.
Me?
No... pfft!
I'm in.
Yeah!
All right!
That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, all right.
Bring it in.
- Oh, oops!
- Munch!
So, why would you be organizing your ketchups?
- Because.
- Who does that?
So I can get to them easier, and then it's more organized,
- and it's better.
- And you are my friend.
Guys, guys, it's time to practice the big lie.
Hey, Mom, I'm spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a neat, brand-new video game.
And I'm sleeping over at Tuck's house so we can play a new video game.
And I'm sleeping in your mom's bed,
- not playing a video game.
- Oh, my God, all right, dude.
Stop talking about my mother, thank you.
All right, the camera's are gonna be on 24 hours a day, nonstop.
Dude, can you stop touching, please?
It attaches to my bike, and it's also a pretty good way to get footage on the fly.
Spy glasses.
I love these;
I love them.
And last, camera, but definitely not least...
What up, camcorder?
Keeping it tight.
Looking pretty good these days.
Tuck, these are the ugliest things I've ever seen.
Dude, what?
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Those are...
They're sweet.
- The camera's undetectable,
- Wow.
- And the ladies love them.
- Prove it.
Prove it?
(SCOFFS)
This guy, all right?
Give me my glasses, man.
Those are stealth.
Now I'm gonna prove to you guys spy glasses get you girls.
MUNCH:
Oh, my gosh, he's going over there.
- I can't see who he's talking to.
- Shut up, Munch.
TUCK:
Uh, hi, uh...
Hey, um, Em-Emma, right?
Emma?
I was just... (TUCK SPUTTERS)
Okay, uh, can I borrow a piece of paper, please?
MUNCH:
He has something.
- I can't see who he got it from.
- We're about to see right now.
Look, look, look, look.
He has a paper.
ALEX:
You did not get her number.
Totally got her number.
Right there.
You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.
You, too, you're a sellout.
No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.
Yes, I did.
Mannequin Girl?
(ALEX LAUGHS)
What kind of name is that?
What?
That's what I call her.
I think mannequins are hot.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING) TUCK:
I'll leave my house at 6:00.
15 minutes later, I pick up Alex.
- Munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Tonight, we're no longer boys.
We're men.
(GRUNTS)
TUCK:
- Dude, what the...?
- I didn't see you, man.
(TUCK SIGHS)
ALEX:
Tuck, you all right?
Let's go.
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) Our whole lives we've been nobodies.
In visible.
The good kids.
(CHUCKLES) Not anymore.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
All right, Ma.
I'm leaving.
Spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a new video game.
Have whatever you want, honey.
(CONVERSATION CONTINUES) (TUCK SIGHS)
You know what, I lied, actually.
We're gonna ride our bikes out into the desert at night alone.
Without supervision.
We got that;
we're going to state.
Okay, see you then, sweetie.
- We could go.
- Also rob a bank.
- All the way.
State.
- What?
TUCK:
Go to Mexico.
Maybe even start a new life.
- Right, I know.
- Wrestling!
TUCK'S MOM:
You're trying to act like I don't know what I'm talking about.
(CONVERSATION AND LAUGHTER CONTINUE)
What's up, Stumpy?
Yo, man, I told you to stop to calling me that.
You know what, man, look, my girl's throwing this huge party later tonight, if you want to come by.
(ENGINE STARTS)
You serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
Because not a lady in the world can resist a natty old BMX bike.
What's the zero to 60 on that bad boy, huh?
Two, three days?
(TIRES SQUEALING, ENGINE RUMBLING)
(HUMMING)
Come on, come on, dude, you ready?
Let's go.
(LAUGHS) I can't even tell a difference.
This looks exactly the way it looked before you packed.
All your stuff fitting in one box?
What are you, a drifter?
Who told you?
Look, all I'm saying is, when you get to your new house, put a poster up, put some shelves on the wall, frame a photo.
Look, there's a painting right there.
Put something on a shelf...
That's not a painting.
That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt, smudged it and called it art.
I'm going to Munch's house to play a video game, all right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure, buddy.
- Bye, Dylan.
- Have fun with your friends.
- Hey, hey, Tuck.
TUCK:
- How are you?
Uh, good luck with the move to New York, buddy.
- Maybe we'll come see you.
- All right, cool.
The moving truck is coming at 10:00.
Make sure you're back, okay?
TUCK:
I don't get it.
If your foster parents already have a baby of their own, why do they need you?
There's no sense in having two babies.
- Shut up, dude.
- One baby cries all the time, the other one listens to indie rock.
Let's go.
(ALEX WHOOPING) (TUCK HUMMING)
ALEX:
Yeow!
WOMAN:
Guys, would you please help my son with his room, before I go crazy?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I don't think he's started...
Honey, have you even started packing your room?
MUNCH:
I told you a thousand times,
I'm alphabetizing!
(ALEX CHUCKLES)
TUCK:
Yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.
Shh.
(DOOR CREAKS)
(VIDEO PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)
MAN: (ON VIDEO) ...they're flexible, they're "dynamical, "
they can be curved, they can bend, and this opens up a whole new universe of possibilities, and one of the possibilities is that there can be shortcuts through space and through time.
So that's really just what a Wormhole is.
It's taking advantage... (BOYS WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
(SCREAMING)
What are you...
Aah!
- Why don't you stop doing that?
!
- I'm sorry!
You guys are gonna give me a heart attack one day.
- I'm sorry.
- Turn that off, dude.
(MUTTERING)
(BEEPING) I created a substation for each of our parents' phones that's wired to the router, which is wired to the transmitter, which transmits to the receiver, which is...
- my phone.
TUCK:
- Okay, so basically, no matter who our parents call, it goes to your phone.
Yeah.
My mom's friends always say that I sound just like my mom, you know,
- when I pick up the phone...
- Yeah.
So I figured, I can be Betty.
(COMPUTERS AND GADGETS BEEPING)
ALEX:
Bye, Betty.
Thank you.
Um, I'm going to Alex's...
or Munch's... or Tuck's house, and we're gonna play a video game and sleep over.
BETTY:
Wait, what's all that stuff?
Honey?
(SIGHS)
ALEX:
Good job, Munch.
You did it.
TUCK:
Here we come.
17.6 miles.
(TUCK HUMMING HAPPILY)
♪ Going to the desert... ♪
Munch, what are you doing?
Guys, guys, just hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Dude...
- I'm not backing out or anything,
- He wants to quit right when we - ...just hear me out.
- Been waiting for this forever.
- Dude, listen, come on, okay.
This is crazy what we're doing.
Dude, I don't want to punk out or back out or anything... it's just, my mom, you know, she just got divorced.
- Munch...
- She's already had enough guys lying to her.
If you didn't want to come, then why didn't you tell us earlier?
TUCK:
You do understand this is our last night together.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Look, Munch, if we don't go now, we'll never go.
We won't even be here.
This is our last chance to try and do something.
Even-even if it is stupid.
- Yeah.
- You know what,
I say we put a vote to it.
All in favor raise your hand.
Well, now I have to raise my hand.
Munch, just...
Fine, fine.
Okay, whatever.
I'll go.
But only under one condition.
TUCK:
- I call the black!
ALEX:
- Mine!
No, no, give it!
MUNCH:
It's so weird, no one's gonna be in these houses next week.
ALEX:
Dude, you're so full of it.
- When did you kiss her?
TUCK:
- Dude, trust me.
After pre-algebra, she pulled me into the bathroom.
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Mannequin Girl?
TUCK:
- Yeah!
- Was she good at it?
TUCK:
Uh, eh, B minus.
You know, I've kissed better in better locations.
No, how do I know you're not lying?
TUCK:
Trust me.
I don't even have to reply to you.
- You're last!
MUNCH:
- Hey, you got a head start!
That's not fair!
TUCK:
Oh, so what, there's a Wing Stop?
I never been to a Wing Stop.
(BIRDS SQUAWKING)
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) We followed a map out in the middle of nowhere.
MUNCH:
It might be, like, a CIA prison.
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) We were miles from home.
(BOYS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
No one in the world knew it.
No one said it... but we were scared.
ALEX:
We haven't seen a car in, like, half an hour.
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) We were on our own.
MUNCH:
This-this is the way, right?
You have the map, right?
- Can I see the map?
ALEX:
- Left.
MUNCH:
Left?
Are you sure?
Because right looks a little bit more promising.
(COYOTES HOWLING, YIPPING) Did you guys hear that?
ALEX:
Just a couple more miles.
(STEADY ELECTRONIC PULSING)
TUCK:
Hold on.
What is that?
It's the map.
TUCK:
Are we close?

I never understood why people like the outdoors.

Will you stop freaking out?

Let's go, man.

We're almost there.
Come on.

Oh.

What?

What do you think it is?
How would I know?
TUCK:
Why does it look all burnt?
MUNCH:
Hey, just be careful.
- Careful!
- Yeah, don't touch that thing.
Could be...
MUNCH:
Could be...
I don't know, I don't know.
A part of a satellite?
TUCK:
All right, all right, um, Munch, film me while I'm...
- while I'm touching this thing.
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Let me try it.
Thank you.
It's dusty.
It's a piece of crap.
MUNCH:
What?
Forget about it.
Just turn off the camera.
MUNCH:
Well, it's not a national treasure, but it could be used for something.
(TUCK SCOFFS) It's crap.
What happened to filming 'cause it's our last night, huh?
Um, in case you haven't noticed, obviously, the map led to squat.
ALEX:
Got it.
So all you cared about was getting your stupid hits on your stupid video?
- Dude, why don't you just...
MUNCH:
- Whoa, guys, guys, guys.
Come on!
I know we're all frustrated... (PHONE RINGING, GASPS) It's Alex's mom.
TUCK:
- Are you serious?
ALEX:
- Um, it'll be fine.
Just, um, be Betty, okay?
- Oh, man.
MUNCH:
- Oh, crap.
Yo, I thought I could do this, but I can't.
Maybe you can answer it.
She just likes to check up on things, okay?
All right. (GASPS)
WOMAN:
Betty, are you there?
(WHISPERING) Go.
This is Betty.
WOMAN:
I was thinking maybe I could bring over some pizzas?
TUCK:
Dude, go.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No coming over.
- Just hang up.
- No way.
No, it's really no trouble.
We have a coupon.
- I said no!
No pizzas!
- What?
- No, uh...
TUCK:
- Don't yell at her, man.
Maybe you and your husband should go to bed.
TUCK:
Stop saying words!
ALEX'S MOM:
Are you sure everything's okay?
Have a good night.
Go to sleep.
(LINE DISCONNECTS, BEEPS)
(CHUCKLES) That could've gone better.
TUCK:
That was horrible.
"Your husband should go to sleep"?
Was that really something smart to say?
Munch.
Don't look at me like I'm a hoarder.
That's rude.
(DISTANT VOICES)
ALEX: (WHISPERING) Who are they?

I don't...
I don't know.

Get down, get down.
Turn your flashlight off, dummy.
Let's go.

Why would they be out this far?
TUCK:
Who cares?
The night's blown.
(STATIC CRACKLES)
- Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
(PANTING)
ALEX:
Munch?
(CHUCKLES)
- You're a character.
- There's something in there!
ALEX:
What?
TUCK:
Dude, are you kidding me right now?
MUNCH:
Something is in that bag.
It touched me.
TUCK:
Go check.
MUNCH:
Be-be careful.
(HARSH SCREECHING)
TUCK:
- What?
- Did it poke you, too?
TUCK:
What, dude?
Say something!
What did you see?
There-There's something in there.
Yeah, a bunch of crap Munch brought.
(CHUCKLES)
- You guys are funny.
- All I know is it beeped.
You know, why don't you go in there and just see.
TUCK:
Beeped?
What are you talking about?
Babies.
I'll do it myself.
Dang, how much stuff do you have in your bag, dude?
Geez.
Oh, boy, are you guys talking about this?
It's garbage.
It's nothing.
What are you talking about, you heard something?
It made a noise.
Hey, hey, do something!
See, it's not doing anything.
What are you talking about?
Beep.
(SNARLING, SNAPPING)
(TUCK LAUGHS)
Do that again, do that again.
Do what again?
Do what you just did.
Beep.
(SNARLING, SNAPPING)
Whoa, hold on.
Let me...
Let me try this for myself.
Beep.
Beep?
Why is it making noise only for you and not me?
Make it beep again.
Beep.

This is it!
It's a bomb!
(FADING INTO DISTANCE) No, no, oh, God, no!
No, no, no!

Guys, I think...
I think it might have defused.
I don't know.
TUCK:
Man, nothing's happening.
All right, hold on, hold on.
I got an idea.
MUNCH:
Tuck!
What?
MUNCH:
Okay, it didn't do anything, but just don't do it again.
Are you insane, Tuck?
!
Are you sure you guys know what you're doing?
TUCK:
Yes, trust me.
When it's a bomb, you have to act quick.
I seen it on some TV show or some movie or something.
ALEX:
- Saw what?
- Check it out.
MUNCH:
What are you doing?
!
Disarming it.
MUNCH:
Are you crazy?
!
It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.
That's not what you do with a bomb!
Are you insane?
!
(ELECTRONIC CHIRP, PINGING) What was that?
It's not my phone.
It's the thing, whatever that is.
- What are you talking about?
- It's that.
That's what just made that noise.
(ELECTRONIC PINGING)
I, uh...
It, like, imitated my ring-tone.
TUCK:
This is what made our phones barf?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
ALEX:
Did you hear that?
(STATIC CRACKLES) ALL:
Whoa, whoa.
All right, so, a couple of seconds ago, our phones went crazy.
Bananas, insane.
I don't know what to call it.
Look.
You see that?
It's a new map, but on my phone this time.
To me?
All right, him, or...
Dude, Munch's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and, ugh, I don't even know what that is.
Alex's phone, it just turned on by itself and started filming.
We can't even turn them off.
Oh, don't try to act like it's not cool.
That is weird.
ALEX:
It's showing us where we are.
MUNCH:
And you don't find that creepy?
What do you think that is?
You think that's a road?
We should follow the map.
MUNCH:
How about no.
TUCK:
How about yes?
We wanted a last night together, so what do you call this?
A trap?
MUNCH:
Didn't you guys see the "No Trespassing" sign?
TUCK:
Oops.
I didn't see anything.
(ELECTRONIC TONE PULSING, STUTTERING)
This is where the map says to go.

Did you see that just now?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING) ALEX:
What is that?

What is that?
MUNCH:
- What is that?
- What is that?
- Oh, my...
Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.
ALEX:
It-It's moving.
TUCK:
There's something in there right now.
MUNCH:
What's in there?
Oh, don't tell me.
ALEX:
Are those... eyes?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
Dude, dude, it's looking dead at us right now.
MUNCH:
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
ALEX:
It's trembling like it's hurt.
MUNCH:
Good.
TUCK:
My heart's beating so fast right now.
Wow.
MUNCH:
Almost got us killed, like, three times already.
Yeah, but it was worth it, dude.
Incredible.
All right, so...
I just figured out why Alex's camera was on this whole time.
So this thing, whatever it is, it's eyes are, like, all screwed up, completely.
You see?
So, basically, it uses his phone to see.
That's insane.
(ALEX CHUCKLES)
ALEX: (DISTORTED) You think he can see us right now?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
Munch, you have to check this out.
This is amazing.
(CLICK, ELECTRONIC SNARL)
MUNCH:
Is it?
Is it amazing?
'Cause I think it's scary as balls.
I mean, obviously people are looking for it.
- Munch...
- It has access to our voicemails and our texts and our ringtones.
TUCK:
How do you even know it's a he?
Are you a dude?
(BEEPS)
(CHUCKLES)
Wait... you understood us.
(BEEPS, WARBLES)
Whoa. (CHUCKLES)
All right, here's how it goes.
One beep is yes, two beeps are no.
Watch.
Is one beep yes?
(BEEPS ONCE)
TUCK:
Yo, that's so tight.
Are we in a barn?
(BEEPS ONCE)
Is Munch really a woman?
(BEEPS TWICE)
Oh, come on, man, this thing is broken.
Everybody knows Munch is a woman.
Okay, I have a question.
Are we gonna die tonight?
Why isn't it answering?
What...
Well, that's not good, right?

We're cool like that.
Come on.
Are you hurt?
(BEEPS ONCE)
- Oh.
- He's hurt.
Well, his lights seem brighter, so...
Did that piece help you?
(BEEPS ONCE)
Oh.
Can we help fix you or something?
Or...
Like, what is this?
Are you trying to build something?
(BEEPS ONCE) Oh, he's trying to build...
Building something.
Right there.
- What could he be building?
- Yeah.
So, wait, what are, what are you building?
Lasers?
(BEEPS TWICE)

Hold up, hold up.
So let me get this right.
So you're building a spaceship,
- He's building a spaceship, - and you need our help building the spaceship?
(BEEPS ONCE) Oh, man.
This guy is building a spaceship.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Let me make sure I don't have any plans.
Nope!
We're building a spaceship!
He's building a spaceship.
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) We asked him questions for almost two hours.
Where he came from.
If there were others here like him.
We found out he was lost... and alone.
He was out in the middle of nowhere, on his own, like us.
All we really knew was that he crashed, and now he needed us to rebuild him.
ALEX:
The map says up ahead.
MUNCH:
Are we going the right way?
(HORNS HONKING, DISTORTED)
Look, look, look, look, whatever that is, the map goes to it.
All right, so wait-wait a minute.
Let me get this right.
Dude comes from a million light-years away, and he wants to come here?
I don't know, the map said so.

They broke my girlfriend's lamp!
TUCK:
Wait, what is he doing?
MUNCH:
- Oh.
Whoa, whoa.
TUCK:
- Is that...
OWNER:
Sweet babushka.
(TUCK LAUGHS)
You want to sell it?
- Tuck, let's go!
Come on!
- Run!
What are you waiting for?
TUCK:
Dude, that place was wrecked!
MUNCH:
Sorry again, sir!
ALEX:
Go!
Go!
Down here!
TUCK:
Let's get somewhere so we can look at him.
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
ALEX:
He's shaking.
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
TUCK:
Whoa, he's letting you touch him.
MUNCH:
- I wouldn't, guys.
- Hey, what about here?
Here, set him on here.
(ALEX LAUGHS) MUNCH:
He looks scared.
TUCK:
Yeah, why is he all balled up?
Can't you stand?
You all right?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING) MUNCH:
Maybe he's... maybe he's just shy.
- Ooh, can you fly?
TUCK:
- Can you do X-ray vision?
MUNCH:
How?
He can't see.
ALEX: (CHUCKLES) He doesn't even know where to look.
TUCK:
All right, all right, I think the question is, what can you do?
TUCK:
Okay, so Dr. Nichols is doing a surgical procedure with very sophisticated technology.
Pen caps.
(TUCK LAUGHS)
Clear.
MUNCH:
Wait, I don't get it.
How is that sophisticated?
It's kind of just, like, pen caps.
I got it.
(QUIET ELECTRONIC WARBLING)
TUCK:
Be careful.
His legs are fragile.
(ALEX LAUGHS) MUNCH:
Whoa.
Get this.
Are you getting this?
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
(TUCK LAUGHS)
TUCK:
Oh, that's crazy!
So you can't fly, but you can float.
(ELECTRONIC CHIRP) TUCK:
That is so crazy!
(ALL LAUGHING)
I saw you.
I saw you grinning, man.
Stop trying to pretend like that wasn't cool.
- That was hot.
- This is crazy.
I mean, it's just crazy.
(ELECTRONIC CHIRP) ALEX:
Whoa.
Don't drop it.
Huh.
(ELECTRONIC CHIRP, LOW WHIRRING)
(ZAPS)
(CHIRPS)
Can you see me?
(CHIRPING, PINGING)
(ALEX IMITATES PINGING)
(PINGING) TUCK:
Huh, I think he likes you.
Will you show us where you live?
(CHIRPS) All right.
Beep faster if I'm getting close.
(BEEPING)
(RAPID BEEPING) Is that it, right there?
(QUIET ELECTRONIC WARBLING)
Why don't I go first.
Hi.
Um, my name's Alex, and... you're in...
Munch, no... you're in my hand right now.
You know my ring-tone, which is, like, insane and awesome.
(ELECTRONIC PINGING)
(WHIRRING)
(CHIRPING)
Okay, um...
Hi.
I'm Tuck.
What's up?
I don't even know what to say, but, uh... but, uh, I'm from...
I'm from New York.
Uh, this is Nevada.
I don't even know, like, I like donuts,
- um...
ALEX:
- Donuts?
Really?
Okay, can somebody else do this?
I know, I'm going.
My name's M...
My real name is Reginald, but my friends call me Munch.
I hope we can be friends, too.
(ELECTRONIC CHIRPING) Do you have a name?
Oh, we could call him Beep.
Dude, what-what kind of name is Beep?
Word.
We got to give him a name that's powerful, like... like Master Blaster.
He doesn't blast anything.
Peter.
Peter.
What about Peter?
Something cool, like Space Ninja or something.
MUNCH:
Well, how is there a ninja in space?
He wouldn't be able to breathe.
- All right, all right...
- Dude, you don't know that.
Have you ever been to space?
Which name do you like?
MUNCH:
Uh, Beep.
Why?
(BEEPS)
There it is.
- Hello.
Watch this.
Watch this.
- You can't echo...
Watch this.
Just...
Beep.
(BEEPS) See?
Echo.
(CHIRPS)
That's what we should call it.
Echo.
(CHIRPS)
- Oh, 'cause it echoes.
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Echo, Echo, Echo.
- Echo.
Your name... is Echo.
ECHO: (DISTORTED) Echo...
Echo... (VOICE DISTORTING UNINTELLIGIBLY)
ALEX:
I don't think he's supposed to come out of that cylinder thing.
MUNCH:
He looks... dead.
TUCK: (FAINTLY) Echo?
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) So then we didn't know how broken he was.
(ELECTRONIC CHIRPING)
The crash hurt him worse than we thought.
(WEAK CHIRP) ALEX:
Okay, little guy... where do you want us to go?
(CHIRPS)
(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)
(DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE)
MUNCH:
Guys?
You know this is considered being a burglar, right?
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) With each new piece, he got strong.
And that's what we were gonna do... make him stronger.
(TONE PULSES BRIEFLY)
(WHISPERS) Which way?
Around.
MUNCH:
- In the house?
!
TUCK:
- Dude!
(MUNCH GROANS)
MUNCH:
Maybe we should just knock on the door and...
MAN:
We just need you to listen, sweetheart.
TUCK: (SIGHS)
- Oh, man.
GIRL:
- You're grounding me?
ALEX:
Tuck, what are you doing?
Munch, go.
MAN:
It's the man... the man should choose his dance partner.
GIRL:
It's a stupid tradition.
WOMAN:
Really, it's about meeting new people, and many of those were our friends' sons.
And it's embarrassing when you ignore them.
MEN:
And these are life skills that we are teaching you.
MUNCH:
- Tuck, get back.
- Putting on this dress for you doesn't change me into some perfect little homecoming queen!
MAN:
Okay, no one's asking you to act like a homecoming queen.
WOMAN:
It's at least three years away.
MUNCH:
Now.
Go, go, go.
WOMAN: ...by the company you keep.
It's a cliché for a reason.
I'm sure this all seems...
MUNCH:
Guys, what are we doing?
We're gonna be trapped up here.
TUCK:
Everybody be quiet.
(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING) (WOMAN CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)
GIRL:
Yeah, everyone!
(WOMAN AND MAN CONTINUE INDISTINCTLY)
TUCK:
You got to be kidding me.
Aw, you know what?
Everyone just follow me, all right?
Don't look at anything.
Just hurry.
- Hey, Tuck, did you see this?
- No, don't...
Dude, Tuck, this is Mannequin Girl's house.
Now we can ask for permission to steal stuff, 'cause, you know, you guys are kissing buddies.
Aw, man...
TUCK:
It was a couple of days ago.
She probably forgot about it by now, you know?
Like, yeah, it's...
yeah, she probably forgot.
- How would she forget about it?
- I almost forgot about it... (DEEP RUMBLING)
TUCK:
- Oh, boy, get ready.
- Uh-oh.
Close the door.
Close the door.
(RUMBLING, CLATTERING)
- Guys...
- Dude, we just got to keep it from going crazy.
It's gonna get loud.
We'll catch it in a blanket.
- What?
(GASPS)
- Whoa!
- Get down!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Stop letting it move!
MUNCH:
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
GIRL:
How to unfold a napkin?
!
- Who cares!
MAN:
- Fine!
GIRL:
And in no time in my life am I gonna be somewhere
- that even plays the foxtrot!
TUCK:
- Close the door.
(LOW ELECTRONIC WARBLE) Yo, put it away, man.
ALEX:
Shh.
Be quiet.
(DOOR OPENS) GIRL:
What the...?
Wait, I know you.
Hey.
It's okay.
(GASPS)
Hey, hey, hey, we're with Tuck.
Tuck Simms.
You know?
Remember you guys kissed?
- We what?
- Yeah, what are you talking about, huh?
Why is my room destroyed?
Why are you filming this?
(ELECTRONIC CHIRPING)
- And what is that?
- Um, it's a... it's a car muffler.
No.
I want to know what that is.
MUNCH:
It's actually a spaceship.
- Munch!
- Sorry.
Uh, well, we-we were following maps, and it just happened to lead here, so we were trying to help our friend Echo...
well, he's an alien
TUCK:
- Oh, God...
- ...that we're trying to get him on a ship.
See, look, it used to have six symbols, but now it has three, so that means we're almost there.
Crazy, right?
ALEX:
Munch, will you shut up?
An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?
ALEX:
- Nope.
TUCK:
- No, no.
(ECHO CHIRPS "NO")
(ELECTRONIC CHIRPING)
- You did not just see that.
- Yeah, I did.
MUNCH:
Yeah, she definitely saw it.
GIRL:
- Wait.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, I want to go.
- Really?
Sounds great.
ALEX:
What?
No.
- Dude...
- You're not part of our group, so why don't you just go play with your super rich friends...
TUCK:
That's kind of harsh and your ball gowns and just go eat steak or something.
GIRL:
- What the hell?
TUCK:
- Go, go, go.
(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE)
TUCK:
Dang, dude, what was that upstairs?
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you so mad.
MUNCH:
Yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.
ALEX:
All right, let's just...
don't talk about...
Nothing happened in there, all right?
TUCK:
You know, they say the girls you argue with are the ones you like.
(ALEX SIGHS)
ALEX:
Don't go there, Bro.
(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING) Tuck, it's over there.
TUCK:
Wait, it wants us to go to a bar?
Man, I say we climb in a window or find a door.
There's got to be another way.
MUNCH:
Um, before-before we go...
I really need to get the pee out of my body.
(TUCK GROANS) Let's just hope the next place isn't a bank.
(ECHO BEEPING)
TUCK:
I can't believe you told that girl to get lost.
- You're so dramatic.
ALEX:
- What about you?
You invented a whole kiss, didn't you?
Uh, first of all, for your info, it's called aspirational thinking.
You're thinking it one moment, you're living it the next.
- How's that working out?
MAN:
- Oh, excuse me.
(INDISTINCT RADIO COMMUNICATION)
(GASPS)
TUCK:
Go to the bikes.
MUNCH:
Oh, God, oh, God.
TUCK:
- Why is the construction man...
- Shut...
MAN:
- Excuse me.
TUCK:
- Aw...
Hey.
I know you guys.
You're the guys... you're from the construction site, right?
Uh, with the, uh, with the camera?
Whoa-ho, wait, wait.
Why aren't you guys at home right now?
You guys weren't riding your bikes out around the desert, were you?
- No, of course not.
MUNCH:
- Yes.
Uh, no.
That doesn't sound too... clear.
MUNCH:
- Uh...
GIRL:
- Thank God.
There you are.
TUCK:
- What?
MAN:
- Who-who are you?
Who am I?
(DRAMATIC SOBBING) Who am I?
Exactly!
It's like I don't even know anymore.
My mom had to drag my dad from the bar... again!
TUCK:
- What?
- He likes to go there more than he likes to tuck in his own kids at night.
At least that's what my mom says.
MUNCH:
What's she talking about?
That's her.
Eating a burrito.
She east when she's stressed.
I ask myself if that's gonna be me one day.
What do you think?
Is it?
We make mistakes and we get married and we go to bars.
And these... these are my only friends in the world,
- 'cause they see me TUCK:
- Uh... for who I really am.
MAN:
That's your mom over there?
- Do you want to meet her?
- No.
No.
No, no.
Just get home safe!
Told you guys I wanted to go.
(ECHO CHIRPS "OH...!") TUCK:
What the...?
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) Okay, so this girl, man, she'd been tailing us since her house, spying on us like some creepy stalker.
- She'd overheard our whole plan.
- She... she's crazy.
ALEX:
- I need the bag!
- I think I like it.
(ENGINE REVS)
(MUSIC BLARING) ALEX:
Oh, boy, get ready.
TUCK:
All right, try to blend in.
Look old.
WOMAN:
That must've been some good fake I.D.'s.
MAN:
What's up, baby face?
What are you doing in here, little man?
Oh, uh, I, uh...
- Are you Randy's kid?
TUCK:
- Uh,
- yes, he is.
- Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's my dad... or mom.
- You know, dad.
Mom.
- Okay, dude, just go.
Hurry up.
(ECHO WARBLING)
ALEX:
Emma?
Emma?
I was hanging out with this really pretty chick.
She's almost as pretty as you.
I mean... you're not pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.
Come over here.
Hop up on that stool.
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Oh, and one for his buddy here, too.
TUCK:
No, no, I'm all right.
Seriously, I'm all right.
- Sure, you'll like it.
- Sorry, I'm a...
I'm allergic.
Oh, you're gonna love it.
- Uh, no, no.
- You're gonna get one.
So, what happens next?
- Just give me back my bag.
- No.
Give it.
I'm serious.
Give me the bag.
Why are you being mean to me?
- Here, honey.
TUCK:
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
MUNCH:
Wow, a lot of people with beards and mustaches in here, you know?
(DEEP RUMBLING, RATTLING)

You don't understand.
Whenever you get close to the next piece, it goes crazy.

(EXCITED CHATTER) (WHOOPS)
Do you guys just go around town breaking stuff?
TUCK:
Just keep running!
Go, go!
EMMA:
What was that?
I think the ship's trying to take off!
(WHIRRING, CLICKING) TUCK:
Whoa, whoa!
(ALEX LAUGHING)
TUCK:
Are you seeing this?
This thing is flying a ship... in your backpack?
I think he's getting better.
MUNCH:
Oh.
So, you don't know how he crashed, or when, or why he came here with a spaceship in the first place?
Look, he only answers yes or no... it's not that simple.
Is this how I talk to him?
(ECHO CHIRPING)
So, you crashed.
(CHIRPS ONCE)
Did someone cause you to crash?
(CHIRPS ONCE) ALEX:
Dude, what's she doing?
TUCK:
- I don't know.
- Someone on Earth?
(CHIRPS ONCE)
Do you think they're looking for you?
(CHIRPS ONCE)
It's not those guys in trucks from the convenience store, is it?
(CHIRPS, CHITTERS) TUCK:
The construction man?
MUNCH:
Those are the guys that shot you down?
TUCK:
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We got to take a step back.
This is way bigger and shadier than before, okay?
This is not good.
If those dudes are looking for Echo, they're looking for us, you know?

ALEX:
The map says up ahead.
MUNCH:
This map's confusing.
I was a mind ninja back there...
EMMA:
- So, what was it like kissing me?
- Give me my camera.
Did your legs get all wobbly?
(TUCK SCOFFS)
Was there soft music playing?
Please remind me, Tuck.
I totally forgot.
- What was it like?
- You're close.
Is this your first imaginary kiss?
TUCK:
The map says for us to go inside.
EMMA:
I'm confused.
- Huh?
- Didn't you guys kiss?
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) Anyway, the point is,
Emma was being annoying...
she kept walking off with Echo like she owned him, and talking to him about
I don't know what, I don't even know.
You know what?
Delete.
TUCK:
Man, are we sure there's no security guards or...
You know, that door wasn't even looked.
Hey, uh, guys, I was just thinking, you know,
I... haven't got to actually hold the, you know, the ship, before we did the thing, so can I do it?
- You know, before it gets crazy?
EMMA:
- Sure, but... it's not a ship.
TUCK:
What?
What are you talking about?
He told us it was a ship.
It's a key to your ship, right?
(ECHO CHIRPS)
(LOW ELECTRONIC WARBLING)
Well, if this is just the key, where's the spaceship?
(CLATTERING, CRACKLING) All right, Munch, put it down.
(ECHO CHIRPS) Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.
TUCK:
Okay, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to put it down
- before you hurt both of us.
- I need this, man.

There's a guard in there, you know?
You can't just go running in, acting crazy.
We need a plan, or...

Those are felonies, kid.

- All right, you know what?
Calm down, because if people would've listened to me, then Alex never would have gotten caught.
Didn't I say there would be security guards?
Alex!
Dude!
You're all right!
Are you all right?
Hey, Alex, we're good, man.
All right?
MUNCH:
- Buddy?
- We're good, man?
TUCK:
Alex.
Come on, dude.
Alex!
We could've gone home, but we didn't.
- We were outside.
- Turn off the camera.
Not till you admit you're acting mopey for no reason.
You're always freaking out if anyone's gonna leave you behind.
TUCK:
Do you know how expensive that is?
ALEX:
I'm glad I'm moving.
You were never my friend.

Is that right?

Have you lost your mind?
TUCK: (VOICE-OVER) I acted like I didn't know what I'd done.
But I knew exactly.
MUNCH:
I know we're all tired and stuff, and hungry.
I saw this awesome diner.
We can totally just go grab
- a bite to eat or something.
EMMA:
- Real awesome, guys.
Real macho.

So, that's it?
The night's over?
Doesn't have to be.
Right?
Well, I mean, if it is, uh, we could...
I don't know, I guess we can keep the mood going, yeah?
Or we can do it another time, right?
Good times, the continuation, part two.
Right?
(TUCK SCOFFS)
(SIGHS) Hmm.
You know what?
I'm gonna talk about Sandra.
Man, that girl used to beat the crap out of you.
Me, too.
We were both little, small and scrawny.
She was a big girl, and she knew it.
But then I had a growth spurt, and you didn't, and I finally did something.
You remember that?
You told herl had polio.
Yeah, I told her that, and did she beat you up after that?
MUNCH:
She still beat me up.
'Cause I always get your back, man.
I never let you down;
I always get your back.
(TUCK SIGHS)
Most of the time.
Just when I'm not freaked out about security guards, all right?
I'm sorry, man.

Hi, I'm Reginald.
I don't really get friends much, but it's probably because I'm a bit of... an acquired taste.
That's what my mom says.
And I'm sure whatever school I'm forced to go to no one will acquire it.
So... thanks for paving a road over, really, the only place I've ever had any real friends.

for the video.
Dude, we've been hanging out for years.

What's the problem?
Yeah, my-my phone's good.
Why?
What happened?
Wait, what?
This is when everything started to change.
So, being me,
I kept filming.
I'm Tuck.
What you're about to see happened to me and my best friends one year ago.
This is the story of our last week together.
Phones all over our neighborhood are freaking out.
We've done everything we could possibly do with this phone.
We threw it at the wall, we took it to the phone guy, we took it to the store where we got it from, and they say it's a problem.
So you know it's serious.
It looks like your phone basically barfed on the screen.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I was just eating dinner, and all of a sudden, all the phones in the house just did this.
At exactly the same time.
Dude.
What?
It's freaky.
- De hello?
- Hey, Alex.
Oh, Munch, you're outside.
Get over here, over here, down the street.
Ask him if his phone barfed yet.
Did your phone barf yet?
- Phones are still working.
- Cool.
Keep going, and we'll meet you in the backyard.
Okay, copy that.
I'll take swift steps.
When I look back at that day,
I realize the clues were all around us.
We had no idea.
Dude, they all still work.
See?
Dude, you know if this whole thing works,
- these phones are done.
- No, I know.
I have 14 spares; it's okay.
- I bet you do.
- Okay.
All right, anyways, let's spread out.
- Okay.
- Alex, go by the gate.
Munch, go on the far end,
- Yeah, I got it.
- And I'll stay right here by my camera.
- Just watch out!
- Okay, okay.
Okay, it's good.
It's good...
It's good...
Whoa, okay, it went out.
Whoa, whoa, it barfed!
All right, people, if you go to Alex's house, your phones will spew chunks all over his screen.
My mom said the Murphys' phones and the Churleys' changed, too.
So what do you think this is?
Whoa!
These dudes.
Hi.
- Is that on?
- I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Oh.
We had an electrical short over at the site, and it may be disrupting people's phone service, and we're wondering if that happened
- to anybody in this house?
- Oh, no, my phone is good.
- 'Cause we're offering new phone vouchers
- Uh-huh.
In exchange for any device in this area here
- that may be displaying
- That's weird, that's weird.
- Faulty messages or images?
- I don't know.
See you.
No, listen, I...
Okay, so you-you really don't think this is a little bit weird?
These dudes come here to build a freeway
- and now they want our phones?
- Well, I think it's gonna work.
No.
Clean your room.
Oh, my...
I'm not gonna have a room if we don't do something.
- Right, I think...
- No, Mom, seriously.
These guys want our houses.
Maybe if we expose them for illegal property, then...
- Yo!
- Aw, you don't like how things are, do you?
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
Dude, it's a map to the desert.
Like, what is that?
What do we do with this?
I guess most maps are made to be followed.
Exactly.
It could go to, like, some crazy headquarters, and we find out that these construction clowns are spies and we expose them to the world.
It's 20 miles away.
What...
No, we're not...
we're not gonna go.
No, obviously not.
Look, whatever it is, this Saturday, we're going to sneak behind our parents' backs and find out.
I'm moving Saturday.
All right, all right, so Friday night.
Our last night together?
It doesn't have to be;
that's what I'm saying.
Like, I don't want to move, and these clowns are making us do it.
Maybe we can stop them.
Now, are you in?
Yeah, all right.
- All right.
- I'm in.
Munch, don't you bail out on us now.
Dude, I'm not.
Me?
No... pfft!
I'm in.
Yeah!
All right!
That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, all right.
Bring it in.
- Oh, oops!
- Munch!
So, why would you be organizing your ketchups?
- Because.
- Who does that?
So I can get to them easier, and then it's more organized,
- and it's better.
- And you are my friend.
Guys, guys, it's time to practice the big lie.
Hey, Morn, I'm spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a neat, brand-new video game.
And I'm sleeping over at Tuck's house so we can play a new video game.
And I'm sleeping in your mom's bed,
- not playing a video game.
- Oh, my God, all right, dude.
Stop talking about my mother, thank you.
All right, the camera's are gonna be on 24 hours a day, nonstop.
Dude, can you stop touching, please?
It attaches to my bike, and it's also a pretty good way to get footage on the fly.
Spy glasses.
I love these;
I love them.
And last, camera, but definitely not least...
What up, camcorder?
Keeping it tight.
Looking pretty good these days.
Tuck, these are the ugliest things I've ever seen.
Dude, what?
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Those are...
They're sweet.
- The camera's undetectable,
- Wow.
- And the ladies love them.
- Prove it.
Prove it?
This guy, all right?
Give me my glasses, man.
Those are stealth.
Now I'm gonna prove to you guys spy glasses get you girls.
Oh, my gosh, he's going over there.
- I can't see who he's talking to.
- Shut up, Munch.
Uh, hi, uh...
Hey, um, Em-Emma, right?
Emma?
I was just...
Okay, uh, can I borrow a piece of paper, please?
He has something.
- I can't see who he got it from.
- We're about to see right now.
Look, look, look, look.
He has a paper.
You did not get her number.
Totally got her number.
Right there.
You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.
You, too, you're a sellout.
No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.
Yes, I did.
Mannequin Girl?
What kind of name is that?
What?
That's what I call her.
I think mannequins are hot.
I'll leave my house at 6:00.
15 minutes later, I pick up Alex.
- Munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Tonight, we're no longer boys.
We're men.
- Dude, what the...?
- I didn't see you, man.
Tuck, you all right?
Let's go.
Our whole lives we've been nobodies.
Invisible.
The good kids.
Not anymore.
All right, Ma.
I'm leaving.
Spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a new video game.
Have whatever you want, honey.
You know what, I lied, actually.
We're gonna ride our bikes out into the desert at night alone.
Without supervision.
We got that;
we're going to state.
Okay, see you then, sweetie.
- We could go.
- Also rob a bank.
- All the way.
State.
- What?
Go to Mexico.
Maybe even start a new life.
- Right, I know.
- Wrestling!
You're trying to act like I don't know what I'm talking about.
What's up, Stumpy?
Yo, man, I told you to stop to calling me that.
You know what, man, look, my girl's throwing this huge party later tonight, if you want to come by.
You serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
Because not a lady in the world can resist a natty old BMX bike.
What's the zero to 60 on that bad boy, huh'?
Two, three days?
Come on, come on, dude, you ready?
Let's go.
I can't even tell a difference.
This looks exactly the way it looked before you packed.
All your stuff fitting in one box?
What are you, a drifter?
Who told you?
Look, all I'm saying is, when you get to your new house, put a poster up, put some shelves on the wall, frame a photo.
Look, there's a painting right there.
Put something on a shelf...
That's not a painting.
That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt, smudged it and called it art.
I'm going to Munch's house to play a video game, all right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure, buddy.
- Bye, Dylan.
- Have fun with your friends.
- Hey, hey, Tuck.
- How are you?
Uh, good luck with the move to New York, buddy.
- Maybe we'll come see you.
- All right, cool.
The moving truck is coming at 10:00.
Make sure you're back, okay?
I-l don't get it.
If your foster parents already have a baby of their own, why do they need you?
There's no sense in having two babies.
- Shut up, dude.
- One baby cries all the time, the other one listens to indie rock.
Let's go.
Yeow!
Guys, would you please help my son with his room, before I go crazy?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I don't think he's started...
Honey, have you even started packing your room?
I told you a thousand times,
I'm alphabetizing!
Yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.
Shh.
...they're flexible, they're "dynamical,"
they can be curved, they can bend, and this opens up a whole new universe of possibilities, and one of the possibilities is that there can be shortcuts through space and through time.
So that's really just what a Wormhole is.
It's taking advantage...
What are you...
Aah!
- Why don't you stop doing that?
!
- I'm sorry!
You guys are gonna give me a heart attack one day.
- I'm sorry.
- Turn that off, dude.
I created a substation for each of our parents' phones that's wired to the router, which is wired to the transmitter, which transmits to the receiver, which is...
- my phone.
- Okay, so basically, no matter who our parents call, it goes to your phone.
Yeah.
My mom's friends always say that I sound just like my mom, you know,
- when I pick up the phone...
- Yeah.
So I figured, I can be Betty.
Bye, Betty.
Thank you.
Um, I'm going to Alex's...
or Munch's... or Tuck's house, and we're gonna play a video game and sleep over.
Wait, what's all that stuff?
Honey?
Good job, Munch.
You did it.
Here we come.
17.6 miles.
♪ Going to the desert... ♪
Munch, what are you doing?
Guys, guys, just hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Dude...
- I'm not backing out or anything,
- He wants to quit right when we - ...just-just hear me out.
- Been waiting for this forever.
- Dude, listen, come on, okay.
This is crazy what we're doing.
Dude, I don't want to punk out or back out or anything... it's just, my mom, you know, she just got divorced.
- Munch...
- She's already had enough guys lying to her.
If you didn't want to come, then why didn't you tell us earlier?
You do understand this is our last night together.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Look, Munch, if we don't go now, we'll never go.
We won't even be here.
This is our last chance to try and do something.
Even-even if it is stupid.
- Yeah.
- You know what,
I say we put a vote to it.
All in favor raise your hand.
Well, now I have to raise my hand.
Munch, just...
Fine, fine.
Okay, whatever.
I'll go.
But only under one condition.
- I call the black!
- Mine!
No, no, give it!
It's so weird, no one's gonna be in these houses next week.
Dude, you're so full of it.
- When did you kiss her?
- Dude, trust me.
After pre-algebra, she pulled me into the bathroom.
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Mannequin Girl?
- Yeah!
- Was she good at it?
Uh, eh, B minus.
You know, I've kissed better in better locations.
No, how do I know you're not lying?
Trust me.
I don't even have to reply to you.
- You're last!
- Hey, you got a head start!
That's not fair!
Oh, so what, there's a Wing Stop?
I never been to a Wing Stop.
We followed a map out in the middle of nowhere.
It might be, like, a CIA prison.
We were miles from home.
No one in the world knew it.
No one said it... but we were scared.
We haven't seen a car in, like, half an hour.
We were on our own.
This-this is the way, right?
You have the map, right?
- Can I see the map?
- Left.
Left?
Are you sure?
Because right looks a little bit more promising.
Did you guys hear that?
Just a couple more miles.
Hold on.
What is that?
It's the map.
Are we close?
I never understood why people like the outdoors.
Will you stop freaking out?
Yo, this is too steep, man.
Let's go, man.
We're getting pretty far from the road, guys.
Almost there.
Is it this thing?
I don't think so.
Wait, what was that?
- I don't know.
- Well, hold on.
What'd you see, dude?
Over here!
We're almost there.
Come on.
Oh.
What?
What do you think it is?
How would I know?
Why does it look all burnt?
Hey, just be careful.
- Careful!
- Yeah, don't touch that thing.
Could be...
C-Could be...
I don't know, I don't know.
A part of a satellite?
All right, all right, um, Munch, film me while I'm...
- while I'm touching this thing.
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Let me try it.
Thank you.
It's dusty.
It's a piece of crap.
What?
Forget about it.
Just turn off the camera.
Well, it's not a national treasure, but it could be used for something.
It's crap.
What happened to filming 'cause it's our last night, huh?
Um, in case you haven't noticed, obviously, the map led to squat.
Got it.
So all you cared about was getting your stupid hits on your stupid video?
- Dude, why don't you just...
- Whoa, guys, guys, guys.
Come on!
I know we're all frustrated... it's Alex's mom.
- Are you serious?
- Um, it'll be fine.
Just, um, be Betty, okay?
- Oh, man.
- Oh, crap.
Yo, I thought I could do this, but I can't.
Maybe you can answer it.
She just likes to check up on things, okay?
All right.
Betty, are you there'?
Go.
This is Betty.
I was thinking maybe I could bring over some pizzas?
Dude, go.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No coming over.
- Just hang up.
- No way.
No, it's really no trouble.
We have a coupon.
- I said no!
No pizzas!
- What?
- No, uh...
- Don't yell at her, man.
Maybe you and your husband should go to bed.
Stop saying words!
Are you sure everything's okay?
Have a good night.
Go to sleep.
That could've gone better.
That was horrible.
"Your husband should go to sleep"?
Was that really something smart to say?
Munch.
Don't look at me like I'm a hoarder.
That's rude.
Who are they?
I don't...
I don't know.
I'm picking up some spikes in the readings...
Get down, get down.
Turn your flashlight off, dummy.
Let's go.
Why would they be out this far?
Who cares?
The night's blown.
- Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
Munch?
- You're a character.
- There's something in there!
What?
Dude, are you kidding me right now?
Something is in that bag.
It-it touched me.
Go check.
Be-be careful.
- What?
- Did it poke you, too?
What, dude?
Say something!
What did you see?
There-There's something in there.
Yeah, a bunch of crap Munch brought.
- You guys are funny.
- All I know is it beeped.
You know, why don't you go in there and just see.
Beeped?
What are you talking about?
Babies.
I'll do it myself.
Dang, how much stuff do you have in your bag, dude?
Geez.
Oh, boy, are you guys talking about this?
It's garbage.
It's nothing.
What are you talking about, you heard something?
It made a noise.
Hey, hey, do something!
See, it's not doing anything.
What are you talking about?
Beep.
Do that again, do that again.
Do what again?
Do what you just did.
Beep.
Whoa, hold on.
Let me...
Let me try this for myself.
Beep.
Beep?
Why is it making noise only for you and not me?
Make it beep again.
Beep.
Whoa!
This is it!
It's a bomb!
No, no, oh, God, no!
No, no, no!
Guys, I think...
I think it might have defused.
I don't know.
Man, nothing's happening.
All right, hold on, hold on.
I got an idea.
Tuck!
What?
Okay, it didn't do anything, but j-just don't do it again.
Are you insane, Tuck?
!
Are you sure you guys know what you're doing?
Yes, trust me.
When it's a bomb, you have to act quick.
I seen it on some TV show or some movie or something.
- Saw what?
- Check it out.
What are you doing?
!
Disarming it.
Are you crazy?
!
It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.
That's not what you do with a bomb!
Are you insane?
!
What was that?
It's not my phone.
It's the thing, whatever that is.
- What are you talking about?
- It's that.
That's what just made that noise.
I, uh...
It, like, imitated my ringtone.
This is what made our phones barf?
Did you hear that?
Whoa, whoa.
All right, so, a couple of seconds ago, our phones went crazy.
Bananas, insane.
I don't know what to call it.
Look.
You see that?
It's a new map, but on my phone this time.
To me?
All right, him, or...
Dude, Munch's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and, ugh, I don't even know what that is.
Alex's phone, it just turned on by itself and started filming.
We can't even turn them off.
Oh, don't try to act like it's not cool.
That is weird.
It's showing us where we are.
And you don't find that creepy?
What do you think that is?
You think that's a road?
We should follow the map.
How about no.
How about yes?
We wanted a last night together, so what do you call this?
A trap?
Didn't you guys see the "No Trespassing" sign?
Oops.
I didn't see anything.
This is where the map says to go.
Stop stepping on leaves.
There's leaves everywhere.
Shh.
What was that?
Where do you think it's taking us to?
Maybe another one of those beepy things.
What was that?
I don't know.
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Get down!
Oh, geez!
Munch, watch out!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
What's going on?
Dude, Munch, what was that?
Where is it?
Is it over?
Oh, geez.
Dude!
Tuck, stay back.
- Whoa.
- Stay back.
What's...
Dude!
Wait, wait, be careful.
Your phone just got a new map.
What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait, why is it opening?
Hold on, hold on.
Did you see that just now?
What is that?
- Whoa!
What is that?
- What is that?
- What is that?
- Oh, my...
Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.
It-it's moving.
There's something in there right now.
What's in there?
Oh, don't tell me.
Are those... eyes?
Dude, dude, it's looking dead at us right now.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
It's trembling like it's hurt.
Good.
My heart's beating so fast right now.
Wow.
Almost got us killed, like, three times already.
Yeah, but it was worth it, dude.
Incredible.
All right, so...
I just figured out why Alex's camera was on this whole time.
So this thing, whatever it is, it's eyes are, like, all screwed up, completely.
You see?
So, basically, it uses his phone to see.
That's insane.
You think he can see us right now?
Munch, you have to check this out.
This is amazing.
Is it?
Is it amazing?
'Cause I think it's scary as balls.
I mean, obviously people are looking for it.
- Munch...
- it has access to our voicemails and our texts and our ringtones.
How do you even know it's a he?
Are you a dude?
Wait... you understood us.
Whoa.
All right, here's how it goes.
One beep is yes, two beeps are no.
Watch.
Is one beep yes?
Yo, that's so tight.
Are we in a barn?
Is Munch really a woman?
Oh, come on, man, this thing is broken.
Everybody knows Munch is a woman.
Okay, I have a question.
Are we gonna die tonight?
Why isn't it answering?
What...
Well, that's not good, right?
20 questions with an alien.
Tuck Simms exclusive.
- Let's do this.
- Check it out.
All right, urn, are you from space?
Ooh!
Are you a robot?
Do you eat humans?
Do you like Earth?
Why?
Why doesn't he like Earth?
Do you like us?
You see?
I told you.
We're cool like that.
Come on.
Are you hurt?
- Oh.
- He's hurt.
Well, his lights seem brighter, so...
Did that piece help you?
Uh.
Can we help fix you or something?
Or...
Like, what is this?
Are-are you trying to build something?
Oh, he's trying to build...
Building something.
Right there.
- What could he be building?
- Yeah.
So, wait, what are, what are you building?
Lasers?
A portal?
Minions?
A cloaking device?
It's an army.
Ignore him.
Spaceship?
Oh, my God!
Hold up, hold up.
So let me get this right.
So you're building a spaceship,
- He's building a spaceship.
- And you need our help building the spaceship?
Oh, man.
This guy is building a spaceship.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Let me make sure I don't have any plans.
Nope!
We're building a spaceship!
He's building a spaceship.
We asked him questions for almost two hours.
Where he came from.
If there were others here like him.
We found out he was lost... and alone.
He was out in the middle of nowhere, on his own, like us.
All we really knew was that he crashed, and now he needed us to rebuild him.
The map says up ahead.
Are we going the right way?
Look, look, look, look, whatever that is, the map goes to it.
All right, so wait-wait a minute.
Let me get this right.
Dude comes from a million light-years away, and he wants to come here?
I don't know, the map said so.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You got to look both ways before you cross the street.
Munch.
So are you... snoopy.
Ten dollars?
- I said no deal.
- $7.50.
I don't want it.
It's tchotchke trash.
If you give it to me as a gift, I'd still throw it away.
- It's trash.
- No, it's vintage.
No.
You don't get to say the word "vintage."
I'm the one who gets to say when what is vintage.
Excuse me, sir, you have a very, very lovely shop.
Come on, you sure?
Hey-
Oh, man, look at the hand painting.
It's all crafted right there.
- One of a kind.
- It's trash.
Uh, uh...
What was that?
F-sharp?
No, no, no!
Come on!
Watch out!
Watch out!
What was it?
Whoa. is everybody okay?
Hey, Nichols, are you alive?
They broke my girlfriend's lamp!
Wait, what is he doing?
Oh.
Whoa, whoa.
Is-is that...
Sweet babushka.
You want to sell it?
- Tuck, let's go!
Come on!
- Run!
What are you waiting for?
Dude, that place was wrecked!
Sorry again, sir!
Go!
Go!
Down here!
Let's get somewhere so we can look at him.
He's shaking.
Whoa, he's letting you touch him.
- I wouldn't, guys.
- Hey, what about here?
Here, set him on here.
He looks scared.
Yeah, why is he all balled up?
Can't you stand?
You all right?
Maybe he's... maybe he's just shy.
- Ooh, can you fly?
- Can you do X-ray vision?
How?
He can't see.
He doesn't even know where to look.
All right, all right, I think the question is, what can you do?
Okay, so Dr. Nichols is doing a surgical procedure with very sophisticated technology.
Pen caps.
Clear.
Wait, I don't get it.
How is that sophisticated?
It's kind of just, like, pen caps.
I got it.
Be careful.
His legs are fragile.
Whoa.
Get this.
Are you getting this?
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Oh, that's crazy!
So you can't fly, but you can float.
That is so crazy!
I saw you.
I saw you grinning, man.
Stop trying to pretend like that wasn't cool.
- That was hot.
- This is crazy.
I mean, it's-it's just crazy.
Whoa.
Don't drop it.
Huh.
Can you see me?
Huh, I think he likes you.
Will you show us where you live?
All right.
Beep faster if I'm getting close.
Is that it, right there?
Why don't I go first.
Hi.
Um, my name's Alex, and... you're-you're in...
Munch, no... you're in my hand right now.
You know my ringtone, which is, like, insane and awesome.
Okay, um...
Hi.
I'm Tuck.
What's up?
I don't even know what to say, but, uh... but, uh, I'm from...
I'm from New York.
Uh, this is Nevada.
I don't even know, like, I like donuts,
- um...
- Donuts?
Really?
Okay, can somebody else do this?
I know, I'm going.
My name's M...
My real name is Reginald, but my friends call me Munch.
I hope we can be friends, too.
Do you have a name?
Oh, we could call him Beep.
Dude, what-what kind of name is Beep?
Word.
We got to give him a name that's powerful, like... like Master Blaster.
He doesn't blast anything.
Peter.
Peter.
What about Peter?
Something cool, like Space Ninja or something.
Well, how is there a ninja in space?
He wouldn't be able to breathe.
- All right, all right...
- Dude, you don't know that.
Have you ever been to space?
Which name do you like?
Uh, Beep.
Why?
There it is.
- Hello.
Watch this.
Watch this.
- You can't echo...
Watch this.
Just...
Beep.
See?
Echo.
That's what we should call it.
Echo.
- Oh, 'cause it echoes.
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Echo, Echo, Echo.
- Echo.
Your name... is Echo.
Echo...
Echo...
I don't think he's supposed to come out of that cylinder thing.
He looks... dead.
Echo?
So then we didn't know how broken he was.
The crash hurt him worse than we thought.
Okay, little guy... where do you want us to go?
Guys?
You know this is considered being a burglar, right?
With each new piece, he got strong.
And that's what we were gonna do... make him stronger.
Which way?
- Around.
- In the house?
!
- Dude!
Maybe we should just knock on the door and...
We just need you to listen, sweetheart.
- Oh, man.
- You're grounding me?
Tuck, what are you doing?
Munch, go.
It's the man... the man should choose his dance partner.
It's a stupid tradition.
Really, it's about meeting new people, and many of those were our friends' sons.
And it's embarrassing when you ignore them.
And these are life skills that we are teaching you.
- Tuck, get back.
- Putting on this dress for you doesn't change me into some perfect little homecoming queen!
Okay, no one's asking you to act like a homecoming queen.
It's at least three years away.
Now.
Go, go, go.
...by the company you keep.
It's a cliché for a reason.
I'm sure this all seems...
Guys, what are we doing?
We're gonna be trapped up here.
Everybody be quiet.
Yeah, everyone!
You got to be kidding me.
Aw, you know what?
Everyone just follow me, all right?
Don't look at anything.
Just hurry.
- Hey, Tuck, did you see this?
- No, don't...
Dude, Tuck, this is Mannequin Girl's house.
Now we can ask for permission to steal stuff, 'cause, you know, you guys are kissing buddies.
Aw, man...
It was a couple of days ago.
She probably forgot about it by now, you know?
Like, yeah, it's...
yeah, she probably forgot.
- How would she forget about it?
- I almost forgot about it...
- Oh, boy, get ready.
- Uh-oh.
Close the door.
Close the door.
-
-Guys...
- Dude, we just got to keep it from going crazy.
It's gonna get loud.
We'll catch it in a blanket.
- What?
- Whoa!
- Get down!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Stop letting it move!
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
How to unfold a napkin?
!
- Who cares!
- Fine!
And in no time in my life am I gonna be somewhere
- that even plays the foxtrot!
- Close the door.
Yo, put it away, man.
Shh.
Be quiet.
What the...?
Wait, I know you.
Hey.
It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey, we're with Tuck.
Tuck Simms.
You know?
Remember you guys kissed?
- We what?
- Yeah, what are you talking about, huh?
Why is my room destroyed?
Why are you filming this?
- And what is that?
- Um, it's a... it's a-a car muffler.
No.
I want to know what that is.
It's actually a spaceship.
- Munch!
- Sorry.
Uh, well, we-we were following maps, and it just happened to lead here, so we were trying to help our friend Echo...
well, he's an alien
- Oh, God...
- ...that we're trying to get him on a ship.
See, look, it used to have six symbols, but now it has three, so that means we're almost there.
Crazy, right?
Munch, will you shut up?
An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?
- Nope.
- No, no.
- You did not just see that.
- Yeah, I did.
Yeah, she definitely saw it.
- Wait.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, I want to go.
- Really?
Sounds great.
What?
No.
- Dude...
- You're not part of our group, so why don't you just go play with your super rich friends...
That's kind of harsh and your ball gowns and just go eat steak or something.
- What the hell?
- Go, go, go.
Dang, dude, what was that upstairs?
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you so mad.
Yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.
All right, let's just...
don't talk about...
Nothing happened in there, all right?
You know, they say the girls you argue with are the ones you like.
Don't go there, bro.
Tuck, it's over there.
Wait, it wants us to go to a bar?
Man, I say we climb in a window or find a door.
There's got to be another way.
Um, before-before we go...
I really need to get the pee out of my body.
-
- Let's just hope the next place isn't a bank.
I can't believe you told that girl to get lost.
- You're so dramatic.
- What about you?
You invented a whole kiss, didn't you?
Uh, first of all, for your info, it's called aspirational thinking.
You're thinking it one moment, you're living it the next.
- How's that working out?
- Oh, excuse me.
Go to the bikes.
Oh, God, oh, God.
- Why is the construction man...
- Shut...
- Excuse me.
- Aw...
Hey-
I know you guys.
You're the guys... you're from the construction site, right?
Uh, with the, uh, with the camera?
Whoa-ho, wait, wait.
Why aren't you guys at home right now?
You guys weren't riding your bikes out around the desert, were you?
- No, of course not.
- Yes.
Uh, no.
That doesn't sound too... clear.
- Uh...
- Thank God.
There you are.
- What?
Who-who are you?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Exactly!
It's like I don't even know anymore.
My mom had to drag my dad from the bar... again!
- What?
- He likes to go there more than he likes to tuck in his own kids at night.
At least that's what my mom says.
What's she talking about?
That's her.
Eating a burrito.
She east when she's stressed.
I ask myself if that's gonna be me one day.
What do you think?
Is it?
We make mistakes and we get married and we go to bars.
And these... these are my only friends in the world,
- 'cause they see me Uh... for who I really am.
That's your mom over there?
- Do you want to meet her?
- No.
No.
No, no.
Just get home safe!
Told you guys I wanted to go.
What the...?
Okay, so this girl, man, she'd been tailing us since her house, spying on us like some creepy stalker.
- She'd overheard our whole plan.
- She... she's crazy.
- I need the bag!
- I think I like it.
Oh, boy, get ready.
All right, try to blend in.
Look old.
That must've been some good fake l.
D.'s.
What's up, baby face?
What are you doing in here, little man?
Oh, uh, I, uh...
- Are you Randy's kid?
- Uh,
- yes, he is.
- Um, y-yeah, yeah, yeah, he's my dad... or mom.
- You know, dad.
Mom.
- Okay, dude, just go.
Hurry up.
Emma?
Emma?
I was hanging out with this really pretty chick.
She's almost as pretty as you.
I mean... you're not pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.
Come over here.
Hop up on that stool.
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Oh, and one for his buddy here, too.
No, no, I'm all right.
Seriously, I'm all right.
- Sure, you'll like it.
- Sorry, I'm a...
I'm allergic.
Oh, you're gonna love it.
- Uh, no, no.
- You're gonna get one.
So, what happens next?
- Just give me back my bag.
- No.
Give it.
I'm serious.
Give me the bag.
Why are you being mean to me?
- Here, honey.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.
Wow, a lot of people with beards and mustaches in here, you know?
You don't understand.
Whenever you get close to the next piece, it goes crazy.
Oh, my God!
Whoa!
Aah!
- Uh...
- Are you kidding me?
Do you guys just go around town breaking stuff?
Just keep running!
Go, go!
What was that?
I think the ship's trying to take off!
Whoa, whoa!
Are you seeing this?
This thing is flying a ship... in your backpack?
I think he's getting better.
Oh.
So, you don't know how he crashed, or when, or why he came here with a spaceship in the first place?
Look, he only answers yes or no... it's not that simple.
Is this how I talk to him?
So, you crashed.
Did someone cause you to crash?
Dude, what's she doing?
- I don't know.
- Someone on Earth?
Do you think they're looking for you?
It's not those guys in trucks from the convenience store, is it?
The construction man?
Those are the guys that shot you down?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We got to take a step back.
This is way bigger and shadier than before, okay?
This is not good.
If those dudes are looking for Echo, they're looking for us, you know?
Echo?
You need some help there, buddy?
Hey, it's okay.
Shh.
Breathe like me, okay?
It's okay.
Dude, h-he'll be fine.
No.
We're not leaving him.
My whole life, I've been left.
I know how it feels.
We're all he's got.
- Uh, left?
- We could find a shortcut.
The map says up ahead.
This map's confusing.
I was a mind ninja back there...
- So, what was it like kissing me?
- Give me my camera.
Did your legs get all wobbly?
Was there soft music playing?
Please remind me, Tuck.
I totally forgot.
- What was it like?
- You're close.
Is this your first imaginary kiss?
The map says for us to go inside.
I'm confused.
- Huh?
- Didn't you guys kiss?
Anyway, the point is,
Emma was being annoying...
she kept walking off with Echo like she owned him, and talking to him about
I don't know what, I don't even know.
You know what?
Delete.
Man, are we sure there's no security guards or...
You know, that door wasn't even locked.
Hey, uh, guys, I was just thinking, you know,
I... haven't got to actually hold the, you know, the ship, before we did the thing, so can I do it?
- You know, before it gets crazy?
- Sure, but... it's not a ship.
What?
What are you talking about?
He told us it was a ship.
It's a key to your ship, right?
Well, if this is just the key, where's the spaceship?
All right, Munch, put it down.
Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.
Okay, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to put it down
- before you hurt both of us.
- I need this, man.
That's weird.
- Does it know her?
- I don't know.
Munch!
Whoa!
Whoa!
You okay?
- Yeah.
- What are you guys doing?
- Wow.
- Um, she was gonna get hit by the piece, so I-l saved her.
Hey!
You four!
Freeze!
- Run!
- Which way?
- Tuck!
- Stop right there!
Stop!
Go, go!
Hurry up!
Hold up, hold up!
Did Alex get out?
Uh, I d...
I don't know.
- We have to go back.
- Uh...
- Come on, you guys.
- Okay.
Look.
Whoa, whoa.
She's being stupid.
There's a guard in there, you know?
You can't just go running in, acting crazy.
We need a-a plan, or... s... right?
Breaking and entering, destruction of property.
Those are felonies, kid.
Okay, Echo, I need your help.
Um, I need you to...
do something.
I have a minor here; he's 13.
Caught him breaking in with his friends.
If you could send an officer down.
Stay put.
Hello?
Anybody there?
Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
...there...
ls anybody there... there...
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Alex.
Alex.
- Wh-Where's Tuck?
- We got to go.
- We should've gone back.
- All right, you know what?
Calm down, because if people would've listened to me, then Alex never would have gotten caught.
Didn't I say there would be security guards?
Alex!
Dude!
You're all right!
Are you all right?
Hey, Alex, we're good, man.
All right?
- Buddy?
- We're good, man?
Alex.
Come on, dude.
Alex!
We could've gone home, but we didn't.
- We were outside.
- Turn off the camera.
Not till you admit you're acting mopey for no reason.
You're always freaking out if anyone's gonna leave you behind.
Do you know how expensive that is?
I'm glad I'm moving.
You were never my friend.
- Is that right?
Is that right?
- Guys, guys,
- come on, just-just chill out.
- Come on!
Have you lost your mind?
TUCK woke-every.
I acted like I didn't know what I'd done.
But I knew exactly.
I know we're all tired and stuff, and hungry.
I saw this awesome diner.
We can totally just go grab
- a bite to eat or something.
- Real awesome, guys.
Real macho.
So, that's it?
The night's over?
Doesn't have to be.
Right?
Well, I mean, if it is, uh, we could...
I don't know, I guess we can keep the mood going, yeah?
Or we can do it another time, right?
Good times, the continuation, part two.
Right?
Hmm.
You know what?
I'm gonna talk about Sandra.
Man, that girl used to beat the crap out of you.
Me, too.
We were both little, small and scrawny.
She was a big girl, and she knew it.
But then I had a growth spurt, and you didn't, and I finally did something.
You remember that?
You told her I had polio.
Yeah, I told her that, and did she beat you up after that?
She still beat me up.
'Cause I-l always get your back, man.
I never let you down;
I always get your back.
Most of the time.
Just when I'm not freaked out about security guards, all right?
I'm sorry, man.
Are we good?
Yeah.
Dude.
Faster.
Sure are doing some traveling tonight.
My parents are in the bathroom.
Uh-huh.
Let it go.
What are you doing?
- Dude!
Hey, what are you doing?
!
- Oh, God!
Don't grab our stuff like that!
- Stop!
- Hey, give me the backpack!
- Who do you think you are?
- The police have been instructed to come and pick up these kids and take them home.
He can't just walk away.
What was it?
- The phone.
- No, no, no!
- Munch!
- Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
Oh, my...
Munch!
This is not real, this is not real, this is not real right now.
Don't let them see you.
Now!
Munch!
Do you see the truck?
Munch!
Munch!
That guy is not a construction worker.
- It's Munch.
- I need help, guys.
I really didn't think this through.
We're here, we're here.
Are you hurt?
Can you guys hear me...?
- Are you okay?
- Where are you, Munch?
We'll find you, all right?
I promise.
I think I'm at the construction site.
- Come on, buddy.
- Munch!
I can see the big lights and up at those...
- the white trucks...
How far is your neighborhood?
It's way over an hour.
All right, I think I got a faster way.
Who wants to go to a party?
Are you sure he'll even be here?
Better be.
His girlfriend's throwing it.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Sophomores.
Hey, sweet party.
Sweet jams.
Guys, what are we doing here?
We can't be...
Just look for my brother.
Look for his keys.
- Oh, my gosh, it's the cops.
- Okay.
Oh, God, the keys, the keys.
I lost my keys.
I have a Porsche.
Marcus!
Oh, not you, sorry.
I wasn't trying to stop the fun...
I like it.
Whoa...!
Hi.
Uh, sorry to bother everyone.
Have you seen my brother, Marcus?
Tall guy?
You seen his car keys?
- Uh, anyone?
- Guys, the cops are here!
- What?
- Yeah, the cops are here.
- Turn it down, turn it down.
- Dude, stop...
No, I'm serious, the cops are here right now.
Alex!
Alex!
We have to go now.
All right, just come on, come on.
We got to move.
Hurry, hurry.
We can't hide here.
Look, look, just stay here.
He's my brother;
I'll find him.
Just... don't let the cops take the footage.
All right?
You live here, right?
The cops!
Marcus?
Marcus, we're here.
The party's shut down.
That's enough.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Tuck's gonna freak.
Uh, here, check his pockets.
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.
Cops are gone.
- Uh, Tuck, Tuck?
- I have no idea where Marcus is.
Yeah.
Tell me you got that on tape?
My name is Reginald "Munch" Barrett.
This is my...
kind of my final message.
To my best friends...
I love you, guys.
You're Googling it?
Really?
Oh, come on, this is what the Internet is for.
Um, "step one, get a driver's license."
- Do we have one of those?
- Oh, wow.
All right, am I good?
Stop!
Stop!
All right, all right.
Dude, do you even know what you're doing?
No, I don't.
"Step two, be calm."
What are you doing?
!
- Sorry, sorry.
- Be calm is step two?
All right, all right, all right.
I got it, I got it.
Hold on a sec..
- Stop!
- Tuck, Tuck, turn!
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.
- Uh...
- Oh, my God.
We're good, we're good.
All right, I'm excited.
Should I gun it?
- No, no, no, don't.
- No, Tuck.
I need, I need music.
Somebody just play some music.
All right.
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my God.
Change it.
Everywhere we'd been that night, shot by us like a rocket.
All we wanted was our friends back.
A'?
A'?
I'm gonna miss it here, man.
Yeah, me too.
Here we go.
I don't know about this.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
That does not look like a freeway.
Get down.
Shh, Shh.
All right, so what's the plan?
I don't know.
Get him out?
So, in other words, we don't have a plan.
Go, go, go.
I'm just gonna call Munch's phone and see if his phone rings.
Wait a minute.
Dude, my camera's not a doorstop.
I hear his voice.
Shh.
I-l knew it was you guys 'cause I saw the same truck from my neighborhood.
Tell us the truth.
l-l had a lot of adrenaline rush, and...
I...
I didn't want the night to end.
And I... and it was the last night with Alex.
Oh, shit, Munch.
Stop crying and talk to us.
This is not good.
I'm not...
I'm not crying!
What?
Where is that?
We got to find him and get him out of there, man.
Just don't kill me!
Did he access your phones at all?
Were there others like it or was this the only one you found?
What are they doing?
Dude, they're breaking him!
Guys?
Guys, someone's coming.
We should go.
Go, go.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, construction man!
- Give me the camera.
- Listen...
This is not your camera.
Hey, guys, go!
- And find Munch!
- Let go of me!
Get off of us, man, this isn't...
- My camera!
- Let go.
Is that thing still on?
Okay, no more lies.
No more sneaking around.
No more cameras, understand?
Son, look at me.
Look at me.
Oh, I-l see better with my glasses on, you know?
This signal has been transmitting for a very long time, from a ship that we believe is located right here in your neighborhood.
- What?
- Wait, what's he talking about?
Six days ago, an object entered our atmosphere at 20,000 miles an hour, on a direct course for that ship.
We shot it down.
What you found activates the ship, and if that ship takes off, it could kill everyone.
He just wants to go home.
Okay, that will not happen.
He is far too valuable.
This is crazy, this is crazy.
So... we are gonna follow this map and you are gonna help us get that thing operational, and it will lead us back to its ship, and we will disable it permanently.
Am I clear?
Am I clear?
Y-Yeah.
Good.
Check the doors, check the doors.
It's locked;
it's not just locked.
They don't have a handle on it.
- Someone help!
- Where are they taking us?
Hey, yo!
Let us out, man!
Someone!
Well, the sun's up.
Our parents are gonna find out.
I think we got bigger problems than our parents.
Where are we?
Let's go!
All right, everybody knows the drill.
Let's set it up.
- He's not moving.
- Stop!
Can you see me?
Beep?
We're all here.
We're gonna get you home, all right?
We'll find a way.
Nichols, man, it's not there.
No.
Please, you have to work.
Just try.
Echo?
Don't!
Echo!
You can't go; you can't!
It's over.
Let's keep them quiet.
Come on, man.
It's...
It's time to go.
What's happening?
What is that?
Here he goes.
Back up.
Get ready.
Whoa.
Okay, now!
Where are we going?
Home!
His ship's in Mulberry Woods.
Dude, go!
How do I drive?
Will you drive?
!
Please drive!
Just hurry up!
Alex, dude, you don't have your seat belt on!
- Just speed up!
- Just go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
They're right there!
You have to speed!
- I'm trying!
- You're driving...!
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
- Tuck, you're gonna get us killed!
- Where do I go?
- Just go around them.
- No, hold on.
- Don't go on the wrong side!
Dude, stop, stop!
- Oh!
- What the...?
- Oh, my gosh.
- Whoa, whoa!
Are you...
Are you seeing this?
Thanks, buddy.
I need an Advil.
We can't afford this right now.
We really can't afford this right now.
Dude, look, there's a new map.
A what?
Here, here, give me the phones back.
I think that's his ship.
Whoa, that's a big ship.
Alex, I don't want to stress you out or anything, but they're right there!
Oh, my God.
Alex, it's your morn.
- Don't answer it.
- Why would I answer it?
- Betty?
- Dude.
- Munch.
- Betty?
Hi.
- Sorry about my tone last night.
- Oh, I just thought it would be nice to have the boys have a nice night
- together before we're all uprooted.
- You're crying.
- Munch, it's your mom.
- What?
!
Look, look, look, look.
Dude.
- You okay?
- So, Janice, gotta go... on my jog.
Can we act like we never had this conversation?
Uh, uh, just come over this wall.
Are you up?
- Guys, they're here.
- Jump.
- Move!
- Faster!
They can't catch us in our own backyard.
Let's cut them off.
Munch, hurry UP!
- Okay, okay.
- Munch!
Well, I don't jump walls very much, man!
Here, hold my camera.
Dude, come on, come on, come on.
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Tuck, wait!
They're right behind us!
Come on, guys, we got to go, we got to go.
Let's go, right now.
It's down the hill.
Come on, let's go!
Shh.
Go, go, go.
It says the ship is up ahead.
This is the way to your house, man.
- Go, go, go, guys!
- Are your parents awake?
I think we...
I think we lost them.
Okay.
I don't...
I don't get it.
I...
This is where the map ends.
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship.
Maybe it's invisible.
What is it?
Wait, what-what's he talking about?
What do you want us to...
Dude, what?
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa...
- Oh.
Everybody good?
What's down there?
Be careful, man.
What?
That's it.
Dude, it-it's underneath.
So this whole time...
That's why they want all our houses.
They were digging.
Yo, Alex, I know what you're thinking.
Alex!
Alex, man!
Th-The only way that thing can take off is to come up out of the ground through us.
That's a really bad idea.
Dude, what are you doing?
This is not just about us anymore.
It's about other people now, a whole community still asleep in their beds.
Let's just think this through first.
- I trust him.
- Listen to us.
Alex!
Alex!
Alex!
Is this where we're supposed to be?
Make up a plan.
- No, we got to run.
- What are you talking about?
- If the ship's right under...
- We can't leave.
- I know we can't leave him.
- What about Alex?
What about everyone up here that's gonna die?
Alex!
Dude, say something!
Oh, my God.
I left you behind once.
I'm not doing it again.
Hi, guys.
Whoa.
Whoa.
This... this is in-insane.
So, um, beep.
Uh, um,
I don't really know how to say good-bye... so I'm not gonna.
And, um...
Um...
You're my friend, you know?
Even when I'm old, even when... even when you think I've forgotten...
I'm always gonna be there.
Do you feel that?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, we need to go now!
We have to go.
Bye.
Go, go, go!
Wait, wait, wait, my camera!
Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Dude, are you all right?
- Everybody good?
- Are you all right?
Okay.
That was so close.
What the heck?
- Oh, my...
- What the...?
Yeah!
Oh, my God.
Dude, this is amazing.
I think you're gonna want to get this.
Oh!
We did it, dude.
We did it.
Dude!
Did you see that?
Did you see...
- Wow.
We did that!
- You're like...
That's insane.
We just did that!
That's...
Look, come on.
Look, look, people want to know what happened.
If we told them what happened, they wouldn't believe us.
Guys, it's morning.
Oh, crap, I gotta get home.
- My dad is gonna kill me.
- I think I need a ride.
We should go because people, they'll start asking...
Hey, buddy...
Did you guys feel that earthquake?
- Were you okay?
- No, Mom, I'm fine.
- Let me see.
- He's fine.
Honey, he's fine.
Did no one just see the giant spaceship?
!
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, a spaceship.
What just happened?
!
Oh, oh, okay, okay.
I know it's been really hard lately,
- and we've all been really overwhelmed.
- Just...
Why don't we... why don't we just go in and relax.
Maybe we can, um, go get that-that pizza we talked about.
- All right?
Yeah.
- Pizza?
- If we don't play along,
- Yeah, his mom saw the ship.
- Nobody's gonna get it okay?
- How could I play along?
- So just...
- Yes, I'm sure.
I found them here at Alex's.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, no, no.
Actually, uh, we found him here.
I thought he was staying with you.
No, I was told they were at Munch's.
I'll call you back, babe.
Yeah, yeah, they were at my house.
We-we played this game where you play as a guy with the soul of a dragon, and it had really good voices.
The voices were great, so...
Who's this?
That's Emma.
I'm, uh, he's my boyfriend.
I mean, friend who's a boy.
- Urn...
- Awkward.
She's hot, right?
Knock it off, you.
Six hours later, Alex moved.
I just got grounded for, like, life.
Me, too.
Might as well move now.
Not gonna be seeing anyone for a while.
Yeah.
But this... what really happened tonight... no one knows but us.
Hey, Alex!
Time to go, buddy.
I'm gonna miss you guys.
You guys smell really bad.
Our last night together, we did a lot.
A whole lot.
But there's some things we couldn't do.
Alex's parents had already bought a new home.
Most of the neighborhood had.
Munch's, too.
So, one by one, people started to move.
My parents hadn't, so we got to stay.
New people started moving in, and Mulberry Wood started again,
but not the one that had my friends in it.
When you're a kid, you think you're invisible.
You think you can't make a difference.
We're not kids anymore.
We know now... that we can do anything.
Having a friend light-years away taught us that distance is just a state of mind.
If you're best friends, then you always will be no matter where you are in the universe.

[ Barking In Distance]
[ Winston ] Alphas, the first rule of a hunt... is to control your fears.
But, Winston, great leader, we're the wolves, they're the prey.
What do vve have to fear?
Stinky.
Is that mud on your snout, or is it always brown?
Claudette, shut it.
- As future leader of the pack, I-
- Oh, please.
- I'm faster, stronger-
- Clumsier.
[ Winston ] Claudette, Stinky.
Fear vvill be natural, but you must control it, or it will destroy you.
- You got that, Bro?
- Yeah.
Do you?
Alphas, take your positions.
[All Growling]
Runt!
This is Alpha School.
You're supposed to be in Omega School.
Aw, Grandpa Winston, I want to hunt!
I may be small, but I'm fearless!
Hey, fearless.
You get over here right now!
Oh, shoot!
Runt, buddy, listen to your mother.
Why should I, Dad?
You never do.
Aunt Lilly has a fabulous field trip planned for Omega School.
Alphas get to hunt, and the Omegas go on field trips!
We're going to an ecological phenomenon, Shadow Forest.
[ Gasps ]
Shadow Forest, cool!
isn't that haunted?
Huh.
Just a myth, and that was a long time ago.
Did I just hear you were going to Shadow Forest?
Yes.
I was there yesterday.
It's fine. it's teeming with life.
Code for food.
Hmm.
Would Garth like this, Lilly?
My husband is on an extended hunting trip.
He trusts my judgment.
Well, I had a bad experience in there, and I've never been back.
When you were supposedly attacked by a ghost at Saw Tooth Cave, right.
Well, I haverft seen you going in there lately.
Lilly, you were just there, and ifs, uh, okay, right?
There were a whole lot of critters because we have avoided an entire forest.
[ Kate ] Humphrey, is this a good idea?
It'll be fine, Kate.
- I'm going with them.
- [Winston ] Then ifs settled.
The Alphas will be kings of the fields... and the Omegas will be kings of the forest.
Awesome!
Dad!
Aunt Lilly, shall we?
Okay, I see Where it got its name.
So What happened that made us avoid it all this time?
Some wolves claim that it's haunted with a wolf ghost.
Wait, I hear something.
[ Shouts ]
Is that supposed to be aggression?
You see?
Even the critters arerft afraid of us.
[Yelling]
[ Growls ]
Runt, unnecessary.
Dad!
Ifthe Omegas are the kings of the forest... we have to show it whds boss!
- Ah!
- I think hejust did.
Hey, wolves.
The exifs thatavvay.
Yeah, and the forest is thatavvay.
You Want to take this outside?
- Arerft vve already outside?
- [ Runt ] Dad!
Come on.
You Wolves are making a big mistake!
[ Runt ] What is it?
- Not sure.
- It looks like someones home.
[ Humphrey ] Well, it certainly seems protected.
Protected?
From What?
[ Wind Howling]
[ Lilly] That's odd.
Nothing in the clouds indicated a Windstorm today.
Oh.
All right cubs, uh, let's go.
- Cubs?
- [ Runt Grunting]
Runt!
- What are you doing?
- I'm going up to take a look.
My son, the tree hugger.
I think it's Saw Tooth Cave.
The rocks around the edges look like fangs.
[ Gasps ]
[ Humphrey ] Son, ifs getting windy up there.
Come on.
Time to hit the trail.
- [ Thunder Rumbles ] - [Screams] Dad!
[Grunts]
- Hi, Eve.
- Hi, Mom.
Oh, there you are.
Why are you so late?
Dinnefis gone cold.
Uh, Runt had an incident.
Dad, I'm fine.
What did you see?
Nothing.
[Snoring]
[ Groans ] Stay away!
Stay away!
Something got your fur in a bunch?
Little Bro, you're- you're as pale as a coyote.
A coyote. [ Scoffs ] Really?
Hey, did you alert the critters that the Omegas are the new kings of the forest?
No, but I will tomorrow.
I think a different field trip is probably a good idea.
[ Gasps ]
Kate, ifs not a bad place to explore.
Yeah.
Critters everywhere.
I have an idea.
Let's all go.
We can do a hunt.
[ Growls ] And afterwards have a picnic!
[ Snoring ] Stay away-
- Stay away.
- Wolf attack!
[Together] War!
L-low was the forest'?
Great, except that place has some strange weather patterns.
Windy, right?
- Yeah.
- Especially up by Saw Tooth Cave.
Runt, I told you to stay away from that place.
Uncle Tony, What happened to you when you vvere there?
Don't act like you clon't want to tell them your story.
I really dorft.
Well, okay.
It was a dark and cold night.
And if ifs Tony's story, it'll be even darker and colder.
There we were, young wolves, like yourselves.
We were practice hunting.
On the tail of a major prey.
It was huge!
Antlers sharp as rock.
We stalked it across the path.
I had to get it.
It was my first act as a future leader.
Tony, it looks like it Went into that cave.
That dark and creepy cave.
Okay, Lyle and Link, you twins go check it out.
[ Together ] Why us?
Because if anything happens to one, there's always a spare.
I was so selfless.
Think about it.
You'll come back with your biggest prey yet.
Come on, lefs do this thing!
[ Wind Howling]
Oh, for howling out loud!
What is Wrong with you two?
I'll do it.
[Growling]
- [ Thunder Rumbling ] - [ Screams ]
Run!
Run!
it's going to get us!
It's going to get us!
It's going to get us!
It's going to get us!
And I never Went into the forest again.
Okay, I think its getting late.
Uh, yeah, I agree.
Uh, pups, thank Grandma for dinner.
[ All ] Thanks for dinner, Grandma.
Come back for leftovers.
Oh, and, uh, thank Uncle Tony for the bedtime horror story.
[ All ] Thank you for the bedtime horror story!
[ Sighs ] They're growing up so fast.
Hunting, exploring.
Quite a paw full.
Yeah. it's how a gray wolf gets even grayer.
[Yawning]
I am not afraid.
I am not afraid.
I am not afraid.
[ Gasps ]
- [ Gasps ] - [ Screams ]
You okay, little Brother?
I have to go back.
I have to!
Are you two with me?
[ Kate ] l-lave fun at the river!
Catch a few fish, would you'?
Uh, sure thing, Mom.
I feel guilty.
Why?
Technically vve are going to the river.
Just taking a detour.
- And, please-
- Mom, we're cool, okay?
We'll be back for dinner.
Bye.
Welcome to my kingdom.
[Stinky] it's, uh, nice, Runt.
Uh-
- A bit dark and-
- So shadowy.
Okay, now we've seen it and vve should... hightail it over to the river.
No, I want to show you Saw Tooth Cave.
Are you two afraid?
- No!
- No!
- [Animal Calls] - [ Gasping]
Would you two Wolves channel your inner alpha?
- We're creating an image here.
- [ Laughter ]
Great.
Identify yourselves!
[ Scoffs ] Identify yourself.
Well, we asked you first.
And we outrank you guys.
Check out wolf girl.
She has got some serious attitude.
And What is with that fur?
- Is that a mullet?
- [ Gasps]
Well, well, if it isn't the mean girls of Shadow Forest.
Okay, now look.
Let's all try and be friendly here.
I'm Runt, the future king of the forest.
[ Laughs ] Says who?
Says Winston, the leader of the wolves.
And I do believe vve can come and go as vve vvish.
And I do believe you carft.
Hey, hey!
We're not here to cause problems.
Come on.
Let's do this thing.
[ Wind Howling]
Okay, maybe we should come back another clay.
[ Gasps ] What is that?
[Stinky] It looks like a wolf.
Quick, this way!
- Which Way is out?
- I think vve came that way, didn't we?
- No, no, it was that way!
- [ Gasps ]
Run, Run!
This way, Bros!
[ Stinky ] Okay, be very quiet.
Where are we?
I'll scope out the opposite direction.
- Runt, you stay in there!
- What am I?
The sitting Paddy?
- Stinky, Claudette, anything?
- [ I/V/nd Howling ]
I think I found the exit.
Where is Stinky?
- I dorft know.
- [Stinky Screaming]
- Stinky!
- Bro, Where are you?
His pavv marks stop here.
- Stinky!
- Stinky!
Where are you!
[Grunting]
Anything?
No, nothing!
L
- I dorft see him anywhere!
Stinky!
[ Gasps ] it's protecting her!
What are you saying to me?
Claudette, I see him!
I see him!
[Grunting]
Hold on!
Come on!
Lift, Stinky!
- [All Grunting ]
- Hold it!
[Grunts]
You said you were going to the river!
Well, vve did travel to the river.
And Stinky has the dog paddle to prove it!
I savv something coming and freaked out, and then I fell.
But I survived.
Oh, pups, enough with that forest.
Cant you stick to chasing butterflies in the valley?
- Huh?
- Or playing in front of the cave.
- Playing What?
- Well, you could play... howl.
Oh, you mean like howling every 15 minutes so you can locate us?
No.
[ Chuckles ]
On the hour will do.
What's next?
A leash?
Okay, guys.
Look, your mother is just trying to make sure that you dorft... you know, get yourself into a... situation.
Yeah, a situation that could be bad...
leads to bad things.
Didrft you two get into a lot of situations?
But I vvouldrft say it led to bad things.
Well, not in the end, at least.
If it isn't my favorite twins.
We hear that a bunch of Omegas Went into Shadow Forest today.
Against my Wishes.
It must be safe if Omegas Went there.
From what I understand, it's exactly as we left it.
Did Winston declare it for the Omegas?
I heard there was a lot of food in there.
For your ovvn good, stick to hunting in the fields.
Ever since Winston allowed Kate to marry Humphrey... the Alphas have always gotten the short end.
We found that forest first.
Yeah, vve did.
- Ugh!
Can Mom and Dad chill?
- Let's call them out.
Let me.
I do believe vve are being followed!
You think we're following you?
Kate, did you hear that?
The pups think their own parents are following them.
Please.
[ Chuckles ]
Huh.
I told you this was a bad idea.
No, no.
We're just, uh, going on a Walk.
Hey!
Hey, let's do a family walk...
together, okay?
Mom, it's time we explore places by ourselves.
Kate, we knew this clay would come.
Rejection.
Horrible feeling.
Okay, well, stay on the path of, uh, life.
And, uh, throw us a howl every now and then.
I have an idea.
Don't worry.
[ Quacking ]
Well, look at Paddy.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
Isrft it kind of a duck thing?
Blech!
And so is Forange sauce.
Paddy, enough with that!
I have to get it out of my system.
Oh, gosh, is that What you're doing?
I drink out of this lake.
Unlucky you.
Uh, Paddy, Humphrey has a task for us.
Hurry!
Will the stuffed goose please stop pressuring me?
Uh, the pups are no longer pups, my friend.
You and Kate must learn to let them go.
I'll never forget when my mama gathered me in her maternal Wings... and threw me off the nest.
Ah, all cleaned out.
That's more than I needed to know.
The parents are dealing with maturing pups.
They're always getting into trouble.
Hmm.
Sounds like a family trait.
But no judgment, by the Way.
Please, guys, just some air reconnaissance.
[ Quacks ]
That sounded like Paddy.
Uncle Paddy, is that you?
[Sighs ] Never send a duck to do a gooses job.
Uncle Marcel, stop following us!
Oh, I was, uh, trying to catch a field mouse.
Yeah, right.
Did our parents put you up to this?
My beak is sealed!
[ Marcel Honking]
[Grunting Groans]
If we're being honked at, vve tend to move.
Well, Where is Runt?
Hello?
Hello?
I Wanted to thank you for the other day.
You helped me find my brother.
Can I come up?
Is that okay?
Please dorft.
Okay, we're making progress here.
I just Want to say hi.
I dorft Want any visitors.
Almost there.
Okay, used to that wind already.
Bringing... a housewarming gift.
It's simple, but ifs, um, art.
Look at the texture.
It says, "Life... is a rough-"
I am not afraid.
I am king of the forest.
Wow, that sounded pretty good.
Boring.
Doesrft scare me!
I once fought a bear... cub at Rabbit Poo Mountain!
" [ GTOMAS]
- Ah!
You've been to Rabbit Poo Mountain?
Yes.
Who are you?
Come back tomorrow.
So, um, I'm free to leave?
Yes, but move quickly.
Flea alert.
We let one in, and now we've got the whole pack to deal with.
Well, if it isn't wolf squared.
Look, tasty prey.
And so plump.
- What'?
- Should we take 'em clown'?
I wonder hovv- [ Enunciating ] they would taste.
[ Freida ] Gross me out.
Psych!
I woulclr?
t eat a wolf.
Like, disgusting.
Are they sneering at us?
[snarling]
Okay, that critter just gave me a territorial challenge.
Go ahead, show the porcupine vvhds top dog.
- [ Freida Gasps]
- He's marking my favorite tree?
Oh, gross!
You know, in this lighting, they're almost cute.
That does it.
[snarling]
Great.
They were supposed to run out of the woods.
Wait.
I Went first last time.
Okay, put your paw out.
Ready?
Leaf, teeth, rock.
I won!
Take that.
Just like last time.
[ Wind Howling]
[ Screaming ]
[ Together ] Come again!
[Chattering ]
- Order, order!
- Speak.
Winston, Tony, we ventured into Shadow Forest, ancl we saw for ourselves... that forest is haunted!
- [ All Laughing]
- There is a ghost of a wolf.
- Where?
- It was this image in the trees.
Been telling your stories lately?
[ Lyle 1 And there are these two Witches.
- Witches?
- Yeah, these two porcupines.
[All Laughing]
Do you mind?
I was having a nice dream about a moonlight howl.
No one believed us.
Yeah, it stunk.
Novv back to my dream, and you're not in it.
And now vve look pathetic to our pack.
Try to sleep it off.
If we chase out the ghost, we will be heroes.
We'll need more wolves.
[ Panting ]
[Grunts]
[No Audible Dialogue]
Hey there.
Runt. isn't it a little late for you to be out'?
I had to, uh- you know.
[ Laughs ] Get back to your cave.
What's going on?
Mmm.
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
By the way, What exactly did you see in Shadow Forest?
Anything unusual?
Uh, no.
Nothing.
[ Growls ]
Actually, yeah.
There, um
- There was something way clown by the river.
- Like what'?
- Something strange clown there.
[ Grunts ] Hello?
Hello.
Um, excuse me?
[ Stammers ] Sorry to bother you so late.
- I need to tell you something.
- Come here.
[Grunting]
Are you hiding from another pack?
Yes.
Because, uh-
Because a wolf who oarTt see isn't considered useful to some'?
Yes.
Then hovv did you know Where my brother was that day?
I heard a splash, and, well, I have other talents.
How (Xvi you get up here'?
[ Barking In Distance]
- You brought them'?
- No, I came to warn you!
They'll come after you.
You know how to get to Rabbit Poo Mountain.
- Yes.
- Can you take me there?
Daria?
Are you kidding?
He's a pup!
I am not a pup!
I just look like one.
My name is Runt.
What's at Rabbit Poo Mountain?
[ Head Wolf] She carft possibly raise future hunters... when one of those pups is-
[ Growls ]
[Loud Growling]
[ Roaring ]
It is the Way of the pack.
[ Barking In Distance]
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
[ Barking ]
[ Grunts ] Psst!
Psst!
Come with me.
I know a safe place.
I just Want to hear her voice.
- Once.
- [ Barking In Distance]
I told them to go to the river.
So you did bring 'em here.
No.
Daria, we have to leave.
It's a trap.
He's still a vvolf.
[ Barking ]
[ Lyle 1 Something is up there.
If we storm it all at once, we can get to it.
Okay, follow me!
Push on, Brother!
No ghost.
Yeah.
But maybe-
[All Gasping, Screaming]
- [ All Whining]
- Whds next?
[All Whimpering]
Waterfall.
Oh, pretty waterfall.
Major waterfall!
[ Gasps ]
[ Gasps ]
- Kate.
- Humphrey, vvha-
[ Yawns ] What is it?
Oh, full moon.
[Giggling]
Runt?
Where'd he go?
Hmm.
I'll get Lilly to cub Watch.
Right this way, Daria.
[ Branches Scraping ]
Okay, we've got problems.
Floyd, follow me.
Every time we try to get out, we get blookecl.
It's like the forest doesrft Want you to leave.
- Mmm.
No comment.
- Just get us out of here.
I'm trying.
Floyd, up and over the rocks!
[ Wind Howling]
Okay, jump!
- No, I carft.
- Jump!
Daria, ifs okay.
Straight ahead!
I... carft.
[Grunts]
[Grunting]
This Way to Rabbit Poo Mountain.
Quickly!
Don't you wolves know when to quit'?
L-lave you seen a small wolf'?
Runt'?
- Yeah.
- Well, Where is he?
He's fine.
He's on a mission.
What kind of a mission?
Where?
- Carft say.
- This is our son.
Not our problem.
You two better pipe up, or you're going to be our future appetizer!
Oh, now we see where the daughter got her obnoxious personality.
Mm-hmm.
Look, I get it.
You're bitter because you have quills, and no one wants to touch you.
[ Both Gasping ]
But we need to find our pup.
Now!
First of all, Runt is not a pup.
He is a stand-up wolf.
[ Fran ] And he is helping a friend of ours.
Okay?
Okay.
We Want to help him and help his friend.
I promise.
We both promise.
Oh, girlfriend.
We are close to seeing the two dogs beg.
Let's see it.
Come on now.
What?
Beg?
I will never.
[Whining]
[ Floyd ] Daria, stay to your right.
[ Daria ] Ouch!
- Your other right!
- Ouch!
Aw, at this pace, it'll take us overnight to get there.
My parents will come after me if they figure out I'm gone.
Oh, great.
The non-pup pup has a curfew.
- [ Runt ] Ouch.
- [ Floyd ] That vvasrft me.
[ Daria ] That was me.
I stepped on his paw.
It's all right.
I know a shortcut to Rabbit Poo Mountain.
Follow me.
We've gotta keep going.
I carft even feel my legs.
Runt, get me a leaf to chew on.
My blood sugar is plummeting.
[ Groans ]
Wake up!
Wake up.
You carft rest here.
[Sighs]
This surface is so warm.
[ Giggling ]
Yeah, and it'll be even Warmer when you're road kill.
Just a twig and maybe throw in a few pine needles.
[Loud Sighing]
Okay, coming up.
Daria, I'll be right there.
I'm not going anywhere.
- [ Groans ]
- Hey, you are okay, right?
Yeah, I can feel it on my back.
- Feel What?
- [ Mimicking Vibration]
[Rumbling]
Move off the road!
Move off!
You're no fun.
It feels so good.
[ Gasps 1 Yes!
- [ Daria] Floyd, right now!
- [ Gasps ]
[ Shouts ]
We have to move!
- Oh, Where are you?
- [ Floyd ] Oh, baby.
- Keep talking!
- That is one strong back pounding.
Get up, get UP!
- Floyd!
- What the-
Whoa!
I just had a dream I was run over.
Hmm!
[ Floyd Screaming ]
[ Runt ] We're very close.
[ Floyd ] I've been hearing that for an awfully long time.
I'm not complaining, but- Hmm.
This is the only route I know.
My dad knows all the real short cuts.
[Humphrey] Yes, I do.
Runt?
You are so busted!
Dad, Mom, I, uh-
Son, Son.
We're here to help you.
Okay, Dana.
I see your pack.
They'll take me back, right?
Why vvouldrft they?
They were Worried she vvouldrft be able to take care of me when I was a pup... but I made it.
Okay, Daria, I will lead, you follow close behind.
I have to hear her voice.
I'll know it immediately.
Uh, hi there.
We're from the western pack.
We're just passing through.
I think that is Winstorfs daughter.
Yeah, yeah, we're a long vvays away.
Just a road trip.
- Who's your friend there?
- Oh, she is shy.
I'll be right back.
So, um-
[ Stammering ] Are there any other female wolves here'?
No, just us.
Dad, look!
We have to do something.
No, Runt.
Not until your mother signals me.
[ Chuckles ] Well, better get going.
- [Grunts]
- Runt!
What the heck?
Is he crazy?
[Panting] I, uh-
Have you seen my mommy?
Oh, little pup.
isn't that her with-
Hi there!
[Laughs] Hey, Runt, come on now.
Let's not bother Mr. King.
Wait, wait!
Yes?
You' re Dana, arerft you'?
It's okay.
I... just Wanted to say hi.
Who are you?
You are married to Winstorfs daughter.
You're an Omega, right?
Last time I checked.
Well, we've taken up too much of your good time.
I mean, you're king of Rabbit Poo Mountain, and, uh, mmm, smell that fresh poo.
Daria, Mom never made it back.
But I want you to know, she loved you.
She vowed to protect all of us.
I needed to hear that.
The rules of this pack are still the same.
But maybe I can come visit you and your pack some time?
Runt?
Shall we?
See you later.
- What is it?
- I hear something.
Sounds like wolves.
I hear three of them.
Okay, Daria, we gotta get you out of here.
Hey there, all of you!
- Let's go.
- No.
I'm tired of hiding.
What did you do with my mother?
[Growling]
[ Barks ]
[Grunts]
[Growling]
[Whimpers]
[ Shouts ]
[Growling]
She's gone, Daria, and she's paid the highest price for hiding you!
Daria, we have to get you into the forest.
You'll be protected there.
Follow me!
Listen for my footsteps, okay?
Dariafs in trouble!
[Growling]
Daria, jump!
[ Gasps ]
[Loud Growling]
[ Screaming ]
Okay.
That was beyond twisted.
We're okay, Dana.
We're okay.
Thank you.
Okay, Winston.
This is our favorite part, the Valley of the Forest.
This is where we are from.
So, you're valley girls.
Yeah, totally.
Oh, look vvhds here.
Grandpa Winston, I want you to meet a friend of mine.
My name is Daria.
Dariafs been living up there.
Alone.
Way up there, I bet the views are wonderful.
Oh, my bad.
That is Saw Tooth Cave.
And here I thought your story was a bunch of deer dung.
But that still doesht explain the ghost.
Trust me, ifs here.
- And those are the two Witches.
- [ Giggling ]
Grandpa, I'm Willing to bet if there is a ghost... it was only to protect Daria.
[ Wind Rust/mg]
She needs a pack.
She needs us.
And if vve don't accept her, I believe we'll continue to be... haunted.
Well, it will require adjustments.
Dad, she has amazing hearing.
It will be great for hunts.
Why does it always circle back to hunts with these wolves?
Come on.
Let's Welcome Daria.
After all, you heard it yourself from the king of the forest.
[ Wind Rust/mg]
You know, Runt, clon't think we clicln't notice you were out all night.
Yeah, Son, Way past your curfew.
I'll take my licks.
[Giggling] Mom, Dad!
Is this any Way to treat the king of the forest?
- [ Laughing] - [ Laughing 1 Get Orr!
Not on my face!
Dad!

Hey, hey, Tuck, dude.
- Okay, we're rolling.
-Okay, hold on.
B-Before you go, look-look at my coat.
- It's cool, huh?
- What is that?
Can we do another take with it on, though?
No.
Okay.
- Ready when you are.
Okay.
How do I smell?
Or I mean, look, or you know?
Yeah, you can't smell a video.
Okay.
- Ruckus, dude, you got to get out of here.
Hi, I'm Reginald.
I don't really get friends much, but it's probably because I'm a bit of... an acquired taste.
That's what my mom says.
And I'm sure whatever school I'm forced to go to o one will acquire it.
So... thanks for paving a road over, really, the only place I've ever had any real friends.
Okay, we good?
- Uh, say your name.
- I thought you knew my name.
You know what I mean;
for the video.
Dude, we've been hanging out for years.
- Come on.
- Dude, stop fronting.
Just tell the camera.
You're upset, right?
You don't want to move.
I've never gone a day without seeing my friends.
They're, like, the only people in the world who get me.
And now it's just all over, you know?
Good luck finding that again.
So wherever-wherever Munch is going, man... look, you people listen to me, all right?
He's-he's a really good kid.
So don't just assume that he's weird and that's it.
And Alex, man...
He's a foster kid.
He's been moved all over.
I mean, it's like, why do you have to build a freeway right through?
You know, can't you just go around or something?
You're going along feeling like your own person with your own friends, and then something like this comes along that you have no power to stop because you're just a kid.
You're just a kid.
Yeah, hey, man.
Yeah, yeah, I'm up, I'm up.
Whoa, whoa, man, slow down.
What's the problem?
Yeah, my-my phone's good.
Why?
What happened?
- Wait, what?
This is when everything started to change.
So, being me,
I kept filming.
I'm Tuck.
What you're about to see happened to me and my best friends one year ago.
This is the story of our last week together.
--Phones all over our neighborhood are freaking out.
We've done everything we could possibly do with this phone.
We threw it at the wall, we took it to the phone guy, we took it to the store where we got it from, and they say it's a problem.
So you know it's serious.
It looks like your phone basically barfed on the screen.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I was just eating dinner, and all of a sudden, all the phones in the house just did this.
At exactly the same time.
Dude.
- What?
It's freaky.
De hello?
Hey, Alex.
Oh, Munch, you're outside.
Get over here, over here, down the street.
Ask him if his phone barfed yet.
Did your phone barf yet?
- Phones are still working.
- Cool.
Keep going, and we'll meet you in the backyard.
Okay, copy that.
I'll take swift steps.
When I look back at that day,
I realize the clues were all around us.
We had no idea.
Dude, they all still work.
See?
Dude, you know if this whole thing works,
- these phones are done.
- No, I know.
- I have 14 spares; it's okay.
- I bet you do.
- Okay.
All right, anyways, let's spread out.
- Okay.
- Alex, go by the gate.
Munch, go on the far end,
- Yeah, I got it.
- and I'll stay right here
- Just watch out!
- by my camera.
Okay, okay.
Okay, it's good.
It's good...
It's good...
--Whoa, okay, it went out.
Whoa, whoa, it barfed!
All right, people, if you go to Alex's house, your phones will spew chunks all over his screen.
My mom said the Murphys' phones and the Churleys' changed, too.
So what do you think this is?
Whoa!
These dudes.
--Hi.
- Is that on?
- I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Oh.
We had an electrical short over at the site, and it may be disrupting people's phone service, and we're wondering if that happened
- to anybody in this house?
- Oh, no, my phone is good.
- 'Cause we're offering new phone vouchers
- Uh-huh.
in exchange for any device in this area here
- that may be displaying
- That's weird, that's weird.
- faulty messages or images?
- I don't know.
See you.
No, listen, I...
Okay, so you-you really don't think this is a little bit weird?
These dudes come here to build a freeway
- and now they want our phones?
- Well, I think it's gonna work.
No.
Clean your room.
Oh, my...
I'm not gonna have a room if we don't do something.
- Right, I think...
- No, Mom, seriously.
These guys want our houses.
Maybe if expose them for illegal property, then...
Yo!
- Aw, you don't like how things are, do you?
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
--Dude, it's a map to the desert.
Like, what is that?
What do we do with this?
I guess most maps are made to be followed.
Exactly.
It could go to, like, some crazy headquarters, and we find out that these construction clowns are spies and we expose them to the world.
It's 20 miles away.
What...
No, we're not...
we're not gonna go.
No, obviously not.
Look, whatever it is, this Saturday, we're going to sneak behind our parents' backs and find out.
I'm moving Saturday.
All right, all right, so Friday night.
Our last night together?
It doesn't have to be;
that's what I'm saying.
Like, I don't want to move, and these clowns are making us do it.
Maybe we can stop them.
Now, are you in?
Yeah, all right.
- All right.
- I'm in.
Munch, don't you bail out on us now.
Dude, I'm not.
Me?
No... pfft!
I'm in.
Yeah!
All right!
That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, all right.
Bring it in.
- Oh, oops!
- Munch!
So, why would you be organizing your ketchups?
- Because.
- Who does that?
So I can get to them easier, and then it's more organized,
- and it's better.
- And you are my friend.
Guys, guys, it's time to practice the big lie.
Hey, Mom, I'm spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a neat, brand-new video game.
And I'm sleeping over at Tuck's house so we can play a new video game.
And I'm sleeping in your mom's bed, ot playing a video game.
- Oh, my God, all right, dude.
Stop talking about my mother, thank you.
All right, the camera's are gonna be on 24 hours a day, nonstop.
Dude, can you stop touching, please?
It attaches to my bike, and it's also a pretty good way to get footage on the fly.
Spy glasses.
I love these;
I love them.
And last, camera, but definitely not least...
What up, camcorder?
Keeping it tight.
Looking pretty good these days.
Tuck, these are the ugliest things I've ever seen.
Dude, what?
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Those are...
They're sweet.
- The camera's undetectable,
- Wow.
- and the ladies love them.
- Prove it.
Prove it?
This guy, all right?
Give me my glasses, man.
Those are stealth.
Now I'm gonna prove to you guys spy glasses get you girls.
Oh, my gosh, he's going over there.
- I can't see who he's talking to.
- Shut up, Munch.
Uh, hi, uh...
Hey, um, Em-Emma, right?
Emma?
I was just...
Okay, uh, can I borrow a piece of paper, please?
He has something.
- I can't see who he got it from.
- We're about to see right now.
Look, look, look, look.
He has a paper.
You did not get her number.
Totally got her number.
Right there.
You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.
You, too, you're a sellout.
No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.
Yes, I did.
Mannequin Girl?
What kind of name is that?
What?
That's what I call her.
I think mannequins are hot.
- I'll leave my house at 6:00.
15 minutes later, I pick up Alex.
- Munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Tonight, we're no longer boys.
We're men.
- Dude, what the...?
- I didn't see you, man.
- Tuck, you all right?
- Let's go.
Our whole lives we've been nobodies.
Invisible.
The good kids.
Not anymore.
All right, Ma.
I'm leaving.
Spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a new video game.
Have whatever you want, honey.
You know what, I lied, actually.
We're gonna ride our bikes out into the desert at night alone.
Without supervision.
We got that;
we're going to state.
Okay, see you then, sweetie.
- We could go.
- Also rob a bank.
- All the way.
State.
- What?
Go to Mexico.
Maybe even start a new life.
- Right, I know.
- Wrestling!
You're trying to act like I don't know what I'm talking about.
What's up, Stumpy?
Yo, man, I told you to stop to calling me that.
You know what, man, look, my girl's throwing this huge party later tonight, if you want to come by.
You serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
Because not a lady in the world can resist a natty old BMX bike.
What's the zero to 60 on that bad boy, huh?
Two, three days?
Come on, come on, dude, you ready?
Let's go.
I can't even tell a difference.
This looks exactly the way it looked before you packed.
All your stuff fitting in one box?
What are you, a drifter?
Who told you?
Look, all I'm saying is, when you get to your new house, put a poster up, put some shelves on the wall, frame a photo.
Look, there's a painting right there.
Put something on a shelf...
That's not a painting.
That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt, smudged it and called it art.
I'm going to Munch's house to play a video game, all right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure, buddy.
- Bye, Dylan.
- Have fun with your friends.
- Hey, hey, Tuck.
- How are you?
Uh, good luck with the move to New York, buddy.
- Maybe we'll come see you.
- All right, cool.
The moving truck is coming at 10:00.
Make sure you're back, okay?
I-I don't get it.
If your foster parents already have a baby of their own, why do they need you?
There's no sense in having two babies.
- Shut up, dude.
- One baby cries all the time, the other one listens to indie rock.
Let's go.
Yeow!
Guys, would you please help my son with his room, before I go crazy?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I don't think he's started...
Honey, have you even started packing your room?
I told you a thousand times,
I'm alphabetizing!
Yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.
Shh.
...they're flexible, they're "dynamical,"
they can be curved, they can bend, and this opens up a whole new universe of possibilities, and one of the possibilities is that there can be shortcuts through space and through time.
So that's really just what a wormhole is.
It's taking advantage...
What are you...
Aah!
- Why don't you stop doing that?
!
- I'm sorry!
You guys are gonna give me a heart attack one day.
- I'm sorry.
- Turn that off, dude.
--I created substation for each of our parents' phones that's wired to the router, which is wired to the transmitter, which transmits to the receiver, which is...
- my phone.
- Okay, so basically, o matter who our parents call, it goes to your phone.
Yeah.
My mom's friends always say that I sound just like my mom, you know,
- when I pick up the phone...
- Yeah.
so I figured, I can be Betty.
Bye, Betty.
Thank you.
Um, I'm going to Alex's...
or Munch's... or Tuck's house, and we're gonna play a video game and sleep over.
Wait, what's all that stuff?
Honey?
Good job, Munch.
You did it.
Here we come.
17.6 miles.
♪ Going to the desert... ♪
Munch, what are you doing?
Guys, guys, just hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Dude...
- I'm not backing out or anything,
- He wants to quit right when we - ...just-just hear me out.
- been waiting for this forever.
- Dude, listen, come on, okay.
This is crazy what we're doing.
Dude, I don't want to punk out or back out or anything-- it's just, my mom, you know, she just got divorced.
- Munch...
- She's already had enough guys lying to her.
If you didn't want to come, then why didn't you tell us earlier?
You do understand this is our last night together.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Look, Munch, if we don't go now, we'll never go.
We won't even be here.
This is our last chance to try and do something.
Even-even if it is stupid.
- Yeah.
- You know what,
I say we put a vote to it.
All in favor raise your hand.
Well, now I have to raise my hand.
Munch, just...
Fine, fine.
Okay, whatever.
I'll go.
But only under one condition.
- I call the black!
- Mine!
No, no!
No, give it!
It's so weird, no one's gonna be in these houses next week.
Dude, you're so full of it.
- When did you kiss her?
- Dude, trust me.
After pre-algebra, she pulled me into the bathroom.
Wait, wait, wait, wait-- Mannequin Girl?
- Yeah!
- Was she good at it?
Uh, eh, B minus.
You know, I've kissed better in better locations.
No, how do I know you're not lying?
Trust me.
I don't even have to reply to you.
- You're last!
Hey, you got a head start!
That's not fair!
Oh, so what, there's a Wing Stop?
I never been to a Wing Stop.
We followed a map out in the middle of nowhere.
It might be, like, a CIA prison.
We were miles from home.
No one in the world knew it.
No one said it... but we were scared.
We haven't seen a car in, like, half an hour.
We were on our own.
This-this is the way, right?
You have the map, right?
- Can I see the map?
- Left.
Left?
Are you sure?
Because right looks a little bit more promising.
--Did you guys hear that?
Just a couple more miles.
Hold on.
What is that?
It's the map.
Are we close?
I never understood why people like the outdoors.
Will you stop freaking out?
Yo, this is too steep, man.
Let's go, man.
We're getting pretty far from the road, guys.
Almost there.
Is it this thing?
I don't think so.
Wait, what was that?
- I don't know.
- Well, hold on.
What'd you see, dude?
- Over here!
We're almost there.
Come on.
Oh.
What?
What do you think it is?
How would I know?
Why does it look all burnt?
Hey, just be careful.
- Careful!
- Yeah, don't touch that thing.
Could be...
C-Could be...
I don't know, I don't know.
A part of a satellite?
All right, all right, um, Munch, film me while I'm...
- while I'm touching this thing.
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Let me try it.
Thank you.
It's dusty.
It's a piece of crap.
What?
Forget about it.
Just turn off the camera.
Well, it's not a national treasure, but it could be used for something.
It's crap.
What happened to filming 'cause it's our last night, huh?
Um, in case you haven't noticed, obviously,
the map led to squat.
Got it.
So all you cared about was getting your stupid hits on your stupid video?
- Dude, why don't you just...
- Whoa, guys, guys, guys.
Come on!
I know we're all frustrated...
--It's Alex's mom.
- Are you serious?
- Um, it'll be fine.
Just, um, be Betty, okay?
- Oh, man.
- Oh, crap.
Yo, I thought I could do this, but I can't.
Maybe you can answer it.
She just likes to check up on things, okay?
All right.
Betty, are you there?
Go.
This is Betty.
I was thinking maybe I could bring over some pizzas?
Dude, go.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No coming over.
- Just hang up.
- No way.
No, it's really no trouble.
We have a coupon.
- I said no!
No pizzas!
- What?
- o, uh...
- Don't yell at her, man.
Maybe you and your husband should go to bed.
Stop saying words!
Are you sure everything's okay?
Have a good night.
Go to sleep.
That could've gone better.
That was horrible.
"Your husband should go to sleep"?
Was that really something smart to say?
Munch.
Don't look at me like I'm a hoarder.
That's rude.
Who are they?
I don't...
I don't know.
I'm picking up some spikes in the readings...
Get down, get down.
- They're turning a flashlight off, dummy.
- Let's go.
Why would they be out this far?
Who cares?
The night's blown.
- Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
Munch?
- You're a character.
- There's something in there!
What?
Dude, are you kidding me right now?
Something is in that bag.
It-it touched me.
Go check.
Be-be careful.
- What?
- Did it poke you, too?
What, dude?
Say something!
What did you see?
There-There's something in there.
Yeah, a bunch of crap Munch brought.
- You guys are funny.
- All I know is it beeped.
You know, why don't you go in there and just see.
Beeped?
What are you talking about?
Babies.
I'll do it myself.
Dang, how much stuff do you have in your bag, dude?
Geez.
Oh, boy, are you guys talking about this?
It's garbage.
It's nothing.
What are you talking about, you heard something?
It made a noise.
Hey, hey, do something!
See, it's not doing anything.
What are you talking about?
Beep.
Do that again, do that again.
Do what again?
Do what you just did.
- Beep.
Whoa, hold on.
Let me...
Let me try this for myself.
Beep.
Beep?
Why is it making noise only for you and not me?
Make it beep again.
Beep.
--Whoa!
This is it!
It's a bomb!
No, no, oh, God, no!
No, no, no!
Guys, I think...
I think it might have defused.
I don't know.
Man, nothing's happening.
All right, hold on, hold on.
I got an idea.
Tuck!
What?
Okay, it didn't do anything, but j-just don't do it again.
Are you insane, Tuck?
!
Are you sure you guys know what you're doing?
Yes, trust me.
When it's a bomb, you have to act quick.
I seen it on some TV show or some movie or something.
- Saw what?
- Check it out.
What are you doing?
!
Disarming it.
Are you crazy?
!
It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.
That's not what you do with a bomb!
Are you insane?
!
--What was that?
It's not my phone.
It's the thing, whatever that is.
- What are you talking about?
- It's that.
That's what just made that noise.
I, uh...
It, like, imitated my ringtone.
This is what made our phones barf?
Did you hear that?
--Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
All right, so, a couple of seconds ago, our phones went crazy.
Bananas, insane.
I don't know what to call it.
Look.
You see that?
It's a new map, but on my phone this time.
To me?
All right, him, or...
Dude, Munch's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and, ugh, I don't even know what that is.
Alex's phone, it just turned on by itself and started filming.
We can't even turn them off.
Oh, don't try to act like it's not cool.
That is weird.
It's showing us where we are.
And you don't find that creepy?
What do you think that is?
You think that's a road?
We should follow the map.
How about no.
How about yes?
We wanted a last night together, so what do you call this?
A trap?
Didn't you guys see the "No Trespassing" sign?
Oops.
I didn't see anything.
This is where the map says to go.
Stop stepping on leaves.
There's leaves everywhere.
--Shh.
What was that?
Where do you think it's taking us to?
Maybe another one of those beepy things.
What was that?
I don't know.
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Get down!
Oh, geez!
Munch, watch out!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
What's going on?
Dude, Munch, what was that?
Where is it?
Is it over?
- Oh, geez.
Dude!
Tuck, stay back.
- Whoa.
- Stay back.
- What's...
Dude!
- Wait, wait, be careful.
Your phone just got a new map.
What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait, why is it opening?
Hold on, hold on.
Did you see that just now?
- What is that?
- Whoa!
What is that?
- What is that?
- What is that?
- Oh, my...
Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.
It-It's moving.
There's something in there right now.
What's in there?
Oh, don't tell me.
Are those... eyes?
Dude, dude, it's looking dead at us right now.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
It's trembling like it's hurt.
Good.
My heart's beating so fast right now.
Wow.
Almost got us killed, like, three times already.
Yeah, but it was worth it, dude.
Incredible.
All right, so...
I just figured out why Alex's camera was on this whole time.
So this thing, whatever it is, it's eyes are, like, all screwed up, completely.
You see?
So, basically, it uses his phone to see.
That's insane.
You think he can see us right now?
Munch, you have to check this out.
This is amazing.
Is it?
Is it amazing?
'Cause I think it's scary as balls.
I mean, obviously people are looking for it.
- Munch...
- It has access to our voicemails and our texts and our ringtones.
How do you even know it's a he?
Are you a dude?
Wait... you understood us.
Whoa.
All right, here's how it goes.
One beep is yes, two beeps are no.
Watch.
Is one beep yes?
Yo, that's so tight.
Are we in a barn?
Is Munch really a woman?
Oh, come on, man, this thing is broken.
Everybody knows Munch is a woman.
Okay, I have a question.
Are we gonna die tonight?
Why isn't it answering?
What...
Well, that's not good, right?
20 questions with an alien.
Tuck Simms exclusive.
- Let's do this.
- Check it out.
All right, um, are you from space?
--Ooh!
Are you a robot?
Do you eat humans?
Do you like Earth?
Why?
Why doesn't he like Earth?
Do you like us?
You see?
I told you.
We're cool like that.
Come on.
Are you hurt?
- Oh.
- He's hurt.
Well, his lights seem brighter, so...
Did that piece help you?
Oh.
Can we help fix you or something?
Or...
Like, what is this?
Are-are you trying to build something?
--Oh, he's trying to build...
Building something.
Right there.
- What could he be building?
- Yeah.
So, wait, what are, what are you building?
- Lasers?
- A portal?
- Minions?
- A cloaking device?
- It's an army.
Ignore him.
- Spaceship?
Oh, my God!
Hold up, hold up.
So let me get this right.
So you're building a spaceship,
- He's building a spaceship.
- and you need our help building the spaceship?
--Oh, man.
This guy is building a spaceship.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Let me make sure I don't have any plans.
Nope!
We're building a spaceship!
He's building a spaceship.
We asked him questions for almost two hours.
Where he came from.
If there were others here like him.
We found out he was lost... and alone.
He was out in the middle of nowhere, on his own, like us.
All we really knew was that he crashed, and now he needed us to rebuild him.
The map says up ahead.
Are we going the right way?
Look, look, look, look, whatever that is, the map goes to it.
All right, so wait-wait a minute.
Let me get this right.
Dude comes from a million light-years away, and he wants to come here?
I don't know, the map said so.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You got to look both ways before you cross the street.
Munch.
So are you... snoopy.
Ten dollars?
- I said no deal.
- $7.50.
I don't want it.
It's tchotchke trash.
If you give it to me as a gift, I'd still throw it away.
- It's trash.
- No, it's vintage.
No.
You don't get to say the word "vintage."
I'm the one who gets to say when what is vintage.
Excuse me, sir, you have a very, very lovely shop.
Come on, you sure?
Hey.
Oh, man, look at the hand painting.
It's all crafted right there.
- One of a kind.
- It's trash.
Uh, uh...
- What was that?
F-sharp?
No, no, no!
Come on!
Watch out!
Watch out!
- What was it?
Whoa.
Is everybody okay?
- Hey, Nichols, Nichols, are you alive?
They broke my girlfriend's lamp!
Wait, what is he doing?
- Oh.
Whoa, whoa.
Is-is that...
- Sweet babushka.
You want to sell it?
- Tuck, let's go!
Come on!
- Run!
What are you waiting for?
Dude, that place was wrecked!
Sorry again, sir!
Go!
Go!
Down here!
Let's get somewhere so we can look at him.
He's shaking.
Whoa, he's letting you touch him.
- I wouldn't, guys.
- Hey, what about here?
Here, set him on here.
- He looks scared.
Yeah, why is he all balled up?
Can't you stand?
You all right?
- Maybe he's... maybe he's just shy.
- Ooh, can you fly?
- Can you do X-ray vision?
How?
He can't see.
He doesn't even know where to look.
All right, all right, I think the question is, what can you do?
Okay, so Dr. Nichols is doing a surgical procedure with very sophisticated technology.
- Pen caps.
Clear.
Wait, I don't get it.
How is that sophisticated?
It's kind of just, like, pen caps.
I got it.
Be careful.
His legs are fragile.
- Whoa.
Get this.
Are you getting this?
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Oh, that's crazy!
So you can't fly, but you can float.
- That is so crazy!
I saw you.
I saw you grinning, man.
Stop trying to pretend like that wasn't cool.
- That was hot.
- This is crazy.
I mean, it's-it's just crazy.
- Whoa.
Don't drop it.
Huh.
- Can you see me?
- Huh, I think he likes you.
Will you show us where you live?
--All right.
Beep faster if I'm getting close.
--Is that it, right there?
Why don't I go first.
Hi.
Um, my name's Alex, and... you're-you're in-- Munch, no-- you're in my hand right now.
You know my ringtone, which is, like, insane and awesome.
Okay, um...
Hi.
I'm Tuck.
What's up?
I don't even know what to say, but, uh... but, uh, I'm from...
I'm from New York.
Uh, this is Nevada.
I don't even know, like, I like donuts,
- um...
- Donuts?
Really?
Okay, can somebody else do this?
I know, I'm going.
My name's M...
My real name is Reginald, but my friends call me Munch.
I hope we can be friends, too.
--Do you have a name?
Oh, we could call him Beep.
Dude, what-what kind of name is Beep?
Word.
We got to give him a name that's powerful, like... like Master Blaster.
He doesn't blast anything.
Peter.
Peter.
What about Peter?
Something cool, like Space Ninja or something.
Well, how is there a ninja in space?
He wouldn't be able to breathe.
- All right, all right...
- Dude, you don't know that.
Have you ever been to space?
Which name do you like?
Uh, Beep.
Why?
There it is.
- Hello.
Watch this.
Watch this.
- You can't echo...
Watch this.
Just...
Beep.
--See?
- Echo.
That's what we should call it.
Echo.
--Oh, 'cause it echoes.
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Echo, Echo, Echo.
- Echo.
Your name... is Echo.
Echo...
Echo...
I don't think he's supposed to come out of that cylinder thing.
He looks... dead.
Echo?
So then we didn't know how broken he was.
The crash hurt him worse than we thought.
- Okay, little guy... where do you want us to go?
Guys?
You know this is considered being a burglar, right?
With each new piece, he got strong.
And that's what we were gonna do-- make him stronger.
Which way?
- Around.
- In the house?
!
- Dude!
Maybe we should just knock on the door and...
We just need you to listen, sweetheart.
- Oh, man.
- You're grounding me?
Tuck, what are you doing?
Munch, go.
It's the man-- the man should choose his dance partner.
It's a stupid tradition.
Really, it's about meeting new people, and many of those were our friends' sons.
And it's embarrassing when you ignore them.
And these are life skills that we are teaching you.
- Tuck, get back.
- Putting on this dress for you doesn't change me into some perfect little homecoming queen!
Okay, no one's asking you to act like a homecoming queen.
It's at least three years away.
Now.
Go, go, go.
...by the company you keep.
It's a cliché for a reason.
I'm sure this all seems...
Guys, what are we doing?
We're gonna be trapped up here.
Everybody be quiet.
Yeah, everyone!
You got to be kidding me.
Aw, you know what?
Everyone just follow me, all right?
Don't look at anything.
Just hurry.
- Hey, Tuck, did you see this?
- No, don't...
Dude, Tuck, this is Mannequin Girl's house.
Now we can ask for permission to steal stuff, 'cause, you know, you guys are kissing buddies.
Aw, man...
It was a couple of days ago.
She probably forgot about it by now, you know?
Like, yeah, it's...
yeah, she probably forgot.
- How would she forget about it?
- I almost forgot about it...
- Oh, boy, get ready.
- Uh-oh.
Close the door.
Close the door.
--Guys...
- Dude, we just got to keep it from going crazy.
It's gonna get loud.
We'll catch it in a blanket.
- What?
- Whoa!
- Get down!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Stop letting it move!
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
How to unfold a napkin?
!
- Who cares!
- Fine!
And in no time in my life am I gonna be somewhere
- that even plays the foxtrot!
- Close the door.
--Yo, put it away, man.
Shh.
Be quiet.
- What the...?
Wait, I know you.
- Hey.
It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey, we're with Tuck.
Tuck Simms.
You know?
Remember you guys kissed?
- We what?
- Yeah, what are you talking about, huh?
Why is my room destroyed?
- Why are you filming this?
- And what is that?
- Um, it's a... it's a-a car muffler.
No.
I want to know what that is.
It's actually a spaceship.
- Munch!
- Sorry.
Uh, well, we-we were following maps, and it just happened to lead here, so we were trying to help our friend Echo-- well, he's an alien
Oh, God...
- ...that we're trying to get him on a ship.
See, look, it used to have six symbols, but now it has three, so that means we're almost there.
Crazy, right?
Munch, will you shut up?
An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?
- Nope.
- No, no.
- You did not just see that.
- Yeah, I did.
Yeah, she definitely saw it.
- Wait.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, I want to go.
- Really?
Sounds great.
What?
No.
- Dude...
- You're not part of our group, so why don't you just go play with your super rich friends...
That's kind of harsh and your ball gowns and just go eat steak or something.
- What the hell?
- Go, go, go.
Dang, dude, what was that upstairs?
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you so mad.
Yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.
All right, let's just...
don't talk about...
Nothing happened in there, all right?
You know, they say the girls you argue with
- are the ones you like.
Don't go there, bro.
--Tuck, it's over there.
Wait, it wants us to go to a bar?
Man, I say we climb in a window or find a door.
There's got to be another way.
Um, before-before we go...
I really need to get the pee out of my body.
--Let's just hope the next place isn't a bank.
I can't believe you told that girl to get lost.
- You're so dramatic.
- What about you?
You invented a whole kiss, didn't you?
Uh, first of all, for your info, it's called aspirational thinking.
You're thinking it one moment, you're living it the next.
- How's that working out?
- Oh, excuse me.
Go to the bikes.
Oh, God, oh, God.
Why is the construction man...
- Shut...
- Excuse me.
- Aw...
Hey.
I know you guys.
You're the guys... you're from the construction site, right?
Uh, with the, uh, with the camera?
Whoa-ho, wait, wait.
Why aren't you guys at home right now?
You guys weren't riding your bikes out
- around the desert, were you?
- No, of course not.
Yes.
Uh, no.
That doesn't sound too... clear.
- Uh...
- Thank God.
There you are.
- What?
Who-who are you?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Exactly!
It's like I don't even know anymore.
My mom had to drag my dad from the bar-- again!
- What?
- He likes to go there more than he likes to tuck in his own kids at night.
At least that's what my mom says.
What's she talking about?
That's her.
Eating a burrito.
She east when she's stressed.
I ask myself if that's gonna be me one day.
What do you think?
Is it?
We make mistakes and we get married and we go to bars.
And these... these are my only friends in the world,
- 'cause they see me Uh... for who I really am.
That's your mom over there?
- Do you want to meet her?
- No.
No.
No, no.
Just get home safe!
Told you guys I wanted to go.
- What the...?
Okay, so this girl, man, she'd been tailing us since her house, spying on us like some creepy stalker.
- She'd overheard our whole plan.
- She... she's crazy.
- I need the bag!
- I think I like it.
- Oh, boy, get ready.
All right, try to blend in.
Look old.
That must've been some good fake I.D.'s.
What's up, baby face?
What are you doing in here, little man?
Oh, uh, I, uh...
- Are you Randy's kid?
- Uh,
- yes, he is.
- Um, y-yeah, yeah, yeah, he's my dad... or mom.
- You know, dad.
Mom.
- Okay, dude, just go.
- Hurry up.
Emma?
Emma?
I was hanging out with this really pretty chick.
She's almost as pretty as you.
I mean... you're not pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.
Come over here.
Hop up on that stool.
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Oh, and one for his buddy here, too.
No, no, I'm all right.
Seriously, I'm all right.
- Sure, you'll like it.
- Sorry, I'm a...
I'm allergic.
Oh, you're gonna love it.
- Uh, no, no.
- You're gonna get one.
So, what happens next?
- Just give me back my bag.
- No.
Give it.
I'm serious.
Give me the bag.
Why are you being mean to me?
- Here, honey.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.
Wow, a lot of people with beards and mustaches in here, you know?
You don't understand.
Whenever you get close to the next piece, it goes crazy.
Oh, my God!
- Whoa!
Aah!
- Uh...
- Are you kidding me?
Do you guys just go around town breaking stuff?
Just keep running!
Go, go!
What was that?
I think the ship's trying to take off!
- Whoa, whoa!
Are you seeing this?
This thing is flying a ship... in your backpack?
I think he's getting better.
Oh.
So, you don't know how he crashed, or when, or why he came here with a spaceship in the first place?
Look, he only answers yes or no-- it's not that simple.
Is this how I talk to him?
- So, you crashed.
Did someone cause you to crash?
- Dude, what's she doing?
- I don't know.
- Someone on Earth?
Do you think they're looking for you?
It's not those guys in trucks from the convenience store, is it?
- The construction man?
Those are the guys that shot you down?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We got to take a step back.
This is way bigger and shadier than before, okay?
This is not good.
If those dudes are looking for Echo, they're looking for us, you know?
Echo?
You need some help there, buddy?
Hey, it's okay.
Shh.
Breathe like me, okay?
It's okay.
Dude, h-he'll be fine.
No.
We're not leaving him.
My whole life, I've been left.
I know how it feels.
We're all he's got.
- Uh, left?
- We could find a shortcut.
The map says up ahead.
This map's confusing.
I was a mind ninja back there...
So, what was it like kissing me?
- Give me my camera.
- Did your legs get all wobbly?
Was there soft music playing?
Please remind me, Tuck.
I totally forgot.
- What was it like?
- You're close.
Is this your first imaginary kiss?
The map says for us to go inside.
I'm confused.
- Huh?
- Didn't you guys kiss?
Anyway, the point is,
Emma was being annoying-- she kept walking off with Echo like she owned him, and talking to him about
I don't know what, I don't even know.
You know what?
Delete.
Man, are we sure there's no security guards or...
You know, that door wasn't even locked.
Hey, uh, guys, I was just thinking, you know,
I... haven't got to actually hold the, you know, the ship, before we did the thing, so can I do it?
- You know, before it gets crazy?
- Sure, but... it's not a ship.
What?
What are you talking about?
You told us it was a ship.
It's a key to your ship, right?
Well, if this is just the key, where's the spaceship?
--All right, Munch, put it down.
--Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.
Okay, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to put it down
- before you hurt both of us.
- I need this, man.
- That's weird.
- Does it know her?
- I don't know.
Munch!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- What are you guys doing?
- Wow.
- Um, she was gonna get hit by the piece, so I-I saved her.
Hey!
You four!
Freeze!
- Run!
- Which way?
- Tuck!
- Stop right there!
Stop!
Go, go!
Hurry up!
Hold up, hold up!
Did Alex get out?
Uh, I d...
I don't know.
- We have to go back.
- Uh...
- Come on, you guys.
- Okay.
Look.
Whoa, whoa.
She's being stupid.
There's a guard in there, you know?
You can't just go running in, acting crazy.
We need a-a plan, or... s... right?
Breaking and entering, destruction of property.
Those are felonies, kid.
Okay, Echo, I need your help.
Um, I need you to...
do something.
I have a minor here; he's 13.
Caught him breaking in with his friends.
If you could send an officer down.
Stay put.
Hello?
--Anybody there?
- Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
...there...
Is anybody there... there...
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Alex.
Alex.
- Wh-Where's Tuck?
- We got to go.
- We should've gone back.
- All right, you know what?
Calm down, because if people would've listened to me, then Alex never would have gotten caught.
Didn't I say there would be security guards?
Alex!
Dude!
You're all right!
Are you all right?
Hey, Alex, we're good, man.
All right?
- Buddy?
- We're good, man?
Alex.
Come on, dude.
Alex!
We could've gone home, but we didn't.
- We were outside.
- Turn off the camera.
Not till you admit you're acting mopey for no reason.
You're always freaking out if anyone's gonna leave you behind.
Do you know how expensive that is?
I'm glad I'm moving.
You were never my friend.
- Is that right?
Is that right?
- Guys, guys,
- come on, just-just chill out.
- Come on!
Have you lost your mind?
I acted like I didn't know what I'd done.
But I knew exactly.
I know we're all tired and stuff, and hungry.
I saw this awesome diner.
We can totally just go grab
- a bite to eat or something.
- Real awesome, guys.
- Real macho.
So, that's it?
The night's over?
Doesn't have to be.
Right?
Well, I mean, if it is, uh, we could...
I don't know, I guess we can keep the mood going, yeah?
Or we can do it another time, right?
Good times, the continuation, part two.
Right?
Hmm.
You know what?
I'm gonna talk about Sandra.
Man, that girl used to beat the crap out of you.
Me, too.
We were both little, small and scrawny.
She was a big girl, and she knew it.
But then I had a growth spurt, and you didn't, and I finally did something.
You remember that?
You told her I had polio.
Yeah, I told her that, and did she beat you up after that?
She still beat me up.
'Cause I-I always get your back, man.
I never let you down;
I always get your back.
Most of the time.
Just when I'm not freaked out about security guards, all right?
I'm sorry, man.
Are we good?
Yeah.
Dude.
Faster.
Sure are doing some traveling tonight.
My parents are in the bathroom.
Uh-huh.
Let it go.
What are you doing?
- Dude!
Hey, what are you doing?
!
- Oh, God!
Don't grab our stuff like that!
- Stop!
- Hey, give me the backpack!
- Who do you think you are?
- The police have been instructed to come and pick up these kids and take them home.
He can't just walk away.
- What was it?
The phone.
o, no, no!
- Munch!
-Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
Oh, my...
Munch!
This is not real, this is not real, this is not real right now.
- Don't let them see you.
--Now!
Munch!
Do you see the truck?
Munch!
Munch!
That guy is not a construction worker.
- It's Munch.
- I need help, guys.
I really didn't think this through.
We're here, we're here.
Are you hurt?
Can you guys hear me...?
- Are you okay?
- Where are you, Munch?
We'll find you, all right?
I promise.
I think I'm at the construction site.
- Come on, buddy.
- Munch!
I can see the big lights and up at those...
- the white trucks...
How far is your neighborhood?
It's way over an hour.
All right, I think I got a faster way.
Who wants to go to a party?
Are you sure he'll even be here?
Better be.
His girlfriend's throwing it.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Sophomores.
Hey, sweet party.
Sweet jams.
Guys, what are we doing here?
We can't be...
Just look for my brother.
Look for his keys.
- Oh, my gosh, it's the cops.
- Okay.
Oh, God, the keys, the keys.
I lost my keys.
I have a Porsche.
Marcus!
Oh, not you, sorry.
I wasn't trying to stop the fun-
- I like it.
- Whoa...!
Hi.
Uh, sorry to bother everyone.
Have you seen my brother, Marcus?
Tall guy?
You seen his car keys?
- Uh, anyone?
- Guys, the cops are here!
- What?
- Yeah, the cops are here.
- Turn it down, turn it down.
- Dude, stop...
No, I'm serious, the cops are here right now.
Alex!
Alex!
--We have to go now.
All right, just come on, come on.
We got to move.
Hurry, hurry.
We can't hide here.
Look, look, just stay here.
He's my brother;
I'll find him.
Just... don't let the cops take the footage.
All right?
You live here, right?
The cops!
Marcus?
Marcus, we're here.
The party's shut down.
That's enough.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Tuck's gonna freak.
Uh, here, check his pockets.
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.
Cops are gone.
- Uh, Tuck, Tuck?
- I have no idea where Marcus is.
Yeah.
Tell me you got that on tape?
My name is Reginald "Munch" Barrett.
This is my...
kind of my final message.
To my best friends...
I love you, guys.
You're Googling it?
Really?
Oh, come on, this is what the Internet is for.
Um, "step one, get a driver's license."
- Do we have one of those?
- Oh, wow.
All right, am I good?
--Stop!
Stop!
All right, all right.
Dude, do you even know what you're doing?
No, I don't.
"Step two, be calm."
--What are you doing?
!
- Sorry, sorry.
- Be calm is step two?
All right, all right, all right.
I got it, I got it.
- Hold on a sec..
- Stop!
- Tuck, Tuck, turn!
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.
- Uh...
- Oh, my God.
We're good, we're good.
All right, I'm excited.
Should I gun it?
- No, no, no, don't.
- No, Tuck.
I need, I need music.
Somebody just play some music.
- All right.
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my God.
Change it.
Everywhere we'd been that night, shot by us like a rocket.
All we wanted was our friends back.
I'm gonna miss it here, man.
Yeah, me too.
Here we go.
I don't know about this.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
That does not look like a freeway.
- Get down.
Shh, shh.
All right, so what's the plan?
I don't know.
Get him out?
So, in other words, we don't have a plan.
Go, go, go.
I'm just gonna call Munch's phone and see if his phone rings.
Wait a minute.
Dude, my camera's not a doorstop.
I hear his voice.
Shh.
I-I knew it was you guys 'cause I saw the same truck from my neighborhood.
Tell us the truth.
I-I had a lot of adrenaline rush, and...
I...
I didn't want the night to end.
And I... and it was the last night with Alex.
Oh, shit, Munch.
Stop crying and talk to us.
This is not good.
I'm not...
I'm not crying!
What?
Where is that?
We got to find him and get him out of there, man.
- Just don't kill me!
Did he access your phones at all?
Were there others like it or was this the only one you found?
What are they doing?
Dude, they're breaking him!
Guys?
Guys, someone's coming.
We should go.
Go, go.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, construction man!
- Give me the camera.
- Listen...
This is not your camera.
Hey, guys, go!
- And find Munch!
- Let go of me!
Get off of us, man, this isn't...
- My camera!
- Let go.
Is that thing still on?
Okay, no more lies.
No more sneaking around.
No more cameras, understand?
Son, look at me.
Look at me.
Oh, I-I see better with my glasses on,
you know?
This signal has been transmitting for a very long time, from a ship that we believe is located right here in your neighborhood.
What?
Wait, what-what's he talking about?
Six days ago, an object entered our atmosphere at 20,000 miles an hour, on a direct course for that ship.
We shot it down.
What you found activates the ship, and if that ship takes off, it could kill everyone.
He just wants to go home.
Okay, that will not happen.
He is far too valuable.
This is crazy, this is crazy.
So... we are gonna follow this map and you are gonna help us get that thing operational, and it will lead us back to its ship, and we will disable it permanently.
Am I clear?
--Am I clear?
Y-Yeah.
Good.
Check the doors, check the doors.
It's locked;
it's not just locked.
They don't have a handle on it.
- Someone help!
- Where are they taking us?
--Hey, yo!
Let us out, man!
Someone!
Well, the sun's up.
Our parents are gonna find out.
I think we got bigger problems than our parents.
Where are we?
Let's go!
All right, everybody knows the drill.
Let's set it up.
- He's not moving.
- Stop!
Can you see me?
Beep?
We're all here.
We're gonna get you home, all right?
We'll find a way.
Nichols, man, it's not there.
No.
Please, you have to work.
Just try.
Echo?
Don't!
Echo!
You can't go; you can't!
It's over.
Let's keep them quiet.
Come on, man.
It's...
It's time to go.
What's happening?
What is that?
Here he goes.
Back up.
Get ready.
Whoa.
Okay, now!
Where are we going?
Home!
His ship's in Mulberry Woods.
Dude, go!
How do I drive?
Will you drive?
!
Please drive!
Just hurry up!
Alex, dude, you don't have your seat belt on!
- Just speed up!
- Just go!
--Go, go, go, go, go!
They're right there!
You have to speed!
- I'm trying!
- You're driving...!
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
- Tuck, you're gonna
- get us killed!
- Where do I go?
- Just go around them.
o, hold on.
- Don't go on the wrong side!
Dude, stop, stop!
- Oh!
- What the...?
- Oh, my gosh.
- Whoa, whoa!
Are you...
Are you seeing this?
Thanks, buddy.
I need an Advil.
We can't afford this right now.
We really can't afford this right now.
Dude, look, there's a new map.
A what?
Here, here, give me the phones back.
I think that's his ship.
Whoa, that's a big ship.
Alex, I don't want to stress you out or anything, but they're right there!
- Oh, my God.
Alex, it's your mom.
- Don't answer it.
- Why would I answer it?
- Betty?
- Dude.
Munch.
Betty?
Hi.
- Sorry about my tone last night.
- Oh, I just thought it would be nice to have the boys have a nice night
- together before we're all uprooted.
- You're crying.
- Munch, it's your mom.
- What?
!
Look, look, look, look.
Dude.
You okay?
So, uh, Janice, gotta go-- on my jog.
Can we act like we never had this conversation?
Uh, uh, just come over this wall.
Are you up?
- Guys, they're here.
- Jump.
- Move!
- Faster!
They can't catch us in our own backyard.
Let's cut them off.
Munch, hurry up!
- Okay, okay.
- Munch!
Well, I don't jump walls very much, man!
Here, hold my camera.
Dude, come on, come on, come on.
o, no, no, no, no!
- Tuck, wait!
They're right behind us!
Come on, guys, we got to go, we got to go.
Let's go, right now.
It's down the hill.
Come on, let's go!
Shh.
Go, go, go.
It says the ship is up ahead.
This is the way to your house, man.
- Go, go, go, guys!
- Are your parents awake?
I think we...
I think we lost them.
--Okay.
I don't...
I don't get it.
I...
This is where the map ends.
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship.
Maybe it's invisible.
What is it?
Wait, what-what's he talking about?
What do you want us to...
Dude, what?
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa...
- Oh.
Everybody good?
What's down there?
Be careful, man.
What?
That's it.
Dude, it-it's underneath.
So this whole time...
That's why they want all our houses.
They were digging.
Yo, Alex, I know what you're thinking.
Alex!
Alex, man!
Th-The only way that thing can take off is to come up out of the ground through us.
That's a really bad idea.
Dude, what are you doing?
This is not just about us anymore.
It's about other people now, a whole community still asleep in their beds.
Let's just think this through first.
- I trust him.
- Listen to us.
Alex!
Alex!
Alex!
Is this where we're supposed to be?
- Make up a plan.
- No, we got to run.
- What are you talking about?
- If the ship's right under...
- We can't leave.
- I know we can't leave him.
- What about Alex?
What about everyone up here that's gonna die?
Alex!
Dude, say something!
Oh, my God.
I left you behind once.
I'm not doing it again.
Hi, guys.
Whoa.
Whoa.
This... this is in-insane.
So, um, beep.
Uh, um,
I don't really know how to say good-bye... so I'm not gonna.
And, um...
Um...
You're my friend, you know?
Even when I'm old, even when... even when you think I've forgotten...
I'm always gonna be there.
Do you feel that?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, we need to go now!
We have to go.
Bye.
Go, go, go!
Wait, wait, wait, my camera!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Dude, are you all right?
- Everybody good?
- Are you all right?
Okay.
That was so close.
What the heck?
- Oh, my...
- What the...?
Yeah!
Oh, my God.
Dude, this is amazing.
I think you're gonna want to get this.
Oh!
We did it, dude.
We did it.
Dude, it...
Did you see that?
Did you see...
- Wow.
We did that!
- You're like...
That's insane.
We just did that!
That's...
Look, come on.
Look, look, people want to know what happened.
If we told them what happened, they wouldn't believe us.
Guys, it's morning.
Oh, crap, I gotta get home.
- My dad is gonna kill me.
- I think I need a ride.
We should go because people, they'll start asking--
Hey, buddy...
Did you guys feel that earthquake?
- Were you okay?
- No, Mom, I'm fine.
- Let me see.
- He's fine.
Honey, he's fine.
Did no one just see the giant spaceship?
!
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, a spaceship.
What just happened?
!
Oh, oh, okay, okay.
I know it's been really hard lately,
- and we've all been really overwhelmed.
- Just...
Why don't we... why don't we just go in and relax.
Maybe we can, um, go get that-that pizza we talked about.
- All right?
Yeah.
- Pizza?
- If we don't play along,
- Yeah, his mom saw the ship.
obody's gonna get it okay?
- How could I play along?
- So just...
- Yes, I'm sure.
I found them here at Alex's.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, no, no.
Actually, uh, we found him here.
I thought he was staying with you.
No, I was told they were at Munch's.
I'll call you back, babe.
Yeah, yeah, they were at my house.
We-we played this game where you play as a guy with the soul of a dragon, and it had really good voices.
The voices were great, so...
Who's this?
That's Emma.
I'm, uh, he's my boyfriend.
I mean, friend who's a boy.
- Um...
- Awkward.
She's hot, right?
Knock it off, you.
Six hours later, Alex moved.
I just got grounded for, like, life.
Me, too.
Might as well move now.
Not gonna be seeing anyone for a while.
Yeah.
But this... what really happened tonight-- o one knows but us.
Hey, Alex!
Time to go, buddy.
I'm gonna miss you guys.
You guys smell really bad.
Our last night together, we did a lot.
A whole lot.
But there's some things we couldn't do.
Alex's parents had already bought a new home.
Most of the neighborhood had.
Munch's, too.
So, one by one, people started to move.
My parents hadn't, so we got to stay.
New people started moving in, and Mulberry Wood started again, but not the one that had my friends in it.
When you're a kid, you think you're invisible.
You think you can't make a difference.
We're not kids anymore.
We know now... that we can do anything.
Having a friend light-years away taught us that distance is just a state of mind.
If you're best friends, then you always will be no matter where you are in the universe.
Guys, my just...
my phone just...
You guys got to see this.

Hey, hey, Tuck, dude.
- Okay, we're rolling.
-Okay, hold on.
B-Before you go, look-look at my coat.
- It's cool, huh?
- What is that?
Can we do another take with it on, though?
No.
Okay.
- Ready when you are.
Okay.
How do I smell?
Or I mean, look, or you know?
Yeah, you can't smell a video.
Okay.
- Ruckus, dude, you got to get out of here.
Hi, I'm Reginald.
I don't really get friends much, but it's probably because I'm a bit of... an acquired taste.
That's what my mom says.
And I'm sure whatever school I'm forced to go to o one will acquire it.
So... thanks for paving a road over, really, the only place I've ever had any real friends.
Okay, we good?
- Uh, say your name.
- I thought you knew my name.
You know what I mean;
for the video.
Dude, we've been hanging out for years.
- Come on.
- Dude, stop fronting.
Just tell the camera.
You're upset, right?
You don't want to move.
I've never gone a day without seeing my friends.
They're, like, the only people in the world who get me.
And now it's just all over, you know?
Good luck finding that again.
So wherever-wherever Munch is going, man... look, you people listen to me, all right?
He's-he's a really good kid.
So don't just assume that he's weird and that's it.
And Alex, man...
He's a foster kid.
He's been moved all over.
I mean, it's like, why do you have to build a freeway right through?
You know, can't you just go around or something?
You're going along feeling like your own person with your own friends, and then something like this comes along that you have no power to stop because you're just a kid.
You're just a kid.
Yeah, hey, man.
Yeah, yeah, I'm up, I'm up.
Whoa, whoa, man, slow down.
What's the problem?
Yeah, my-my phone's good.
Why?
What happened?
- Wait, what?
This is when everything started to change.
So, being me,
I kept filming.
I'm Tuck.
What you're about to see happened to me and my best friends one year ago.
This is the story of our last week together.
...Phones all over our neighborhood are freaking out.
We've done everything we could possibly do with this phone.
We threw it at the wall, we took it to the phone guy, we took it to the store where we got it from, and they say it's a problem.
So you know it's serious.
It looks like your phone basically barfed on the screen.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I was just eating dinner, and all of a sudden, all the phones in the house just did this.
At exactly the same time.
Dude.
- What?
It's freaky.
De hello?
Hey, Alex.
Oh, Munch, you're outside.
Get over here, over here, down the street.
Ask him if his phone barfed yet.
Did your phone barf yet?
- Phones are still working.
- Cool.
Keep going, and we'll meet you in the backyard.
Okay, copy that.
I'll take swift steps.
When I look back at that day,
I realize the clues were all around us.
We had no idea.
Dude, they all still work.
See?
Dude, you know if this whole thing works,
- these phones are done.
- No, I know.
- I have 14 spares; it's okay.
- I bet you do.
- Okay.
All right, anyways, let's spread out.
- Okay.
- Alex, go by the gate.
Munch, go on the far end,
- Yeah, I got it.
- And I'll stay right here
- Just watch out!
- By my camera.
Okay, okay.
Okay, it's good.
It's good...
It's good Whoa, okay, it went out.
Whoa, whoa, it barfed!
All right, people, if you go to Alex's house, your phones will spew chunks all over his screen.
My mom said the Murphys' phones and the Churleys' changed, too.
So what do you think this is?
Whoa!
These dudes.
...Hi.
- Is that on?
- I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Oh.
We had an electrical short over at the site, and it may be disrupting people's phone service, and we're wondering if that happened
- to anybody in this house?
- Oh, no, my phone is good.
- 'Cause we're offering new phone vouchers
- Uh-huh.
In exchange for any device in this area here
- that may be displaying
- That's weird, that's weird.
- Faulty messages or images?
- I don't know.
See you.
No, listen, I...
Okay, so you-you really don't think this is a little bit weird?
These dudes come here to build a freeway
- and now they want our phones?
- Well, I think it's gonna work.
No.
Clean your room.
Oh, my...
I'm not gonna have a room if we don't do something.
- Right, I think...
- No, Mom, seriously.
These guys want our houses.
Maybe if expose them for illegal property, then...
Yo!
- Aw, you don't like how things are, do you?
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
...Dude, it's a map to the desert.
Like, what is that?
What do we do with this?
I guess most maps are made to be followed.
Exactly.
It could go to, like, some crazy headquarters, and we find out that these construction clowns are spies and we expose them to the world.
It's 20 miles away.
What...
No, we're not...
we're not gonna go.
No, obviously not.
Look, whatever it is, this Saturday, we're going to sneak behind our parents' backs and find out.
I'm moving Saturday.
All right, all right, so Friday night.
Our last night together?
It doesn't have to be;
that's what I'm saying.
Like, I don't want to move, and these clowns are making us do it.
Maybe we can stop them.
Now, are you in?
Yeah, all right.
- All right.
- I'm in.
Munch, don't you bail out on us now.
Dude, I'm not.
Me?
No... pfft!
I'm in.
Yeah!
All right!
That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, all right.
Bring it in.
- Oh, oops!
- Munch!
So, why would you be organizing your ketchups?
- Because.
- Who does that?
So I can get to them easier, and then it's more organized,
- and it's better.
- And you are my friend.
Guys, guys, it's time to practice the big lie.
Hey, Mom, I'm spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a neat, brand-new video game.
And I'm sleeping over at Tuck's house so we can play a new video game.
And I'm sleeping in your mom's bed, ot playing a video game.
- Oh, my God, all right, dude.
Stop talking about my mother, thank you.
All right, the camera's are gonna be on 24 hours a day, nonstop.
Dude, can you stop touching, please?
It attaches to my bike, and it's also a pretty good way to get footage on the fly.
Spy glasses.
I love these;
I love them.
And last, camera, but definitely not least...
What up, camcorder?
Keeping it tight.
Looking pretty good these days.
Tuck, these are the ugliest things I've ever seen.
Dude, what?
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Those are...
They're sweet.
- The camera's undetectable,
- Wow.
- And the ladies love them.
- Prove it.
Prove it?
This guy, all right?
Give me my glasses, man.
Those are stealth.
Now I'm gonna prove to you guys spy glasses get you girls.
Oh, my gosh, he's going over there.
- I can't see who he's talking to.
- Shut up, Munch.
Uh, hi, uh...
Hey, um, Em-Emma, right?
Emma?
I was just...
Okay, uh, can I borrow a piece of paper, please?
He has something.
- I can't see who he got it from.
- We're about to see right now.
Look, look, look, look.
He has a paper.
You did not get her number.
Totally got her number.
Right there.
You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.
You, too, you're a sellout.
No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.
Yes, I did.
Mannequin Girl?
What kind of name is that?
What?
That's what I call her.
I think mannequins are hot.
- I'll leave my house at 6:00.
15 minutes later, I pick up Alex.
- Munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Tonight, we're no longer boys.
We're men.
- Dude, what the...?
- I didn't see you, man.
- Tuck, you all right?
- Let's go.
Our whole lives we've been nobodies.
Invisible.
The good kids.
Not anymore.
All right, Ma.
I'm leaving.
Spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a new video game.
Have whatever you want, honey.
You know what, I lied, actually.
We're gonna ride our bikes out into the desert at night alone.
Without supervision.
We got that;
we're going to state.
Okay, see you then, sweetie.
- We could go.
- Also rob a bank.
- All the way.
State.
- What?
Go to Mexico.
Maybe even start a new life.
- Right, I know.
- Wrestling!
You're trying to act like I don't know what I'm talking about.
What's up, Stumpy?
Yo, man, I told you to stop to calling me that.
You know what, man, look, my girl's throwing this huge party later tonight, if you want to come by.
You serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
Because not a lady in the world can resist a natty old BMX bike.
What's the zero to 60 on that bad boy, huh?
Two, three days?
Come on, come on, dude, you ready?
Let's go.
I can't even tell a difference.
This looks exactly the way it looked before you packed.
All your stuff fitting in one box?
What are you, a drifter?
Who told you?
Look, all I'm saying is, when you get to your new house, put a poster up, put some shelves on the wall, frame a photo.
Look, there's a painting right there.
Put something on a shelf...
That's not a painting.
That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt, smudged it and called it art.
I'm going to Munch's house to play a video game, all right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure, buddy.
- Bye, Dylan.
- Have fun with your friends.
- Hey, hey, Tuck.
- How are you?
Uh, good luck with the move to New York, buddy.
- Maybe we'll come see you.
- All right, cool.
The moving truck is coming at 10:00.
Make sure you're back, okay?
I-I don't get it.
If your foster parents already have a baby of their own, why do they need you?
There's no sense in having two babies.
- Shut up, dude.
- One baby cries all the time, the other one listens to indie rock.
Let's go.
Yeow!
Guys, would you please help my son with his room, before I go crazy?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I don't think he's started...
Honey, have you even started packing your room?
I told you a thousand times,
I'm alphabetizing!
Yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.
Shh.
...they're flexible, they're "dynamical,"
they can be curved, they can bend, and this opens up a whole new universe of possibilities, and one of the possibilities is that there can be shortcuts through space and through time.
So that's really just what a wormhole is.
It's taking advantage...
What are you...
Aah!
- Why don't you stop doing that?
!
- I'm sorry!
You guys are gonna give me a heart attack one day.
- I'm sorry.
- Turn that off, dude.
...I created substation for each of our parents' phones that's wired to the router, which is wired to the transmitter, which transmits to the receiver, which is...
- my phone.
- Okay, so basically, o matter who our parents call, it goes to your phone.
Yeah.
My mom's friends always say that I sound just like my mom, you know,
- when I pick up the phone...
- Yeah.
So I figured, I can be Betty.
Bye, Betty.
Thank you.
Um, I'm going to Alex's...
or Munch's... or Tuck's house, and we're gonna play a video game and sleep over.
Wait, what's all that stuff?
Honey?
Good job, Munch.
You did it.
Here we come.
17.6 miles.
♪ Going to the desert... ♪
Munch, what are you doing?
Guys, guys, just hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Dude...
- I'm not backing out or anything,
- He wants to quit right when we - ...just-just hear me out.
- Been waiting for this forever.
- Dude, listen, come on, okay.
This is crazy what we're doing.
Dude, I don't want to punk out or back out or anything... it's just, my mom, you know, she just got divorced.
- Munch...
- She's already had enough guys lying to her.
If you didn't want to come, then why didn't you tell us earlier?
You do understand this is our last night together.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Look, Munch, if we don't go now, we'll never go.
We won't even be here.
This is our last chance to try and do something.
Even-even if it is stupid.
- Yeah.
- You know what,
I say we put a vote to it.
All in favor raise your hand.
Well, now I have to raise my hand.
Munch, just...
Fine, fine.
Okay, whatever.
I'll go.
But only under one condition.
- I call the black!
- Mine!
No, no!
No, give it!
It's so weird, no one's gonna be in these houses next week.
Dude, you're so full of it.
- When did you kiss her?
- Dude, trust me.
After pre-algebra, she pulled me into the bathroom.
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Mannequin Girl?
- Yeah!
- Was she good at it?
Uh, eh, B minus.
You know, I've kissed better in better locations.
No, how do I know you're not lying?
Trust me.
I don't even have to reply to you.
- You're last!
Hey, you got a head start!
That's not fair!
Oh, so what, there's a Wing Stop?
I never been to a Wing Stop.
We followed a map out in the middle of nowhere.
It might be, like, a CIA prison.
We were miles from home.
No one in the world knew it.
No one said it... but we were scared.
We haven't seen a car in, like, half an hour.
We were on our own.
This-this is the way, right?
You have the map, right?
- Can I see the map?
- Left.
Left?
Are you sure?
Because right looks a little bit more promising.
...Did you guys hear that?
Just a couple more miles.
Hold on.
What is that?
It's the map.
Are we close?
I never understood why people like the outdoors.
Will you stop freaking out?
Yo, this is too steep, man.
Let's go, man.
We're getting pretty far from the road, guys.
Almost there.
Is it this thing?
I don't think so.
Wait, what was that?
- I don't know.
- Well, hold on.
What'd you see, dude?
- Over here!
We're almost there.
Come on.
Oh.
What?
What do you think it is?
How would I know?
Why does it look all burnt?
Hey, just be careful.
- Careful!
- Yeah, don't touch that thing.
Could be...
C-Could be...
I don't know, I don't know.
A part of a satellite?
All right, all right, um, Munch, film me while I'm...
- while I'm touching this thing.
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Let me try it.
Thank you.
It's dusty.
It's a piece of crap.
What?
Forget about it.
Just turn off the camera.
Well, it's not a national treasure, but it could be used for something.
It's crap.
What happened to filming 'cause it's our last night, huh?
Um, in case you haven't noticed, obviously, the map led to squat.
Got it.
So all you cared about was getting your stupid hits on your stupid video?
- Dude, why don't you just...
- Whoa, guys, guys, guys.
Come on!
I know we're all frustrated It's Alex's mom.
- Are you serious?
- Um, it'll be fine.
Just, um, be Betty, okay?
- Oh, man.
- Oh, crap.
Yo, I thought I could do this, but I can't.
Maybe you can answer it.
She just likes to check up on things, okay?
All right.
Betty, are you there?
Go.
This is Betty.
I was thinking maybe I could bring over some pizzas?
Dude, go.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No coming over.
- Just hang up.
- No way.
No, it's really no trouble.
We have a coupon.
- I said no!
No pizzas!
- What?
- O, uh...
- Don't yell at her, man.
Maybe you and your husband should go to bed.
Stop saying words!
Are you sure everything's okay?
Have a good night.
Go to sleep.
That could've gone better.
That was horrible.
"Your husband should go to sleep"?
Was that really something smart to say?
Munch.
Don't look at me like I'm a hoarder.
That's rude.
Who are they?
I don't...
I don't know.
I'm picking up some spikes in the readings...
Get down, get down.
- They're turning a flashlight off, dummy.
- Let's go.
Why would they be out this far?
Who cares?
The night's blown.
- Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
Munch?
- You're a character.
- There's something in there!
What?
Dude, are you kidding me right now?
Something is in that bag.
It-it touched me.
Go check.
Be-be careful.
- What?
- Did it poke you, too?
What, dude?
Say something!
What did you see?
There-There's something in there.
Yeah, a bunch of crap Munch brought.
- You guys are funny.
- All I know is it beeped.
You know, why don't you go in there and just see.
Beeped?
What are you talking about?
Babies.
I'll do it myself.
Dang, how much stuff do you have in your bag, dude?
Geez.
Oh, boy, are you guys talking about this?
It's garbage.
It's nothing.
What are you talking about, you heard something?
It made a noise.
Hey, hey, do something!
See, it's not doing anything.
What are you talking about?
Beep.
Do that again, do that again.
Do what again?
Do what you just did.
- Beep.
Whoa, hold on.
Let me...
Let me try this for myself.
Beep.
Beep?
Why is it making noise only for you and not me?
Make it beep again.
Beep.
...Whoa!
This is it!
It's a bomb!
No, no, oh, God, no!
No, no, no!
Guys, I think...
I think it might have defused.
I don't know.
Man, nothing's happening.
All right, hold on, hold on.
I got an idea.
Tuck!
What?
Okay, it didn't do anything, but j-just don't do it again.
Are you insane, Tuck?
!
Are you sure you guys know what you're doing?
Yes, trust me.
When it's a bomb, you have to act quick.
I seen it on some TV show or some movie or something.
- Saw what?
- Check it out.
What are you doing?
!
Disarming it.
Are you crazy?
!
It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.
That's not what you do with a bomb!
Are you insane?
!
...What was that?
It's not my phone.
It's the thing, whatever that is.
- What are you talking about?
- It's that.
That's what just made that noise.
I, uh...
It, like, imitated my ringtone.
This is what made our phones barf?
Did you hear that?
...Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
All right, so, a couple of seconds ago, our phones went crazy.
Bananas, insane.
I don't know what to call it.
Look.
You see that?
It's a new map, but on my phone this time.
To me?
All right, him, or...
Dude, Munch's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and, ugh, I don't even know what that is.
Alex's phone, it just turned on by itself and started filming.
We can't even turn them off.
Oh, don't try to act like it's not cool.
That is weird.
It's showing us where we are.
And you don't find that creepy?
What do you think that is?
You think that's a road?
We should follow the map.
How about no.
How about yes?
We wanted a last night together, so what do you call this?
A trap?
Didn't you guys see the "No Trespassing" sign?
Oops.
I didn't see anything.
This is where the map says to go.
Stop stepping on leaves.
There's leaves everywhere.
...Shh.
What was that?
Where do you think it's taking us to?
Maybe another one of those beepy things.
What was that?
I don't know.
- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Get down!
Oh, geez!
Munch, watch out!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
What's going on?
Dude, Munch, what was that?
Where is it?
Is it over?
- Oh, geez.
Dude!
Tuck, stay back.
- Whoa.
- Stay back.
- What's...
Dude!
- Wait, wait, be careful.
Your phone just got a new map.
What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait, why is it opening?
Hold on, hold on.
Did you see that just now?
- What is that?
- Whoa!
What is that?
- What is that?
- What is that?
- Oh, my...
Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.
It-It's moving.
There's something in there right now.
What's in there?
Oh, don't tell me.
Are those... eyes?
Dude, dude, it's looking dead at us right now.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
It's trembling like it's hurt.
Good.
My heart's beating so fast right now.
Wow.
Almost got us killed, like, three times already.
Yeah, but it was worth it, dude.
Incredible.
All right, so...
I just figured out why Alex's camera was on this whole time.
So this thing, whatever it is, it's eyes are, like, all screwed up, completely.
You see?
So, basically, it uses his phone to see.
That's insane.
You think he can see us right now?
Munch, you have to check this out.
This is amazing.
Is it?
Is it amazing?
'Cause I think it's scary as balls.
I mean, obviously people are looking for it.
- Munch...
- It has access to our voicemails and our texts and our ringtones.
How do you even know it's a he?
Are you a dude?
Wait... you understood us.
Whoa.
All right, here's how it goes.
One beep is yes, two beeps are no.
Watch.
Is one beep yes?
Yo, that's so tight.
Are we in a barn?
Is Munch really a woman?
Oh, come on, man, this thing is broken.
Everybody knows Munch is a woman.
Okay, I have a question.
Are we gonna die tonight?
Why isn't it answering?
What...
Well, that's not good, right?
20 questions with an alien.
Tuck Simms exclusive.
- Let's do this.
- Check it out.
All right, um, are you from space?
...Ooh!
Are you a robot?
Do you eat humans?
Do you like Earth?
Why?
Why doesn't he like Earth?
Do you like us?
You see?
I told you.
We're cool like that.
Come on.
Are you hurt?
- Oh.
- He's hurt.
Well, his lights seem brighter, so...
Did that piece help you?
Oh.
Can we help fix you or something?
Or...
Like, what is this?
Are-are you trying to build something?
...Oh, he's trying to build...
Building something.
Right there.
- What could he be building?
- Yeah.
So, wait, what are, what are you building?
- Lasers?
- A portal?
- Minions?
- A cloaking device?
- It's an army.
Ignore him.
- Spaceship?
Oh, my God!
Hold up, hold up.
So let me get this right.
So you're building a spaceship,
- He's building a spaceship.
- And you need our help building the spaceship?
...Oh, man.
This guy is building a spaceship.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Let me make sure I don't have any plans.
Nope!
We're building a spaceship!
He's building a spaceship.
We asked him questions for almost two hours.
Where he came from.
If there were others here like him.
We found out he was lost... and alone.
He was out in the middle of nowhere, on his own, like us.
All we really knew was that he crashed, and now he needed us to rebuild him.
The map says up ahead.
Are we going the right way?
Look, look, look, look, whatever that is, the map goes to it.
All right, so wait-wait a minute.
Let me get this right.
Dude comes from a million light-years away, and he wants to come here?
I don't know, the map said so.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You got to look both ways before you cross the street.
Munch.
So are you... snoopy.
Ten dollars?
- I said no deal.
- $7.50.
I don't want it.
It's tchotchke trash.
If you give it to me as a gift, I'd still throw it away.
- It's trash.
- No, it's vintage.
No.
You don't get to say the word "vintage."
I'm the one who gets to say when what is vintage.
Excuse me, sir, you have a very, very lovely shop.
Come on, you sure?
Hey.
Oh, man, look at the hand painting.
It's all crafted right there.
- One of a kind.
- It's trash.
Uh, uh...
- What was that?
F-sharp?
No, no, no!
Come on!
Watch out!
Watch out!
- What was it?
Whoa.
Is everybody okay?
- Hey, Nichols, Nichols, are you alive?
They broke my girlfriend's lamp!
Wait, what is he doing?
- Oh.
Whoa, whoa.
Is-is that...
- Sweet babushka.
You want to sell it?
- Tuck, let's go!
Come on!
- Run!
What are you waiting for?
Dude, that place was wrecked!
Sorry again, sir!
Go!
Go!
Down here!
Let's get somewhere so we can look at him.
He's shaking.
Whoa, he's letting you touch him.
- I wouldn't, guys.
- Hey, what about here?
Here, set him on here.
- He looks scared.
Yeah, why is he all balled up?
Can't you stand?
You all right?
- Maybe he's... maybe he's just shy.
- Ooh, can you fly?
- Can you do X-ray vision?
How?
He can't see.
He doesn't even know where to look.
All right, all right, I think the question is, what can you do?
Okay, so Dr. Nichols is doing a surgical procedure with very sophisticated technology.
- Pen caps.
Clear.
Wait, I don't get it.
How is that sophisticated?
It's kind of just, like, pen caps.
I got it.
Be careful.
His legs are fragile.
- Whoa.
Get this.
Are you getting this?
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Oh, that's crazy!
So you can't fly, but you can float.
- That is so crazy!
I saw you.
I saw you grinning, man.
Stop trying to pretend like that wasn't cool.
- That was hot.
- This is crazy.
I mean, it's-it's just crazy.
- Whoa.
Don't drop it.
Huh.
- Can you see me?
- Huh, I think he likes you.
Will you show us where you live?
...All right.
Beep faster if I'm getting close.
...Is that it, right there?
Why don't I go first.
Hi.
Um, my name's Alex, and... you're-you're in...
Munch, no... you're in my hand right now.
You know my ringtone, which is, like, insane and awesome.
Okay, um...
Hi.
I'm Tuck.
What's up?
I don't even know what to say, but, uh... but, uh, I'm from...
I'm from New York.
Uh, this is Nevada.
I don't even know, like, I like donuts,
- um...
- Donuts?
Really?
Okay, can somebody else do this?
I know, I'm going.
My name's M...
My real name is Reginald, but my friends call me Munch.
I hope we can be friends, too.
...Do you have a name?
Oh, we could call him Beep.
Dude, what-what kind of name is Beep?
Word.
We got to give him a name that's powerful, like... like Master Blaster.
He doesn't blast anything.
Peter.
Peter.
What about Peter?
Something cool, like Space Ninja or something.
Well, how is there a ninja in space?
He wouldn't be able to breathe.
- All right, all right...
- Dude, you don't know that.
Have you ever been to space?
Which name do you like?
Uh, Beep.
Why?
There it is.
- Hello.
Watch this.
Watch this.
- You can't echo...
Watch this.
Just...
Beep.
...See?
- Echo.
That's what we should call it.
Echo.
...Oh, 'cause it echoes.
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Echo, Echo, Echo.
- Echo.
Your name... is Echo.
Echo...
Echo...
I don't think he's supposed to come out of that cylinder thing.
He looks... dead.
Echo?
So then we didn't know how broken he was.
The crash hurt him worse than we thought.
- Okay, little guy... where do you want us to go?
Guys?
You know this is considered being a burglar, right?
With each new piece, he got strong.
And that's what we were gonna do... make him stronger.
Which way?
- Around.
- In the house?
!
- Dude!
Maybe we should just knock on the door and...
We just need you to listen, sweetheart.
- Oh, man.
- You're grounding me?
Tuck, what are you doing?
Munch, go.
It's the man... the man should choose his dance partner.
It's a stupid tradition.
Really, it's about meeting new people, and many of those were our friends' sons.
And it's embarrassing when you ignore them.
And these are life skills that we are teaching you.
- Tuck, get back.
- Putting on this dress for you doesn't change me into some perfect little homecoming queen!
Okay, no one's asking you to act like a homecoming queen.
It's at least three years away.
Now.
Go, go, go.
...by the company you keep.
It's a cliché for a reason.
I'm sure this all seems...
Guys, what are we doing?
We're gonna be trapped up here.
Everybody be quiet.
Yeah, everyone!
You got to be kidding me.
Aw, you know what?
Everyone just follow me, all right?
Don't look at anything.
Just hurry.
- Hey, Tuck, did you see this?
- No, don't...
Dude, Tuck, this is Mannequin Girl's house.
Now we can ask for permission to steal stuff, 'cause, you know, you guys are kissing buddies.
Aw, man...
It was a couple of days ago.
She probably forgot about it by now, you know?
Like, yeah, it's...
yeah, she probably forgot.
- How would she forget about it?
- I almost forgot about it...
- Oh, boy, get ready.
- Uh-oh.
Close the door.
Close the door.
...Guys...
- Dude, we just got to keep it from going crazy.
It's gonna get loud.
We'll catch it in a blanket.
- What?
- Whoa!
- Get down!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Stop letting it move!
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
How to unfold a napkin?
!
- Who cares!
- Fine!
And in no time in my life am I gonna be somewhere
- that even plays the foxtrot!
- Close the door.
...Yo, put it away, man.
Shh.
Be quiet.
- What the...?
Wait, I know you.
- Hey.
It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey, we're with Tuck.
Tuck Simms.
You know?
Remember you guys kissed?
- We what?
- Yeah, what are you talking about, huh?
Why is my room destroyed?
- Why are you filming this?
- And what is that?
- Um, it's a... it's a-a car muffler.
No.
I want to know what that is.
It's actually a spaceship.
- Munch!
- Sorry.
Uh, well, we-we were following maps, and it just happened to lead here, so we were trying to help our friend Echo...
well, he's an alien
Oh, God...
- ...that we're trying to get him on a ship.
See, look, it used to have six symbols, but now it has three, so that means we're almost there.
Crazy, right?
Munch, will you shut up?
An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?
- Nope.
- No, no.
- You did not just see that.
- Yeah, I did.
Yeah, she definitely saw it.
- Wait.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, I want to go.
- Really?
Sounds great.
What?
No.
- Dude...
- You're not part of our group, so why don't you just go play with your super rich friends...
That's kind of harsh and your ball gowns and just go eat steak or something.
- What the hell?
- Go, go, go.
Dang, dude, what was that upstairs?
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you so mad.
Yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.
All right, let's just...
don't talk about...
Nothing happened in there, all right?
You know, they say the girls you argue with
- are the ones you like.
Don't go there, bro.
...Tuck, it's over there.
Wait, it wants us to go to a bar?
Man, I say we climb in a window or find a door.
There's got to be another way.
Um, before-before we go...
I really need to get the pee out of my body.
...Let's just hope the next place isn't a bank.
I can't believe you told that girl to get lost.
- You're so dramatic.
- What about you?
You invented a whole kiss, didn't you?
Uh, first of all, for your info, it's called aspirational thinking.
You're thinking it one moment, you're living it the next.
- How's that working out?
- Oh, excuse me.
Go to the bikes.
Oh, God, oh, God.
Why is the construction man...
- Shut...
- Excuse me.
- Aw...
Hey.
I know you guys.
You're the guys... you're from the construction site, right?
Uh, with the, uh, with the camera?
Whoa-ho, wait, wait.
Why aren't you guys at home right now?
You guys weren't riding your bikes out
- around the desert, were you?
- No, of course not.
Yes.
Uh, no.
That doesn't sound too... clear.
- Uh...
- Thank God.
There you are.
- What?
Who-who are you?
Who am I?
Who am I?
Exactly!
It's like I don't even know anymore.
My mom had to drag my dad from the bar... again!
- What?
- He likes to go there more than he likes to tuck in his own kids at night.
At least that's what my mom says.
What's she talking about?
That's her.
Eating a burrito.
She east when she's stressed.
I ask myself if that's gonna be me one day.
What do you think?
Is it?
We make mistakes and we get married and we go to bars.
And these... these are my only friends in the world,
- 'cause they see me Uh... for who I really am.
That's your mom over there?
- Do you want to meet her?
- No.
No.
No, no.
Just get home safe!
Told you guys I wanted to go.
- What the...?
Okay, so this girl, man, she'd been tailing us since her house, spying on us like some creepy stalker.
- She'd overheard our whole plan.
- She... she's crazy.
- I need the bag!
- I think I like it.
- Oh, boy, get ready.
All right, try to blend in.
Look old.
That must've been some good fake I.D.'s.
What's up, baby face?
What are you doing in here, little man?
Oh, uh, I, uh...
- Are you Randy's kid?
- Uh,
- yes, he is.
- Um, y-yeah, yeah, yeah, he's my dad... or mom.
- You know, dad.
Mom.
- Okay, dude, just go.
- Hurry up.
Emma?
Emma?
I was hanging out with this really pretty chick.
She's almost as pretty as you.
I mean... you're not pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.
Come over here.
Hop up on that stool.
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Oh, and one for his buddy here, too.
No, no, I'm all right.
Seriously, I'm all right.
- Sure, you'll like it.
- Sorry, I'm a...
I'm allergic.
Oh, you're gonna love it.
- Uh, no, no.
- You're gonna get one.
So, what happens next?
- Just give me back my bag.
- No.
Give it.
I'm serious.
Give me the bag.
Why are you being mean to me?
- Here, honey.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.
Wow, a lot of people with beards and mustaches in here, you know?
You don't understand.
Whenever you get close to the next piece, it goes crazy.
Oh, my God!
- Whoa!
Aah!
- Uh...
- Are you kidding me?
Do you guys just go around town breaking stuff?
Just keep running!
Go, go!
What was that?
I think the ship's trying to take off!
- Whoa, whoa!
Are you seeing this?
This thing is flying a ship... in your backpack?
I think he's getting better.
Oh.
So, you don't know how he crashed, or when, or why he came here with a spaceship in the first place?
Look, he only answers yes or no... it's not that simple.
Is this how I talk to him?
- So, you crashed.
Did someone cause you to crash?
- Dude, what's she doing?
- I don't know.
- Someone on Earth?
Do you think they're looking for you?
It's not those guys in trucks from the convenience store, is it?
- The construction man?
Those are the guys that shot you down?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We got to take a step back.
This is way bigger and shadier than before, okay?
This is not good.
If those dudes are looking for Echo, they're looking for us, you know?
Echo?
You need some help there, buddy?
Hey, it's okay.
Shh.
Breathe like me, okay?
It's okay.
Dude, h-he'll be fine.
No.
We're not leaving him.
My whole life, I've been left.
I know how it feels.
We're all he's got.
- Uh, left?
- We could find a shortcut.
The map says up ahead.
This map's confusing.
I was a mind ninja back there...
So, what was it like kissing me?
- Give me my camera.
- Did your legs get all wobbly?
Was there soft music playing?
Please remind me, Tuck.
I totally forgot.
- What was it like?
- You're close.
Is this your first imaginary kiss?
The map says for us to go inside.
I'm confused.
- Huh?
- Didn't you guys kiss?
Anyway, the point is,
Emma was being annoying...
she kept walking off with Echo like she owned him, and talking to him about
I don't know what, I don't even know.
You know what?
Delete.
Man, are we sure there's no security guards or...
You know, that door wasn't even locked.
Hey, uh, guys, I was just thinking, you know,
I... haven't got to actually hold the, you know, the ship, before we did the thing, so can I do it?
- You know, before it gets crazy?
- Sure, but... it's not a ship.
What?
What are you talking about?
You told us it was a ship.
It's a key to your ship, right?
Well, if this is just the key, where's the spaceship?
...All right, Munch, put it down.
...Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.
Okay, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to put it down
- before you hurt both of us.
- I need this, man.
- That's weird.
- Does it know her?
- I don't know.
Munch!
Whoa!
Whoa!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- What are you guys doing?
- Wow.
- Um, she was gonna get hit by the piece, so I-I saved her.
Hey!
You four!
Freeze!
- Run!
- Which way?
- Tuck!
- Stop right there!
Stop!
Go, go!
Hurry up!
Hold up, hold up!
Did Alex get out?
Uh, I d...
I don't know.
- We have to go back.
- Uh...
- Come on, you guys.
- Okay.
Look.
Whoa, whoa.
She's being stupid.
There's a guard in there, you know?
You can't just go running in, acting crazy.
We need a-a plan, or... s... right?
Breaking and entering, destruction of property.
Those are felonies, kid.
Okay, Echo, I need your help.
Um, I need you to...
do something.
I have a minor here; he's 13.
Caught him breaking in with his friends.
If you could send an officer down.
Stay put.
Hello?
...Anybody there?
- Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
...there...
Is anybody there... there...
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Alex.
Alex.
- Wh-Where's Tuck?
- We got to go.
- We should've gone back.
- All right, you know what?
Calm down, because if people would've listened to me, then Alex never would have gotten caught.
Didn't I say there would be security guards?
Alex!
Dude!
You're all right!
Are you all right?
Hey, Alex, we're good, man.
All right?
- Buddy?
- We're good, man?
Alex.
Come on, dude.
Alex!
We could've gone home, but we didn't.
- We were outside.
- Turn off the camera.
Not till you admit you're acting mopey for no reason.
You're always freaking out if anyone's gonna leave you behind.
Do you know how expensive that is?
I'm glad I'm moving.
You were never my friend.
- Is that right?
Is that right?
- Guys, guys,
- come on, just-just chill out.
- Come on!
Have you lost your mind?
I acted like I didn't know what I'd done.
But I knew exactly.
I know we're all tired and stuff, and hungry.
I saw this awesome diner.
We can totally just go grab
- a bite to eat or something.
- Real awesome, guys.
- Real macho.
So, that's it?
The night's over?
Doesn't have to be.
Right?
Well, I mean, if it is, uh, we could...
I don't know, I guess we can keep the mood going, yeah?
Or we can do it another time, right?
Good times, the continuation, part two.
Right?
Hmm.
You know what?
I'm gonna talk about Sandra.
Man, that girl used to beat the crap out of you.
Me, too.
We were both little, small and scrawny.
She was a big girl, and she knew it.
But then I had a growth spurt, and you didn't, and I finally did something.
You remember that?
You told her I had polio.
Yeah, I told her that, and did she beat you up after that?
She still beat me up.
'Cause I-I always get your back, man.
I never let you down;
I always get your back.
Most of the time.
Just when I'm not freaked out about security guards, all right?
I'm sorry, man.
Are we good?
Yeah.
Dude.
Faster.
Sure are doing some traveling tonight.
My parents are in the bathroom.
Uh-huh.
Let it go.
What are you doing?
- Dude!
Hey, what are you doing?
!
- Oh, God!
Don't grab our stuff like that!
- Stop!
- Hey, give me the backpack!
- Who do you think you are?
- The police have been instructed to come and pick up these kids and take them home.
He can't just walk away.
- What was it?
The phone.
O, no, no!
- Munch!
-Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
- Munch!
Munch!
Oh, my...
Munch!
This is not real, this is not real, this is not real right now.
- Don't let them see you.
...Now!
Munch!
Do you see the truck?
Munch!
Munch!
That guy is not a construction worker.
- It's Munch.
- I need help, guys.
I really didn't think this through.
We're here, we're here.
Are you hurt?
Can you guys hear me...?
- Are you okay?
- Where are you, Munch?
We'll find you, all right?
I promise.
I think I'm at the construction site.
- Come on, buddy.
- Munch!
I can see the big lights and up at those...
- the white trucks...
How far is your neighborhood?
It's way over an hour.
All right, I think I got a faster way.
Who wants to go to a party?
Are you sure he'll even be here?
Better be.
His girlfriend's throwing it.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Sophomores.
Hey, sweet party.
Sweet jams.
Guys, what are we doing here?
We can't be...
Just look for my brother.
Look for his keys.
- Oh, my gosh, it's the cops.
- Okay.
Oh, God, the keys, the keys.
I lost my keys.
I have a Porsche.
Marcus!
Oh, not you, sorry.
I wasn't trying to stop the fun...
I like it.
- Whoa...!
Hi.
Uh, sorry to bother everyone.
Have you seen my brother, Marcus?
Tall guy?
You seen his car keys?
- Uh, anyone?
- Guys, the cops are here!
- What?
- Yeah, the cops are here.
- Turn it down, turn it down.
- Dude, stop...
No, I'm serious, the cops are here right now.
Alex!
Alex!
...We have to go now.
All right, just come on, come on.
We got to move.
Hurry, hurry.
We can't hide here.
Look, look, just stay here.
He's my brother;
I'll find him.
Just... don't let the cops take the footage.
All right?
You live here, right?
The cops!
Marcus?
Marcus, we're here.
The party's shut down.
That's enough.
Come on.
Oh, my God.
Tuck's gonna freak.
Uh, here, check his pockets.
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.
Cops are gone.
- Uh, Tuck, Tuck?
- I have no idea where Marcus is.
Yeah.
Tell me you got that on tape?
My name is Reginald "Munch" Barrett.
This is my...
kind of my final message.
To my best friends...
I love you, guys.
You're Googling it?
Really?
Oh, come on, this is what the Internet is for.
Um, "step one, get a driver's license."
- Do we have one of those?
- Oh, wow.
All right, am I good?
...Stop!
Stop!
All right, all right.
Dude, do you even know what you're doing?
No, I don't.
"Step two, be calm."
...What are you doing?
!
- Sorry, sorry.
- Be calm is step two?
All right, all right, all right.
I got it, I got it.
- Hold on a sec..
- Stop!
- Tuck, Tuck, turn!
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.
- Uh...
- Oh, my God.
We're good, we're good.
All right, I'm excited.
Should I gun it?
- No, no, no, don't.
- No, Tuck.
I need, I need music.
Somebody just play some music.
- All right.
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my God.
Change it.
Everywhere we'd been that night, shot by us like a rocket.
All we wanted was our friends back.
I'm gonna miss it here, man.
Yeah, me too.
Here we go.
I don't know about this.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
That does not look like a freeway.
- Get down.
Shh, shh.
All right, so what's the plan?
I don't know.
Get him out?
So, in other words, we don't have a plan.
Go, go, go.
I'm just gonna call Munch's phone and see if his phone rings.
Wait a minute.
Dude, my camera's not a doorstop.
I hear his voice.
Shh.
I-I knew it was you guys 'cause I saw the same truck from my neighborhood.
Tell us the truth.
I-I had a lot of adrenaline rush, and...
I...
I didn't want the night to end.
And I... and it was the last night with Alex.
Oh, shit, Munch.
Stop crying and talk to us.
This is not good.
I'm not...
I'm not crying!
What?
Where is that?
We got to find him and get him out of there, man.
- Just don't kill me!
Did he access your phones at all?
Were there others like it or was this the only one you found?
What are they doing?
Dude, they're breaking him!
Guys?
Guys, someone's coming.
We should go.
Go, go.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, construction man!
- Give me the camera.
- Listen...
This is not your camera.
Hey, guys, go!
- And find Munch!
- Let go of me!
Get off of us, man, this isn't...
- My camera!
- Let go.
Is that thing still on?
Okay, no more lies.
No more sneaking around.
No more cameras, understand?
Son, look at me.
Look at me.
Oh, I-I see better with my glasses on, you know?
This signal has been transmitting for a very long time, from a ship that we believe is located right here in your neighborhood.
What?
Wait, what-what's he talking about?
Six days ago, an object entered our atmosphere at 20,000 miles an hour, on a direct course for that ship.
We shot it down.
What you found activates the ship, and if that ship takes off, it could kill everyone.
He just wants to go home.
Okay, that will not happen.
He is far too valuable.
This is crazy, this is crazy.
So... we are gonna follow this map and you are gonna help us get that thing operational, and it will lead us back to its ship, and we will disable it permanently.
Am I clear?
...Am I clear?
Y-Yeah.
Good.
Check the doors, check the doors.
It's locked;
it's not just locked.
They don't have a handle on it.
- Someone help!
- Where are they taking us?
...Hey, yo!
Let us out, man!
Someone!
Well, the sun's up.
Our parents are gonna find out.
I think we got bigger problems than our parents.
Where are we?
Let's go!
All right, everybody knows the drill.
Let's set it up.
- He's not moving.
- Stop!
Can you see me?
Beep?
We're all here.
We're gonna get you home, all right?
We'll find a way.
Nichols, man, it's not there.
No.
Please, you have to work.
Just try.
Echo?
Don't!
Echo!
You can't go; you can't!
It's over.
Let's keep them quiet.
Come on, man.
It's...
It's time to go.
What's happening?
What is that?
Here he goes.
Back up.
Get ready.
Whoa.
Okay, now!
Where are we going?
Home!
His ship's in Mulberry Woods.
Dude, go!
How do I drive?
Will you drive?
!
Please drive!
Just hurry up!
Alex, dude, you don't have your seat belt on!
- Just speed up!
- Just go!
...Go, go, go, go, go!
They're right there!
You have to speed!
- I'm trying!
- You're driving...!
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
- Tuck, you're gonna
- get us killed!
- Where do I go?
- Just go around them.
O, hold on.
- Don't go on the wrong side!
Dude, stop, stop!
- Oh!
- What the...?
- Oh, my gosh.
- Whoa, whoa!
Are you...
Are you seeing this?
Thanks, buddy.
I need an Advil.
We can't afford this right now.
We really can't afford this right now.
Dude, look, there's a new map.
A what?
Here, here, give me the phones back.
I think that's his ship.
Whoa, that's a big ship.
Alex, I don't want to stress you out or anything, but they're right there!
- Oh, my God.
Alex, it's your mom.
- Don't answer it.
- Why would I answer it?
- Betty?
- Dude.
Munch.
Betty?
Hi.
- Sorry about my tone last night.
- Oh, I just thought it would be nice to have the boys have a nice night
- together before we're all uprooted.
- You're crying.
- Munch, it's your mom.
- What?
!
Look, look, look, look.
Dude.
You okay?
So, uh, Janice, gotta go... on my jog.
Can we act like we never had this conversation?
Uh, uh, just come over this wall.
Are you up?
- Guys, they're here.
- Jump.
- Move!
- Faster!
They can't catch us in our own backyard.
Let's cut them off.
Munch, hurry up!
- Okay, okay.
- Munch!
Well, I don't jump walls very much, man!
Here, hold my camera.
Dude, come on, come on, come on.
O, no, no, no, no!
- Tuck, wait!
They're right behind us!
Come on, guys, we got to go, we got to go.
Let's go, right now.
It's down the hill.
Come on, let's go!
Shh.
Go, go, go.
It says the ship is up ahead.
This is the way to your house, man.
- Go, go, go, guys!
- Are your parents awake?
I think we...
I think we lost them.
...Okay.
I don't...
I don't get it.
I...
This is where the map ends.
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship.
Maybe it's invisible.
What is it?
Wait, what-what's he talking about?
What do you want us to...
Dude, what?
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa...
- Oh.
Everybody good?
What's down there?
Be careful, man.
What?
That's it.
Dude, it-it's underneath.
So this whole time...
That's why they want all our houses.
They were digging.
Yo, Alex, I know what you're thinking.
Alex!
Alex, man!
Th-The only way that thing can take off is to come up out of the ground through us.
That's a really bad idea.
Dude, what are you doing?
This is not just about us anymore.
It's about other people now, a whole community still asleep in their beds.
Let's just think this through first.
- I trust him.
- Listen to us.
Alex!
Alex!
Alex!
Is this where we're supposed to be?
- Make up a plan.
- No, we got to run.
- What are you talking about?
- If the ship's right under...
- We can't leave.
- I know we can't leave him.
- What about Alex?
What about everyone up here that's gonna die?
Alex!
Dude, say something!
Oh, my God.
I left you behind once.
I'm not doing it again.
Hi, guys.
Whoa.
Whoa.
This... this is in-insane.
So, um, beep.
Uh, um,
I don't really know how to say good-bye... so I'm not gonna.
And, um...
Um...
You're my friend, you know?
Even when I'm old, even when... even when you think I've forgotten...
I'm always gonna be there.
Do you feel that?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, we need to go now!
We have to go.
Bye.
Go, go, go!
Wait, wait, wait, my camera!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Dude, are you all right?
- Everybody good?
- Are you all right?
Okay.
That was so close.
What the heck?
- Oh, my...
- What the...?
Yeah!
Oh, my God.
Dude, this is amazing.
I think you're gonna want to get this.
Oh!
We did it, dude.
We did it.
Dude, it...
Did you see that?
Did you see...
- Wow.
We did that!
- You're like...
That's insane.
We just did that!
That's...
Look, come on.
Look, look, people want to know what happened.
If we told them what happened, they wouldn't believe us.
Guys, it's morning.
Oh, crap, I gotta get home.
- My dad is gonna kill me.
- I think I need a ride.
We should go because people, they'll start asking...
Hey, buddy...
Did you guys feel that earthquake?
- Were you okay?
- No, Mom, I'm fine.
- Let me see.
- He's fine.
Honey, he's fine.
Did no one just see the giant spaceship?
!
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, a spaceship.
What just happened?
!
Oh, oh, okay, okay.
I know it's been really hard lately,
- and we've all been really overwhelmed.
- Just...
Why don't we... why don't we just go in and relax.
Maybe we can, um, go get that-that pizza we talked about.
- All right?
Yeah.
- Pizza?
- If we don't play along,
- Yeah, his mom saw the ship.
Obody's gonna get it okay?
- How could I play along?
- So just...
- Yes, I'm sure.
I found them here at Alex's.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, no, no.
Actually, uh, we found him here.
I thought he was staying with you.
No, I was told they were at Munch's.
I'll call you back, babe.
Yeah, yeah, they were at my house.
We-we played this game where you play as a guy with the soul of a dragon, and it had really good voices.
The voices were great, so...
Who's this?
That's Emma.
I'm, uh, he's my boyfriend.
I mean, friend who's a boy.
- Um...
- Awkward.
She's hot, right?
Knock it off, you.
Six hours later, Alex moved.
I just got grounded for, like, life.
Me, too.
Might as well move now.
Not gonna be seeing anyone for a while.
Yeah.
But this... what really happened tonight... o one knows but us.
Hey, Alex!
Time to go, buddy.
I'm gonna miss you guys.
You guys smell really bad.
Our last night together, we did a lot.
A whole lot.
But there's some things we couldn't do.
Alex's parents had already bought a new home.
Most of the neighborhood had.
Munch's, too.
So, one by one, people started to move.
My parents hadn't, so we got to stay.
New people started moving in, and Mulberry Wood started again, but not the one that had my friends in it.
When you're a kid, you think you're invisible.
You think you can't make a difference.
We're not kids anymore.
We know now... that we can do anything.
Having a friend light-years away taught us that distance is just a state of mind.
If you're best friends, then you always will be no matter where you are in the universe.
Guys, my just...
my phone just...
You guys got to see this.
Hey, hey, Tuck, dude.
- Okay, we're rolling.
- Okay, hold on.
B-Before you go, look-look at my coat.
- It's cool, huh?
- What is that?
Can we do another take with it on, though?
No.
Okay.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- TUCK:
Ready when you are.
(SNIFFS) Okay.
How do I smell?
Or I mean, look, or you know?
Yeah, you can't smell a video.
Okay.
(CLEARS THROAT)
- Ruckus, dude, you got to get out of here.
- (BARKS)
Hi, I'm Reginald.
I don't really get friends much, but it's probably because I'm a bit of... an acquired taste.
That's what my mom says.
And I'm sure whatever school I'm forced to go to no one will acquire it.
So... thanks for paving a road over, really, the only place I've ever had any real friends.
Okay, we good?
- TUCK:
Uh, say your name.
- I thought you knew my name.
You know what I mean; for the video.
Dude, we've been hanging out for years.
- Come on.
- Dude, stop fronting.
Just tell the camera.
You're upset, right?
You don't want to move.
TUCK:
I've never gone a day without seeing my friends.
They're, like, the only people in the world who get me.
And now it's just all over, you know?
Good luck finding that again.
So wherever-wherever Munch is going, man...
Look, you people listen to me, all right?
He's-he's a really good kid.
So don't just assume that he's weird and that's it.
And Alex, man...
He's a foster kid.
He's been moved all over.
I mean, it's like, why do you have to build a freeway right through?
You know, can't you just go around or something?
You're going along feeling like your own person with your own friends, and then something like this comes along... that you have no power to stop... because you're just a kid.
(SCOFFS)
You're just a kid.
(PHONE RINGS)
Yeah, hey, man.
(SNIFFS)
Yeah, yeah, I'm up, I'm up.
Whoa, whoa, man, slow down.
What's the problem?
Yeah, my-my phone's good.
Why?
What happened?
- Wait, what?
- (CLICK)
(VOICE-OVER):
This is when everything started to change.
So, being me,
I kept filming.
I'm Tuck.
What you're about to see happened to me and my best friends one year ago.
This is the story of our last week together.
- (STATIC BUZZES, CRACKLES)
- Phones all over our neighborhood are freaking out.
We've done everything we could possibly do with this phone.
We threw it at the wall, we took it to the phone guy, we took it to the store where we got it from, and they say it's a problem.
So you know it's serious.
It looks like your phone basically barfed on the screen.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
I was just eating dinner, and all of a sudden, all the phones in the house just did this.
At exactly the same time.
Dude.
- What?
It's freaky.
- (PHONE RINGS)
- De hello?
- Hey, Alex.
Oh, Munch, you're outside.
MUNCH:
Get over here, over here, down the street.
TUCK:
Ask him if his phone barfed yet.
ALEX:
Did your phone barf yet?
- Phones are still working.
- ALEX:
Cool.
Keep going, and we'll meet you in the backyard.
Okay, copy that.
I'll take swift steps.
TUCK:
When I look back at that day,
I realize the clues were all around us.
(CHUCKLES) We had no idea.
Dude, they all still work.
See?
(PANTING)
Dude, you know if this whole thing works,
- these phones are done.
- No, I know.
- I have 14 spares; it's okay.
- (PHONE CHIRPS)
- (SCOFFS) I bet you do.
- Okay.
All right, anyways, let's spread out.
- Okay.
- Alex, go by the gate.
Munch, go on the far end,
- Yeah, I got it.
- And I'll stay right here by my camera.
- Just watch out!
- Okay, okay.
Okay, it's good.
It's good...
It's good...
- (STATIC SCREECHING)
- Whoa, okay, it went out.
TUCK:
Whoa, whoa, it barfed!
All right, people, if you go to Alex's house, your phones will spew chunks all over his screen.
My mom said the Murphys' phones and the Churleys' changed, too.
So what do you think this is?
TUCK:
Whoa!
- (TUCK CHUCKLES) - (DOORBELL RINGS)
(TUCK GROANS)
These dudes.
- (LOW, INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
- Hi.
- Is that on?
- I don't know.
- Maybe.
- Oh.
We had an electrical short over at the site, and it may be disrupting people's phone service, and we're wondering if that happened
- to anybody in this house?
- Oh, no, my phone is good.
- 'Cause we're offering new phone vouchers
- Uh-huh.
in exchange for any device in this area here
- that may be displaying
- That's weird, that's weird.
- Faulty messages or images?
- I don't know.
See you.
No, listen, I...
Okay, so you-you really don't think this is a little bit weird?
These dudes come here to build a freeway
- and now they want our phones?
- Well, I think it's gonna work.
No.
Clean your room.
Oh, my...
I'm not gonna have a room if we don't do something.
- Right, I think...
- No, Mom, seriously.
These guys want our houses.
Maybe if we expose them for illegal property, then...
- TUCK:
Yo!
- Aw, you don't like how things are, do you?
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
- (ELECTRONIC CHIME)
- Dude, it's a map to the desert.
Like, what is that?
What do we do with this?
I guess most maps are made to be followed.
Exactly.
It could go to, like, some crazy headquarters, and we find out that these construction clowns are spies and we expose them to the world.
It's 20 miles away.
What...
No, we're not... we're not gonna go.
No, obviously not.
Look, whatever it is, this Saturday, we're going to sneak behind our parents' backs and find out.
I'm moving Saturday.
All right, all right, so Friday night.
Our last night together?
It doesn't have to be;
that's what I'm saying.
Like, I don't want to move, and these clowns are making us do it.
Maybe we can stop them.
Now, are you in?
Yeah, all right.
- A ll right.
- I'm in.
Munch, don't you bail out on us now.
Dude, I'm not.
Me?
No... pfft!
I'm in.
Yeah!
All right!
That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, all right.
Bring it in.
- Oh, oops!
- Munch!
So, why would you be organizing your ketchups?
- Because.
- Who does that?
So I can get to them easier, and then it's more organized,
- and it's better.
- And you are my friend.
Guys, guys, it's time to practice the big lie.
Hey, Mom, I'm spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a neat, brand-new video game.
And I'm sleeping over at Tuck's house so we can play a new video game.
And I'm sleeping in your mom's bed,
- not playing a video game.
- Oh, my God, all right, dude.
Stop talking about my mother, thank you.
All right, the camera's are gonna be on 24 hours a day, nonstop.
Dude, can you stop touching, please?
It attaches to my bike, and it's also a pretty good way to get footage on the fly.
Spy glasses.
I love these;
I love them.
And last, camera, but definitely not least...
What up, camcorder?
Keeping it tight.
Looking pretty good these days.
Tuck, these are the ugliest things I've ever seen.
Dude, what?
What are you...
what are you talking about?
Those are...
They're sweet.
- The camera's undetectable,
- Wow.
- And the ladies love them.
- Prove it.
Prove it?
(SCOFFS)
This guy, all right?
Give me my glasses, man.
Those are stealth.
Now I'm gonna prove to you guys spy glasses get you girls.
MUNCH:
Oh, my gosh, he's going over there.
- I can't see who he's talking to.
- Shut up, Munch.
TUCK:
Uh, hi, uh...
Hey, um, Em-Emma, right?
Emma?
I was just... (TUCK SPUTTERS)
Okay, uh, can I borrow a piece of paper, please?
MUNCH:
He has something.
- I can't see who he got it from.
- We're about to see right now.
Look, look, look, look.
He has a paper.
ALEX:
You did not get her number.
Totally got her number.
Right there.
You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.
You, too, you're a sellout.
No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.
Yes, I did.
Mannequin Girl?
(ALEX LAUGHS)
What kind of name is that?
What?
That's what I call her.
I think mannequins are hot.
- (SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
- TUCK:
I'll leave my house at 6:00.
15 minutes later, I pick up Alex.
- Munch, we'll get you at 6:30.
- Yeah.
Okay?
Tonight, we're no longer boys.
We're men. (GRUNTS)
- TUCK:
Dude, what the...?
- I didn't see you, man.
(TUCK SIGHS)
ALEX:
Tuck, you all right?
Let's go.
TUCK:
Our whole lives we've been nobodies.
In visible.
The good kids.
(CHUCKLES) Not anymore.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
All right, Ma.
I'm leaving.
Spending the night at Alex's house so we can play a new video game.
Have whatever you want, honey.
- (CONVERSATION CONTINUES) - (TUCK SIGHS)
You know what, I lied, actually.
We're gonna ride our bikes out into the desert at night alone.
Without supervision.
We got that; we're going to state.
Okay, see you then, sweetie.
- We could go.
- Also rob a bank.
- All the way.
State.
- What?
TUCK:
Go to Mexico.
Maybe even start a new life.
- Right, I know.
- Wrestling!
TUCK'S MOM:
You're trying to act like I don't know what I'm talking about.
(CONVERSATION AND LAUGHTER CONTINUE)
What's up, Stumpy?
Yo, man, I told you to stop to calling me that.
You know what, man, look, my girl's throwing this huge party later tonight, if you want to come by.
(ENGINE STARTS)
You serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
Because not a lady in the world can resist a natty old BMX bike.
What's the zero to 60 on that bad boy, huh?
Two, three days?
(TIRES SQUEALING, ENGINE RUMBLING)
(HUMMING)
Come on, come on, dude, you ready?
Let's go.
(LAUGHS) I can't even tell a difference.
This looks exactly the way it looked before you packed.
All your stuff fitting in one box?
What are you, a drifter?
Who told you?
Look, all I'm saying is, when you get to your new house, put a poster up, put some shelves on the wall, frame a photo.
Look, there's a painting right there.
Put something on a shelf...
That's not a painting.
That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt, smudged it and called it art.
I'm going to Munch's house to play a video game, all right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure, buddy.
- Bye, Dylan.
- Have fun with your friends.
- Hey, hey, Tuck.
- TUCK:
How are you?
Uh, good luck with the move to New York, buddy.
- Maybe we'll come see you.
- All right, cool.
The moving truck is coming at 10:00.
Make sure you're back, okay?
TUCK:
I-I don't get it.
If your foster parents already have a baby of their own, why do they need you?
There's no sense in having two babies.
- Shut up, dude.
- One baby cries all the time, the other one listens to indie rock.
Let's go.
- (ALEX WHOOPING) - (TUCK HUMMING)
ALEX:
Yeow!
WOMAN:
Guys, would you please help my son with his room, before I go crazy?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I don't think he's started...
Honey, have you even started packing your room?
MUNCH:
I told you a thousand times,
I'm alphabetizing!
(ALEX CHUCKLES)
TUCK:
Yo, let's scare him, let's scare him.
Shh.
(DOOR CREAKS)
(VIDEO PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)
MAN (ON VIDEO):
...they're flexible, they're "dynamical,"
they can be curved, they can bend, and this opens up a whole new universe of possibilities, and one of the possibilities is that there can be shortcuts through space and through time.
So that's really just what a Wormhole is.
It's taking advantage... (BOYS WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
(SCREAMING)
What are you...
Aah!
- Why don't you stop doing that?
!
- I'm sorry!
You guys are gonna give me a heart attack one day.
- I'm sorry.
- Turn that off, dude.
(MUTTERING)
- (BEEPING)
- I created a substation for each of our parents' phones that's wired to the router, which is wired to the transmitter, which transmits to the receiver, which is...
- my phone.
- TUCK:
Okay, so basically, no matter who our parents call, it goes to your phone.
Yeah.
My mom's friends always say that I sound just like my mom, you know,
- when I pick up the phone...
- Yeah.
So I figured, I can be Betty.
(COMPUTERS AND GADGETS BEEPING)
ALEX:
Bye, Betty.
Thank you.
Um, I'm going to Alex's...
or Munch's... or Tuck's house, and we're gonna play a video game and sleep over.
BETTY:
Wait, what's all that stuff?
Honey?
(SIGHS)
ALEX:
Good job, Munch.
You did it.
TUCK:
Here we come.
17.6 miles.
(TUCK HUMMING HAPPILY)
♪ Going to the desert... ♪
Munch, what are you doing?
Guys, guys, just hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Dude...
- I'm not backing out or anything,
- He wants to quit right when we - ...just-just hear me out.
- Been waiting for this forever.
- Dude, listen, come on, okay.
This is crazy what we're doing.
Dude, I don't want to punk out or back out or anything... it's just, my mom, you know, she just got divorced.
- Munch...
- She's already had enough guys lying to her.
If you didn't want to come, then why didn't you tell us earlier?
TUCK:
You do understand this is our last night together.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Look, Munch, if we don't go now, we'll never go.
We won't even be here.
This is our last chance to try and do something.
Even-even if it is stupid.
- Yeah.
- You know what,
I say we put a vote to it.
All in favor raise your hand.
Well, now I have to raise my hand.
Munch, just...
Fine, fine.
Okay, whatever.
I'll go.
But only under one condition.
- TUCK:
I call the black!
- ALEX:
Mine!
No, no, give it!
MUNCH:
It's so weird, no one's gonna be in these houses next week.
ALEX:
Dude, you're so full of it.
- When did you kiss her?
- TUCK:
Dude, trust me.
After pre-algebra, she pulled me into the bathroom.
Wait, wait, wait, wait...
Mannequin Girl?
- TUCK:
Yeah!
- Was she good at it?
TUCK:
Uh, eh, B minus.
You know, I've kissed better in better locations.
No, how do I know you're not lying?
TUCK:
Trust me.
I don't even have to reply to you.
- You're last!
- MUNCH:
Hey, you got a head start!
That's not fair!
TUCK:
Oh, so what, there's a Wing Stop?
I never been to a Wing Stop.
(BIRDS SQUAWKING)
TUCK:
We followed a map out in the middle of nowhere.
MUNCH:
It might be, like, a CIA prison.
TUCK:
We were miles from home.
(BOYS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
No one in the world knew it.
No one said it... but we were scared.
ALEX:
We haven't seen a car in, like, half an hour.
TUCK:
We were on our own.
MUNCH:
This-this is the way, right?
You have the map, right?
- Can I see the map?
- ALEX:
Left.
MUNCH:
Left?
Are you sure?
Because right looks a little bit more promising.
- (COYOTES HOWLING, YIPPING)
- Did you guys hear that?
ALEX:
Just a couple more miles.
(STEADY ELECTRONIC PULSING)
TUCK:
Hold on.
What is that?
It's the map.
TUCK:
Are we close?
MUNCH:
I never understood why people like the outdoors.
TUCK:
Will you stop freaking out?
(ELECTRONIC PULSING CONTINUES)
Yo, this is too steep, man.
Let's go, man.
(ELECTRONIC PULSING CONTINUES)
MUNCH:
We're getting pretty far from the road, guys.
ALEX:
Almost there.
(ELECTRONIC PULSING SLOWS)
TUCK:
Is it this thing?
(SIGHS)
(ELECTRONIC TRILLING, THEN STATIC CRACKLING)
ALEX:
I don't think so.
(ELECTRONIC PULSING AND TRILLING STOP)
TUCK:
Wait, what was that?
- ALEX:
I don't know.
- Well, hold on.
What'd you see, dude?
- (PULSING RESUMES)
- TUCK:
Over here!
ALEX:
We're almost there.
Come on.
(ELECTRONIC PULSING STOPS)
MUNCH:
Oh.
TUCK:
What?
TUCK:
What do you think it is?
How would I know?
TUCK:
Why does it look all burnt?
MUNCH:
Hey, just be careful.
- Careful!
- Yeah, don't touch that thing.
Could be...
MUNCH:
C-Could be...
I don't know, I don't know.
A part of a satellite?
TUCK:
All right, all right, um, Munch, film me while I'm...
- while I'm touching this thing.
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Let me try it.
Thank you.
It's dusty.
It's a piece of crap.
MUNCH:
What?
Forget about it.
Just turn off the camera.
MUNCH:
Well, it's not a national treasure, but it could be used for something.
(TUCK SCOFFS) It's crap.
What happened to filming 'cause it's our last night, huh?
Um, in case you haven't noticed, obviously, the map led to squat.
ALEX:
Got it.
So all you cared about was getting your stupid hits on your stupid video?
- Dude, why don't you just...
- MUNCH:
Whoa, guys, guys, guys.
Come on!
I know we're all frustrated...
- (PHONE RINGING, GASPS)
- It's Alex's mom.
- TUCK:
Are you serious?
- ALEX:
Um, it'll be fine.
Just, um, be Betty, okay?
- Oh, man.
- MUNCH:
Oh, crap.
Yo, I thought I could do this, but I can't.
Maybe you can answer it.
She just likes to check up on things, okay?
All right. (GASPS)
WOMAN:
Betty, are you there?
(WHISPERING):
Go.
This is Betty.
WOMAN:
I was thinking maybe I could bring over some pizzas?
TUCK:
Dude, go.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No coming over.
- Just hang up.
- No way.
No, it's really no trouble.
We have a coupon.
- I said no!
No pizzas!
- What?
- No, uh...
- TUCK:
Don't yell at her, man.
Maybe you and your husband should go to bed.
TUCK:
Stop saying words!
ALEX'S MOM:
Are you sure everything's okay?
Have a good night.
Go to sleep.
(LINE DISCONNECTS, BEEPS)
(CHUCKLES) That could've gone better.
TUCK:
That was horrible.
"Your husband should go to sleep"?
Was that really something smart to say?
Munch.
Don't look at me like I'm a hoarder.
That's rude.
(DISTANT VOICES)
ALEX (WHISPERING):
Who are they?
MUNCH:
I don't...
I don't know.
MAN (OVER RADIO):
I'm picking up some spikes in the readings...
ALEX:
Get down, get down.
Turn your flashlight off, dummy.
Let's go.
MUNCH:
Why would they be out this far?
TUCK:
Who cares?
The night's blown.
(STATIC CRACKLES)
- Aah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa.
(PANTING)
ALEX:
Munch?
(CHUCKLES)
- You're a character.
- There's something in there!
ALEX:
What?
TUCK:
Dude, are you kidding me right now?
MUNCH:
Something is in that bag.
It-it touched me.
TUCK:
Go check.
MUNCH:
Be-be careful.
(HARSH SCREECHING)
- TUCK:
What?
- Did it poke you, too?
TUCK:
What, dude?
Say something!
What did you see?
There-There's something in there.
Yeah, a bunch of crap Munch brought.
(CHUCKLES)
- You guys are funny.
- All I know is it beeped.
You know, why don't you go in there and just see.
TUCK:
Beeped?
What are you talking about?
Babies.
I'll do it myself.
Dang, how much stuff do you have in your bag, dude?
Geez.
Oh, boy, are you guys talking about this?
It's garbage.
It's nothing.
What are you talking about, you heard something?
It made a noise.
Hey, hey, do something!
See, it's not doing anything.
What are you talking about?
Beep.
(SNARLING, SNAPPING)
(TUCK LAUGHS)
Do that again, do that again.
Do what again?
Do what you just did.
- Beep.
- (SNARLING, SNAPPING)
Whoa, hold on.
Let me...
Let me try this for myself.
Beep.
Beep?
Why is it making noise only for you and not me?
Make it beep again.
Beep.
- (CLANK, HISSING)
- Whoa!
MUNCH:
This is it!
It's a bomb!
(FADING INTO DISTANCE):
No, no, oh, God, no!
No, no, no!
(CHITTERING)
ALEX:
Guys, I think...
I think it might have defused.
I don't know.
TUCK:
Man, nothing's happening.
All right, hold on, hold on.
I got an idea.
MUNCH:
Tuck!
What?
MUNCH:
Okay, it didn't do anything, but j-just don't do it again.
Are you insane, Tuck?
!
Are you sure you guys know what you're doing?
TUCK:
Yes, trust me.
When it's a bomb, you have to act quick.
I seen it on some TV show or some movie or something.
- ALEX:
Saw what?
- Check it out.
MUNCH:
What are you doing?
!
Disarming it.
MUNCH:
Are you crazy?
!
It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.
That's not what you do with a bomb!
Are you insane?
!
- (ELECTRONIC CHIRP, PINGING)
- What was that?
It's not my phone.
It's the thing, whatever that is.
- What are you talking about?
- It's that.
That's what just made that noise.
(ELECTRONIC PINGING)
I, uh...
It, like, imitated my ringtone.
TUCK:
This is what made our phones barf?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
ALEX:
Did you hear that?
- (STATIC CRACKLES)
- ALL:
Whoa, whoa.
All right, so, a couple of seconds ago, our phones went crazy.
Bananas, insane.
I don't know what to call it.
Look.
You see that?
It's a new map, but on my phone this time.
To me?
All right, him, or...
Dude, Munch's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and, ugh, I don't even know what that is.
Alex's phone, it just turned on by itself and started filming.
We can't even turn them off.
Oh, don't try to act like it's not cool.
That is weird.
ALEX:
It's showing us where we are.
MUNCH:
And you don't find that creepy?
What do you think that is?
You think that's a road?
We should follow the map.
MUNCH:
How about no.
TUCK:
How about yes?
We wanted a last night together, so what do you call this?
A trap?
MUNCH:
Didn't you guys see the "No Trespassing" sign?
TUCK:
Oops.
I didn't see anything.
(ELECTRONIC TONE PULSING, STUTTERING)
This is where the map says to go.
(LEAVES CRUNCHING)
Stop stepping on leaves.
MUNCH:
There's leaves everywhere.
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
- (GRUNTING)
- Shh.
What was that?
(ELECTRONIC TONE PULSING, STUTTERING)
Where do you think it's taking us to?
(INDISTINCT TALKING CONTINUES)
(ELECTRONIC TONE CONTINUES)
MUNCH:
Maybe another one of those beepy things.

- Whoa!
Whoa!
- Get down!
Oh, geez!
Munch, watch out!
Aah!
Aah!
TUCK:
Aah!
ALEX:
What's going on?
Dude, Munch, what was that?
(CLATTERING, RUMBLING)
(BOYS SCREAM)
TUCK:
Where is it?
Is it over?
- Oh, geez.
- (SCREAMING)
Dude!
MUNCH:
Tuck, stay back.
- TUCK:
Whoa.
- MUNCH:
Stay back.
- (ELECTRONIC WARBLING)
- MUNCH:
What's...
TUCK:
Dude!
(WHIRRING, BEEPING)
- Wait, wait, be careful.
- (ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
MUNCH:
Your phone just got a new map.
ALEX:
What?
(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Wait, why is it opening?
TUCK:
Hold on, hold on.
Did you see that just now?
- (ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
- ALEX:
What is that?
- TUCK:
Whoa!
What is that?
- MUNCH:
What is that?
- What is that?
- Oh, my...
Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.
ALEX:
It-it's moving.
TUCK:
There's something in there right now.
MUNCH:
What's in there?
Oh, don't tell me.
ALEX:
Are those... eyes?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
Dude, dude, it's looking dead at us right now.
MUNCH:
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
ALEX:
It's trembling like it's hurt.
MUNCH:
Good.
TUCK:
My heart's beating so fast right now.
Wow.
MUNCH:
Almost got us killed, like, three times already.
Yeah, but it was worth it, dude.
Incredible.
All right, so...
I just figured out why Alex's camera was on this whole time.
So this thing, whatever it is, it's eyes are, like, all screwed up, completely.
You see?
So, basically, it uses his phone to see.
That's insane.
(ALEX CHUCKLES)
ALEX (DISTORTED):
You think he can see us right now?
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
Munch, you have to check this out.
This is amazing.
(CLICK, ELECTRONIC SNARL)
MUNCH:
Is it?
Is it amazing?
'Cause I think it's scary as balls.
I mean, obviously people are looking for it.
- Munch...
- It has access to our voicemails and our texts and our ringtones.
TUCK:
How do you even know it's a he?
Are you a dude?
(BEEPS)
(CHUCKLES)
Wait... you understood us.
(BEEPS, WARBLES)
Whoa. (CHUCKLES)
All right, here's how it goes.
One beep is yes, two beeps are no.
Watch.
Is one beep yes?
(BEEPS ONCE)
TUCK:
Yo, that's so tight.
Are we in a barn?
(BEEPS ONCE)
Is Munch really a woman?
(BEEPS TWICE)
Oh, come on, man, this thing is broken.
Everybody knows Munch is a woman.
Okay, I have a question.
Are we gonna die tonight?
Why isn't it answering?
What...
Well, that's not good, right?
20 questions with an alien.
Tuck Simms exclusive.
- Let's do this.
- Check it out.
All right, um, are you from space?
- (BEEPS ONCE)
- Ooh!
Are you a robot?
(BEEPS TWICE)
Do you eat humans?
(BEEPS TWICE)
(SIGHS)
Do you like Earth?
(BEEPS TWICE)
Why?
Why doesn't he like Earth?
Do you like us?
(BEEPS ONCE)
You see?
I told you.
We're cool like that.
Come on.
Are you hurt?
(BEEPS ONCE)
- Oh.
- He's hurt.
Well, his lights seem brighter, so...
Did that piece help you?
(BEEPS ONCE)
Oh.
Can we help fix you or something?
Or...
Like, what is this?
Are-are you trying to build something?
- (BEEPS ONCE)
- Oh, he's trying to build...
Building something.
Right there.
- What could he be building?
- Yeah.
So, wait, what are, what are you building?
- Lasers?
- (BEEPS TWICE)
- A portal?
- (BEEPS TWICE)
- Minions?
- (BEEPS TWICE)
- A cloaking device?
- (BEEP TWICE)
- It's an army.
- (BEEPS TWICE)
Ignore him.
- Spaceship?
- (DEEP ELECTRONIC WHIR)
Oh, my God!
Hold up, hold up.
So let me get this right.
So you're building a spaceship,
- He's building a spaceship.
- And you need our help building the spaceship?
- (BEEPS ONCE)
- Oh, man.
This guy is building a spaceship.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Let me make sure I don't have any plans.
Nope!
We're building a spaceship!
He's building a spaceship.
TUCK:
We asked him questions for almost two hours.
Where he came from.
If there were others here like him.
We found out he was lost... and alone.
He was out in the middle of nowhere, on his own, like us.
All we really knew was that he crashed, and now he needed us to rebuild him.
ALEX:
The map says up ahead.
MUNCH:
Are we going the right way?
(HORNS HONKING, DISTORTED)
Look, look, look, look, whatever that is, the map goes to it.
All right, so wait-wait a minute.
Let me get this right.
Dude comes from a million light-years away, and he wants to come here?
I don't know, the map said so.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
You got to look both ways before you cross the street.
ALEX:
Munch.

It's tchotchke trash.
If you give it to me as a gift, I'd still throw it away.
- It's trash.
- CUSTOMER:
No, it's vintage.
OWNER:
No.
You don't get to say the word "vintage."
I'm the one who gets to say when what is vintage.
Excuse me, sir, you have a very, very lovely shop.
MAN:
Come on, you sure?
Hey.
Oh, man, look at the hand painting.
It's all crafted right there.

TUCK:
Dude, that place was wrecked!
MUNCH:
Sorry again, sir!
ALEX:
Go!
Go!
Down here!
TUCK:
Let's get somewhere so we can look at him.
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
ALEX:
He's shaking.
(ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
TUCK:
Whoa, he's letting you touch him.
- MUNCH:
I wouldn't, guys.
- Hey, what about here?
Here, set him on here.
- (ALEX LAUGHS)
- MUNCH:
He looks scared.
TUCK:
Yeah, why is he all balled up?
Can't you stand?
You all right?
- (ELECTRONIC CHITTERING)
- MUNCH:
Maybe he's... maybe he's just shy.
- Ooh, can you fly?
- TUCK:
Can you do X-ray vision?
MUNCH:
How?
He can't see.
ALEX (CHUCKLES):
He doesn't even know where to look.
TUCK:
All right, all right, I think the question is, what can you do?
TUCK:
Okay, so Dr. Nichols is doing a surgical procedure with very sophisticated technology.
- Pen caps.
- (TUCK LAUGHS)
Clear.
MUNCH:
Wait, I don't get it.
How is that sophisticated?
It's kind of just, like, pen caps.
I got it.
(QUIET ELECTRONIC WARBLING)
TUCK:
Be careful.
His legs are fragile.
- (ALEX LAUGHS)
- MUNCH:
Whoa.
Get this.
Are you getting this?
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

TUCK:
Oh, that's crazy!
So you can't fly, but you can float.
- (ELECTRONIC CHIRP)
- TUCK:
That is so crazy!
(ALL LAUGHING)
I saw you.
I saw you grinning, man.
Stop trying to pretend like that wasn't cool.
- That was hot.

(BEEPING)
- (RAPID BEEPING)
- Is that it, right there?
(QUIET ELECTRONIC WARBLING)
Why don't I go first.
Hi.
Um, my name's Alex, and... you're-you're in...
Munch, no... you're in my hand right now.
You know my ringtone, which is, like, insane and awesome.
(ELECTRONIC PINGING)
(WHIRRING)
(CHIRPING)
Okay, um...
Hi.
I'm Tuck.
What's up?
I don't even know what to say, but, uh... but, uh, I'm from...
I'm from New York.
Uh, this is Nevada.
I don't even know, like, I like donuts,
- um...
- ALEX:
Donuts?
Really?
Okay, can somebody else do this?
I know, I'm going.
My name's M...
My real name is Reginald, but my friends call me Munch.
I hope we can be friends, too.
- (ELECTRONIC CHIRPING)
- Do you have a name?
Oh, we could call him Beep.
Dude, what-what kind of name is Beep?
Word.
We got to give him a name that's powerful, like... like Master Blaster.
He doesn't blast anything.
Peter.
Peter.
What about Peter?
Something cool, like Space Ninja or something.
MUNCH:
Well, how is there a ninja in space?
He wouldn't be able to breathe.
- All right, all right...
- Dude, you don't know that.
Have you ever been to space?
Which name do you like?
- MUNCH:
Uh, Beep.
Why?
- (BEEPS)
There it is.
- Hello.
Watch this.
Watch this.
- You can't echo...
Watch this.
Just...
Beep.
- (BEEPS)
- See?
- Echo.
- (CHIRPS)
- That's what we should call it.
Echo.
- (CHIRPS)
- Oh, 'cause it echoes.
- Wait, I don't get it.
- Echo, Echo, Echo.
- Echo.
Your name... is Echo.
ECHO (DISTORTED):
Echo...
Echo... (VOICE DISTORTING UNINTELLIGIBLY)
ALEX:
I don't think he's supposed to come out of that cylinder thing.
MUNCH:
He looks... dead.

Echo?
TUCK:
So then we didn't know how broken he was.
(ELECTRONIC CHIRPING)

We just need you to listen, sweetheart.
- TUCK (SIGHS):
Oh, man.
- GIRL:
You're grounding me?
ALEX:
Tuck, what are you doing?
Munch, go.
MAN:
It's the man... the man should choose his dance partner.
GIRL:
It's a stupid tradition.
WOMAN:
Really, it's about meeting new people, and many of those were our friends' sons.
And it's embarrassing when you ignore them.
MEN:
And these are life skills that we are teaching you.
- MUNCH:
Tuck, get back.
- Putting on this dress for you doesn't change me into some perfect little homecoming queen!
MAN:
Okay, no one's asking you to act like a homecoming queen.
WOMAN:
It's at least three years away.
MUNCH:
Now.
Go, go, go.
WOMAN: ...by the company you keep.
It's a cliché for a reason.
I'm sure this all seems...
MUNCH:
Guys, what are we doing?
We're gonna be trapped up here.
TUCK:
Everybody be quiet.

You got to be kidding me.
Aw, you know what?
Everyone just follow me, all right?
Don't look at anything.
Just hurry.
- Hey, Tuck, did you see this?
- No, don't...
Dude, Tuck, this is Mannequin Girl's house.
Now we can ask for permission to steal stuff, 'cause, you know, you guys are kissing buddies.
Aw, man...
TUCK:
It was a couple of days ago.
She probably forgot about it by now, you know?
Like, yeah, it's... yeah, she probably forgot.
- How would she forget about it?
- I almost forgot about it... (DEEP RUMBLING)
- TUCK:
Oh, boy, get ready.
- Uh-oh.
Close the door.
Close the door.
- (RUMBLING, CLATTERING)
- Dude, we just got to keep it from going crazy.
It's gonna get loud.
We'll catch it in a blanket.
- What?

- Whoa!
- Get down!
Whoa!

Remember you guys kissed?
- We what?
- Yeah, what are you talking about, huh?
Why is my room destroyed?
- Why are you filming this?
- (ELECTRONIC CHIRPING)
- And what is that?
- Um, it's a... it's a-a car muffler.
No.
I want to know what that is.
MUNCH:
It's actually a spaceship.
- Munch!
- Sorry.
Uh, well, we-we were following maps, and it just happened to lead here, so we were trying to help our friend Echo...
well, he's an alien
- TUCK:
Oh, God...
- ...that we're trying to get him on a ship.
See, look, it used to have six symbols, but now it has three, so that means we're almost there.
Crazy, right?
ALEX:
Munch, will you shut up?
An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?
- ALEX:
Nope.
- TUCK:
No, no.
(ECHO CHIRPS "NO")
(ELECTRONIC CHIRPING)
- You did not just see that.
- Yeah, I did.
MUNCH:
Yeah, she definitely saw it.
- GIRL:
Wait.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Hey, I want to go.
- Really?
Sounds great.
ALEX:
What?
No.
- Dude...
- You're not part of our group, so why don't you just go play with your super rich friends...
TUCK:
That's kind of harsh... and your ball gowns and just go eat steak or something.
- GIRL:
What the hell?
- TUCK:
Go, go, go.
(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE)
TUCK:
Dang, dude, what was that upstairs?
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you so mad.
MUNCH:
Yeah, dude, you did kind of snap.
ALEX:
All right, let's just...
don't talk about...
Nothing happened in there, all right?
TUCK:
You know, they say the girls you argue with
- are the ones you like.
- (ALEX SIGHS)
ALEX:
Don't go there, bro.
- (ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)
- Tuck, it's over there.
TUCK:
Wait, it wants us to go to a bar?
Man, I say we climb in a window or find a door.
There's got to be another way.
MUNCH:
Um, before-before we go...
I really need to get the pee out of my body.
- (TUCK GROANS)
- Let's just hope the next place isn't a bank.
(ECHO BEEPING)
TUCK:
I can't believe you told that girl to get lost.
- You're so dramatic.
- ALEX:
What about you?
You invented a whole kiss, didn't you?
Uh, first of all, for your info, it's called aspirational thinking.
You're thinking it one moment, you're living it the next.
- How's that working out?
- MAN:
Oh, excuse me.
(INDISTINCT RADIO COMMUNICATION)
(GASPS)
TUCK:
Go to the bikes.
MUNCH:
Oh, God, oh, God.
- TUCK:
Why is the construction man...
- Shut...
- MAN:
Excuse me.
- TUCK:
Aw...
Hey.
I know you guys.
You're the guys... you're from the construction site, right?
Uh, with the, uh, with the camera?
Whoa-ho, wait, wait.
Why aren't you guys at home right now?
You guys weren't riding your bikes out around the desert, were you?
- No, of course not.
- MUNCH:
Yes.
Uh, no.
That doesn't sound too... clear.
- MUNCH:
Uh...
- GIRL:
Thank God.
There you are.
- TUCK:
What?
- MAN:
Who-who are you?
Who am I?
(DRAMATIC SOBBING):
Who am I?
Exactly!
It's like I don't even know anymore.
My mom had to drag my dad from the bar... again!
- TUCK:
What?
- He likes to go there more than he likes to tuck in his own kids at night.
At least that's what my mom says.
MUNCH:
What's she talking about?
That's her.
Eating a burrito.
She east when she's stressed.
I ask myself if that's gonna be me one day.
What do you think?
Is it?
We make mistakes and we get married and we go to bars.
And these... these are my only friends in the world,
- 'cause they see me
- TUCK:
Uh... for who I really am.
MAN:
That's your mom over there?
- Do you want to meet her?
- No.
No.
No, no.
Just get home safe!
Told you guys I wanted to go.
- (ECHO CHIRPS "OH...!")
- TUCK:
What the...?
TUCK:
Okay, so this girl, man, she'd been tailing us since her house, spying on us like some creepy stalker.
- She'd overheard our whole plan.
- She... she's crazy.
- ALEX:
I need the bag!
- I think I like it.
(ENGINE REVS)
- (MUSIC BLARING)
- ALEX:
Oh, boy, get ready.
TUCK:
All right, try to blend in.
Look old.
WOMAN:
That must've been some good fake I.D.'s.
MAN:
What's up, baby face?
What are you doing in here, little man?
Oh, uh, I, uh...
- Are you Randy's kid?
- TUCK:
Uh,
- yes, he is.
- Um, y-yeah, yeah, yeah, he's my dad... or mom.
- You know, dad.
Mom.
- Okay, dude, just go.
- Hurry up.
- (ECHO WARBLING)
ALEX:
Emma?
Emma?
I was hanging out with this really pretty chick.
She's almost as pretty as you.
I mean... you're not pretty.
I mean, you are pretty.
Come over here.
Hop up on that stool.
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Oh, and one for his buddy here, too.
TUCK:
No, no, I'm all right.
Seriously, I'm all right.
- Sure, you'll like it.
- Sorry, I'm a...
I'm allergic.
Oh, you're gonna love it.
- Uh, no, no.
- You're gonna get one.
So, what happens next?
- Just give me back my bag.
- No.
Give it.
I'm serious.
Give me the bag.
Why are you being mean to me?
- Here, honey.
- TUCK:
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- (CHUCKLES):
Yeah.
MUNCH:
Wow, a lot of people with beards and mustaches in here, you know?
(DEEP RUMBLING, RATTLING)

You don't understand.

Are you kidding me?
- (EXCITED CHATTER) - (WHOOPS)
Do you guys just go around town breaking stuff?
TUCK:
Just keep running!
Go, go!
EMMA:
What was that?
I think the ship's trying to take off!
- (WHIRRING, CLICKING)
- TUCK:
Whoa, whoa!
(ALEX LAUGHING)
TUCK:
Are you seeing this?
This thing is flying a ship... in your backpack?
I think he's getting better.
MUNCH:
Oh.
So, you don't know how he crashed, or when, or why he came here with a spaceship in the first place?
Look, he only answers yes or no... it's not that simple.
Is this how I talk to him?
(ECHO CHIRPING)
- So, you crashed.
- (CHIRPS ONCE)
Did someone cause you to crash?
- (CHIRPS ONCE)
- ALEX:
Dude, what's she doing?
- TUCK:
I don't know.
- Someone on Earth?
(CHIRPS ONCE)
Do you think they're looking for you?
(CHIRPS ONCE)
It's not those guys in trucks from the convenience store, is it?
- (CHIRPS, CHITTERS)
- TUCK:
The construction man?
MUNCH:
Those are the guys that shot you down?
TUCK:
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We got to take a step back.
This is way bigger and shadier than before, okay?
This is not good.
If those dudes are looking for Echo, they're looking for us, you know?

(IMITATES BREATHING)
(EXHALES)
It's okay.

We're not leaving him.

I know how it feels.

(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS IN DISTANCE)

Uh, left?
- EMMA:
We could find a shortcut.
ALEX:
The map says up ahead.
MUNCH:
This map's confusing.
I was a mind ninja back there...
- EMMA:
So, what was it like kissing me?
- Give me my camera.
- Did your legs get all wobbly?
- (TUCK SCOFFS)
Was there soft music playing?
Please remind me, Tuck.
I totally forgot.
- What was it like?
- You're close.
Is this your first imaginary kiss?
TUCK:
The map says for us to go inside.
EMMA:
I'm confused.
- Huh?
- Didn't you guys kiss?
TUCK:
Anyway, the point is,
Emma was being annoying...
she kept walking off with Echo like she owned him, and talking to him about
I don't know what, I don't even know.
You know what?
Delete.
TUCK:
Man, are we sure there's no security guards or...
You know, that door wasn't even locked.
Hey, uh, guys, I was just thinking, you know,
I... haven't got to actually hold the, you know, the ship, before we did the thing, so can I do it?
- You know, before it gets crazy?
- EMMA:
Sure, but... it's not a ship.
TUCK:
What?
What are you talking about?
He told us it was a ship.
It's a key to your ship, right?
(ECHO CHIRPS)
(LOW ELECTRONIC WARBLING)
Well, if this is just the key, where's the spaceship?
- (CLATTERING, CRACKLING)
- All right, Munch, put it down.
- (ECHO CHIRPS)
- Okay, dude, no, I got it, I got it.
TUCK:
Okay, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you to put it down
- before you hurt both of us.
- I need this, man.
- (ELECTRONIC BLIPPING)
- TUCK:
That's weird.
- Does it know her?
- TUCK:
I don't know.
Munch!
(MUNCH GASPS)

You okay?

Yeah.

What are you guys doing?

Wow.

Um, she was gonna get hit by the piece, so I-I saved her.

Hey!

Did Alex get out?
(ECHO CHIRPS)
Uh, I d...
I don't know.
- We have to go back.
- Uh...
- Come on, you guys.
- Okay.
Look.
Whoa, whoa.
She's being stupid.
There's a guard in there, you know?
You can't just go running in, acting crazy.
We need a-a plan, or...
S... right?
GUARD:
Breaking and entering, destruction of property.
Those are felonies, kid.
(WHISPERS):
Okay, Echo, I need your help.
Um, I need you to... do something.
GUARD:
I have a minor here; he's 13.
Caught him breaking in with his friends.

(ARCADE GAME MUSIC CONTINUES)
- We should've gone back.
- All right, you know what?
Calm down, because if people would've listened to me, then Alex never would have gotten caught.
Didn't I say there would be security guards?
Alex!
Dude!
You're all right!
Are you all right?
Hey, Alex, we're good, man.
All right?
- MUNCH:
Buddy?
- We're good, man?
TUCK:
Alex.
Come on, dude.
Alex!
We could've gone home, but we didn't.
- We were outside.
- Turn off the camera.
Not till you admit you're acting mopey for no reason.
You're always freaking out if anyone's gonna leave you behind.
TUCK:
Do you know how expensive that is?
ALEX:
I'm glad I'm moving.
You were never my friend.
- Is that right?
Is that right?
- MUNCH:
Guys, guys,
- come on, just-just chill out.
- EMMA:
Come on!
EMMA:
Have you lost your mind?
TUCK:
I acted like I didn't know what I'd done.
But I knew exactly.
MUNCH:
I know we're all tired and stuff, and hungry.
I saw this awesome diner.
We can totally just go grab
- a bite to eat or something.
- EMMA:
Real awesome, guys.
- Real macho.
- (TUCK AND ALEX GRUNTING)
So, that's it?
The night's over?
Doesn't have to be.
Right?
Well, I mean, if it is, uh, we could...
I don't know, I guess we can keep the mood going, yeah?
Or we can do it another time, right?
Good times, the continuation, part two.
Right?
(TUCK SCOFFS)
(SIGHS) Hmm.
You know what?
I'm gonna talk about Sandra.
Man, that girl used to beat the crap out of you.
Me, too.
We were both little, small and scrawny.
She was a big girl, and she knew it.
But then I had a growth spurt, and you didn't, and I finally did something.
You remember that?
You told her I had polio.
Yeah, I told her that, and did she beat you up after that?
MUNCH:
She still beat me up.
'Cause I-I always get your back, man.
I never let you down;
I always get your back.
(TUCK SIGHS)
Most of the time.
Just when I'm not freaked out about security guards, all right?
I'm sorry, man.
Are we good?
(SOFTLY):
Yeah.

Just look for my brother.
Look for his keys.

I have a Porsche.

Oh, not you, sorry.
I wasn't trying to stop the fun...
I like it.

This signal has been transmitting for a very long time, from a ship that we believe is located right here in your neighborhood.
- ALEX:
What?
- TUCK:
Wait, what's he talking about?
MAN:
Six days ago, an object entered our atmosphere at 20,000 miles an hour, on a direct course for that ship.
We shot it down.
(TUCK SIGHS)
What you found activates the ship, and if that ship takes off, it could kill everyone.
He just wants to go home.
MAN:
Okay, that will not happen.
He is far too valuable.
TUCK:
This is crazy, this is crazy.
So... we are gonna follow this map and you are gonna help us get that thing operational, and it will lead us back to its ship, and we will disable it permanently.
Am I clear?

A what?
TUCK:
Here, here, give me the phones back.

I think that's his ship.

Whoa, that's a big ship.

- You're crying.
- Munch, it's your mom.
- What?
!
Look, look, look, look.
Dude.
- JANICE:
You okay?
- MUNCH:
So, Janice, gotta go... on my jog.
Can we act like we never had this conversation?
Uh, uh, just come over this wall.
Are you up?
- Guys, they're here.
- ALEX:
Jump.
- TUCK:
Move!
- MUNCH:
Faster!

They can't catch us in our own backyard.

This is the way to your house, man.
- Go, go, go, guys!
- Are your parents awake?
I think we...
I think we lost them.

Wait, what-what's he talking about?
What do you want us to...

Dude, what?
Whoa, whoa.
MUNCH:
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Oh.

MUNCH:
What's down there?
Be careful, man.
What?
ALEX:
That's it.
TUCK:
Dude, it-it's underneath.
(ECHO CHITTERING)
TUCK:
So this whole time...
ALEX:
That's why they want all our houses.
(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)
They were digging.
TUCK:
Yo, Alex, I know what you're thinking.
Alex!
Alex, man!
Th-The only way that thing can take off is to come up out of the ground through us.
That's a really bad idea.
MUNCH:
Dude, what are you doing?
TUCK:
This is not just about us anymore.
It's about other people now, a whole community still asleep in their beds.
MUNCH:
Let's just think this through first.
- I trust him.

Listen to us.

(DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE, CAR ALARMS CONTINUE BLARING)

Did you see that?
Did you see...
- Wow.
We did that!
- You're like...
That's insane.
We just did that!
That's...
Look, come on.
Look, look, people want to know what happened.
(SHOUTING IN DISTANCE) if we told them what happened, they wouldn't believe us.
MUNCH:
Guys, it's morning.
Oh, crap, I gotta get home.
- My dad is gonna kill me.
- EMMA:
I think I need a ride.
ALEX:
We should go because people, they'll start asking...
Hey, buddy...
Did you guys feel that earthquake?
- Were you okay?
- No, Mom, I'm fine.
- Let me see.
- He's fine.
Honey, he's fine.
Did no one just see the giant spaceship?
!
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, a spaceship.
What just happened?
!
JANICE:
Oh, oh, okay, okay.
I know it's been really hard lately,
- and we've all been really overwhelmed.
- Just...
Why don't we... why don't we just go in and relax.
Maybe we can, um, go get that-that pizza we talked about.
- All right?
Yeah.
- Pizza?
- If we don't play along,
- Yeah, his mom saw the ship.
- Nobody's gonna get it okay?
- How could I play along?
- So just...
- Yes, I'm sure.
I found them here at Alex's.
Yeah, yeah.
ALEX'S DAD:
Uh, no, no.
Actually, uh, we found him here.
TUCK'S DAD:
I thought he was staying with you.
ALEX'S DAD:
No, I was told they were at Munch's.
I'll call you back, babe.
Yeah, yeah, they were at my house.
We-we played this game where you play as a guy with the soul of a dragon, and it had really good voices.
The voices were great, so...
JANICE:
Who's this?
That's Emma.
I'm, uh, he's my boyfriend.
I mean, friend who's a boy.
- ALEX:
Um...
- TUCK:
Awkward.
She's hot, right?
JANICE:
Knock it off, you.
TUCK:
Six hours later, Alex moved.
I just got grounded for, like, life.
(CHUCKLES) Me, too.
TUCK:
Might as well move now.
Not gonna be seeing anyone for a while.
ALEX:
Yeah.
But this... what really happened tonight... no one knows but us.
ALEX'S DAD:
Hey, Alex!
Time to go, buddy.
I'm gonna miss you guys.
You guys smell really bad.
(CHUCKLING)
TUCK:
Our last night together, we did a lot.
A whole lot.
But there's some things we couldn't do.
Alex's parents had already bought a new home.
Most of the neighborhood had.
Munch's, too.
So, one by one, people started to move.
My parents hadn't, so we got to stay.
New people started moving in, and Mulberry Wood started again, but not the one that had my friends in it.
When you're a kid, you think you're invisible.
You think you can't make a difference.
We're not kids anymore.
We know now... that we can do anything.
Having a friend light-years away taught us that distance is just a state of mind.
If you're best friends, then you always will be... no matter where you are in the universe.

TV ANNOUNCER:
The Travel Channel presents,
"Backpacking Through Europe with a Bowlegged Man in Short Shorts."
Hello.
Come, let's see some beautiful sites together.
Hello, Tree.
Thank you for shade.
Hello, Mountain Cat.
Thank you for controlling local rat population.
Hello, Windmill.
Thank you for the cheese ride and ball cooling.
Next week, bullet trains.
Hello...!
Hey, Dad.
Are you busy?
I was thinking we could spend some time together.
Okay, are you a television set, or the Internet?
No.
Oh, then no.
No, thank you.
Are you sure?
Cause there's a three-day weekend coming up and I thought maybe you and I can finally go fishing like we've been talking about.
Aw, sorry, Chris, I can't.
I got insanity practice.
(yelling hysterically)
Pinwheels!
Pinwheels in my head!
Voices!
Angry fish!
How's he doing?
Not good.
He still thinks this is "practice" of some sort.
But you promised we'd go fishing.
Aw, Chris, I was just lying to you so you'd go away.
But, if you leave me alone now, I'll give you a billion dollars.
You've got a deal!
Peter, you know, i-it might help Chris to be able to spend some time with his father.
Well, what's in it for ol' Pete?
He's your son.
Don't you want someone to bond with.
No.
I only form unspoken bonds.

I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
You guys, that was my mom.
She said that Daddy broke his leg.
How?
!
A-Apparently, he got hurt at the mall.
Carter, please stop doing that.
We need to get you some new corduroys.
No!
None of the other boys are wearing corduroys!
I want dungarees!
You're going to get hurt doing that.
No I'm not!
I'm the champ at doing this!
Ow!
You jinxed me!
Aw, damn it!
Hey, call that beeping cart that carries around the fat black people.
Well, I guess Babs has her work cut out for her.
Actually, Mom can't take care of him, she's out of town doing a photo shoot for the cover of Veins Magazine.
So, are you gonna go take care of him, Mom?
I can't go.
I've got to go get my hair very minutely changed and then spend the next 14 hours trying to get people to notice.
Well...?
Lois, move.
You're blocking the TV.
(laughs) What do you think?
I think you're blocking the TV.
Peter, i-is there anything you want to say to me?
(sighs)
All right.
Amy at work kissed me.
It is true that I did not step away, but I did not lean in.
However, in my defense, she had recently gotten her hair done differently.
I was actually thinking that maybe you could go help Daddy.
Well, not me, Mom.
Last time I was at Grandpa's,
I beat him at checkers and he punched one of my hogans.
Well, what about Chris?
Wai-Wait, where is Chris?
He's upstairs in his room.
That's odd.
He never misses a meal.
I-I better go check on him.
Yeah, good idea.
I better check on my hairless twin in the storm shed.
Close the door, the moonlight burns!
It's almost Christmas.
It's almost Christmas.
Christmas?
!
Yes.
Keep being good and all the eggshells and coffee grounds will be yours.
Can I meet the family?
You've overstepped!
No Christmas!
(door slams shut)
Hey, Chris.
Are you okay?
Holy crap, it smells like farts in here.
Those are my farts.
Why doesn't Dad ever want to spend time with me?
Chris, come here.
Sit down.
You know I love you, right, sweetie?
Mom... not in front of my posters.
And your father loves you, too.
He just has trouble expressing his emotions.
PETER:
I love Mike Molly!
I love Mike and I also love Molly!
And I don't care who knows it!
You know, Chris, you've got a grandpa who could use your help right now.
I'm sure he'd enjoy spending time with you.
Okay...
I'll give it a shot.
You're not gonna kill yourself, are you?
That would be a severe black mark on my record as a mom.
Oh, I'd have to make up stories of a severe mental illness.
Make is seem a miracle you made it this long.
I could do that.
Sucks about your leg, Grandpa.
How you been doin'?
Well, let me tell you, this is awful.
I-I'm so bored.
I can't sleep, I-I just have to lie here and wait for my stupid leg to heal.
Oh, I'm really sorry, Grandpa.
And the worst part about it, is I can't have sex.
God!
I wish there was a way I could just do it myself.
You know, just-just to be done and napping within four minutes.
Let me show you something.
That... was... amazing!
And Lynda Carter wasn't actually here?
No!
That was just in your mind.
Incredible!
So-So you can do that like, wh-what, once a year or something?
No.
You can do it basically whenever you're not doing something else.
Cool!
Hey, next time I want to try it with my hand.
Hey, Grandpa.
What should we do now?
You wanna order a pizza?
Well, that doesn't sound very exciting.
But now you can follow your order online!
(keyboard clicking)
There it is.
It's on Van Buren!
Oh.
Oh.
He's almost here!
Wow, he's really fast.
Hey, I got an idea, let's put in two different orders and have 'em race!
(gasps) You think it'll crash the system?
Only one way to find out.
(keyboard clicking)
Here's your pizza.
That's $16.50.
We were playing a game with you.
That's what you are.
You're a clown.
Are you gonna pay for the pizza?
Yes.
Your money is in this pile of mashed potatoes.
Eat your way out.
No hands.
(munching, moaning)
This is fun, Chris.
I like hanging out with you.
Don't look up.
You're not a part of this.
♪
It's sounding really good, Grandpa.
I know, I know.
Sorry I'm late.
Look, Jason, are you taking this seriously?
Because Chris and I take this seriously.
You know, if you're not gonna show up to rehearsal, we'll find someone else who will, all right?
We want to get some paying gigs!
Sorry.
Geez.
Remember, this is about writing music that means something to us!

Now, let's play "I Fell in the Shower, So Maybe We Do Need That Bar."
Five, six, seven, eight!
Listen, Chris, I really want to thank you for coming to take care of me and helping me get well again.
Oh, it was no big deal.
Well, it is to me, and I want to give you some money for all your time.
Come on, y-you don't have to do that.
I just like getting to spend time with my grandpa, you know?
I...
Wait, wait, what?
You're... you're not gonna take the money?
No, I don't want your money.
I had fun hanging out with you.
Well, all right, then.
Hey, Grandpa, check it out.
When I make my elbow like this, it looks like women's private parts!
(laughs):
Oh, Chris!
You just have a way of looking at things that's delightfully fresh!
(both laughing)
We're not supposed to be doing this.
I bet we're not supposed to be doing this.
Daddy!
You're all better!
That's right, pumpkin.
And I have an important announcement to make.
I have decided to change my will, and name my grandson Chris the sole heir to the Pewterschmidt fortune.
You what?
What?
Oh, my!
(clattering in distance)
Oh, no!
My hairless twin got out!
(gunshot)
Hello, family.
Let's eat all the garbage we want.
Daddy, you're seriously leaving your entire estate to Chris?
I-I mean, what about Mom?
I promise she'll be dead before I am.
I promise.
But, Grandpa, I don't even want the money.
See?
This is exactly why you should get it!
So refreshing!
Well, I-I don't want it, either.
Good, 'cause you're not getting it.
Come on, what are you doing?
Listen, Carter, you take me out of your will,
I'm taking you out of mine.
Peter, that wasn't your will, that was your birth certificate.
Oh, no!
(gasps)
There's no light!
There's only fire!
Look, Carter, I suppose you're entitled to do what you want, but, you know, I'm just saying, if it were me,
I would give all the money to charity.
Oh, yeah?
Which charity?
Well, there are just so many that do such great work.
Name just one.
Um... well, you know...
Poor...
Green...
Whale...
Guns...
Books?
You are such a fraud.
Why won't anyone help us?
!
What the hell?
I can't believe your dad's giving all his cash to Chris!
I know it's strange, but in the end it's his money, so who really cares?
Well, yeah, but...
But what?
Peter... did you marry me for my money?
Of course not, Lois, but even you can't deny it was always gonna be a huge perk.
D-Did I use that right?
Perk?
Yes, Peter.
Yeah, I thought so, but then it just sounded kind of weird when I said it.
It was fine.
Thanks.
Anyway, I don't plan on losing out on any of that money.
So if you ask me, we got to start sucking up to Chris right away.
What?
Wh-What are you talking about?
I'm talking about brownnosing Chris and getting on his good side perk.
No, that's wrong.
No "perk."
Okay, my bad.
But I've been counting on that money, Lois.
It's always been critical to my master plan.
What master plan?
Look, I never told you this, but... for years now, I've been planning on retiring at 45 so I can work on finding a cure for Ballzheimers disease.
Peter, are those testicles?
Wh-where did you get those?
(crying):
I don't remember!
Hey, hey, there he is!
Oh, boy, hot dogs and Nintendo, huh, Chris?
Dad, what are you doing?
What's going on?
(laughs)
Good one, Chris!
(laughing)
Good one!
Why are you dressed like that?
I don't know.
I-I just kind of felt like this is what cool people wear.
Hey, hey, Chris, how about you and me do a secret handshake that has way too many steps to remember, all right?
Okay.
Shake, bump, bump, slap, pinky hook, pretend to slick your hair back, represent, bump, one spin, slap high, slap low, reverse spin, bump, explode, shake, belly rub,
fake yawn, finger gun, hitchhiker, hitchhiker, shimmy shimmy sham sham, shake, shake, shake, bump, something smells and shake again.
Okay, ready?
Oh, my God, it's nighttime.
MAN (on TV):
We now return to the director's cut of Mission:
Impossible 5, with the step stools not edited out.
You're coming with me because I'm definitely over six feet, and you're not handsome.
Hey, Chris, hey, you remember that kid you said was bullying you at school?
Well, here's his head!
(screaming)
That's not even him!
That's the deaf kid!
Oh, that was sign language.
I thought he was trying to defend himself with terrible karate.
Chris, I want to share with you a timeworn father/son tradition.
I am gonna show you a film comedy from my youth that won't hold up.
Welcome to the classic comedy, Meatballs.
Oh, that sounds great.
Is it about a pasta factory or something?
No, that's part of the joke.
Who's the guy?
That's not a guy.
That's the hot chick!
Where are her boobs?
Flat with a decent face was the best we could hope for back then.
Miley Cyrus had sex with a foam finger at, like, 6:00 p.m. Central Time.
This movie has a canoe that slowly sinks.
All right, you know what?
Forget it!
I'm just gonna take my VCR, my VCR head-cleaning tape, my VCR head-cleaning spray, my head-cleaning rag, and my rewinder, and just get the hell out of here.
MAN (on TV):
We now return to At the Movies
With Two Guys Who Watch the Films On Their iPhones.
Good evening.
First off, we're going to review Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips.
What did you think, Bill?
Well, it got off to a great start, but when it was my turn to play Words With Friends, it really took me out of it.
Well, that's a shame, because visually... (phone whooshes) Ooh!
ANNOUNCER:
When we come back, the guys will review American Hustle.
Hmm?
Hey, you guys.
Geez, Peter, you look exhausted.
Ugh, I am.
I've been busting my ass for the last week trying to suck up to Chris.
To Chris?
What the hell for?
Well, Carter kind of decided he's gonna leave all his money to Chris.
So, I've been trying to get on his good side.
I even cleaned his room for him the other day.
Wish I hadn't done that.
Chris, our bath is ready.
I... uh...
I don't...
I don't know what to do now.
I...
I don't have the parenting skills necessary to deal with this.
I say we never speak of this again.
I...
I might move.
You know what?
I say, good for Chris and whatever lucky girl he ends up marrying.
Yeah, or lucky guy, if he ends up being gay.
Lucky guy?
Wait a minute.
You guys just gave me an idea!
(playing tuba)
(laughs)
What's he doing up there?
He's a cat!
He can't play no tuba!
No, wait!
Actually, you guys gave me two ideas!
(snoring)
Mumbling while I sleep to indicate dream content.
Chris, Chris, wake up.
I have something very important to ask you.
Chris, there comes a time when every man looks at his son and thinks, "I want to take this to the next level."
Chris Griffin...
will you marry me?
What?
!
Is it even legal for a man to marry his son?
It is in Vermont.
As long as it's a man and a man, anything goes up there.
They're a bunch of liberal degenerates.
I don't know.
It seems really weird.
I mean, aren't men supposed to marry women?
No, no, no, that's just all of human history except for the last five months.
We'll just be like best pals.
And besides, there's plenty of people who are married and don't have sex.
Like Will Smith and that pit bull.
Why do you even want to marry me?
It's time to settle down and simplify things, like maybe having one ATM card and one bank account.
Say, yours.
Oh.
I get it.
So, what do you say?
When you're married, you get to spend all your time together, doing things like playing catch and going fishing, right?
Well, the best marriages give each other space, but, yes, Chris.
Then, yes, I will marry you, Dad!
Oh, that's wonderful news!
You should know this ring is very special.
It used to belong to your mother.
Wait.
What about Mom?
I'm afraid that's over, Chris.
Lois, wake up.
I need you to sign this legal document.
Huh?
Wha-What is this?
It's a petition to force that hot mom to wear something appropriate at PTA meetings.
Oh, thank God.
(cans rattling, tires squeaking)
(engine revving)
No, Dad.
I don't know what normal is anymore.
So now you know my complete sexual history, Chris.
Wow.
I'm surprised you got fooled by a bear in a wig.
It wasn't a wig, it was a hair system.
Well, whatever.
Why do we have all these appointments?
Wedding DJ, florist.
Because, Chris, it takes time to plan a perfect wedding.
You don't want to jump the gun.
You know, like when you respond to a text too quickly.
(whooshing)
(whooshing)
So, should we get started with your bridal registry?
Yeah, um, I'd like to furnish my kitchen as if I'm the greatest chef in the world, even though I've never cooked before.
That's what we do!
Okay, great.
All right, we'll start with the nine grand in copper-bottom cookware.
Holy wack-a-zoly!
Dad!
What?
Don't "what" me.
You know what you did.
Hey, I may be your husband and your dad, but I'm still a man.
Yeah, we're looking to plan our post-wedding Sunday breakfast.
You know, when everyone's sick of us.
Of course.
Excellent.
Do you have a table for the couple that barely made it through the weekend without breaking up?
Absolutely.
Can I put them near the couple that hooked up drunk and now have to make awkward small talk until their cab to the airport arrives?
Sure.
And maybe they could go next to the vastly-underdressed cousin who thinks the world revolves around him?
I have just the spot.
Will there be a physically-frail, fall-down uncle?
Indeed.
And we'd like to have him walk through a maze of chair legs.
Anything else?
Yes.
We did invite a black couple.
Um, even though we only met them three months ago, but we would like them to be prominently featured to let the other guests know how tolerant and wonderful we are.
I'm excited for your first dance.
And now we're ready to add music.
What's your song?
You know, I've given it a lot of thought, and I went with the most romantic song ever,
"Stars And Stripes Forever" by John Philip Sousa.
♪
March!
March!
March!
March!
Can you feel the soldiers, Chris?
So many have fallen.
And this is why they were fighting.
For a man to marry his son in a state with enough trees around that nobody can see what's going on.
(organ plays gentle melody)
It was nice of the guests at the cat funeral to stay for our wedding.
Yeah, and I bet you're especially happy we're getting married on a Thursday.
School, yuck, right?
!
Welcome, friends, loved ones, and people who are waiting for the 3:00 check-in time with nothing better to do.
Just let us put our bags in there.
I'm literally gonna grab my shorts and leave.
I understand the two of you have written your own vows?
Chris, to express my love,
I turn to the words of the only poet that blue collar,
New England scumbags like me know:
Robert Frost.
"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I...
I took the one less traveled."
Now, I ain't no scholar, but if that's not a metaphor for major-league butt stuff, I don't know what is.
Thank you.
Chris?
LOIS:
Stop the wedding!
Lois!
How did you find out about this?
Peter, several people have called the police about a man marrying his son.
It's not normal!
Peter?
Peter Griffin?
Oh, God.
Is everyone from your past here to walk you down the aisle?
!
Peter, you cannot do this!
You cannot marry your son!
I don't care how much money Daddy's left him.
Don't listen to your mother, Chris.
It's 'cause of her we have bedtimes!
Chris, come on, we're going home!
He can't make you do this.
But, Mom, I want to do this.
What?
I know he's marrying me for my money, but I don't care.
Dad and I spent more time together planning this wedding than we ever have before.
And if being married means
I get to spend even more time with my dad, then it's worth it.
Wait.
You knew all along I just wanted you for your money?
Yeah, Dad, I did.
Wow.
Oh, boy, I've been a real jerk.
I'm sorry, Chris.
But you know what?
I'm gonna make it up to you, starting right now.
Chris Griffin...
will you be my son?
Yes, Dad.
OMG, the photographer is, like, obsessed with me.
Well, let's all go home, you guys.
I think we've had enough excitement for one day.
Yeah, and I guess I learned it's wrong to take your son to Vermont under false pretenses to try to marry him for his inheritance.
You... you should've known that.
Well, we should probably get going.
I think this adventure is over.
PETER:
Interestingly, however, I did run into Chris again.
It was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
He was with another dad.
I was with another son.
But it was nice reminiscing about old times.
For you kids watching, this is a reference to a Woody Allen movie.
He also married one of his children.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
It seems today that all you see
Is violence in movies and sex on TV
But where are those good old-fashioned values

Laugh and cry

Hello.
Come, let's see some beautiful sites together.
Hello, Tree.
Thank you for shade.
Hello, Mountain Cat.
Thank you for controlling local rat population.
Hello, Windmill.
Thank you for the cheese ride and ball cooling.
Next week, bullet trains.
Hello...!
Hey, Dad.
Are you busy?
I was thinking we could spend some time together.
Okay, are you a television set, or the Internet?
No.
Oh, then no.
No, thank you.
Are you sure?
Cause there's a three-day weekend coming up and I thought maybe you and I can finally go fishing like we've been talking about.
Aw, sorry, Chris, I can't.
I got insanity practice.
Pinwheels!
Pinwheels in my head!
Voices!
Angry fish!
How's he doing?
Not good.
He still thinks this is "practice" of some sort.
But you promised we'd go fishing.
Aw, Chris, I was just lying to you so you'd go away.
But, if you leave me alone now, I'll give you a billion dollars.
You've got a deal!
Peter, you know, i-it might help Chris to be able to spend some time with his father.
Well, what's in it for ol' Pete?
He's your son.
Don't you want someone to bond with.
No.
I only form unspoken bonds.
PAT BENATAR Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me with your best shot?
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away...
You come on with a "come on"...
O-Okay.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
You guys, that was my mom.
She said that Daddy broke his leg.
How?
!
A-Apparently, he got hurt at the mall.
Carter, please stop doing that.
We need to get you some new corduroys.
No!
None of the other boys are wearing corduroys!
I want dungarees!
You're going to get hurt doing that.
No I'm not!
I'm the champ at doing this!
Ow!
You jinxed me!
Aw, damn it!
Hey, call that beeping cart that carries around the fat black people.
Well, I guess Babs has her work cut out for her.
Actually, Mom can't take care of him, she's out of town doing a photo shoot for the cover of Veins Magazine.
So, are you gonna go take care of him, Mom?
I can't go.
I've got to go get my hair very minutely changed and then spend the next 14 hours trying to get people to notice.
Well...?
Lois, move.
You're blocking the TV.
What do you think?
I think you're blocking the TV.
Peter, i-is there anything you want to say to me?
All right.
Amy at work kissed me.
It itrue that I did not step away, but I did not lean in.
However, in my defense, she had recently gotten her hair done differently.
I was actually thinking that maybe you could go help Daddy.
Well, not me, Mom.
Last time I was at Grandpa's,
I beat him at checkers and he punched one of my hogans.
Well, what about Chris?
Wai-Wait, where is Chris?
He's upstairs in his room.
That's odd.
He never misses a meal.
I-I better go check on him.
Yeah, good idea.
I better check on my hairless twin in the storm shed.
Close the door, the moonlight burns!
It's almost Christmas.
It's almost Christmas.
Christmas?
!
Yes.
Keep being good and all the eggshells and coffee grounds will be yours.
Can I meet the family?
You've overstepped!
No Christmas!
Hey, Chris.
Are you okay?
Holy crap, it smells like farts in here.
Those are my farts.
Why doesn't Dad ever want to spend time with me?
Chris, come here.
Sit down.
You know I love you, right, sweetie?
Mom... not in front of my posters.
And your father loves you, too.
He just has trouble expressing his emotions.
I love Mike Molly!
I love Mike and I also love Molly!
And I don't care who knows it!
You know, Chris, you've got a grandpa who could use your help right now.
I'm sure he'd enjoy spending time with you.
Okay...
I'll give it a shot.
You're not gonna kill yourself, are you?
That would be a severe black mark on my record as a mom.
Oh, I'd have to make up stories of a severe mental illness.
Make is seem a miracle you made it this long.
I could do that.
Sucks about your leg, Grandpa.
How you been doin'?
Well, let me tell you, this is awful.
I-I'm so bored.
I can't sleep, I-I just have to lie here and wait for my stupid leg to heal.
Oh, I'm really sorry, Grandpa.
And the worst part about it, is I can't have sex.
God!
I wish there was a way I could just do it myself.
You know, just-just to be done and napping within four minutes.
Let me show you something.
That... was... amazing!
And Lynda Carter wasn't actually here?
No!
That was just in your mind.
Incredible!
So-So you can do that like, wh-what, once a year or something?
No.
You can do it basically whenever you're not doing something else.
Cool!
Hey, next time I want to try it with my hand.
Hey, Grandpa.
What should we do now?
You wanna order a pizza?
Well, that doesn't sound very exciting.
But now you can follow your order online!
There it is.
It's on Van Buren!
Oh.
Oh.
He's almost here!
Wow, he's really fast.
Hey, I got an idea, let's put in two different orders and have 'em race!
You think it'll crash the system?
Only one way to find out.
Here's your pizza.
That's $16.50.
We were playing a game with you.
That's what you are.
You're a clown.
Are you gonna pay for the pizza?
Yes.
Your money is in this pile of mashed potatoes.
Eat your way out.
No hands.
This is fun, Chris.
I like hanging out with you.
Don't look up.
You're not a part of this.
It's sounding really good, Grandpa.
I know, I know.
Sorry I'm late.
Look, Jason, are you taking this seriously?
Because Chris and I take this seriously.
You know, if you're not gonna show up to rehearsal, we'll find someone else who will, all right?
We want to get some paying gigs!
Sorry.
Geez.
Remember, this is about writing music that means something to us!
Okay, from the top.
Halls Mentho-lyptus
You can feel it in your nose
That's how you know it's a medicated cough drop
And not just a candy.
Hey, can we play one of my songs?
No!
No one wants to hear your stupid songs about nothing!
Now, let's play "I Fell in the Shower, So Maybe We Do Need That Bar."
Five, six, seven, eight!
Listen, Chris, I really want to thank you for coming to take care of me and helping me get well again.
Oh, it was no big deal.
Well, it is to me, and I want to give you some money for all your time.
Come on, y-you don't have to do that.
I just like getting to spend time with my grandpa, you know?
I...
Wait, wait, what?
You're... you're not gonna take the money?
No, I don't want your money.
I had fun hanging out with you.
Well, all right, then.
Hey, Grandpa, check it out.
When I make my elbow like this, it looks like women's private parts!
Oh, Chris!
You just have a way of looking at things that's delightfully fresh!
We're not supposed to be doing this.
I bet we're not supposed to be doing this.
Daddy!
You're all better!
That's right, pumpkin.
And I have an important announcement to make.
I have decided to change my will, and name my grandson Chris the sole heir to the Pewterschmidt fortune.
You what?
What?
Oh, my!
Oh, no!
My hairless twin got out!
Hello, family.
Let's eat all the garbage we want.
Daddy, you're seriously leaving your entire estate to Chris?
I-I mean, what about Mom?
I promise she'll be dead before I am.
I promise.
But, Grandpa, I don't even want the money.
See?
This is exactly why you should get it!
So refreshing!
Well, I-I don't want it, either.
Good, 'cause you're not getting it.
Come on, what are you doing?
Listen, Carter, you take me out of your will,
I'm taking you out of mine.
Peter, that wasn't your will, that was your birth certificate.
Oh, no!
There's no light!
There's only fire!
Look, Carter, I suppose you're entitled to do what you want, but, you know, I'm just saying, if it were me,
I would give all the money to charity.
Oh, yeah?
Which charity?
Well, there are just so many that do such great work.
Name just one.
Um... well, you know...
Poor...
Green...
Whale...
Guns...
Books?
You are such a fraud.
Why won't anyone help us?
!
What the hell?
I can't believe your dad's giving all his cash to Chris!
I know it's strange, but in the end it's his money, so who really cares?
Well, yeah, but...
But what?
Peter... did you marry me for my money?
Of course not, Lois, but even you can't deny it was always gonna be a huge perk.
D-Did I use that right?
Perk?
Yes, Peter.
Yeah, I thought so, but then it just sounded kind of weird when I said it.
It was fine.
Thanks.
Anyway, I don't plan on losing out on any of that money.
So if you ask me, we got to start sucking up to Chris right away.
What?
Wh-What are you talking about?
I'm talking about brownnosing Chris and getting on his good side perk.
No, that's wrong.
No "perk."
Okay, my bad.
But I've been counting on that money, Lois.
It's always been critical to my master plan.
What master plan?
Look, I never told you this, but... for years now, I've been planning on retiring at 45 so I can work on finding a cure for Ballzheimers disease.
Peter, are those testicles?
Wh-where did you get those?
I don't remember!
Hey, hey, there he is!
Oh, boy, hot dogs and Nintendo, huh, Chris?
Dad, what are you doing?
What's going on?
Good one, Chris!
Good one!
Why are you dressed like that?
I don't know.
I-I just kind of felt like this is what cool people wear.
Hey, hey, Chris, how about you and me do a secret handshake that has way too many steps to remember, all right?
Okay.
Shake, bump, bump, slap, pinky hook, pretend to slick your hair back, represent, bump, one spin, slap high, slap low, reverse spin, bump, explode, shake, belly rub,
fake yawn, finger gun, hitchhiker, hitchhiker, shimmy shimmy sham sham, shake, shake, shake, bump, something smells and shake again.
Okay, ready?
Oh, my God, it's nighttime.
MAN We now return to the director's cut of Mission:
Impossible 5, with the step stools not edited out.
You're coming with me because I'm definitely over six feet, and you're not handsome.
Hey, Chris, hey, you remember that kid you said was bullying you at school?
Well, here's his head!
That's not even him!
That's the deaf kid!
Oh, that was sign language.
I thought he was trying to defend himself with terrible karate.
Chris, I want to share with you a timeworn father/son tradition.
I am gonna show you a film comedy from my youth that won't hold up.
Welcome to the classic comedy, Meatballs.
Oh, that sounds great.
Is it about a pasta factory or something?
No, that's part of the joke.
Who's the guy?
That's not a guy.
That's the hot chick!
Where are her boobs?
Flat with a decent face was the best we could hope for back then.
Miley Cyrus had sex with a foam finger at, like, 6:00 p.m. Central Time.
This movie has a canoe that slowly sinks.
All right, you know what?
Forget it!
I'm just gonna take my VCR, my VCR head-cleaning tape, my VCR head-cleaning spray, my head-cleaning rag, and my rewinder, and just get the hell out of here.
MAN We now return to At the Movies
With Two Guys Who Watch the Films On Their iPhones.
Good evening.
First off, we're going to review Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips.
What did you think, Bill?
Well, it got off to a great start, but when it was my turn to play Words With Friends, it really took me out of it.
Well, that's a shame, because visually...
Ooh!
When we come back, the guys will review American Hustle.
Hmm?
Hey, you guys.
Geez, Peter, you look exhausted.
Ugh, I am.
I've been busting my ass for the last week trying to suck up to Chris.
To Chris?
What the hell for?
Well, Carter kind of decided he's gonna leave all his money to Chris.
So, I've been trying to get on his good side.
I even cleaned his room for him the other day.
Wish I hadn't done that.
Chris, our bath is ready.
I... uh...
I don't...
I don't know what to do now.
I...
I don't have the parenting skills necessary to deal with this.
I say we never speak of this again.
I...
I might move.
You know what?
I say, good for Chris and whatever lucky girl he ends up marrying.
Yeah, or lucky guy, if he ends up being gay.
Lucky guy?
Wait a minute.
You guys just gave me an idea!
What's he doing up there?
He's a cat!
He can't play no tuba!
No, wait!
Actually, you guys gave me two ideas!
Mumbling while I sleep to indicate dream content.

Okay, are you a television set, or the Internet?
No.
Oh, then no.
No, thank you.
Are you sure?
Cause there's a three-day weekend coming up and I thought maybe you and I can finally go fishing like we've been talking about.
Aw, sorry, Chris, I can't.
I got insanity practice.
(yelling hysterically)
Pinwheels!
Pinwheels in my head!
Voices!
Angry fish!
How's he doing?
Not good.
He still thinks this is "practice" of some sort.
But you promised we'd go fishing.
Aw, Chris, I was just lying to you so you'd go away.
But, if you leave me alone now, I'll give you a billion dollars.
You've got a deal!
Peter, you know, i-it might help Chris to be able to spend some time with his father.
Well, what's in it for ol' Pete?
He's your son.
Don't you want someone to bond with.
No.
I only form unspoken bonds.

She said that Daddy broke his leg.
How?

A-Apparently, he got hurt at the mall.
Carter, please stop doing that.
We need to get you some new corduroys.
No!
None of the other boys are wearing corduroys!
I want dungarees!
You're going to get hurt doing that.
No I'm not!
I'm the champ at doing this!
Ow!
You jinxed me!
Aw, damn it!
Hey, call that beeping cart that carries around the fat black people.
Well, I guess Babs has her work cut out for her.
Actually, Mom can't take care of him, she's out of town doing a photo shoot for the cover of Veins Magazine.
So, are you gonna go take care of him, Mom?
I can't go.
I've got to go get my hair very minutely changed and then spend the next 14 hours trying to get people to notice.
Well...?
Lois, move.
You're blocking the TV.
(laughs) What do you think?
I think you're blocking the TV.
Peter, i-is there anything you want to say to me?
(sighs)
All right.
Amy at work kissed me.
It is true that I did not step away, but I did not lean in.
However, in my defense, she had recently gotten her hair done differently.
I was actually thinking that maybe you could go help Daddy.
Well, not me, Mom.
Last time I was at Grandpa's,
I beat him at checkers and he punched one of my hogans.
Well, what about Chris?
Wai-Wait, where is Chris?
He's upstairs in his room.
That's odd.
He never misses a meal.
I-I better go check on him.
Yeah, good idea.
I better check on my hairless twin in the storm shed.
Close the door, the moonlight burns!
It's almost Christmas.
It's almost Christmas.
Christmas?
!
Yes.
Keep being good and all the eggshells and coffee grounds will be yours.
Can I meet the family?
You've overstepped!
No Christmas!
(door slams shut)
Hey, Chris.
Are you okay?
Holy crap, it smells like farts in here.
Those are my farts.
Why doesn't Dad ever want to spend time with me?
Chris, come here.
Sit down.
You know I love you, right, sweetie?
Mom... not in front of my posters.
And your father loves you, too.
He just has trouble expressing his emotions.
PETER:
I love Mike Molly!
I love Mike and I also love Molly!
And I don't care who knows it!
You know, Chris, you've got a grandpa who could use your help right now.
I'm sure he'd enjoy spending time with you.
Okay...
I'll give it a shot.
You're not gonna kill yourself, are you?
That would be a severe black mark on my record as a mom.
Oh, I'd have to make up stories of a severe mental illness.
Make is seem a miracle you made it this long.
I could do that.
Sucks about your leg, Grandpa.
How you been doin'?
Well, let me tell you, this is awful.
I-I'm so bored.
I can't sleep, I-I just have to lie here and wait for my stupid leg to heal.
Oh, I'm really sorry, Grandpa.
And the worst part about it, is I can't have sex.
God!
I wish there was a way I could just do it myself.
You know, just-just to be done and napping within four minutes.
Let me show you something.
That... was... amazing!
And Lynda Carter wasn't actually here?
No!
That was just in your mind.
Incredible!
So-So you can do that like, wh-what, once a year or something?
No.
You can do it basically whenever you're not doing something else.
Cool!
Hey, next time I want to try it with my hand.
Hey, Grandpa.
What should we do now?
You wanna order a pizza?
Well, that doesn't sound very exciting.
But now you can follow your order online!
(keyboard clicking)
There it is.
It's on Van Buren!
Oh.
Oh.
He's almost here!
Wow, he's really fast.
Hey, I got an idea, let's put in two different orders and have 'em race!
(gasps) You think it'll crash the system?
Only one way to find out.
(keyboard clicking)
Here's your pizza.
That's $16.50.
We were playing a game with you.
That's what you are.
You're a clown.
Are you gonna pay for the pizza?
Yes.
Your money is in this pile of mashed potatoes.
Eat your way out.
No hands.
(munching, moaning)
This is fun, Chris.
I like hanging out with you.
Don't look up.
You're not a part of this.

It's sounding really good, Grandpa.
I know, I know.
Sorry I'm late.
Look, Jason, are you taking this seriously?
Because Chris and I take this seriously.
You know, if you're not gonna show up to rehearsal, we'll find someone else who will, all right?
We want to get some paying gigs!
Sorry.
Geez.
Remember, this is about writing music that means something to us!

No!

Now, let's play "I Fell in the Shower, So Maybe We Do Need That Bar."
Five, six, seven, eight!
Listen, Chris, I really want to thank you for coming to take care of me and helping me get well again.
Oh, it was no big deal.
Well, it is to me, and I want to give you some money for all your time.
Come on, y-you don't have to do that.
I just like getting to spend time with my grandpa, you know?
I...
Wait, wait, what?
You're... you're not gonna take the money?
No, I don't want your money.
I had fun hanging out with you.
Well, all right, then.
Hey, Grandpa, check it out.
When I make my elbow like this, it looks like women's private parts!
(laughs):
Oh, Chris!
You just have a way of looking at things that's delightfully fresh!
(both laughing)
We're not supposed to be doing this.
I bet we're not supposed to be doing this.
Daddy!
You're all better!
That's right, pumpkin.
And I have an important announcement to make.
I have decided to change my will, and name my grandson Chris the sole heir to the Pewterschmidt fortune.
You what?
What?
Oh, my!
(clattering in distance)
Oh, no!
My hairless twin got out!
(gunshot)
Hello, family.
Let's eat all the garbage we want.
Daddy, you're seriously leaving your entire estate to Chris?
I-I mean, what about Mom?
I promise she'll be dead before I am.
I promise.
But, Grandpa, I don't even want the money.
See?
This is exactly why you should get it!
So refreshing!
Well, I-I don't want it, either.
Good, 'cause you're not getting it.
Come on, what are you doing?
Listen, Carter, you take me out of your will,
I'm taking you out of mine.
Peter, that wasn't your will, that was your birth certificate.
Oh, no!
(gasps)
There's no light!
There's only fire!
Look, Carter, I suppose you're entitled to do what you want, but, you know, I'm just saying, if it were me,
I would give all the money to charity.
Oh, yeah?
Which charity?
Well, there are just so many that do such great work.
Name just one.
Um... well, you know...
Poor...
Green...
Whale...
Guns...
Books?
You are such a fraud.
Why won't anyone help us?
!
What the hell?
I can't believe your dad's giving all his cash to Chris!
I know it's strange, but in the end it's his money, so who really cares?
Well, yeah, but...
But what?
Peter... did you marry me for my money?
Of course not, Lois, but even you can't deny it was always gonna be a huge perk.
D-Did I use that right?
Perk?
Yes, Peter.
Yeah, I thought so, but then it just sounded kind of weird when I said it.
It was fine.
Thanks.
Anyway, I don't plan on losing out on any of that money.
So if you ask me, we got to start sucking up to Chris right away.
What?
Wh-What are you talking about?
I'm talking about brownnosing Chris and getting on his good side perk.
No, that's wrong.
No "perk."
Okay, my bad.
But I've been counting on that money, Lois.
It's always been critical to my master plan.
What master plan?
Look, I never told you this, but... for years now, I've been planning on retiring at 45 so I can work on finding a cure for Ballzheimers disease.
Peter, are those testicles?
Wh-where did you get those?
(crying):
I don't remember!
Hey, hey, there he is!
Oh, boy, hot dogs and Nintendo, huh, Chris?
Dad, what are you doing?
What's going on?
(laughs)
Good one, Chris!
(laughing)
Good one!
Why are you dressed like that?
I don't know.
I-I just kind of felt like this is what cool people wear.
Hey, hey, Chris, how about you and me do a secret handshake that has way too many steps to remember, all right?
Okay.
Shake, bump, bump, slap, pinky hook, pretend to slick your hair back, represent, bump, one spin, slap high, slap low, reverse spin, bump, explode, shake, belly rub,
fake yawn, finger gun, hitchhiker, hitchhiker, shimmy shimmy sham sham, shake, shake, shake, bump, something smells and shake again.
Okay, ready?
Oh, my God, it's nighttime.
MAN (on TV):
We now return to the director's cut of Mission:
Impossible 5, with the step stools not edited out.
You're coming with me because I'm definitely over six feet, and you're not handsome.
Hey, Chris, hey, you remember that kid you said was bullying you at school?
Well, here's his head!
(screaming)
That's not even him!
That's the deaf kid!
Oh, that was sign language.
I thought he was trying to defend himself with terrible karate.
Chris, I want to share with you a timeworn father/son tradition.
I am gonna show you a film comedy from my youth that won't hold up.
Welcome to the classic comedy, Meatballs.
Oh, that sounds great.
Is it about a pasta factory or something?
No, that's part of the joke.
Who's the guy?
That's not a guy.
That's the hot chick!
Where are her boobs?
Flat with a decent face was the best we could hope for back then.
Miley Cyrus had sex with a foam finger at, like, 6:00 p.m. Central Time.
This movie has a canoe that slowly sinks.
All right, you know what?
Forget it!
I'm just gonna take my VCR, my VCR head-cleaning tape, my VCR head-cleaning spray, my head-cleaning rag, and my rewinder, and just get the hell out of here.
MAN (on TV):
We now return to At the Movies
With Two Guys Who Watch the Films On Their iPhones.
Good evening.
First off, we're going to review Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips.
What did you think, Bill?
Well, it got off to a great start, but when it was my turn to play Words With Friends, it really took me out of it.
Well, that's a shame, because visually... (phone whooshes) Ooh!
ANNOUNCER:
When we come back, the guys will review American Hustle.
Hmm?
Hey, you guys.
Geez, Peter, you look exhausted.
Ugh, I am.
I've been busting my ass for the last week trying to suck up to Chris.
To Chris?
What the hell for?
Well, Carter kind of decided he's gonna leave all his money to Chris.
So, I've been trying to get on his good side.
I even cleaned his room for him the other day.
Wish I hadn't done that.
Chris, our bath is ready.
I... uh...
I don't...
I don't know what to do now.
I...
I don't have the parenting skills necessary to deal with this.
I say we never speak of this again.
I...
I might move.
You know what?
I say, good for Chris and whatever lucky girl he ends up marrying.
Yeah, or lucky guy, if he ends up being gay.
Lucky guy?
Wait a minute.
You guys just gave me an idea!
(playing tuba)
(laughs)
What's he doing up there?
He's a cat!
He can't play no tuba!
No, wait!
Actually, you guys gave me two ideas!
(snoring)
Mumbling while I sleep to indicate dream content.
Chris, Chris, wake up.
I have something very important to ask you.
Chris, there comes a time when every man looks at his son and thinks, "I want to take this to the next level."
Chris Griffin...
will you marry me?
What?
!
Is it even legal for a man to marry his son?
It is in Vermont.
As long as it's a man and a man, anything goes up there.
They're a bunch of liberal degenerates.
I don't know.
It seems really weird.
I mean, aren't men supposed to marry women?
No, no, no, that's just all of human history except for the last five months.
We'll just be like best pals.
And besides, there's plenty of people who are married and don't have sex.
Like Will Smith and that pit bull.
Why do you even want to marry me?
It's time to settle down and simplify things, like maybe having one ATM card and one bank account.
Say, yours.
Oh.
I get it.
So, what do you say?
When you're married, you get to spend all your time together, doing things like playing catch and going fishing, right?
Well, the best marriages give each other space, but, yes, Chris.
Then, yes, I will marry you, Dad!
Oh, that's wonderful news!
You should know this ring is very special.
It used to belong to your mother.
Wait.
What about Mom?
I'm afraid that's over, Chris.
Lois, wake up.
I need you to sign this legal document.
Huh?
Wha-What is this?
It's a petition to force that hot mom to wear something appropriate at PTA meetings.
Oh, thank God.
(cans rattling, tires squeaking)
(engine revving)
No, Dad.
I don't know what normal is anymore.
So now you know my complete sexual history, Chris.
Wow.
I'm surprised you got fooled by a bear in a wig.
It wasn't a wig, it was a hair system.
Well, whatever.
Why do we have all these appointments?
Wedding DJ, florist.
Because, Chris, it takes time to plan a perfect wedding.
You don't want to jump the gun.
You know, like when you respond to a text too quickly.
(whooshing)
(whooshing)
So, should we get started with your bridal registry?
Yeah, um, I'd like to furnish my kitchen as if I'm the greatest chef in the world, even though I've never cooked before.
That's what we do!
Okay, great.
All right, we'll start with the nine grand in copper-bottom cookware.
Holy wack-a-zoly!
Dad!
What?
Don't "what" me.
You know what you did.
Hey, I may be your husband and your dad, but I'm still a man.
Yeah, we're looking to plan our post-wedding Sunday breakfast.
You know, when everyone's sick of us.
Of course.
Excellent.
Do you have a table for the couple that barely made it through the weekend without breaking up?
Absolutely.
Can I put them near the couple that hooked up drunk and now have to make awkward small talk until their cab to the airport arrives?
Sure.
And maybe they could go next to the vastly-underdressed cousin who thinks the world revolves around him?
I have just the spot.
Will there be a physically-frail, fall-down uncle?
Indeed.
And we'd like to have him walk through a maze of chair legs.
Anything else?
Yes.
We did invite a black couple.
Um, even though we only met them three months ago, but we would like them to be prominently featured to let the other guests know how tolerant and wonderful we are.
I'm excited for your first dance.
And now we're ready to add music.
What's your song?
You know, I've given it a lot of thought, and I went with the most romantic song ever,
"Stars And Stripes Forever" by John Philip Sousa.
♪
March!
March!
March!
March!
Can you feel the soldiers, Chris?
So many have fallen.
And this is why they were fighting.
For a man to marry his son in a state with enough trees around that nobody can see what's going on.
(organ plays gentle melody)
It was nice of the guests at the cat funeral to stay for our wedding.
Yeah, and I bet you're especially happy we're getting married on a Thursday.
School, yuck, right?
!
Welcome, friends, loved ones, and people who are waiting for the 3:00 check-in time with nothing better to do.
Just let us put our bags in there.
I'm literally gonna grab my shorts and leave.
I understand the two of you have written your own vows?
Chris, to express my love,
I turn to the words of the only poet that blue collar,
New England scumbags like me know:
Robert Frost.
"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I...
I took the one less traveled."
Now, I ain't no scholar, but if that's not a metaphor for major-league butt stuff, I don't know what is.
Thank you.
Chris?
LOIS:
Stop the wedding!
Lois!
How did you find out about this?
Peter, several people have called the police about a man marrying his son.
It's not normal!
Peter?
Peter Griffin?
Oh, God.
Is everyone from your past here to walk you down the aisle?
!
Peter, you cannot do this!
You cannot marry your son!
I don't care how much money Daddy's left him.
Don't listen to your mother, Chris.
It's 'cause of her we have bedtimes!
Chris, come on, we're going home!
He can't make you do this.
But, Mom, I want to do this.
What?
I know he's marrying me for my money, but I don't care.
Dad and I spent more time together planning this wedding than we ever have before.
And if being married means
I get to spend even more time with my dad, then it's worth it.
Wait.
You knew all along I just wanted you for your money?
Yeah, Dad, I did.
Wow.
Oh, boy, I've been a real jerk.
I'm sorry, Chris.
But you know what?
I'm gonna make it up to you, starting right now.
Chris Griffin...
will you be my son?
Yes, Dad.
OMG, the photographer is, like, obsessed with me.
Well, let's all go home, you guys.
I think we've had enough excitement for one day.
Yeah, and I guess I learned it's wrong to take your son to Vermont under false pretenses to try to marry him for his inheritance.
You... you should've known that.
Well, we should probably get going.
I think this adventure is over.
PETER:
Interestingly, however, I did run into Chris again.
It was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
He was with another dad.
I was with another son.
But it was nice reminiscing about old times.
For you kids watching, this is a reference to a Woody Allen movie.
He also married one of his children.

Five, six, seven, eight!
Listen, chris, I really want to thank you
For coming to take care of me and helping me get well again.
Oh, it was no big deal.
Well, it is to me,
And I want to give you some money for all your time.
Come on, y-you don't have to do that.
I just like getting to spend time with my grandpa, you know?
I...
Wait, wait, what?
You're...
You're not gonna take the money?
No, I don't want your money.
I had fun hanging out with you.
Well, all right, then.
Hey, grandpa, check it out.
When I make my elbow like this,
It looks like women's private parts!
(laughs):
Oh, chris!
You just have a way of looking at things
That's delightfully fresh!
(both laughing)
We're not supposed to be doing this.
I bet we're not supposed to be doing this.
Daddy!
You're all better!
That's right, pumpkin.
And I have an important announcement to make.
I have decided to change my will,
And name my grandson chris
The sole heir to the pewterschmidt fortune.
You what?
What?
Oh, my!
(clattering in distance)
Oh, no!
My hairless twin got out!
(gunshot)
Hello, family.
Let's eat all the garbage we want.
Daddy, you're seriously leaving your entire estate to chris?
I-I mean, what about mom?
I promise she'll be dead before I am.
I promise.
But, grandpa, I don't even want the money.
See?
This is exactly why you should get it!
So refreshing!
Well, I-I don't want it, either.
Good, 'cause you're not getting it.
Come on, what are you doing?
Listen, carter, you take me out of your will,
I'm taking you out of mine.
Peter, that wasn't your will, that was your birth certificate.
Oh, no!
(gasps)
There's no light!
There's only fire!
Look, carter, I suppose you're entitled to do what you want,
But, you know, I'm just saying, if it were me,
I would give all the money to charity.
Oh, yeah?
Which charity?
Well, there are just so many
That do such great work.
Name just one.
Um...
Well, you know...
Poor...
Green...
Whale...
Guns...
Books?
You are such a fraud.
Why won't anyone help us?
!
What the hell?
I can't believe your dad's
Giving all his cash to chris!
I know it's strange, but in the end it's his money,
So who really cares?
Well, yeah, but...
But what?
Peter...
Did you marry me for my money?
Of course not, lois, but even you can't deny
It was always gonna be a huge perk.
D-did I use that right?
Perk?
Yes, peter.
Yeah, I thought so, but then it just sounded kind of weird when I said it.
It was fine.
Thanks.
Anyway, I don't plan on losing out on any of that money.
So if you ask me, we got to start sucking up to chris right away.
What?
Wh-what are you talking about?
I'm talking about brownnosing chris
And getting on his good side perk.
No, that's wrong.
No "perk."
Okay, my bad.
But I've been counting on that money, lois.
It's always been critical to my master plan.
What master plan?
Look, I never told you this, but...
For years now, I've been planning on retiring at 45
So I can work on finding a cure for ballzheimers disease.
Peter, are those testicles?
Wh-where did you get those?
(crying):
I don't remember!
Hey, hey, there he is!
Oh, boy, hot dogs and nintendo, huh, chris?
Dad, what are you doing?
What's going on?
(laughs)
Good one, chris!
(laughing)
Good one!
Why are you dressed like that?
I don't know.
I-I just kind of felt
Like this is what cool people wear.
Hey, hey, chris, how about you and me do a secret handshake
That has way too many steps to remember, all right?
Okay.
Shake, bump, bump, slap, pinky hook,
Pretend to slick your hair back, represent, bump,
One spin, slap high, slap low,
Reverse spin, bump, explode, shake, belly rub,
Fake yawn, finger gun, hitchhiker, hitchhiker,
Shimmy shimmy sham sham, shake, shake, shake, bump,
Something smells and shake again.
Okay, ready?
Oh, my god, it's nighttime.
Man (on tv):
We now return to the director's cut of mission:
Impossible 5,
With the step stools not edited out.
You're coming with me because I'm definitely over six feet,
And you're not handsome.
Hey, chris, hey, you remember that kid
You said was bullying you at school?
Well, here's his head!
(screaming)
That's not even him!
That's the deaf kid!
Oh, that was sign language.
I thought he was trying to defend himself
With terrible karate.
Chris, I want to share with you a timeworn father/son tradition.
I am gonna show you a film comedy
From my youth that won't hold up.
Welcome to the classic comedy, meatballs.
Oh, that sounds great.
Is it about a pasta factory or something?
No, that's part of the joke.
Who's the guy?
That's not a guy.
That's the hot chick!
Where are her boobs?
Flat with a decent face was the best
We could hope for back then.
Miley cyrus had sex with a foam finger
At, like, 6:00 p.M. Central time.
This movie has a canoe that slowly sinks.
All right, you know what?
Forget it!
I'm just gonna take my vcr, my vcr head-cleaning tape,
My vcr head-cleaning spray, my head-cleaning rag,
And my rewinder, and just get the hell out of here.
Man (on tv):
We now return to at the movies
With two guys who watch the films on their iphones.
Good evening.
First off, we're going
To review paul greengrass' captain phillips.
What did you think, bill?
Well, it got off to a great start,
But when it was my turn to play words with friends,
It really took me out of it.
Well, that's a shame, because visually... (phone whooshes) ooh!
Announcer:
When we come back, the guys will review american hustle.
Hmm?
Hey, you guys.
Geez, peter, you look exhausted.
Ugh, I am.
I've been busting my ass
For the last week trying to suck up to chris.
To chris?
What the hell for?
Well, carter kind of decided
He's gonna leave all his money to chris.
So, I've been trying to get on his good side.
I even cleaned his room for him the other day.
Wish I hadn't done that.
Chris, our bath is ready.
I...
Uh...
I don't...
I don't know what to do now.
I...
I don't have the parenting skills necessary
To deal with this.
I say we never speak of this again.
I...
I might move.
You know what?
I say, good for chris
And whatever lucky girl he ends up marrying.
Yeah, or lucky guy, if he ends up being gay.
Lucky guy?
Wait a minute.
You guys just gave me an idea!
(playing tuba)
(laughs)
What's he doing up there?
He's a cat!
He can't play no tuba!
No, wait!
Actually, you guys gave me two ideas!
(snoring)
Mumbling while I sleep to indicate dream content.
Chris, chris, wake up.
I have something very important to ask you.
Chris, there comes a time when every man looks at his son
And thinks, "I want to take this to the next level."
Chris griffin...
Will you marry me?
What?
!
Is it even legal for a man to marry his son?
It is in vermont.
As long as it's a man and a man, anything goes up there.
They're a bunch of liberal degenerates.
I don't know.
It seems really weird.
I mean, aren't men supposed to marry women?
No, no, no, that's just all of human history
Except for the last five months.
We'll just be like best pals.
And besides, there's plenty of people
Who are married and don't have sex.
Like will smith and that pit bull.
Why do you even want to marry me?
It's time to settle down and simplify things,
Like maybe having one atm card and one bank account.
Say, yours.
Oh.
I get it.
So, what do you say?
When you're married, you get to spend all your time together,
Doing things like playing catch and going fishing, right?
Well, the best marriages give each other space,
But, yes, chris.
Then, yes, I will marry you, dad!
Oh, that's wonderful news!
You should know this ring is very special.
It used to belong to your mother.
Wait.
What about mom?
I'm afraid that's over, chris.
Lois, wake up.
I need you to sign this legal document.
Huh?
Wha-what is this?
It's a petition to force that hot mom
To wear something appropriate at pta meetings.
Oh, thank god.
(cans rattling, tires squeaking)
(engine revving)
No, dad.
I don't know what normal is anymore.
So now you know my complete sexual history, chris.
Wow.
I'm surprised you got fooled by a bear in a wig.
It wasn't a wig, it was a hair system.
Well, whatever.
Why do we have all these appointments?
Wedding dj, florist.
Because, chris, it takes time to plan a perfect wedding.
You don't want to jump the gun.
You know, like when you respond to a text too quickly.
(whooshing)
(whooshing)
So, should we get started with your bridal registry?
Yeah, um, I'd like to furnish my kitchen
As if I'm the greatest chef in the world,
Even though I've never cooked before.
That's what we do!
Okay, great.
All right, we'll start with the nine grand
In copper-bottom cookware.
Holy wack-a-zoly!
Dad!
What?
Don't "what" me.
You know what you did.
Hey, I may be your husband and your dad, but I'm still a man.
Yeah, we're looking to plan our post-wedding Sunday breakfast.
You know, when everyone's sick of us.
Of course.
Excellent.
Do you have a table for the couple
That barely made it through the weekend without breaking up?
Absolutely.
Can I put them near the couple
That hooked up drunk and now have to make awkward small talk
Until their cab to the airport arrives?
Sure.
And maybe they could go next
To the vastly-underdressed cousin
Who thinks the world revolves around him?
I have just the spot.
Will there be a physically-frail,
Fall-down uncle?
Indeed.
And we'd like to have him walk
Through a maze of chair legs.
Anything else?
Yes.
We did invite a black couple.
Um, even though we only met them three months ago,
But we would like them to be prominently featured
To let the other guests know how tolerant and wonderful we are.
I'm excited for your first dance.
And now we're ready to add music.
What's your song?
You know, I've given it a lot of thought,
And I went with the most romantic song ever,
"stars and stripes forever" by john philip sousa.
¶ ¶
March!
March!
March!
March!
Can you feel the soldiers, chris?
So many have fallen.
And this is why they were fighting.
For a man to marry his son
In a state with enough trees around
That nobody can see what's going on.
(organ plays gentle melody)
It was nice of the guests at the cat funeral
To stay for our wedding.
Yeah, and I bet you're especially happy
We're getting married on a Thursday.
School, yuck, right?
!
Welcome, friends, loved ones,
And people who are waiting for the 3:00 check-in time
With nothing better to do.
Just let us put our bags in there.
I'm literally gonna grab my shorts and leave.
I understand the two of you have written your own vows?
Chris, to express my love,
I turn to the words of the only poet that blue collar,
New England scumbags like me know:
Robert frost.
"two roads diverged in a wood, and I...
I took the one less traveled."
Now, I ain't no scholar, but if that's not a metaphor
For major-league butt stuff, I don't know what is.
Thank you.
Chris?
Lois:
Stop the wedding!
Lois!
How did you find out about this?
Peter, several people have called the police
About a man marrying his son.
It's not normal!
Peter?
Peter griffin?
Oh, god.
Is everyone from your past here
To walk you down the aisle?
!
Peter, you cannot do this!
You cannot marry your son!
I don't care how much money daddy's left him.
Don't listen to your mother, chris.
It's 'cause of her we have bedtimes!
Chris, come on, we're going home!
He can't make you do this.
But, mom, I want to do this.
What?
I know he's marrying me for my money, but I don't care.
Dad and I spent more time together planning this wedding
Than we ever have before.
And if being married means
I get to spend even more time with my dad, then it's worth it.
Wait.
You knew all along I just wanted you for your money?
Yeah, dad, I did.
Wow.
Oh, boy, I've been a real jerk.
I'm sorry, chris.
But you know what?
I'm gonna make it up to you, starting right now.
Chris griffin...
Will you be my son?
Yes, dad.
Omg, the photographer is, like, obsessed with me.
Well, let's all go home, you guys.
I think we've had enough excitement for one day.
Yeah, and I guess I learned
It's wrong to take your son to vermont
Under false pretenses
To try to marry him for his inheritance.
You...
You should've known that.
Well, we should probably get going.
I think this adventure is over.
Peter:
Interestingly, however, I did run into chris again.
It was on the upper west side of manhattan.
He was with another dad.
I was with another son.
But it was nice reminiscing about old times.
For you kids watching,
This is a reference to a woody allen movie.
He also married one of his children.

The Travel Channel presents,
"Backpacking Through Europe with a Bowlegged Man in Short Shorts."
Hello.
Come, let's see some beautiful sites together.
Hello, Tree.
Thank you for shade.
Hello, Mountain Cat.
Thank you for controlling local rat population.
Hello, Windmill.
Thank you for the cheese ride and ball cooling.
Next week, bullet trains.
Hello...!
Hey, Dad.
Are you busy?
I was thinking we could spend some time together.
Okay, are you a television set, or the Internet?
No.
Oh, then no.
No, thank you.
Are you sure?
Cause there's a three-day weekend coming up and I thought maybe you and I can finally go fishing like we've been talking about.
Aw, sorry, Chris, I can't.
I got insanity practice.
Pinwheels!
Pinwheels in my head!
Voices!
Angry fish!
How's he doing?
Not good.
He still thinks this is "practice" of some sort.
But you promised we'd go fishing.
Aw, Chris, I was just lying to you so you'd go away.
But, if you leave me alone now, I'll give you a billion dollars.
You've got a deal!
Peter, you know, i-it might help Chris to be able to spend some time with his father.
Well, what's in it for ol' Pete?
He's your son.
Don't you want someone to bond with.
No.
I only form unspoken bonds.

You guys, that was my mom.
She said that Daddy broke his leg.
How?
!
A-Apparently, he got hurt at the mall.
Carter, please stop doing that.
We need to get you some new corduroys.
No!
None of the other boys are wearing corduroys!
I want dungarees!
You're going to get hurt doing that.
No I'm not!
I'm the champ at doing this!
Ow!
You jinxed me!
Aw, damn it!
Hey, call that beeping cart that carries around the fat black people.
Well, I guess Babs has her work cut out for her.
Actually, Mom can't take care of him, she's out of town doing a photo shoot for the cover of Veins Magazine.
So, are you gonna go take care of him, Mom?
I can't go.
I've got to go get my hair very minutely changed and then spend the next 14 hours trying to get people to notice.
Well...?
Lois, move.
You're blocking the TV.
What do you think?
I think you're blocking the TV.
Peter, i-is there anything you want to say to me?
All right.
Amy at work kissed me.
It is true that I did not step away, but I did not lean in.
However, in my defense, she had recently gotten her hair done differently.
I was actually thinking that maybe you could go help Daddy.
Well, not me, Mom.
Last time I was at Grandpa's,
I beat him at checkers and he punched one of my hogans.
Well, what about Chris?
Wai-Wait, where is Chris?
He's upstairs in his room.
That's odd.
He never misses a meal.
I-I better go check on him.
Yeah, good idea.
I better check on my hairless twin in the storm shed.
Close the door, the moonlight burns!
It's almost Christmas.
It's almost Christmas.
Christmas?
!
Yes.
Keep being good and all the eggshells and coffee grounds will be yours.
Can I meet the family?
You've overstepped!
No Christmas!
Hey, Chris.
Are you okay?
Holy crap, it smells like farts in here.
Those are my farts.
Why doesn't Dad ever want to spend time with me?
Chris, come here.
Sit down.
You know I love you, right, sweetie?
Mom... not in front of my posters.
And your father loves you, too.
He just has trouble expressing his emotions.
I love Mike Molly!
I love Mike and I also love Molly!
And I don't care who knows it!
You know, Chris, you've got a grandpa who could use your help right now.
I'm sure he'd enjoy spending time with you.
Okay...
I'll give it a shot.
You're not gonna kill yourself, are you?
That would be a severe black mark on my record as a mom.
Oh, I'd have to make up stories of a severe mental illness.
Make is seem a miracle you made it this long.
I could do that.
Sucks about your leg, Grandpa.
How you been doin'?
Well, let me tell you, this is awful.
I-I'm so bored.
I can't sleep, I-I just have to lie here and wait for my stupid leg to heal.
Oh, I'm really sorry, Grandpa.
And the worst part about it, is I can't have sex.
God!
I wish there was a way I could just do it myself.
You know, just-just to be done and napping within four minutes.
Let me show you something.
That... was... amazing!
And Lynda Carter wasn't actually here?
No!
That was just in your mind.
Incredible!
So-So you can do that like, wh-what, once a year or something?
No.
You can do it basically whenever you're not doing something else.
Cool!
Hey, next time I want to try it with my hand.
Hey, Grandpa.
What should we do now?
You wanna order a pizza?
Well, that doesn't sound very exciting.
But now you can follow your order online!
There it is.
It's on Van Buren!
Oh.
Oh.
He's almost here!
Wow, he's really fast.
Hey, I got an idea, let's put in two different orders and have 'em race!
You think it'll crash the system?
Only one way to find out.
Here's your pizza.
That's $16.50.
We were playing a game with you.
That's what you are.
You're a clown.
Are you gonna pay for the pizza?
Yes.
Your money is in this pile of mashed potatoes.
Eat your way out.
No hands.
This is fun, Chris.
I like hanging out with you.
Don't look up.
You're not a part of this.
It's sounding really good, Grandpa.
I know, I know.
Sorry I'm late.
Look, Jason, are you taking this seriously?
Because Chris and I take this seriously.
You know, if you're not gonna show up to rehearsal, we'll find someone else who will, all right?
We want to get some paying gigs!
Sorry.
Geez.
Remember, this is about writing music that means something to us!

Now, let's play "I Fell in the Shower, So Maybe We Do Need That Bar."
Five, six, seven, eight!
Listen, Chris, I really want to thank you for coming to take care of me and helping me get well again.
Oh, it was no big deal.
Well, it is to me, and I want to give you some money for all your time.
Come on, y-you don't have to do that.
I just like getting to spend time with my grandpa, you know?
I...
Wait, wait, what?
You're... you're not gonna take the money?
No, I don't want your money.
I had fun hanging out with you.
Well, all right, then.
Hey, Grandpa, check it out.
When I make my elbow like this, it looks like women's private parts!
Oh, Chris!
You just have a way of looking at things that's delightfully fresh!
We're not supposed to be doing this.
I bet we're not supposed to be doing this.

You're all better!
That's right, pumpkin.
And I have an important announcement to make.
I have decided to change my will, and name my grandson Chris the sole heir to the Pewterschmidt fortune.
You what?
What?
Oh, my!
Oh, no!
My hairless twin got out!
Hello, family.
Let's eat all the garbage we want.
Daddy, you're seriously leaving your entire estate to Chris?

Good, 'cause you're not getting it.

Why are you dressed like that?
I don't know.
I-I just kind of felt like this is what cool people wear.
Hey, hey, Chris, how about you and me do a secret handshake that has way too many steps to remember, all right?
Okay.
Shake, bump, bump, slap, pinky hook, pretend to slick your hair back, represent, bump, one spin, slap high, slap low, reverse spin, bump, explode, shake, belly rub,
fake yawn, finger gun, hitchhiker, hitchhiker, shimmy shimmy sham sham, shake, shake, shake, bump, something smells and shake again.

Lucky guy?
Wait a minute.
You guys just gave me an idea!
What's he doing up there?
He's a cat!
He can't play no tuba!
No, wait!
Actually, you guys gave me two ideas!
Mumbling while I sleep to indicate dream content.
Chris, Chris, wake up.
I have something very important to ask you.
Chris, there comes a time when every man looks at his son and thinks, "I want to take this to the next level."
Chris Griffin...
will you marry me?
What?
!
Is it even legal for a man to marry his son?
It is in Vermont.
As long as it's a man and a man, anything goes up there.
They're a bunch of liberal degenerates.
I don't know.
It seems really weird.
I mean, aren't men supposed to marry women?
No, no, no, that's just all of human history except for the last five months.
We'll just be like best pals.
And besides, there's plenty of people who are married and don't have sex.
Like Will Smith and that pit bull.
Why do you even want to marry me?
It's time to settle down and simplify things, like maybe having one ATM card and one bank account.
Say, yours.
Oh.
I get it.
So, what do you say?
When you're married, you get to spend all your time together, doing things like playing catch and going fishing, right?
Well, the best marriages give each other space, but, yes, Chris.
Then, yes, I will marry you, Dad!
Oh, that's wonderful news!
You should know this ring is very special.
It used to belong to your mother.
Wait.
What about Mom?
I'm afraid that's over, Chris.
Lois, wake up.
I need you to sign this legal document.
Huh?
Wha-What is this?
It's a petition to force that hot mom to wear something appropriate at PTA meetings.
Oh, thank God.
No, Dad.
I don't know what normal is anymore.
So now you know my complete sexual history, Chris.
Wow.
I'm surprised you got fooled by a bear in a wig.
It wasn't a wig, it was a hair system.
Well, whatever.
Why do we have all these appointments?
Wedding DJ, florist.
Because, Chris, it takes time to plan a perfect wedding.
You don't want to jump the gun.
You know, like when you respond to a text too quickly.
So, should we get started with your bridal registry?
Yeah, um, I'd like to furnish my kitchen as if I'm the greatest chef in the world, even though I've never cooked before.
That's what we do!
Okay, great.
All right, we'll start with the nine grand in copper-bottom cookware.
Holy wack-a-zoly!
Dad!
What?
Don't "what" me.
You know what you did.
Hey, I may be your husband and your dad, but I'm still a man.
Yeah, we're looking to plan our post-wedding Sunday breakfast.
You know, when everyone's sick of us.
Of course.
Excellent.
Do you have a table for the couple that barely made it through the weekend without breaking up?
Absolutely.
Can I put them near the couple that hooked up drunk and now have to make awkward small talk until their cab to the airport arrives?
Sure.
And maybe they could go next to the vastly-underdressed cousin who thinks the world revolves around him?
I have just the spot.
Will there be a physically-frail, fall-down uncle?
Indeed.
And we'd like to have him walk through a maze of chair legs.
Anything else?
Yes.
We did invite a black couple.
Um, even though we only met them three months ago, but we would like them to be prominently featured to let the other guests know how tolerant and wonderful we are.
I'm excited for your first dance.
And now we're ready to add music.
What's your song?
You know, I've given it a lot of thought, and I went with the most romantic song ever,
"Stars And Stripes Forever" by John Philip Sousa.
March!
March!
March!
March!
Can you feel the soldiers, Chris?
So many have fallen.
And this is why they were fighting.
For a man to marry his son in a state with enough trees around that nobody can see what's going on.
It was nice of the guests at the cat funeral to stay for our wedding.
Yeah, and I bet you're especially happy we're getting married on a Thursday.
School, yuck, right?
!
Welcome, friends, loved ones, and people who are waiting for the 3:00 check-in time with nothing better to do.
Just let us put our bags in there.
I'm literally gonna grab my shorts and leave.
I understand the two of you have written your own vows?
Chris, to express my love,
I turn to the words of the only poet that blue collar,
New England scumbags like me know:
Robert Frost.
"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I...
I took the one less traveled."
Now, I ain't no scholar, but if that's not a metaphor for major-league butt stuff, I don't know what is.
Thank you.
Chris?
Stop the wedding!
Lois!
How did you find out about this?
Peter, several people have called the police about a man marrying his son.
It's not normal!
Peter?
Peter Griffin?
Oh, God.
Is everyone from your past here to walk you down the aisle?
!
Peter, you cannot do this!
You cannot marry your son!
I don't care how much money Daddy's left him.
Don't listen to your mother, Chris.
It's 'cause of her we have bedtimes!
Chris, come on, we're going home!
He can't make you do this.
But, Mom, I want to do this.
What?
I know he's marrying me for my money, but I don't care.
Dad and I spent more time together planning this wedding than we ever have before.
And if being married means
I get to spend even more time with my dad, then it's worth it.
Wait.
You knew all along I just wanted you for your money?
Yeah, Dad, I did.
Wow.
Oh, boy, I've been a real jerk.
I'm sorry, Chris.
But you know what?
I'm gonna make it up to you, starting right now.
Chris Griffin...
will you be my son?
Yes, Dad.
OMG, the photographer is, like, obsessed with me.
Well, let's all go home, you guys.
I think we've had enough excitement for one day.
Yeah, and I guess I learned it's wrong to take your son to Vermont under false pretenses to try to marry him for his inheritance.
You... you should've known that.
Well, we should probably get going.
I think this adventure is over.
Interestingly, however, I did run into Chris again.
It was on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
He was with another dad.
I was with another son.
But it was nice reminiscing about old times.
For you kids watching, this is a reference to a Woody Allen movie.
He also married one of his children.

"Backpacking Through Europe with a Bowlegged Man in Short Shorts."
Hello.
Come, let's see some beautiful sites together.
Hello, Tree.
Thank you for shade.
Hello, Mountain Cat.
Thank you for controlling local rat population.
Hello, Windmill.
Thank you for the cheese ride and ball cooling.
Next week, bullet trains.
Hello...!
Hey, Dad.
Are you busy?
I was thinking we could spend some time together.
Okay, are you a television set, or the Internet?
No.
Oh, then no.
No, thank you.
Are you sure?
Cause there's a three-day weekend coming up and I thought maybe you and I can finally go fishing like we've been talking about.
Aw, sorry, Chris, I can't.
I got insanity practice.
Pinwheels!
Pinwheels in my head!
Voices!
Angry fish!
How's he doing?
Not good.
He still thinks this is "practice" of some sort.
But you promised we'd go fishing.
Aw, Chris, I was just lying to you so you'd go away.
But, if you leave me alone now, I'll give you a billion dollars.
You've got a deal!
Peter, you know, i-it might help Chris to be able to spend some time with his father.
Well, what's in it for ol' Pete?
He's your son.
Don't you want someone to bond with.
No.
I only form unspoken bonds.

I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
You guys, that was my mom.
She said that Daddy broke his leg.
How?
!
A-Apparently, he got hurt at the mall.
Carter, please stop doing that.
We need to get you some new corduroys.
No!
None of the other boys are wearing corduroys!
I want dungarees!
You're going to get hurt doing that.
No I'm not!
I'm the champ at doing this!
Ow!
You jinxed me!
Aw, damn it!
Hey, call that beeping cart that carries around the fat black people.
Well, I guess Babs has her work cut out for her.
Actually, Mom can't take care of him, she's out of town doing a photo shoot for the cover of Veins Magazine.
So, are you gonna go take care of him, Mom?
I can't go.
I've got to go get my hair very minutely changed and then spend the next 14 hours trying to get people to notice.
Well...?
Lois, move.
You're blocking the TV.
What do you think?
I think you're blocking the TV.
Peter, i-is there anything you want to say to me?
All right.
Amy at work kissed me.
It is true that I did not step away, but I did not lean in.
However, in my defense, she had recently gotten her hair done differently.
I was actually thinking that maybe you could go help Daddy.
Well, not me, Mom.
Last time I was at Grandpa's,
I beat him at checkers and he punched one of my hogans.
Well, what about Chris?
Wai-Wait, where is Chris?
He's upstairs in his room.
That's odd.
He never misses a meal.
I-I better go check on him.
Yeah, good idea.
I better check on my hairless twin in the storm shed.
Close the door, the moonlight burns!
It's almost Christmas.
It's almost Christmas.
Christmas?
!
Yes.
Keep being good and all the eggshells and coffee grounds will be yours.
Can I meet the family?
You've overstepped!
No Christmas!
Hey, Chris.
Are you okay?
Holy crap, it smells like farts in here.
Those are my farts.
Why doesn't Dad ever want to spend time with me?
Chris, come here.
Sit down.
You know I love you, right, sweetie?
Mom... not in front of my posters.
And your father loves you, too.
He just has trouble expressing his emotions.
I love Mike Molly!
I love Mike and I also love Molly!
And I don't care who knows it!
You know, Chris, you've got a grandpa who could use your help right now.
I'm sure he'd enjoy spending time with you.
Okay...
I'll give it a shot.
You're not gonna kill yourself, are you?
That would be a severe black mark on my record as a mom.
Oh, I'd have to make up stories of a severe mental illness.
Make is seem a miracle you made it this long.
I could do that.
Sucks about your leg, Grandpa.
How you been doin'?
Well, let me tell you, this is awful.
I-I'm so bored.
I can't sleep, I-I just have to lie here and wait for my stupid leg to heal.
Oh, I'm really sorry, Grandpa.
And the worst part about it, is I can't have sex.
God!
I wish there was a way I could just do it myself.
You know, just-just to be done and napping within four minutes.
Let me show you something.
That... was... amazing!
And Lynda Carter wasn't actually here?
No!
That was just in your mind.
Incredible!
So-So you can do that like, wh-what, once a year or something?
No.
You can do it basically whenever you're not doing something else.
Cool!
Hey, next time I want to try it with my hand.
Hey, Grandpa.
What should we do now?
You wanna order a pizza?
Well, that doesn't sound very exciting.
But now you can follow your order online!
There it is.
It's on Van Buren!
Oh.
Oh.
He's almost here!
Wow, he's really fast.
Hey, I got an idea, let's put in two different orders and have 'em race!
You think it'll crash the system?
Only one way to find out.
Here's your pizza.
That's $16.50.
We were playing a game with you.
That's what you are.
You're a clown.
Are you gonna pay for the pizza?
Yes.
Your money is in this pile of mashed potatoes.
Eat your way out.
No hands.
This is fun, Chris.
I like hanging out with you.
Don't look up.
You're not a part of this.
It's sounding really good, Grandpa.
I know, I know.
Sorry I'm late.
Look, Jason, are you taking this seriously?
Because Chris and I take this seriously.
You know, if you're not gonna show up to rehearsal, we'll find someone else who will, all right?
We want to get some paying gigs!
Sorry.
Geez.
Remember, this is about writing music that means something to us!
Okay, from the top.
♪ Halls Mentho-lyptus
♪ You can feel it in your nose ♪
♪ That's how you know it's a medicated cough drop ♪
♪ And not just a candy.
Hey, can we play one of my songs?
No!
No one wants to hear your stupid songs about nothing!
Now, let's play "I Fell in the Shower, So Maybe We Do Need That Bar."
Five, six, seven, eight!
Listen, Chris, I really want to thank you for coming to take care of me and helping me get well again.
Oh, it was no big deal.
Well, it is to me, and I want to give you some money for all your time.
Come on, y-you don't have to do that.
I just like getting to spend time with my grandpa, you know?
I...
Wait, wait, what?
You're... you're not gonna take the money?
No, I don't want your money.
I had fun hanging out with you.
Well, all right, then.
Hey, Grandpa, check it out.
When I make my elbow like this, it looks like women's private parts!
Oh, Chris!
You just have a way of looking at things that's delightfully fresh!
We're not supposed to be doing this.
I bet we're not supposed to be doing this.
Daddy!
You're all better!
That's right, pumpkin.
And I have an important announcement to make.
I have decided to change my will, and name my grandson Chris the sole heir to the Pewterschmidt fortune.
You what?
What?
Oh, my!
Oh, no!
My hairless twin got out!
Hello, family.
Let's eat all the garbage we want.
Daddy, you're seriously leaving your entire estate to Chris?
I-I mean, what about Mom?
I promise she'll be dead before I am.
I promise.
But, Grandpa, I don't even want the money.
See?
This is exactly why you should get it!
So refreshing!
Well, I-I don't want it, either.
Good, 'cause you're not getting it.
Come on, what are you doing?
Listen, Carter, you take me out of your will,
I'm taking you out of mine.
Peter, that wasn't your will, that was your birth certificate.
Oh, no!
There's no light!
There's only fire!
Look, Carter, I suppose you're entitled to do what you want, but, you know, I'm just saying, if it were me,
I would give all the money to charity.
Oh, yeah?
Which charity?
Well, there are just so many that do such great work.
Name just one.
Um... well, you know...
Poor...
Green...
Whale...
Guns...
Books?
You are such a fraud.
Why won't anyone help us?
!
What the hell?
I can't believe your dad's giving all his cash to Chris!
I know it's strange, but in the end it's his money, so who really cares?
Well, yeah, but...
But what?
Peter... did you marry me for my money?
Of course not, Lois, but even you can't deny it was always gonna be a huge perk.
D-Did I use that right?
Perk?
Yes, Peter.
Yeah, I thought so, but then it just sounded kind of weird when I said it.
It was fine.
Thanks.
Anyway, I don't plan on losing out on any of that money.
So if you ask me, we got to start sucking up to Chris right away.
What?
Wh-What are you talking about?
I'm talking about brownnosing Chris and getting on his good side perk.
No, that's wrong.
No "perk."
Okay, my bad.
But I've been counting on that money, Lois.
It's always been critical to my master plan.
What master plan?
Look, I never told you this, but... for years now, I've been planning on retiring at 45 so I can work on finding a cure for Ballzheimers disease.
Peter, are those testicles?
Wh-where did you get those?
I don't remember!
Hey, hey, there he is!
Oh, boy, hot dogs and Nintendo, huh, Chris?
Dad, what are you doing?
What's going on?
Good one, Chris!
Good one!
Why are you dressed like that?
I don't know.
I-I just kind of felt like this is what cool people wear.
Hey, hey, Chris, how about you and me do a secret handshake that has way too many steps to remember, all right?
Okay.
Shake, bump, bump, slap, pinky hook, pretend to slick your hair back, represent, bump, one spin, slap high, slap low, reverse spin, bump, explode, shake, belly rub,
fake yawn, finger gun, hitchhiker, hitchhiker, shimmy shimmy sham sham, shake, shake, shake, bump, something smells and shake again.
Okay, ready?
Oh, my God, it's nighttime.
MAN (on TV):
We now return to the director's cut of Mission:
Impossible 5, with the step stools not edited out.
You're coming with me because I'm definitely over six feet, and you're not handsome.
Hey, Chris, hey, you remember that kid you said was bullying you at school?
Well, here's his head!
That's not even him!
That's the deaf kid!
Oh, that was sign language.
I thought he was trying to defend himself with terrible karate.
Chris, I want to share with you a timeworn father/son tradition.
I am gonna show you a film comedy from my youth that won't hold up.
Welcome to the classic comedy, Meatballs.
Oh, that sounds great.
Is it about a pasta factory or something?
No, that's part of the joke.
Who's the guy?
That's not a guy.
That's the hot chick!
Where are her boobs?
Flat with a decent face was the best we could hope for back then.
Miley Cyrus had sex with a foam finger at, like, 6:00 p.m. Central Time.
This movie has a canoe that slowly sinks.
All right, you know what?
Forget it!
I'm just gonna take my VCR, my VCR head-cleaning tape, my VCR head-cleaning spray, my head-cleaning rag, and my rewinder, and just get the hell out of here.
We now return to At the Movies
With Two Guys Who Watch the Films On Their iPhones.
Good evening.
First off, we're going to review Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips.
What did you think, Bill?
Well, it got off to a great start, but when it was my turn to play Words With Friends, it really took me out of it.
Well, that's a shame, because visually...
Ooh!
When we come back, the guys will review American Hustle.
Hmm?
Hey, you guys.
Geez, Peter, you look exhausted.
Ugh, I am.
I've been busting my ass for the last week trying to suck up to Chris.
To Chris?
What the hell for?
Well, Carter kind of decided he's gonna leave all his money to Chris.
So, I've been trying to get on his good side.
I even cleaned his room for him the other day.
Wish I hadn't done that.
Chris, our bath is ready.
I... uh...
I don't...
I don't know what to do now.
I...
I don't have the parenting skills necessary to deal with this.
I say we never speak of this again.
I...
I might move.
You know what?
I say, good for Chris and whatever lucky girl he ends up marrying.
Yeah, or lucky guy, if he ends up being gay.
Lucky guy?
Wait a minute.
You guys just gave me an idea!
What's he doing up there?
He's a cat!
He can't play no tuba!
No, wait!
Actually, you guys gave me two ideas!
Mumbling while I sleep to indicate dream content.

SUBTITLES BY TOUTOULE LE MABOULE!
AND GOUGOUZINKOV LA RUSSKOV
You are shown also been attacked, Wayne Newton.
Sorry, little buddy.
You just have to keep going until ...
Till I come back with a shampoo against crabs.
Dirty small plucking pigs.
Crabs are the dirtiest small crayfish-like piksnyltere on this planet, and they are not allowed to to get on my dick.
They get stuck in the clock work with their dirty little cock-claws.
And then down the fucking eggs.
It is cruel!
I went online and figured on it.
I need 22 bottles of shampoo to remove flat lice on my kitties.
22 fucking bottles!
Do you know how embarrassing it is to ask for 22 bottles of shampoo against crabs?
I'll tell you:
Very embarrassing!
Can I help you?
Yes, I can see that you have not the medical shampoo on the shelf?
Skælshampooen stands on the shelf seven.
It is not against dandruff.
Lice?
No, it's more down ... in this region.
Just a moment.
Theresa, you just here?
I have a client with crabs, to use something Fladlus Away.
Do you want the large bottle or the small?
Twenty-two of the ...
The ...
Forget it!
AN ORIGINAL SERIES FROM NETFLIX
Hello!
It smells, as if you have disinfected the place.
Yes, I did it this morning, so if all goes well, I can open again this weekend.
How it sounds, Julian.
I knew a bunch of damn small dirty, evil crabs could not beat the mighty Julian.
What happens?
I would drop by and tell you
Sam and Cyrus came over to me and gave me $ 2,200 of the down payment on my one percent.
And you took them?
That I had to.
They threatened me!
They would probably rather be my friend, than you will be my friend.
They will damn damn you.
Oh, we were friends, Julian.
We are indeed!
I do not have $ 2,200.
- It's just money, Julian.
- Just money.
I am more surprises.
I like personalized gifts.
Use your imagination, Julian.
Well, I think a man like you could find something special, that would please old Jim Lahey.
Maybe something that's $ 2,200 worth.
I hope we see you later tonight.
Goddamn it.
I find out for yourself.
Come on, we win the damn no matches thus.
I must hand harder and a little faster.
- Level, then we go.
- What's wrong?
What kind of father leaves his daughter reside where there is crab lice?
It might be fine enough to swipe, whoever you want, and damn if you get infected, but it is disgusting.
I have not gotten pubic lice.
It was Julian.
I was not Near the people.
If you do not believe me, so see for yourself.
Do you see any pubic lice?
So you bang no?
There is actually only one person I would like to swipe, but unfortunately she busted by another.
How has the center cock it?
George works both night and day, so I have almost always entertain myself.
It sounds funny.
Darren, what the hell are you doing?
How do not--
You take hold of his jersey with one hand and hits him in the head a few times.
And then drag jersey over his head and smashes him in the head with an uppercut.
Not on the floor.
It is for sissies.
Try again.
George must work later, so maybe I look over.
- Do you mean that?
- Perhaps.
- I'll stay here a little.
- Okay.
- See you later.
- I hope so.
Are they almost finished?
Hello.
- Ready?
And here you go!
- Ready.
Come down in Sunnyvale Trailer Park and visit Dirty Dancer, where Roc Vodka in the tap, and you can get these girls to twerke you in your lap.
Get both for $ 25, and all the dancers are guaranteed free of pubic lice.
Good thanks!
It was good T, but piger--
It is an Internet advertising so I must have tits up and kiss each other or something.
- I'll show it to you.
- T.
When can I be advertising online?
- We will soon open.
- As soon as you want, man, but mr.
Green has just Found an fladlus more.
It's fucking lie.
Okay, we have of course not open inside, dammit!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just--
I need help, but I'll figure it out.
Just proceed here.
It looks good.
It is much better, girls.
Well.
Tyrone, you sit.
Well.
Girls, put you in Tyrone.
Tyrone, make sure you understand them.
Do not be shy.
Perfect.
Try again from the beginning.
Randy, I come in.
You shaved buns, did not you?
You got crabs over at Julian the other night ... did not you, Randy?
Randy, stop acting like a pig!
Do you want to hear the truth?
Yes ...
I think I deserve.
I told you that I need, and you have not been able to meet them.
So I drank my game full and was wildly horny ... and so I grew sex with a woman.
Was it really dirty, and I liked it?
Yes!
I feel like hell now?
Yes.
Drink I fucking stiff?
Hell yes!
Do you hate Jacob, father?
No, I do not hate him.
So ...
At first I did not know what to think ...
He's fucking weird, and he has a brain like Trevor, and I was worried, that my little girl would end up with a guy, that never become a man.
So he smoked in jail without crying, and it got me thinking:
"Holy shit.
Maybe he can be a man. "
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Yes.
Thank you, Dad.
I love you.
I love you, prune.
- Hey, Julian.
- Hey, Step.
Oh boy!
Here's damn been nice.
It's a good thing you do, mate.
Yes, it's good for the kids, and it keeps me occupied, while I'm retired.
Yes, retire.
Do you miss not the insane things, we always did?
Of course I do.
Good, because I have a job, and you are the only one who can help me.
I make no job more.
I am retired.
But it's an easy job!
We just have to steal something, which is $ 2,000 worth, so Lahey falls down a bit.
Sorry, I can not.
I'll be damn grandfather.
Should your grandchild growing up in Sunnyvale?
Of course it since.
Okay, but if you do not help me, can not he ... so think about it.
Good, then I will help you, but on one condition ...
- What?
- Me and you, we smoke ourselves fucking leaning all day, like we did before.
It's fucking okay.
- Okay.
- Agreement.
Do you have enough joints, buddy?
Almost.
Holy shit!
The hash oil is insane.
You do not say.
It is bloody as pure THC from the sky.
The marshmallow man.
Yes, I just laugh, boys.
It must be nice to sit out here without having to think on the fucking cock-crustaceans.
Holy shit, man.
Relax.
Take another toke of hash oil.
It is bloody good.
It's really good.
So three are just sitting out here and smoking you leaning?
Well, guess what?
- Guess what?
- What?
No, what should we guess?
What?
What happened?
Shut up, you're leaning.
This is the "guess what".
Someone has to drive me to the laundry, so I can get washed the little pigs out of my bedding.
Come on.
We are too busy today, man.
Yes, we are too crooked.
Well, are you?
Should I throw all lortet--
No, no, slip with you!
Slip, Bubs!
Come on up, dammit.
Throw away your staple fladlus into Ricky's trunk.
We do not take my car.
Rick, your car has three doors.
It is easier.
Here, you stay here, little buddy.
How can you function in this way every day, Rick?
It's funny, right?
Make sure that bound well the sack, Bubbles!
Make sure that you piss on Ricky.
Boys, now that I have been well Leaning,
I have a little mission for you.
I must go to the pharmacy and buying 22 bottles shampoo against crabs for me.
22 bottles!
It's fucking lie!
So much will it, and I can tease me and make fun of me, or you can take the suit and even go and wash this dirty linens.
You choose.
Shut up.
Relax.
I had nothing to do with it, but we can make a deal.
We'll get your fladluseshampoo, if you promise to take a proper sharpening of this bong and get in a better mood with us.
I do not want a hissing, and I will not be in a better mood.
It's damn fun to look at things, that revolves around when you're stoned.
Come on, do not be such a grumpy bastard.
Okay.
One hissing.
Is it strong stuff?
Oh no.
Good luck, mate.
Godfather!
- He spit in your car.
- Hello ...
- I did?
- You shall not ...
Do not spit in the car.
Screwdriver.
Ricky.
Okay, focus the, Bubbles.
Focus.
You have a job to do.
- Focus.
- What the hell is he doing?
He is far-fetched.
COIN LAUNDRY
Boys, what should I do?
Washing clothes.
Washing clothes is great fun.
Put the clothes in the machine.
What the hell was that we were going?
We must provide 22 bottles of shampoo against crabs.
Yes.
Holy shit.
Twenty-two.
Hello, Don.
Hello, you have loved recently!
You naughty boy.
Then you and mr.
Lahey finally made peace.
- No, actually not.
- Not?
I was very full and had sexual intercourse with a woman.
Who is the lucky canned?
I would rather not say.
The worst thing is that I got crabs.
Because you and I work so closely together,
I would advise you to check yourself and have disinfected your mobile home immediately.
"Fladlus Away." Randall.
I can not harm a living creature.
But the beasts spread wildly.
I had to shave the entire region.
I meditate them simply away again.
Have you had them before?
Yes, many times.
Randall, I have been together with a lot of women.
There is always the risk of assembling one of love unwanted hitchhikers up.
Remember to sieve the sand well next time,
Before diving into the dew.
POLICE
T, I have not worked for months to make Roc Vodka a premium brand, so you can put a damper on the with a video upload with crabs in.
We are trying to reopen the bar.
We must have allocated some Roc.
You must raise the quality, are you with?
It is a premium brand.
No one is interested in crabs, unless you sell them as shellfish.
I know ...
Nobody wants step fleas.
I understand.
It was my fault.
But it has been crazy, Since you went in, and I can not drive up here every day and get approval.
Do you think this is crazy with you?
Then you should try to be up here.
Here are crazy.
Motherfucker Core puts pressure on me.
I am harsh, but a little worried, for the others are harsher, are you with?
You are harsh.
Hold your head high and squeeze the buttocks together.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Well.
You, T.
Come over here.
- Good to see you, buddy.
- You too.
So, plucking little beasts.
So it goes no further.
Oh no!
No!
Oh God.
Oh no!
Do not panic, Bubbles.
Do not panic.
Do not panic.
Oh god suit.
It is stuck.
It is stuck!
Oh God!
I mærke--
Oh no.
Help me to be naked!
Help me to be naked!
They go after dilleren!
- Slip!
- They go after dilleren!
Take the damn quiet!
There are children present.
Calm down, dammit!
No, man.
I am insanely lopsided.
I'm too lopsided.
I can not even find something to give Lahey.
How about a new stove?
One of the there --and
They are fine with glass plates.
He'd bloody love.
Sam and Cyrus gave him $ 2200.
You want to give him a glass stove?
- It was just a thought.
- "Thought"?
Okay, go in after the shit.
I'll wait here.
No, no, no.
I had nothing to do with the crabs to do.
I do not go in and buy that crap.
- What if Lucy sees me?
- Lucy?
Lucy cubes George.
It's fucking disgusting.
They say that beauties makes people blind.
I still love her, and I do not go in and buy shit.
Fucking!
Well.
I'm too lopsided for this shit.
You have changed you, Julian.
Please just shut up.
I have since not.
Can I help you find something?
- Sorry?
- Toothpaste ... and it is ...
It is not toothpaste.
Pis.
A convulsion.
Shit Clouds.
A convulsion.
It failed.
You must go and retrieve it.
I told you, I will not be seen with the shit.
Here, take it in and say, that you suffer from allergies.
No.
It was you who promised Bubbles it, not me.
Goddamn it.
Okay.
If I have to do it, it will be on my way.
What are you doing?
I will be back soon.

A Jacuzzi, a banjo of gold and silver, an outdoor stalkun-keger.

- "Stalkun-keger"?
Let us ask Lahey what he wants, and we'll collect it.
We can not.
He will have a surprise.
We can not now gastropods, where Bubbles is.

We must drive him home and take out again ... and I do not smoke more of your weed.
Yes you do.
That was the deal.
Hi, Gary.
- Ricky.
- Slip.
How did it, buddy?
How it went?
Let me see.
I was sentenced to community service for baring, resisting the arrest and the influence of narcotics.
They thought I was on bath salts, when I threw the clothes.
Otherwise, it went fine!
What kind of community they gave you?
I'm going out on a school and tell small children about the dangers of taking drugs, and you must believe me.
Shut up, I will not fucking.
In return we got your shampoo.
It is in the back.
I hope fucking, In crooked bastards bought it right.
Where is it?
Holy shit, boys.
I should not use the big dunk.
But it's cool!
It should probably be able to do damage.
Yes, it was on offer.
What is everything else?
I took some pills, as Trinity's fönster grow better.
Her what?
"Fönster." This is called the child, while in the stomach before it is born.
"Fönster"?
Ricky, it's penis pills!
Here are at least $ 5,000 pikstivere!
- What?
- The moronic pharmacy fools.
Wait a minute.
So this means you have stolen all this shit!
Godfather.
Boys, drive me home right now, before I end up there again because of you two!
You have just saved the situation, mate.
- How?
- By screw up.
"Fönster" pills!
- Julian.
- Hello, Jim.
- Is it for me?
- It can tell you, mate.
Come on in.
What should I use them?
Have Randy spread rumors about me?
No, dammit.
I heard you talk about your little situation the other night, just before you fell through the roof at the bar.
Well ...
I do not know what to say.
I will not tell anyone.
I do not care, if your dick is not working.
I just think of you and Randy.
I want to help you, ... it kind of makes friends, Jim.
Are we friends?
Of course we are.
- Is not it better that way?
- Yes.
Just so you know ... no matter how much booze you drink, works the pills forever.

- Yes.
I have tried them a few times.
Just between us two.
I would like to say thank you, Julian ... and I am very happy here they are.
So you're happy?
Yes Yes.

- Have fun little man.
- Yes.
You look like shit, Jimmy.
I must move on, man.

Hi, Rick.
What brings you to these parts?
George is at work in the evening, and Step are in town with Jacob, so I thought I'd drop by.
Fat.
I was just thinking of you.
- I love that picture of us.
- Me too.
It's sweet that you think of us, and I thought of you and ...
I always think of you.
- Do you?
- Yes.
What do you think?
Well, I thought that ... for you are with George, and you probably will not be busted, right?
And I'm not with someone and I will not swipe other than you, so maybe we could be Friends of the parts.
What about parts?
You know them to become friends with, if you want to swipe each other without obligations.
- "Friends of the parts."
- Oh yeah.
Are you sure, To be friends with the parts?
It could be good Trinity and grandchild.
We should fucking be grandparents, Luce.
Is not it incredible?
What then, Grandpa, do you remember what grandma love?
You can fucking believe.
Hi, Julian!
- Hi how are you?
- Well.
I'm glad you wanted a drink.
I know how busy you are.
We're partners.
Hold up, it's the crystals you bought on your trip?
Yes it is.
They have some amazing properties.
I'll tell you, but first I need good advice on something.
So ...
I-
- Do not laugh, right?
I have decided to try their luck with internet dating.
I have not had much success with men, as you know,
- So I've looked på--
- Barb ...
Do not do it.
But Julian, I will not be alone.
Yes, but if you end up with some narrøv, you'll miss the opportunity to find him the right, who will love you for who you are!
One who like crystals.
One that seems, that you are the best person in the world.
You deserve the best.
You damn not let you settle other than the best, it deserves you fucking.
You're right.
You are absolutely right.
- I deserve ... fucking best.
- Hell so.
I will not settle.
I wait until he comes.
It may take some time, but ...
What does time?
Should we smoke ourselves crooked?
That's a lie.
No.
I do it occasionally.
I tried again on vacation.
It was about the expansion of consciousness.
Here.
I got it from Sarah.
It is Ricky hash oil.
Come on, guy up for it.
Fuck it.
Jesus H Christ, it looks like you're infested too
Wayne Newton.
Sorry little buddy.
Bubbles:
You're gonna have to just hang in there until I can get back with the proper crab shampoo.
[Sound of a click as a barbecue lighter is lit]
You dirty little pinchy bastards.
Crabs are the dirtiest little crustaceous fuckin' cock inhabitants on the face of the planet and there's no way I'm letting them get on my bird.
They latch right on to your package with their dirty little pinchy cock claws.
They start fuckin' hatching eggs, it's terrifying!
Well I went online and I calculated I need about twenty-two bottles of crab shampoo to get rid of the infestation on my kitties, twenty-two fucking bottles!
Do you know how embarrassing that's going to be to us for twenty-two bottles of crab shampoo?
I'll tell ya, VERY EMBARRASSING!
Can I help you sir?
Yeah I notice you don't have the medicated shampoo on the shelves?
Dandruff shampoo's in aisle seven sir.
Oh it's not for dandruff.
Lice?
No it's more down ...this region.
Just a moment sir.
[Over loud speaker] Tweece would you call please I have a customer with crabs and needs some "Crab Out".
Would you like the big bottle or the little sir?
Um twenty-two of the...
NEVERMIND!

Hey it smells like you fumigated the place Julie.
Yeah I did this morning so hopefully if all goes well I'll be reopened by the weekend.
That's the spirit Julian.
I knew a bunch of pesky little dirty old crabs couldn't defeat the mighty Julian.
So what's going on?
Well I thought I should swing by and let you know that Sam and Cyrus dropped my place and gave me twenty-two hundred dollars on the downpayment only one percent.
And you accepted it?
Yeah, I had to Julian they threatened me!
I guess they want to be my friend more than you?
They don't give a fuck about you.
I wish we were friends, Julian.
We are!
I don't have twenty-two hundred bucks.
(Chuckling) It's just money Julian.
(Quietly) It's just money.
I'm a surprise kind of guy.
I like personal gifts.
Use your imagination, Julian.
I think a guy like you could think of something special that would appeal to old Jim Lahey. something more say twenty-two hundred bucks.
I hope to see you later tonight bud.
[Crashes]
Fuck sakes.
I'll let myself out.
[Sounds of glasses being broken]
Ricky:
Come on guys we're not going to win any fucking games like this.
You gotta pass it harder, a little bit faster.
Lucy:
Trin, let's go.
Trinity:
What's wrong?
What kind of Father lets his daughter be around a crab infestation?
You might think that it's okay to bang whoever you want to and not give a shit about what you pick up but it's disgusting.
I had nothing to do with those crabs that was
Julian's thing and I wasn't around any of those fucking people.
Here if you don't believe me check me out, see any crabs down there?
So you're not banging anybody?
There's actually only one person in this world that I want to bang but unfortunately she's being banged by somebody else.
How is mall cock?
George works night and he works day and I'm left basically to entertain myself.
Hmm that sounds like fun.
Darren, [whistle] what the hell are you guys doing, okay?
You don't do it you gotta try to tie up his jersey with one hand like this, hit him in the face a couple of times, okay?
After that try to pull a jersey right up over his head and feed him right in the FUCKING head with upper cuts.
You don't take him to the ground that's what pussies do.
Try it again.
Okay George is working later so maybe I'll pop by.
Are you serious?
Yeah maybe.
Trinity:
I'm going to stay for a bit, okay?
Lucy:
Right.
See you later.
Ricky:

Bubbles:

Ricky:
Holy fuck man, calm down.
Look I had nothing to do with this but I'll make you a fucking deal.
We'll get your crab shampoo as long as you promise to take a big fucking hit off of this bong and get in a fucking better mood with us.
Bubbles:

Julian:

Randy:
Hey Don!
[sniffing] Ah hey!
You've made love recently.
You dirty fucker.
You and Mister Lahey finally worked things out.
No we didn't actually.
Oh no?
Got really drunk and had sexual intercourse with a woman.
Oh ho ho, who's the lucky punta?
I'd rather not say.
Don:
Ah!
Randy:
The worse thing is is I caught crabs. 'Cuz you and
I work so closely together I'd advise you to check yourself out and fumigate your trailer immediately.
Don:
Crap it all Randall I certainly can't harm a creature of this world.
Randy:
But the friggen things spread like crazy!
I had to shave my whole region.
Don:
I'll simply just meditate them away again!
Randy:
You've had 'em before?
Don:
Yes, many times!

- We'll post that on instagram and the website.
- Nice.
- You were discussing a new case?
- Uh-huh.
Yep.
According to the plaintiff, a sleep medication triggered an illicit late-night shopping spree.
Right.
He woke up with no memory, and now he wants to sue the makers of the sleeping pill "Twilera"
for the purchases he cannot return.
Any takers?
Line 'em up.
Anybody?
Where's Swatello?
Uh, I think she's in deposition.
Twilera is now Ellen's case.
Now, that's it for new business.

Yeah, you didn't seem your meta self in that meeting.
Listen, boys.
In the past,
I haven't ruled with an iron fist, but you can't run a respectable firm with pizza parties and skateboarders and what you Americans call football.
Well, it's worked out pretty well so far.
Well, if we're to get to the top again, we'll have to refine your approach.
Okay.
Well, I mean, we could go to Larsen's for lunch, talk it over.
Yeah, we got a 20% Groupon.
Let us take you to lunch.
- One of us has to get that branzino.
- Peter's afraid of fish.
I'm not afraid of fish.
I just don't like the way they serve it.
- They serve it whole...
- You're afraid of fish.
With the head still on there, fried, looking up at you.
- Right, you're afraid of that.
- How you supposed to eat a fish
- when it's looking at you?
- You're just afraid of fish.
Admit it!
All right, enough!
You don't like watching "The Little Mermaid." You...
Maybe we'll have lunch tomorrow, but in the meantime,
I have thousands of e-mails to catch up on.
Dan-o.
- Dan-o?
- Yeah, we like to give nicknames to all our private investigators.
I prefer the nickname I already have.
Oh, yeah?
What is it?
I-I can't tell you.
It's the same as my wi-fi password.
Seems totally normal.
What do you got for us, Dan-o?
Some guy in reception says he knows you...
Jimmy Livanos, Wunder driver?
Doesn't ring a bell, but we do love the Wunder app.
Can't get home from a bar without it.
Really looking forward to when they invent the Wunder jet pack.
[Chuckles] [Chuckles]
He says he was arrested for conspiring to steal a bunch of handbags from celebrities with his passenger.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and presume he sees things differently?
Rhetorical question.
Let it go.
All right.
It's just a misunderstanding.
I drove a passenger to an art gallery opening at H58, then to a denim store launch in X4, and then to a charity event for endangered city squirrels at G21.
I dropped her off, and the next thing you know, my car's surrounded by cops with their guns drawn.
Uh, H58, GX...
Did you sink a battleship at some point in the night?
Sorry.
They're coordinates in the "Harris Road Atlas."
Okay.
Oh.
Well, it seems like a lot of work your phone could do for free.
Yeah, but your phone's GPS does not have the Jimmy Livanos shortcuts.
I've got a photographic memory for directions.
Well, Jimmy, the bouncer at the chateau took down your license plate after Gwyneth Paltrow's purse went missing, and surveillance cameras got you and your passenger leaving with the bag.
Not to mention 70 grand of top-shelf bags disappeared from the other places you guys visited.
No, we didn't steal any bags.
Talk to my passenger, Kim Polito.
She'll tell you.
This is crazy.
Yeah.
Uh, well, that's not gonna be so easy.
Kim Polito doesn't exist, Jimmy.
We pulled the police report.
She used a fake PayPal account.
And the D.A. thinks that you two planned the thefts together.
She set me up?
[Sighs] That doesn't make sense.
She sat up front and bought me cheese fries.
We were vibing each other.
Well, I would keep the vibing to yourself.
Prosecution will only use it to bolster their co-conspirator theory.
You're looking at 10 years for grand theft.
Prison?
No, I-I just bought a house, and I'm on track to be promoted to Wunder S.U.V.
I-I can't...
listen.
When I drove you guys home a few weeks ago, you swore to me you'd get my back if I ever was in trouble.
You picked us up from a bar?
Yeah.
We leave you a good tip?
Just your business card.
And you puked in my back seat.
[Scoffs] Well, Jared can't hold his liquor, but we are good at keeping our word.
You both puked.
That's why we're gonna fight twice as hard for your case.
Ha.
You puked, too.
So, the plaintiff was so out of his mind on the sleep med Twilera that he ordered up a dominatrix.
Of course he did.
And when fantasia arrived, he tried to call it off, but he was so loopy that he couldn't remember the safe word.
She tied him up, poured wax down his crack, and billed him for services rendered.
And you guys want me to go after Twilera because the dominatrix...
Fantasia.
won't provide a refund?
Think of this... it's your first shot at big pharma. [Clicks tongue]
Are you two high on sleep meds right now?
I know I'm not sleeping, 'cause if I was, you wouldn't be so far away and wearing so much.
Uh-oh.
All right, we'll just make a record of that.
I was kidding, 'cause, you know, we're sleeping together.
Dude?
All right.
Tuesday, June 22nd.
Peter, do you have the time?
- I do.
- Don't give her the time.
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.
You are.
And I didn't join this firm to defend potheads and perverts.
Give it to Anita.
[Chuckling] Ellen, Ellen, when you're running a law firm...
Kind of the bosses.
Sometimes, you have to make the tough calls, like matching the perfect lawyer to the perfect case.
And this case has Swatello written all over it.
"Swatello."
You guys already decided I'm taking the case, didn't you?
- Yeah, he's your 12:00.
- He should be here now.
- The underwear model?
- No, his name's Bob Allen.
He's not an underwear model.
He's a...
Masseuse.
[Inhales sharply] Ouch.
Oh, yeah.
This guy definitely deserves his day in court.
Thank you.
How are you?
Well, hello.
I'm Ellen Swatello.
Shut up.
The people vs. Jimmy Livanos.
Mr. Everett, it's the court's understanding you have new evidence you would like to present to trial.
Your Honor, we have an affidavit from a security guard at the Raw Denim event who witnessed Mr. Livanos socializing with his passenger.
Socializing?
Well, let's just skip the trial and lock him up right now.
Your Honor, we admitted our client was invited inside so he wouldn't have to wait in the car.
They were dancing together.
Well, he had to stretch his legs after a long car ride.
Our client has a six-star rating at Wunder.
He was Driver of the Year three times.
And, Your Honor, he has no priors, and on Yelp, his passengers have labeled him Siri's big brother because he has an amazing memory for directions.
Then maybe counsel can explain why Wunder's GPS software tracked Mr. Livanos' vehicle to a parking lot across from a closed pawn shop.
'Cause it looks like he and his co-conspirator were trying to fence the items they stole.
[Quietly] I-I got turned around.
[Quietly] After we just said your brain was Siri's big brother?
I'm deeming the evidence concerning Mr. Livanos' driving that evening admissible.
The jury will be instructed to consider it in determining Mr. Livanos' guilt.
Say goodbye to a plea deal.
We're coming after you with both barrels.
[Quietly] What just happened?
20-car pileup.
Come on, Jimmy.
What's going on?
I just got my wires crossed that night.
I made a wrong turn and pulled over in a parking lot.
Right in front of a diamond brothers pawn shop?
Yeah, also in front of Burger Shack.
Yeah, but drivers with photographic memories for directions don't get lost.
Okay, Jimmy, what's the quickest way to get from Antelope Valley to L.A.X.?
Uh, 14 south to the 5 south to the 405, exit La Tijera, shoot down Manchester to Century, and you're there.
Is he right?
The hell do I know?
I've never been to Antelope Valley.
U-unless it's rush hour, in which case, I'd take the 101 to Highland, to La Brea, to La Tijera...
Okay, so how did your wires get crossed?
[Sighs] I wish I knew.
The whole night's a blur.
It's weird.
It was a blur?
Did she slip something in your drink?
No, I don't drink on my shifts.
Wait.
So, you're saying you danced sober?
Yeah, she was cool.
Why would she do this to me?
Jimmy, was this girl hot?
Uh, she's not unattractive.
But I'm a trained professional.
I would consider that a lame excuse.
Mm-hmm.
So would a judge.
No.
Then we're gonna have to find your mystery girl, get her to tell the truth.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Just...
looking at texts.
Yeah?
Checking in on Swatello?
[Chuckles] Worried about Bob?
- He's not her type.
- Oh, yeah, 'cause she couldn't possibly be interested in a fitness freak who gives happy endings for a living.
I'm not gonna let you get in my head.
I'm not gonna do it.
Hey, Dan-o.
You want a beer?
I'm working.
Sure.
What'd the Danimal drag in?
Great, now I have to change all my passwords.
How did you crack it?
Mm-hmm.
Uh... here's something on our mystery girl.
I figured someone got her into those parties, and if it was someone famous, paparazzi would've caught them together, right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, we're following you.
That's smart, man.
Link her to a celeb who might know the mystery girl's name.
Capturebank gathers every red-carpet nip slip and crotch shot by event.
Already bookmarked.
Good man.
Here she is...
At the Raw Denim launch.
And...
Save the Squirrels fundraiser.
- Both with Jimmy.
- No celebs.
No crotch shots, either.
But...
Look closer.
What... is it some special face-recognition software?
No.
The pics... are watermarked.
"Flywire Photos."
A division of Raglan Public Relations...
Same company that dispatched the photographers to both events.
One of the photographers would recognize a familiar face.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I'll get into it.
Hey, Dan, you, uh...
You been looking for a place to live, right?
Why?
Well, we got a room if you're interested.
It's downstairs, right by...
The door to the beach.
Thanks.
I've been living here for a week now.
- He's gonna kill us.
- I'm gonna lock my door.
- You got a minute?
- No.
- You were right.
- Of course I was.
About what?
Anita's a better fit for the Twilera case.
Hmm.
Is she?
Yeah.
You know, someone with your drive, you should really be focused on making real rain here.
Mm, that's sweet of you to say, but actually, the Twilera case has turned out to be a potential monsoon.
Even your old buddy Karp wants a piece of it.
He put a call in to Bob.
Karp wants a piece of all our cases.
Also, Bob's physician at Westside General contacted me.
Turns out, Twilera has elicited bizarre behavior in a number of his patients.
Class-action suit?
6 grand just turned into $6 million.
Well, even still, I mean, a case that size is gonna suck up all of our firm's resources.
I-I really think we should explore a settlement.
We had sex in the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum.
Since when do you play it safe?
[Chuckles]You gonna put that in your harassment log?
Look, Bob's toxicology came back with traces of benzodiazepines in his system.
The defense is gonna paint him as a pill popper.
You're jealous of Bob.
[Chuckles] Of... of Bob?
I'm not...
I'm not jealous of Bob.
I am looking out for the firm's well being.
So am I. That thing you're playing with is on loan to us from Bob's doctor.
It detects drugs in the body by measuring pupil reaction times.
And we discovered that Twilera's peculiar effects on Bob linger for almost 14 hours after consumption.
And it detected Levipro...
A benzodiazepine.
He was prescribed it for his torn rotator cuff from Fantasia.
Sounds like Bob's got a weak shoulder.
I brought cronuts.
Hi.
Half croissant, half doughnut.
Oh, wow, that is so thoughtful of you, Bob.
Oh, that is really sweet.
- Please, help yourselves.
- Ohh.
Aw, uh, no, thanks.
I don't like hybrid, freakish food.
It's like, you know, are you a doughnut or a croissant?
You know, just decide.
Just make up your mind.
You just have to pick one.
[Door opens]
Oh!
I can still smell old cavendish in the air.
[Sniffs] Remember when a bog-wood pipe came with dessert?
- Times have changed.
- Ah.
Isn't...
Stanton, isn't that your table?
Yeah, where you shared biggie smalls' last supper.
Dominic, um, I do believe we've overshot the green, there.
Hmm.
Someone who's fallen as far from grace as you certainly doesn't need any more unwanted attention.
Gentlemen, here we are.
So close to the bathrooms.
Pretty sure I can hit the urinals from here.
You know, this is Stanton Infeld.
- Show some respect.
- It's... it's all right.
This table, it's fine.
It's great, lovely.
At least from here, I can see my carica...
Wha...
My caricature has been replaced by...
Mike Tyson?
Hmm.
You're the first to notice.
You know, keep this up, we're not gonna be greasing your palms during the holidays.
What will I do without my re-gifted Starbucks card?
Let me guess... using a Groupon today?
Look, direct your insults at me, or just refuse us service if you think we sully your establishment.
I'm surprised it took you this long to take the hint.
You son of a bitch!

we didn't mean decking the owner.
Not that that punch was not awesome.
Oh, wow.
What a right hand, man.
But we are on the verge of pulling the firm out of a nosedive.
And that might've erased all of our progress.
I-I don't know what came over me, boys.
You know, and it's certainly not about that toffee-nosed Dominic.
I-it's more about me.
Hang on.
Thank you.
You know, my image has damaged the firm's name.
It's a bit overwhelming.
- Stanton, your image is fine.
- With your image, we had 641 people testifying to your love-making skills.
Broadcasting my sexcapades in court also came at the expense of the dignity of the firm, and then the pressures that I wasn't aware of, they started to build up, and I...
Snapped.
Snapped, yes.
Now, uh, listen.
I-I'm not proud of my actions, but I do take responsibility for them.
Whoa.
You sucker punched the wrong guy.
And you insulted my lawyers.
You shouldn't have stolen Madeline.
Madeline?
[Chuckling] Madeline?
Come on, man.
That's 20 years ago!
And for 20 years, my position at this establishment has kept me from speaking my mind to a valued patron.
Well, the tables have turned.
I want $100,000, or I'm going straight to the police.
What... are you mad?
You have 24 hours.
You...
If he goes to the cops, that could affect your reinstatement with the bar.
Not to mention get arrested.
You know, I spent three years in a Gulag pushing a stone wheel on the Kolyma River.
Prison, I can survive.
But my dignity...
Well, Stanton, we can't just flip a cushion and find a spare $100,000.
You know, Sotheby's has been after my scrimshaw walrus penis from John Lennon for years!
- We, um...
- We sort of hocked that...
What?
To cover your last round of legal expenses.
Yeah.
Don't tell me we're out of options.
- Peter.
- Shh.
Shh.
Peter?
Shh.
Quick question...
Bra or no bra?
Are you talking to us?
And can you repeat it and say it slower?
I'm on the fence about a bra with this dress.
And... and you want our... our... our advice?
I want your queer eye.
- Here, take a pic.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Use the flash.
That's good.
[Camera shutter clicks]
Tell me you can't see my nipples.
Ooh.
We'd be lying.
Tell you what.
Let's get a second opinion and use my phone.
Good idea.
Stronger flash, yeah.
You must be the lawyers.
[Camera shutter clicks] There we go.
Perfect.
Peter Bash, Jared Franklin.
Esquires.
You don't have to go.
Tenley Lark.
I coordinate firefly from Raglan.
You called about speaking with our photographers?
Yes, trying to figure out if one of your photographers crossed paths with this woman right here.
- Sadie Juvonen.
- You know her?
She was in charge of gifting for Raglan.
We give select celebs and influencers free dresses and accessories from our designers.
Now, you said Sadie was in charge of gifting?
We let her go a month ago.
It takes a unique personality to tolerate the fashion world.
[Chuckles] You wouldn't happen to have her address, would you?
Is she in trouble?
No.
No, no, no.
No.
She, uh, did some personal shopping for one of our clients.
We're handling the returns.
Turnover is fairly high here.
My assistant may know more.
Okay.
So, Sadie knew who got the bags and where to find them.
Yeah, pinned it on Jimmy and turned her unemployment into an early retirement.
She's crashing on a friend's couch in Weho.
[Cellphone rings] Oh, great.
Excuse me.
I have to take this.
Sure.
Thank you.
I am such a pain in the ass.
Could I borrow one of you guys again for a private opinion in my dressing room?
- I'm all yours.
- I'm at your service.
Come on.
I...
Just...
Yeah. [Clears throat]
[Chuckles] Oh.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Swatello!
- You look...
- You can say it.
"Hot."
I'm trying to bait Bob into a dinner at the grill.
Oh.
You sure that's it?
What else would I be trying to do?
Oh, I don't know.
Just trying to make a certain friend of ours jealous?
[Scoffs]
I would only be trying to make someone jealous if I liked them.
Which you don't.
Actually, I don't.
- You paused.
- And now I'm leaving.
All right.
Ellen, the firm's really not in a position to splurge on client dinners.
Okay, but Karp just invited Bob to play in a scramble at Sawbridge.
[Sighs]
All right, fine.
Just don't order any appetizers.
I'm ordering calamari.
- No.
- Yep.
- No!
- Happening.
I've been sensing sexual tension between you and Miss Swatello.
You mean you've been reading my texts?
How I sense it is irrelevant.
What is relevant is her blossoming relationship with Bob.
You know something I don't?
Always, but I could find out more.
You're not seriously offering to spy on a colleague?
I'm offering to find out for my roomie if Ellen and Bob are boning.
No.
No, no, no.
That's totally unprofessional.
I'd keep it professional.
- I'm not saying that.
- And I'm not hearing you.
Wait.
What did we just agree to?
D-Dan!
[Knock on door]
Hi.
Infeld-Daniels, Franklin bash.
Uh, my roommate already told the landlord her dad sent the rent.
We're here to talk to you about the handbags you stole, Sadie.
Uh...
My name's Emma.
You guys must have the wrong address.
Oh, my God.
S-sorry to bother you.
- Yeah, we'll just wait out here for the cops.
- Yeah.
[Sirens wailing in distance]
Okay, why should I talk to you guys?
Because we just called the cops, and in about 60 seconds, you're gonna need a lawyer.
And we're running a one-day-only unemployment special.
We'll represent you pro bono in exchange for your testimony.
You just tell the cops that Jimmy Livanos had nothing to do with those purses.
[Sirens approach, stop] 40 seconds.
We're in tight with the D.A. we can get you a good deal.
- 35.
- I can't go to jail.
Well, there's an innocent man who's about to go behind bars 'cause of something you did.
- You guys can really help me?
- 20 seconds.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Never mind.
They're here.
Sadie Juvonen.
Oh, thank God you're here.
Jimmy Livanos made me rob those women.
I didn't want to do it.
She's good.
She's lying.
She's saying you were in on it from the beginning and that you were in charge.
[Sighs] How could I be such an idiot?
!
The good news is her testimony won't come in.
Why not?
Well, statements from one co-defendant against another are inadmissible.
You both have inherent reason to point the finger at each other.
I mean, how could somebody so beautiful be so evil?
In my experience, sometimes the two go hand in hand.
You know, I-I-I could've been a cab driver...
Throw the meter on, keep to myself.
But I joined Wunder because, you know, it's about more than just the ride.
You share your car!
You share your life!
Sadie's gonna take all that away from me.
- We won't let her.
- Once we put you on the stand, the jury's gonna learn what we already know...
A good guy's really big heart got him in really big trouble.
Well, your nose has healed up nicely.
I wish I could say the same thing about your reputation.
We have a counteroffer I think you'll find acceptable, Dominic.
What does this mean?
You threatened to go to the police if we didn't pay you.
Last time I checked, extortion is illegal.
So is assault.
And around we'll go.
We'd rather let bygones be bygones.
The truth is, Dominic, you caught me on a bad day.
Your insults ignited my pent-up emotions.
Oh, thanks to you, I've worked them out.
Only now, with your ego on the ropes, do you show any remorse for your arrogant behavior over the years.
Look, you shouldn't have taken down my caricature.
And you shouldn't have taken Madeline from me at the Concours D'elegance.
Her engine was a true masterpiece.
This is over a car?
You don't call a 1961 Jaguar E-type "a car."
[Laughs] You can say that again, Dominic.
[Both chuckle]
You outbid me in front of everyone after I told you that I wanted her!
Come on.
We were both half in the bag on Sazerac.
- You said no such thing.
- You calling me a liar?
I'm calling you a crazy old loon who was too drunk to remember.
20 years ago, we would've settled this like men.
Well, men don't go whining to the authorities, old boy.
And only candy asses throw sucker punches!
All right.
Come on.
Give me your best shot.
Go on.
Punch me on the chin, and I hope it feels as good for you as it did for me.
With pleasure.
Ah, no.
Come on.
Take your corners.
Peter, this has to happen.
Please, let's just settle this once and for all.
One free punch, and you're even?
You're good with this?
Okay.
Not here.
We already had too many witnesses at the restaurant.
It's not good for the firm.
It's got to be on the down-low.
Agreed?
Agreed.
[Sighs] So, can Larsen wear any rings on his punching fist?
Oh, he would, wouldn't he?
We should put a no-jewelry proviso in the contract just to cover ourselves.
Yeah.
[Whistles] D-train is in the station.
- Are you having a stroke?
- I'm speaking in code.
We're ignoring you in English.
I have information about Ellen.
Swatello?
Uh, no.
It's... it's nothing.
Shh.
We'll talk about it later.
-We'll talk about it later.
- She and Bob ordered a calamari appetizer.
Seafood... panty dropper.
You put Dan on Swatello?
I didn't put Dan on anyone.
- He accepted my wink.
- He gave you a wink?
Uh... people wink.
It's a thing.
I didn't accept a wi...
I also went through Bob's car at the valet and found these.
What is that?
Jacoby Dunhill, Simmons Associates,
Randall-Kosch.
And a parking stub...
From Gibson Marshall's building.
So Karp's not alone.
Bob's gonna walk.
Not if we get out in front of him.
Aah!
Ohh, yeah!
Harder!
Harder!
- Oh, sweet...
- Ohh, yeah!
Uh, Stanton?
Oh.
Oh.
[Coughs]
Excuse us, but, uh, we have a favor to ask you, sir.
Oh.
Well, I'll trade you.
We need you to lob a call in to Bob Allen.
The plaintiff in the Twilera case.
He needs to know that his case has the support of the firm's emperor.
Very well.
Show a little love to Bob Allen.
Will do.
Good.
Great.
Uh, what's yours?
Well, in order to prepare for my settlement punch,
I need you to pummel me when I least expect it...
Face, kidneys, your choice.
Nothing toughens a man quite like the element of surprise.
[Both grunt]
Oh!
[Groaning]
[Wheezing softly]
Hmm.
Good?
Ellen, our street intel suggests that the Twilera case might be more substantial than we predicted.
It seems that every triple-name firm in town is going after Bob.
We can't let them poach him.
Those firms wine and dine with expense accounts twice the size of our payroll.
Well, we're gonna need you to do whatever it takes to land him.
Okay.
I'll get it done.
Ow!
That's not a toy.
Well, you just gave her the green light to bang Bob.
What are you talking about?
"Whatever it takes to land him"?
Yeah, whatever it takes for her to...
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Wow.
No, I didn't mean it like that!
Look, Jimmy, when Sadie comes in, you have to play it cool.
Trust me, I'd never give her the satisfaction.
Attaboy.
We're gonna get you through this, Jimmy.
Speak of the devil.
What's she doing with the D.A.?
Hey, Jimbo.
Hey.
Did you, uh, get that childish gambino album
- we talked about?
- It's beyond.
Right?
She's the enemy.
Whoa, eyes on the prize.
- Doesn't she smell incredible?
- She smells like 10 years.
My dance card's full today, boys and girls.
Let's get to it.
Your Honor, we move to exclude the testimony of Sadie Juvonen as a co-defendant.
- I object to that motion.
- You shouldn't.
Miss Juvonen cut a deal with my office earlier this morning to turn state's evidence.
- She pled guilty.
- Does that matter?
Yeah.
Now she can say whatever she wants on the stand.
We are in recess until 9:00 A.M. tomorrow.
Hmm.
Uh, do you guys think I still have a shot with her?
Okay.
We have to prove that you weren't partners in crime.
Yeah, and flirting with the person that we're trying to paint as the villain
- sends a mixed message.
- I-I can't explain it.
I just saw her, and all these feelings returned.
[Breathes deeply]
You guys smell that?
[Sniffs] Stripper perfume?
Pink sapphire.
We said the judge might not buy our client being distracted by Sadie.
What if he was drugged?
No, no, I told you.
She didn't slip me anything.
Oh, yeah, she did.
You just weren't aware of it.
Hey, dude, we still have another fight on our hands.
They changed the proximity clause.
- What?
- Check it out.
All right.
Our ducks in a row?
Yeah, remember we went over the original language...
The face, stomach, balls.
We ironed all this out yesterday.
You know, to keep it fair, I would ask you just to punch me directly in the face.
My team made some changes.
I wasn't afforded that luxury when you sucker punched me.
Besides, everyone knows you only have one testicle, Stanton.
All right, enough dilly dallying.
- Let's just sign this thing and move on.
- Okeydoke.
- Here you go.
- Where do I sign?
- Here.
- Okay.
There we go.
[Sighs]
Remember, keep your arms at your side and...
Yeah, just keep your arms at your side.
All right.
Uh...
Uh, bring on the pain.
[Door opens]
Gladly.
Whoa!
Whoa!
I'm hereby invoking my right to a substitute hitter.
Tha... that's... that's Iron Mike Tyson right there.
Oh, my God.
Jared Franklin.
Huge fan.
We're huge fans from way back.
Thank you.
Really appreciate that.
Oh, my God. "Mike Tyson's punch-out!"
On Nintendo... we played every afternoon.
Glass Joe, piston...
- Hell of a game.
- Hell of a game!
Oh, my God.
Amazing game.
He does a spot-on impression of you.
You got to hear this.
No, I don't.
- You should do it for him.
- You should shut up.
- Get out of here.
- He'd love it.
Shut your face.
Come on.
- I would like to hear it, yeah.
- Really?
- He would like to hear it.
- All right, um...
Everyone has a plan u-until they get punched in the mouth.
Not bad.
Most people make me sound like Jay Leno.
- He's good, right?
- Really good.
Thank you very much.
I got to say, your fight against Buster Douglas...
- Oh, man.
- W-w-w-what was that?
- You took him to the mat.
- The ref gave him forever
- to get back up.
- I try to tell everybody.
Man, Buster was so lucky that night.
- So lucky.
- Never gave me a rematch, either.
Boys!
Listen.
He's here to destroy me!
That's kind of true.
I am here to kick his ass.
Okay.
We did not approve the baddest man on the planet.
Iron Mike is going to cripple Stanton.
Strong possibility, yeah.
Never walk again.
Our contract does not clarify who delivers the punch.
Oh, you are a regular John Wilkes, aren't you, Dominic?
A stabber in the dark.
A cowardly, malignant...
[Grunts] Oh!
- What the...
- Oh!
- Hey, man.
That's not cool, dude.
- That's not cool, dude!
- I'm sorry, Mike.
- Really?
- No, I didn't mean...
- Really, huh?
- What are you doing, man?
- Mike, that was a...
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't tell it to do anything.
You hit my friend.
Well, I did this as a favor for a friend, man.
I didn't expect all this stuff.
I'm sorry, Mike.
I'm sorry.
Man, I don't need this.
I do theater now.
Uh, Mi...
I'm sorry.
I loved your show, Mike!
[Stanton groans]
- Where were you?
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You...
[Straining] I think my...
diaphragm just exploded.
[Coughing]
- You think we can still get a picture?
- Yeah.
I was gonna get a picture.
The defense calls Dr. Anthony Garth, a toxicologist from the Claremont institute.
Objection.
Dr. Garth is not on our witness list.
He was a last-minute addition, Your Honor.
We submitted to prosecution late last night.
If you couldn't tell, gentlemen, I also don't like surprises.
Why should I make an exception?
Well, due to Jimmy's keen sense of direction, the prosecution finds it implausible that he accidentally drove to the parking lot across from the pawn shop.
And Dr. Garth will help us argue that Jimmy lost his sense of direction because he was drugged.
Which is why he got turned around.
Objection.
The police report does not establish any evidence of drug-related behavior.
Then you have nothing to lose by allowing our witness.
I'll allow it.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Dr. Garth, isn't it possible that a person could be drugged without exhibiting drug-related behavior?
Intoxicating effects present themselves in a myriad of ways.
Could you educate the court on the device that I'm holding?
An ocular intoximeter is used by law-enforcement agencies to detect drugs in the blood system.
Sort of like a breathalyzer for booze.
More or less.
With the court's permission, could you give a demonstration on our client?
[Sighs]
It's currently measuring pupil reaction times.
Processing the data.
[Device beeping]
Subject's system is drug free.
Great.
Thank you.
No further questions.
Mr. Everett.
Inasmuch as none of this has any relevance to the case, the people have no questions.
Thank you, Dr. Garth.
Your Honor, the defense calls Jimmy Livanos to the stand.
Jimmy, you've been called Siri's big brother because of your photographic memory for directions.
I-I know my way around town.
And you're also knowledgeable with the "Harris Road Atlas."
Yeah, like the back my hand.
The back of your hand.
Let's put him to the test.
Jimmy, where is the Los Feliz Fountain?
Uh, page 56, L72.
56, L72...
He's right.
How about the Long Beach Aquarium, the Getty Center, and Griffith Observatory?
Uh, page 191, L96, page 55, K5, and page 203, W55.
He's too fast.
Objection.
I need a GPS to figure out this line of questioning.
Your Honor, the relevance will be clear in a moment.
Overruled, barely.
But this better get relevant real quick.
I'll do my best, Your Honor.
Jimmy, can you tell me what's on page 48, T82?
That's where I got turned around that night with Sadie.
Outside of Diamond Brother's pawn shop?
Hmm.
No further questions, Your Honor.
The defense would like to recall Sadie Juvonen to the stand.
[Inhales deeply]
Mr. Livanos?
You may step down.
Uh, ha-hang on a sec.
Miss Juvonen, stay on deck.
I have one more question for Jimmy.
Jimmy, you just told us what's on page 48, T82.
Tell us what's on page 48, T83.
Uh... um...
T83?
T83.
Come on, Jimmy, don't let down all your disciples on Yelp.
Uh, page 48.
Uh... 8...
I-I don't know.
Your Honor, I'd like to have Dr. Garth retest Jimmy's pupils with Sadie Juvonen remaining in court.
[Device whirs]
Jimmy.
What's up, doc?
Nothing?
He has the same dilation as someone high on opiates.
And the only thing that's changed since Jimmy's last test is the presence of Sadie Juvonen.
Best ill-fated love outlaw movie?
"True Romance."
Slater.
That's strong, but it's not as strong as "Heathers."
That's a good one.
Hey.
How'd you make out with Bob?
Ow!
Ow!
Stop it!
Aah!
Hi, Ellen.
Take a shot?
Bob caught Dan going through his trash.
There was a confrontation, and then Bob went with Karp's firm.
You were supposed to pull Dan back.
Wait a second.
You guys knew he was snooping?
It was a winking miscommunication.
No, Jared just wanted to know if you were hooking up with Bob.
You probably don't realize this, but exposing this firm ethically and criminally is just plain...
Stupid.
I know.
And in this case...
Lucky.
Bob's a fraud.
He's drumming up bogus cases with his physician at Westside General.
Dan found shredded documents confirming it.
So, it's a good thing I activated him.
You're an idiot.
But an adorable one, right?
No.
Just an idiot.
I can't.
I think you're adorable.
Thanks, buddy.
Right back at ya.
Should we tip off Karp about Bob?
- Nah.
- Nah.
So, ladies and gentlemen, this case isn't about intention.
Jimmy Livanos never intended to assist his passenger in a crime spree.
He simply fell for what Huey Lewis called
"the power of love."
Remember that song?
I mean, look at history.
Men have had their minds blown by women since Eve took a bite out of Adam's apple.
Van Gogh cut off his own ear over a woman.
Tiger Woods has been in a majors drought for years over a woman.
Or two.
My own partner, Jared Franklin, nearly cost us a seven-figure case over a woman.
Jimmy Livanos didn't intentionally drive to a pawn shop.
His GPS brain glitched, and he drove to the wrong grid.
Why?
Because he was high on a drug called Sadie Juvonen.
If he's guilty of anything, it's getting lost...
Lost in love.
It might make him a fool, but it doesn't make him guilty of these crimes.
Thank you.
Jimmy: [Sighs] I don't know how to repay you guys.
Think of it as payback for us throwing up in your back seat.
I don't just mean for saving my ass back there.
I mean for opening my eyes.
That Sadie chick nearly ruined me.
- Won't be the last.
- Wow.
Speaking of sore losers.
Come on.
You got to be used to it by now.
Come on.
We didn't mean to beat you that bad.
Hey, uh, is she in trouble?
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
But I, uh...
I thought she had a deal.
Uh, she didn't give truthful testimony, so that deal's off the table.
She's got to go down all by herself.
Sadie, um...
When this is all, uh, done for you, uh, just click your Wunder app, and I'll be there to pick you up.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Hey, for what it's worth, I had a great night with you.
Yeah.
[Sighs]
Oh, Jimmy.
Oh, that poor guy.
Mmm.
These really are delicious!
Told you.
- What do you call them again?
- Buffalo wings.
Mmm.
Buffalo.
Mmm.
Well, it's chicken.
Well, whatever they are, they're delicious.
Oh, by the way, I commend you on your choice of power table.
You can really control the whole room from here.
Sir...
We got you a welcome-back gift.
Oh.
For me?
- Yep.
- Oh, you're too kind.
- Can I open it now?
- Of course.
Oh.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Ohh.
- You like it?
- Wow.
Doesn't it strike you as being a liitle bit over the top?
- No, it's perfect.
- Practically a photograph.
- Yeah.
- Wow.
We, uh... we got a spot over here for you.
- Oh.
Where is it?
- Starting a wall of fame right there.
- You are the first.
- Oh!
Thank you.
- What do you think?
- It's lovely.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Well, it's good to be back.
It's good to have you back.
Looks like an unconventional approach can get you back to the top.
Yeah, in moderation.
- To Infeld.
- Daniels.
Franklin Bash.
Billables are down, but we still came up 8% last month.
All right.
New business.
Let's do this.
Uh...
Lisa.
Go.
- Good hands, Lisa.
- Thank you.
I'm representing a pro surfer who came in second at the trestles triple crown.
Winner stole his wave, so we're going after prize money and damages.
- Stealing a wave.
- Oh, that's just un-Californian.
Okay.
- Oh, hey.
Okay?
- Oh, got to be aware.
I secured Warren Stone's golden parachute, which...
Uh, Ed...
Would you like to remind the room about our meeting protocol?
Nobody speaks without holding the football.
Mm-hmm.
And are you currently holding the football?
Are you?
Good one, Ed.
Really?
Really?
He nailed ya.
Well, I mean, he spoke first.
Two laps for you, one lap for you.
- Why am I taking two?
- You interrupted him.
Two laps, one lap.
Let's go.
Okay, Ed, let's go.
Come on.
Ed, get to it!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Here it comes.
Oh!
Take a seat.
Oh!
Whoa.
- Boom!
- Boom!
Oh, breakfast is served.
Oh.
Stanton.
Sir.
What on earth is going on here?
Uh, we didn't know you were coming back so soon.
Clearly.
I would apologize for my tardiness, but somebody parked a silver benz in my space, so I had to get it towed.
Oh!
No!
No!
Why don't you take a seat here?
I wouldn't want to interfere with your refereeing.
- Sir, we insist.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Let's get back to business.
A case came in through the firm's website.
The number 4, 'cause it's shorter than...
Yes, yes, yes.
I get it.
Clever.
Also, we have an Instagram account for the firm now, so we do Monday-morning photos.
Let's get in here.
Let's use the fingers this time.
Here we go. "We got your back."
- We'll post that on instagram and the website.
- Nice.
- You were discussing a new case?
- Uh-huh.
Yep.
According to the plaintiff, a sleep medication triggered an illicit late-night shopping spree.
Right.
He woke up with no memory, and now he wants to sue the makers of the sleeping pill "Twilera"
for the purchases he cannot return.
Any takers?
Line 'em up.
Anybody?
Where's Swatello?
Uh, I think she's in deposition.
Twilera is now Ellen's case.
Now, that's it for new business.
Stanton, would you like to address the troops?
Well, I have plenty to say, but I'm going to share my words in private.
Oh.
Call an audible?
Meeting adjourned.
Meeting's adjourned.
Are you mad at us, sir?
Yeah, you didn't seem your meta self in that meeting.
Listen, boys.
In the past,
I haven't ruled with an iron fist, but you can't run a respectable firm with pizza parties and skateboarders and what you Americans call football.
Well, it's worked out pretty well so far.
Well, if we're to get to the top again, we'll have to refine your approach.
Okay.
Well, I mean, we could go to Larsen's for lunch, talk it over.
Yeah, we got a 20% Groupon.
Let us take you to lunch.
- One of us has to get that branzino.
- Peter's afraid of fish.
I'm not afraid of fish.
I just don't like the way they serve it.
- They serve it whole...
- You're afraid of fish.
With the head still on there, fried, looking up at you.
- Right, you're afraid of that.
- How you supposed to eat a fish
- when it's looking at you?
- You're just afraid of fish.
Admit it!
All right, enough!
You don't like watching "The Little Mermaid." You...
Maybe we'll have lunch tomorrow, but in the meantime,
I have thousands of e-mails to catch up on.
Dan-o.
- Dan-o?
- Yeah, we like to give nicknames to all our private investigators.
I prefer the nickname I already have.
Oh, yeah?
What is it?
I-I can't tell you.
It's the same as my wi-fi password.
Seems totally normal.
What do you got for us, Dan-o?
Some guy in reception says he knows you...
Jimmy Livanos, Wunder driver?
Doesn't ring a bell, but we do love the Wunder app.
Can't get home from a bar without it.
Really looking forward to when they invent the Wunder jet pack.
He says he was arrested for conspiring to steal a bunch of handbags from celebrities with his passenger.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and presume he sees things differently?
Rhetorical question.
Let it go.
All right.
It's just a misunderstanding.
I drove a passenger to an art gallery opening at H58, then to a denim store launch in X4, and then to a charity event for endangered city squirrels at G21.
I dropped her off, and the next thing you know, my car's surrounded by cops with their guns drawn.
Uh, H58, GX...
Did you sink a battleship at some point in the night?
Sorry.
They're coordinates in the "Harris Road Atlas."
Okay.
Oh.
Well, it seems like a lot of work your phone could do for free.
Yeah, but your phone's GPS does not have the Jimmy Livanos shortcuts.
I've got a photographic memory for directions.
Well, Jimmy, the bouncer at the chateau took down your license plate after Gwyneth Paltrow's purse went missing, and surveillance cameras got you and your passenger leaving with the bag.
Not to mention 70 grand of top-shelf bags disappeared from the other places you guys visited.
No, we didn't steal any bags.
Talk to my passenger, Kim Polito.
She'll tell you.
This is crazy.
Yeah.
Uh, well, that's not gonna be so easy.
Kim Polito doesn't exist, Jimmy.
We pulled the police report.
She used a fake PayPal account.
And the D.A. thinks that you two planned the thefts together.
She set me up?
That doesn't make sense.
She sat up front and bought me cheese fries.
We were vibing each other.
Well, I would keep the vibing to yourself.
Prosecution will only use it to bolster their co-conspirator theory.
You're looking at 10 years for grand theft.
Prison?
No, I-I just bought a house, and I'm on track to be promoted to Wunder S.U.V.
I-I can't...
listen.
When I drove you guys home a few weeks ago, you swore to me you'd get my back if I ever was in trouble.
You picked us up from a bar?
Yeah.
We leave you a good tip?
Just your business card.
And you puked in my back seat.
Well, Jared can't hold his liquor, but we are good at keeping our word.
You both puked.
That's why we're gonna fight twice as hard for your case.
Ha.
You puked, too.
So, the plaintiff was so out of his mind on the sleep med Twilera that he ordered up a dominatrix.
Of course he did.
And when fantasia arrived, he tried to call it off, but he was so loopy that he couldn't remember the safe word.
She tied him up, poured wax down his crack, and billed him for services rendered.
And you guys want me to go after Twilera because the dominatrix...
Fantasia.
won't provide a refund?
Think of this... it's your first shot at big pharma.
Are you two high on sleep meds right now?
I know I'm not sleeping, 'cause if I was, you wouldn't be so far away and wearing so much.
Uh-oh.
All right, we'll just make a record of that.
I was kidding, 'cause, you know, we're sleeping together.
Dude?
All right.
Tuesday, June 22nd.
Peter, do you have the time?
- I do.
- Don't give her the time.
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.
You are.
And I didn't join this firm to defend potheads and perverts.
Give it to Anita.
Ellen, Ellen, when you're running a law firm...
Kind of the bosses.
Sometimes, you have to make the tough calls, like matching the perfect lawyer to the perfect case.
And this case has Swatello written all over it.
"Swatello."
You guys already decided I'm taking the case, didn't you?
- Yeah, he's your 12:00.
- He should be here now.
- The underwear model?
- No, his name's Bob Allen.
He's not an underwear model.
He's a...
Masseuse.
Ouch.
Oh, yeah.
This guy definitely deserves his day in court.
Thank you.
How are you?
Well, hello.
I'm Ellen Swatello.
Shut up.
The people vs. Jimmy Livanos.
Mr. Everett, it's the court's understanding you have new evidence you would like to present to trial.
Your Honor, we have an affidavit from a security guard at the Raw Denim event who witnessed Mr. Livanos socializing with his passenger.
Socializing?
Well, let's just skip the trial and lock him up right now.
Your Honor, we admitted our client was invited inside so he wouldn't have to wait in the car.
They were dancing together.
Well, he had to stretch his legs after a long car ride.
Our client has a six-star rating at Wunder.
He was Driver of the Year three times.
And, Your Honor, he has no priors, and on Yelp, his passengers have labeled him Siri's big brother because he has an amazing memory for directions.
Then maybe counsel can explain why Wunder's GPS software tracked Mr. Livanos' vehicle to a parking lot across from a closed pawn shop.
'Cause it looks like he and his co-conspirator were trying to fence the items they stole.
I-I got turned around.
After we just said your brain was Siri's big brother?
I'm deeming the evidence concerning Mr. Livanos' driving that evening admissible.
The jury will be instructed to consider it in determining Mr. Livanos' guilt.
Say goodbye to a plea deal.
We're coming after you with both barrels.
What just happened?
20-car pileup.
Come on, Jimmy.
What's going on?
I just got my wires crossed that night.
I made a wrong turn and pulled over in a parking lot.
Right in front of a diamond brothers pawn shop?
Yeah, also in front of Burger Shack.
Yeah, but drivers with photographic memories for directions don't get lost.
Okay, Jimmy, what's the quickest way to get from Antelope Valley to L.A.X.?
Uh, 14 south to the 5 south to the 405, exit La Tijera, shoot down Manchester to Century, and you're there.
Is he right?
The hell do I know?
I've never been to Antelope Valley.
U-unless it's rush hour, in which case, I'd take the 101 to Highland, to La Brea, to La Tijera...
Okay, so how did your wires get crossed?
I wish I knew.
The whole night's a blur.
It's weird.
It was a blur?
Did she slip something in your drink?
No, I don't drink on my shifts.
Wait.
So, you're saying you danced sober?
Yeah, she was cool.
Why would she do this to me?
Jimmy, was this girl hot?
Uh, she's not unattractive.
But I'm a trained professional.
I would consider that a lame excuse.
Mm-hmm.
So would a judge.
No.
Then we're gonna have to find your mystery girl, get her to tell the truth.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Just...
looking at texts.
Yeah?
Checking in on Swatello?
Worried about Bob?
- He's not her type.
- Oh, yeah, 'cause she couldn't possibly be interested in a fitness freak who gives happy endings for a living.
I'm not gonna let you get in my head.
I'm not gonna do it.
Hey, Dan-o.
You want a beer?
I'm working.
Sure.
What'd the Danimal drag in?
Great, now I have to change all my passwords.
How did you crack it?
Mm-hmm.
Uh... here's something on our mystery girl.
I figured someone got her into those parties, and if it was someone famous, paparazzi would've caught them together, right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, we're following you.
That's smart, man.
Link her to a celeb who might know the mystery girl's name.
Capturebank gathers every red-carpet nip slip and crotch shot by event.
Already bookmarked.
Good man.
Here she is...
At the Raw Denim launch.
And...
Save the Squirrels fundraiser.
- Both with Jimmy.
- No celebs.
No crotch shots, either.
But...
Look closer.
What... is it some special face-recognition software?
No.
The pics... are watermarked.
"Flywire Photos."
A division of Raglan Public Relations...
Same company that dispatched the photographers to both events.
One of the photographers would recognize a familiar face.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I'll get into it.
Hey, Dan, you, uh...
You been looking for a place to live, right?
Why?
Well, we got a room if you're interested.
It's downstairs, right by...
The door to the beach.
Thanks.
I've been living here for a week now.
- He's gonna kill us.
- I'm gonna lock my door.
- You got a minute?
- No.
- You were right.
- Of course I was.
About what?
Anita's a better fit for the Twilera case.
Hmm.
Is she?
Yeah.
You know, someone with your drive, you should really be focused on making real rain here.
Mm, that's sweet of you to say, but actually, the Twilera case has turned out to be a potential monsoon.
Even your old buddy Karp wants a piece of it.
He put a call in to Bob.
Karp wants a piece of all our cases.
Also, Bob's physician at Westside General contacted me.
Turns out, Twilera has elicited bizarre behavior in a number of his patients.
Class-action suit?
6 grand just turned into $6 million.
Well, even still, I mean, a case that size is gonna suck up all of our firm's resources.
I-I really think we should explore a settlement.
We had sex in the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum.
Since when do you play it safe?
You gonna put that in your harassment log?
Look, Bob's toxicology came back with traces of benzodiazepines in his system.
The defense is gonna paint him as a pill popper.
You're jealous of Bob.
Of... of Bob?
I'm not...
I'm not jealous of Bob.
I am looking out for the firm's well being.
So am I. That thing you're playing with is on loan to us from Bob's doctor.
It detects drugs in the body by measuring pupil reaction times.
And we discovered that Twilera's peculiar effects on Bob linger for almost 14 hours after consumption.
And it detected Levipro...
A benzodiazepine.
He was prescribed it for his torn rotator cuff from Fantasia.
Sounds like Bob's got a weak shoulder.
I brought cronuts.
Hi.
Half croissant, half doughnut.
Oh, wow, that is so thoughtful of you, Bob.
Oh, that is really sweet.
- Please, help yourselves.
- Ohh.
Aw, uh, no, thanks.
I don't like hybrid, freakish food.
It's like, you know, are you a doughnut or a croissant?
You know, just decide.
Just make up your mind.
You just have to pick one.
Oh!
I can still smell old cavendish in the air.
Remember when a bog-wood pipe came with dessert?
- Times have changed.
- Ah.
Isn't...
Stanton, isn't that your table?
Yeah, where you shared biggie smalls' last supper.
Dominic, um, I do believe we've overshot the green, there.
Hmm.
Someone who's fallen as far from grace as you certainly doesn't need any more unwanted attention.
Gentlemen, here we are.
So close to the bathrooms.
Pretty sure I can hit the urinals from here.
You know, this is Stanton Infeld.
- Show some respect.
- It's... it's all right.
This table, it's fine.
It's great, lovely.
At least from here, I can see my carica...
Wha...
My caricature has been replaced by...
Mike Tyson?
Hmm.
You're the first to notice.
You know, keep this up, we're not gonna be greasing your palms during the holidays.
What will I do without my re-gifted Starbucks card?
Let me guess... using a Groupon today?
Look, direct your insults at me, or just refuse us service if you think we sully your establishment.
I'm surprised it took you this long to take the hint.
You son of a bitch!
Message received.
Just so we're clear, when we said
"go to lunch to discuss our approach,"
we didn't mean decking the owner.
Not that that punch was not awesome.
Oh, wow.
What a right hand, man.
But we are on the verge of pulling the firm out of a nosedive.
And that might've erased all of our progress.
I-I don't know what came over me, boys.
You know, and it's certainly not about that toffee-nosed Dominic.
I-it's more about me.
Hang on.
Thank you.
You know, my image has damaged the firm's name.
It's a bit overwhelming.
- Stanton, your image is fine.
- With your image, we had 641 people testifying to your love-making skills.
Broadcasting my sexcapades in court also came at the expense of the dignity of the firm, and then the pressures that I wasn't aware of, they started to build up, and I...
Snapped.
Snapped, yes.
Now, uh, listen.
I-I'm not proud of my actions, but I do take responsibility for them.
Whoa.
You sucker punched the wrong guy.
And you insulted my lawyers.
You shouldn't have stolen Madeline.
Madeline?
Madeline?
Come on, man.
That's 20 years ago!
And for 20 years, my position at this establishment has kept me from speaking my mind to a valued patron.
Well, the tables have turned.
I want $100,000, or I'm going straight to the police.
What... are you mad?
You have 24 hours.
You...
If he goes to the cops, that could affect your reinstatement with the bar.
Not to mention get arrested.
You know, I spent three years in a Gulag pushing a stone wheel on the Kolyma River.
Prison, I can survive.
But my dignity...
Well, Stanton, we can't just flip a cushion and find a spare $100,000.
You know, Sotheby's has been after my scrimshaw walrus penis from John Lennon for years!
- We, um...
- We sort of hocked that...
What?
To cover your last round of legal expenses.
Yeah.
Don't tell me we're out of options.
- Peter.
- Shh.
Shh.
Peter?
Shh.
Quick question...
Bra or no bra?
Are you talking to us?
And can you repeat it and say it slower?
I'm on the fence about a bra with this dress.
And... and you want our... our... our advice?
I want your queer eye.
- Here, take a pic.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Use the flash.
That's good.
Tell me you can't see my nipples.
Ooh.
We'd be lying.
Tell you what.
Let's get a second opinion and use my phone.
Good idea.
Stronger flash, yeah.
You must be the lawyers.
There we go.
Perfect.
Peter Bash, Jared Franklin.
Esquires.
You don't have to go.
Tenley Lark.
I coordinate firefly from Raglan.
You called about speaking with our photographers?
Yes, trying to figure out if one of your photographers crossed paths with this woman right here.
- Sadie Juvonen.
- You know her?
She was in charge of gifting for Raglan.
We give select celebs and influencers free dresses and accessories from our designers.
Now, you said Sadie was in charge of gifting?
We let her go a month ago.
It takes a unique personality to tolerate the fashion world.
You wouldn't happen to have her address, would you?
Is she in trouble?
No.
No, no, no.
No.
She, uh, did some personal shopping for one of our clients.
We're handling the returns.
Turnover is fairly high here.
My assistant may know more.
Okay.
So, Sadie knew who got the bags and where to find them.
Yeah, pinned it on Jimmy and turned her unemployment into an early retirement.
She's crashing on a friend's couch in Weho.
Oh, great.
Excuse me.
I have to take this.
Sure.
Thank you.
I am such a pain in the ass.
Could I borrow one of you guys again for a private opinion in my dressing room?
- I'm all yours.
- I'm at your service.
Come on.
I...
Just...
Yeah.
Oh.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Swatello!
- You look...
- You can say it.
"Hot."
I'm trying to bait Bob into a dinner at the grill.
Oh.
You sure that's it?
What else would I be trying to do?
Oh, I don't know.
Just trying to make a certain friend of ours jealous?
I would only be trying to make someone jealous if I liked them.
Which you don't.
Actually, I don't.
- You paused.
- And now I'm leaving.
All right.
Ellen, the firm's really not in a position to splurge on client dinners.
Okay, but Karp just invited Bob to play in a scramble at Sawbridge.
All right, fine.
Just don't order any appetizers.
I'm ordering calamari.
- No.
- Yep.
- No!
- Happening.
I've been sensing sexual tension between you and Miss Swatello.
You mean you've been reading my texts?
How I sense it is irrelevant.
What is relevant is her blossoming relationship with Bob.
You know something I don't?
Always, but I could find out more.
You're not seriously offering to spy on a colleague?
I'm offering to find out for my roomie if Ellen and Bob are boning.
No.
No, no, no.
That's totally unprofessional.
I'd keep it professional.
- I'm not saying that.
- And I'm not hearing you.
Wait.
What did we just agree to?
D-Dan!
Hi.
Infeld-Daniels, Franklin bash.
Uh, my roommate already told the landlord her dad sent the rent.
We're here to talk to you about the handbags you stole, Sadie.
Uh...
My name's Emma.
You guys must have the wrong address.
Oh, my God.
S-sorry to bother you.
- Yeah, we'll just wait out here for the cops.
- Yeah.
Okay, why should I talk to you guys?
Because we just called the cops, and in about 60 seconds, you're gonna need a lawyer.
And we're running a one-day-only unemployment special.
We'll represent you pro bono in exchange for your testimony.
You just tell the cops that Jimmy Livanos had nothing to do with those purses.
40 seconds.
We're in tight with the D.A. we can get you a good deal.
- 35.
- I can't go to jail.
Well, there's an innocent man who's about to go behind bars 'cause of something you did.
- You guys can really help me?
- 20 seconds.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Never mind.
They're here.
Sadie Juvonen.
Oh, thank God you're here.
Jimmy Livanos made me rob those women.
I didn't want to do it.
She's good.
She's lying.
She's saying you were in on it from the beginning and that you were in charge.
How could I be such an idiot?
!
The good news is her testimony won't come in.
Why not?
Well, statements from one co-defendant against another are inadmissible.
You both have inherent reason to point the finger at each other.
I mean, how could somebody so beautiful be so evil?
In my experience, sometimes the two go hand in hand.
You know, I-I-I could've been a cab driver...
Throw the meter on, keep to myself.
But I joined Wunder because, you know, it's about more than just the ride.
You share your car!
You share your life!
Sadie's gonna take all that away from me.
- We won't let her.
- Once we put you on the stand, the jury's gonna learn what we already know...
A good guy's really big heart got him in really big trouble.
Well, your nose has healed up nicely.
I wish I could say the same thing about your reputation.
We have a counteroffer I think you'll find acceptable, Dominic.
What does this mean?
You threatened to go to the police if we didn't pay you.
Last time I checked, extortion is illegal.
So is assault.
And around we'll go.
We'd rather let bygones be bygones.
The truth is, Dominic, you caught me on a bad day.
Your insults ignited my pent-up emotions.
Oh, thanks to you, I've worked them out.
Only now, with your ego on the ropes, do you show any remorse for your arrogant behavior over the years.
Look, you shouldn't have taken down my caricature.
And you shouldn't have taken Madeline from me at the Concours D'elegance.
Her engine was a true masterpiece.
This is over a car?
You don't call a 1961 Jaguar E-type "a car."
You can say that again, Dominic.
You outbid me in front of everyone after I told you that I wanted her!
Come on.
We were both half in the bag on Sazerac.
- You said no such thing.
- You calling me a liar?
I'm calling you a crazy old loon who was too drunk to remember.
20 years ago, we would've settled this like men.
Well, men don't go whining to the authorities, old boy.
And only candy asses throw sucker punches!
All right.
Come on.
Give me your best shot.
Go on.
Punch me on the chin, and I hope it feels as good for you as it did for me.
With pleasure.
Ah, no.
Come on.
Take your corners.
Peter, this has to happen.
Please, let's just settle this once and for all.
One free punch, and you're even?
You're good with this?
Okay.
Not here.
We already had too many witnesses at the restaurant.
It's not good for the firm.
It's got to be on the down-low.
Agreed?
Agreed.
So, can Larsen wear any rings on his punching fist?
Oh, he would, wouldn't he?
We should put a no-jewelry proviso in the contract just to cover ourselves.
Yeah.
D-train is in the station.
- Are you having a stroke?
- I'm speaking in code.
We're ignoring you in English.
I have information about Ellen.
Swatello?
Uh, no.
It's... it's nothing.
Shh.
We'll talk about it later.
-We'll talk about it later.
- She and Bob ordered a calamari appetizer.
Seafood... panty dropper.
You put Dan on Swatello?
I didn't put Dan on anyone.
- He accepted my wink.
- He gave you a wink?
Uh... people wink.
It's a thing.
I didn't accept a wi...
I also went through Bob's car at the valet and found these.
What is that?
Jacoby Dunhill, Simmons Associates,
Randall-Kosch.
And a parking stub...
From Gibson Marshall's building.
So Karp's not alone.
Bob's gonna walk.
Not if we get out in front of him.
Aah!
Ohh, yeah!
Harder!
Harder!
- Oh, sweet...
- Ohh, yeah!
Uh, Stanton?
Oh.
Oh.
Excuse us, but, uh, we have a favor to ask you, sir.
Oh.
Well, I'll trade you.
We need you to lob a call in to Bob Allen.
The plaintiff in the Twilera case.
He needs to know that his case has the support of the firm's emperor.
Very well.
Show a little love to Bob Allen.
Will do.
Good.
Great.
Uh, what's yours?
Well, in order to prepare for my settlement punch,
I need you to pummel me when I least expect it...
Face, kidneys, your choice.
Nothing toughens a man quite like the element of surprise.
Oh!
Hmm.
Good?
Ellen, our street intel suggests that the Twilera case might be more substantial than we predicted.
It seems that every triple-name firm in town is going after Bob.
We can't let them poach him.
Those firms wine and dine with expense accounts twice the size of our payroll.
Well, we're gonna need you to do whatever it takes to land him.
Okay.
I'll get it done.
Ow!
That's not a toy.
Well, you just gave her the green light to bang Bob.
What are you talking about?
"Whatever it takes to land him"?
Yeah, whatever it takes for her to...
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Wow.
No, I didn't mean it like that!
Look, Jimmy, when Sadie comes in, you have to play it cool.
Trust me, I'd never give her the satisfaction.
Attaboy.
We're gonna get you through this, Jimmy.
Speak of the devil.
What's she doing with the D.A.?
Hey, Jimbo.
Hey.
Did you, uh, get that childish gambino album
- we talked about?
- It's beyond.
Right?
She's the enemy.
Whoa, eyes on the prize.
- Doesn't she smell incredible?
- She smells like 10 years.
My dance card's full today, boys and girls.
Let's get to it.
Your Honor, we move to exclude the testimony of Sadie Juvonen as a co-defendant.
- I object to that motion.
- You shouldn't.
Miss Juvonen cut a deal with my office earlier this morning to turn state's evidence.
- She pled guilty.
- Does that matter?
Yeah.
Now she can say whatever she wants on the stand.
We are in recess until 9:00 A.M. tomorrow.
Hmm.
Uh, do you guys think I still have a shot with her?
Okay.
We have to prove that you weren't partners in crime.
Yeah, and flirting with the person that we're trying to paint as the villain
- sends a mixed message.
- I-I can't explain it.
I just saw her, and all these feelings returned.
You guys smell that?
Stripper perfume?
Pink sapphire.
We said the judge might not buy our client being distracted by Sadie.
What if he was drugged?
No, no, I told you.
She didn't slip me anything.
Oh, yeah, she did.
You just weren't aware of it.
Hey, dude, we still have another fight on our hands.
They changed the proximity clause.
- What?
- Check it out.
All right.
Our ducks in a row?
Yeah, remember we went over the original language...
The face, stomach, balls.
We ironed all this out yesterday.
You know, to keep it fair, I would ask you just to punch me directly in the face.
My team made some changes.
I wasn't afforded that luxury when you sucker punched me.
Besides, everyone knows you only have one testicle, Stanton.
All right, enough dilly dallying.
- Let's just sign this thing and move on.
- Okeydoke.
- Here you go.
- Where do I sign?
- Here.
- Okay.
There we go.
Remember, keep your arms at your side and...
Yeah, just keep your arms at your side.
All right.
Uh...
Uh, bring on the pain.
Gladly.
Whoa!
Whoa!
I'm hereby invoking my right to a substitute hitter.
Tha... that's... that's Iron Mike Tyson right there.
Oh, my God.
Jared Franklin.
Huge fan.
We're huge fans from way back.
Thank you.
Really appreciate that.
Oh, my God. "Mike Tyson's punch-out!"
On Nintendo... we played every afternoon.
Glass Joe, piston...
- Hell of a game.
- Hell of a game!
Oh, my God.
Amazing game.
He does a spot-on impression of you.
You got to hear this.
No, I don't.
- You should do it for him.
- You should shut up.
- Get out of here.
- He'd love it.
Shut your face.
Come on.
- I would like to hear it, yeah.
- Really?
- He would like to hear it.
- All right, um...
Everyone has a plan u-until they get punched in the mouth.
Not bad.
Most people make me sound like Jay Leno.
- He's good, right?
- Really good.
Thank you very much.
I got to say, your fight against Buster Douglas...
- Oh, man.
- W-w-w-what was that?
- You took him to the mat.
- The ref gave him forever
- to get back up.
- I try to tell everybody.
Man, Buster was so lucky that night.
- So lucky.
- Never gave me a rematch, either.
Boys!
Listen.
He's here to destroy me!
That's kind of true.
I am here to kick his ass.
Okay.
We did not approve the baddest man on the planet.
Iron Mike is going to cripple Stanton.
Strong possibility, yeah.
Never walk again.
Our contract does not clarify who delivers the punch.
Oh, you are a regular John Wilkes, aren't you, Dominic?
A stabber in the dark.
A cowardly, malignant...
Oh!
- What the...
- Oh!
- Hey, man.
That's not cool, dude.
- That's not cool, dude!
- I'm sorry, Mike.
- Really?
- No, I didn't mean...
- Really, huh?
- What are you doing, man?
- Mike, that was a...
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't tell it to do anything.
You hit my friend.
Well, I did this as a favor for a friend, man.
I didn't expect all this stuff.
I'm sorry, Mike.
I'm sorry.
Man, I don't need this.
I do theater now.
Uh, Mi...
I'm sorry.
I loved your show, Mike!
- Where were you?
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You...
I think my...
diaphragm just exploded.
- You think we can still get a picture?
- Yeah.
I was gonna get a picture.
The defense calls Dr. Anthony Garth, a toxicologist from the Claremont institute.
Objection.
Dr. Garth is not on our witness list.
He was a last-minute addition, Your Honor.
We submitted to prosecution late last night.
If you couldn't tell, gentlemen, I also don't like surprises.
Why should I make an exception?
Well, due to Jimmy's keen sense of direction, the prosecution finds it implausible that he accidentally drove to the parking lot across from the pawn shop.
And Dr. Garth will help us argue that Jimmy lost his sense of direction because he was drugged.
Which is why he got turned around.
Objection.
The police report does not establish any evidence of drug-related behavior.
Then you have nothing to lose by allowing our witness.
I'll allow it.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Dr. Garth, isn't it possible that a person could be drugged without exhibiting drug-related behavior?
Intoxicating effects present themselves in a myriad of ways.
Could you educate the court on the device that I'm holding?
An ocular intoximeter is used by law-enforcement agencies to detect drugs in the blood system.
Sort of like a breathalyzer for booze.
More or less.
With the court's permission, could you give a demonstration on our client?
It's currently measuring pupil reaction times.
Processing the data.
Subject's system is drug free.
Great.
Thank you.
No further questions.
Mr. Everett.
Inasmuch as none of this has any relevance to the case, the people have no questions.
Thank you, Dr. Garth.
Your Honor, the defense calls Jimmy Livanos to the stand.
Jimmy, you've been called Siri's big brother because of your photographic memory for directions.
I-I know my way around town.
And you're also knowledgeable with the "Harris Road Atlas."
Yeah, like the back my hand.
The back of your hand.
Let's put him to the test.
Jimmy, where is the Los Feliz Fountain?
Uh, page 56, L72.
56, L72...
He's right.
How about the Long Beach Aquarium, the Getty Center, and Griffith Observatory?
Uh, page 191, L96, page 55, K5, and page 203, W55.
He's too fast.
Objection.
I need a GPS to figure out this line of questioning.
Your Honor, the relevance will be clear in a moment.
Overruled, barely.
But this better get relevant real quick.
I'll do my best, Your Honor.
Jimmy, can you tell me what's on page 48, T82?
That's where I got turned around that night with Sadie.
Outside of Diamond Brother's pawn shop?
Hmm.
No further questions, Your Honor.
The defense would like to recall Sadie Juvonen to the stand.
Mr. Livanos?
You may step down.
Uh, ha-hang on a sec.
Miss Juvonen, stay on deck.
I have one more question for Jimmy.
Jimmy, you just told us what's on page 48, T82.
Tell us what's on page 48, T83.
Uh... um...
T83?
T83.
Come on, Jimmy, don't let down all your disciples on Yelp.
Uh, page 48.
Uh... 8...
I-I don't know.
Your Honor, I'd like to have Dr. Garth retest Jimmy's pupils with Sadie Juvonen remaining in court.
Jimmy.
What's up, doc?
Nothing?
He has the same dilation as someone high on opiates.
And the only thing that's changed since Jimmy's last test is the presence of Sadie Juvonen.
Best ill-fated love outlaw movie?
"True Romance."
Slater.
That's strong, but it's not as strong as "Heathers."
That's a good one.
Hey.
How'd you make out with Bob?
Ow!
Ow!
Stop it!
Aah!
Hi, Ellen.
Take a shot?
Bob caught Dan going through his trash.
There was a confrontation, and then Bob went with Karp's firm.
You were supposed to pull Dan back.
Wait a second.
You guys knew he was snooping?
It was a winking miscommunication.
No, Jared just wanted to know if you were hooking up with Bob.
You probably don't realize this, but exposing this firm ethically and criminally is just plain...
Stupid.
I know.
And in this case...
Lucky.
Bob's a fraud.
He's drumming up bogus cases with his physician at Westside General.
Dan found shredded documents confirming it.
So, it's a good thing I activated him.
You're an idiot.
But an adorable one, right?
No.
Just an idiot.
I can't.
I think you're adorable.
Thanks, buddy.
Right back at ya.
Should we tip off Karp about Bob?
- Nah.
- Nah.
So, ladies and gentlemen, this case isn't about intention.
Jimmy Livanos never intended to assist his passenger in a crime spree.
He simply fell for what Huey Lewis called
"the power of love."
Remember that song?
I mean, look at history.
Men have had their minds blown by women since Eve took a bite out of Adam's apple.
Van Gogh cut off his own ear over a woman.
Tiger Woods has been in a majors drought for years over a woman.
Or two.
My own partner, Jared Franklin, nearly cost us a seven-figure case over a woman.
Jimmy Livanos didn't intentionally drive to a pawn shop.
His GPS brain glitched, and he drove to the wrong grid.
Why?
Because he was high on a drug called Sadie Juvonen.
If he's guilty of anything, it's getting lost...
Lost in love.
It might make him a fool, but it doesn't make him guilty of these crimes.
Thank you.
I don't know how to repay you guys.
Think of it as payback for us throwing up in your back seat.
I don't just mean for saving my ass back there.
I mean for opening my eyes.
That Sadie chick nearly ruined me.
- Won't be the last.
- Wow.
Speaking of sore losers.
Come on.
You got to be used to it by now.
Come on.
We didn't mean to beat you that bad.
Hey, uh, is she in trouble?
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
But I, uh...
I thought she had a deal.
Uh, she didn't give truthful testimony, so that deal's off the table.
She's got to go down all by herself.
Sadie, um...
When this is all, uh, done for you, uh, just click your Wunder app, and I'll be there to pick you up.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Hey, for what it's worth, I had a great night with you.
Yeah.
Oh, Jimmy.
Oh, that poor guy.
Mmm.
These really are delicious!
Told you.
- What do you call them again?
- Buffalo wings.
Mmm.
Buffalo.
Mmm.
Well, it's chicken.
Well, whatever they are, they're delicious.
Oh, by the way, I commend you on your choice of power table.
You can really control the whole room from here.
Sir...
We got you a welcome-back gift.
Oh.
For me?
- Yep.
- Oh, you're too kind.
- Can I open it now?
- Of course.
Oh.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Ohh.
- You like it?
- Wow.
Doesn't it strike you as being a liitle bit over the top?
- No, it's perfect.
- Practically a photograph.
- Yeah.
- Wow.
We, uh... we got a spot over here for you.
- Oh.
Where is it?
- Starting a wall of fame right there.
- You are the first.
- Oh!
Thank you.
- What do you think?
- It's lovely.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Well, it's good to be back.
It's good to have you back.
Looks like an unconventional approach can get you back to the top.
Yeah, in moderation.
- To Infeld.
- Daniels.
Franklin Bash.
Billables are down, but we still came up 8% last month.
All right.
New business.
Let's do this.
Uh...
Lisa.
Go.
- Good hands, Lisa.
- Thank you.
I'm representing a pro surfer who came in second at the trestles triple crown.
Winner stole his wave, so we're going after prize money and damages.
- Stealing a wave.
- Oh, that's just un-Californian.
Okay.
[Gasps]
- Oh, hey.
Okay?
- Oh, got to be aware.
I secured Warren Stone's golden parachute, which...
Uh, Ed...
Would you like to remind the room about our meeting protocol?
[Sighs]
Nobody speaks without holding the football.
Mm-hmm.
And are you currently holding the football?
Are you?
[All ooh]
Good one, Ed.
Really?
Really?
He nailed ya.
Well, I mean, he spoke first.
Two laps for you, one lap for you.
- Why am I taking two?
- You interrupted him.
Two laps, one lap.
Let's go.
Okay, Ed, let's go.
Come on.
Ed, get to it!
[All chanting] Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Here it comes.
Oh!
[Cheers and applause]
Take a seat.
Oh!
Whoa.
- Boom!
- Boom!
[Chuckles]
Oh, breakfast is served.
[Cheers and applause]
Oh.
Stanton.
Sir.
What on earth is going on here?
Uh, we didn't know you were coming back so soon.
Clearly.
♪ Ooh, what a mixture ♪
♪ such a vivid picture ♪
♪ ooh, what a mixture ♪
♪ if I must say so myself ♪
I would apologize for my tardiness, but somebody parked a silver benz in my space, so I had to get it towed.
Oh!
No!
No!
Why don't you take a seat here?
I wouldn't want to interfere with your refereeing.
- Sir, we insist.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Let's get back to business.
A case came in through the firm's website.
The number 4, 'cause it's shorter than...
Yes, yes, yes.
I get it.
Clever.
Also, we have an Instagram account for the firm now, so we do Monday-morning photos.
Let's get in here.
Let's use the fingers this time.
Here we go. "We got your back." [Camera shutter clicks]
- We'll post that on instagram and the website.
- Nice.
- You were discussing a new case?
- Uh-huh.
Yep.
According to the plaintiff, a sleep medication triggered an illicit late-night shopping spree.
Right.
He woke up with no memory, and now he wants to sue the makers of the sleeping pill "Twilera"
for the purchases he cannot return.
Any takers?
Line 'em up.
Anybody?
Where's Swatello?
Uh, I think she's in deposition.
Twilera is now Ellen's case.
Now, that's it for new business.
Stanton, would you like to address the troops?
Well, I have plenty to say, but I'm going to share my words in private.
Oh.
Call an audible?
Meeting adjourned.
Meeting's adjourned.
Are you mad at us, sir?
Yeah, you didn't seem your meta self in that meeting.
Listen, boys.
In the past,
I haven't ruled with an iron fist, but you can't run a respectable firm with pizza parties and skateboarders and what you Americans call football.
Well, it's worked out pretty well so far.
Well, if we're to get to the top again, we'll have to refine your approach.
Okay.
Well, I mean, we could go to Larsen's for lunch, talk it over.
Yeah, we got a 20% Groupon.
Let us take you to lunch.
- One of us has to get that branzino.
- Peter's afraid of fish.
I'm not afraid of fish.
I just don't like the way they serve it.
- They serve it whole...
- You're afraid of fish.
With the head still on there, fried, looking up at you.
- Right, you're afraid of that.
- How you supposed to eat a fish
- when it's looking at you?
- You're just afraid of fish.
Admit it!
All right, enough!
You don't like watching "The Little Mermaid." You...
Maybe we'll have lunch tomorrow, but in the meantime,
I have thousands of e-mails to catch up on.
Dan-o.
- Dan-o?
- Yeah, we like to give nicknames to all our private investigators.
I prefer the nickname I already have.
Oh, yeah?
What is it?
I-I can't tell you.
It's the same as my wi-fi password.
Seems totally normal.
What do you got for us, Dan-o?
Some guy in reception says he knows you...
Jimmy Livanos, Wunder driver?
Doesn't ring a bell, but we do love the Wunder app.
Can't get home from a bar without it.
Really looking forward to when they invent the Wunder jet pack.
[Chuckles] [Chuckles]
He says he was arrested for conspiring to steal a bunch of handbags from celebrities with his passenger.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and presume he sees things differently?
Rhetorical question.
Let it go.
All right.
It's just a misunderstanding.
I drove a passenger to an art gallery opening at H58, then to a denim store launch in X4, and then to a charity event for endangered city squirrels at G21.
I dropped her off, and the next thing you know, my car's surrounded by cops with their guns drawn.
Uh, H58, GX...
Did you sink a battleship at some point in the night?
Sorry.
They're coordinates in the "Harris Road Atlas."
Okay.
Oh.
Well, it seems like a lot of work your phone could do for free.
Yeah, but your phone's GPS does not have the Jimmy Livanos shortcuts.
I've got a photographic memory for directions.
Well, Jimmy, the bouncer at the chateau took down your license plate after Gwyneth Paltrow's purse went missing, and surveillance cameras got you and your passenger leaving with the bag.
Not to mention 70 grand of top-shelf bags disappeared from the other places you guys visited.
No, we didn't steal any bags.
Talk to my passenger, Kim Polito.
She'll tell you.
This is crazy.
Yeah.
Uh, well, that's not gonna be so easy.
Kim Polito doesn't exist, Jimmy.
We pulled the police report.
She used a fake PayPal account.
And the D.A. thinks that you two planned the thefts together.
She set me up?
[Sighs] That doesn't make sense.
She sat up front and bought me cheese fries.
We were vibing each other.
Well, I would keep the vibing to yourself.
Prosecution will only use it to bolster their co-conspirator theory.
You're looking at 10 years for grand theft.
Prison?
No, I-I just bought a house, and I'm on track to be promoted to Wunder S.U.V.
I-I can't...
listen.
When I drove you guys home a few weeks ago, you swore to me you'd get my back if I ever was in trouble.
You picked us up from a bar?
Yeah.
We leave you a good tip?
Just your business card.
And you puked in my back seat.
[Scoffs] Well, Jared can't hold his liquor, but we are good at keeping our word.
You both puked.
That's why we're gonna fight twice as hard for your case.
Ha.
You puked, too.
So, the plaintiff was so out of his mind on the sleep med Twilera that he ordered up a dominatrix.
Of course he did.
And when fantasia arrived, he tried to call it off, but he was so loopy that he couldn't remember the safe word.
She tied him up, poured wax down his crack, and billed him for services rendered.
And you guys want me to go after Twilera because the dominatrix...
Fantasia.
won't provide a refund?
Think of this... it's your first shot at big pharma. [Clicks tongue]
Are you two high on sleep meds right now?
I know I'm not sleeping, 'cause if I was, you wouldn't be so far away and wearing so much.
Uh-oh.
All right, we'll just make a record of that.
I was kidding, 'cause, you know, we're sleeping together.
Dude?
All right.
Tuesday, June 22nd.
Peter, do you have the time?
- I do.
- Don't give her the time.
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.
You are.
And I didn't join this firm to defend potheads and perverts.
Give it to Anita.
[Chuckling] Ellen, Ellen, when you're running a law firm...
Kind of the bosses.
Sometimes, you have to make the tough calls, like matching the perfect lawyer to the perfect case.
And this case has Swatello written all over it.
"Swatello."
You guys already decided I'm taking the case, didn't you?
- Yeah, he's your 12:00.
- He should be here now.
- The underwear model?
- No, his name's Bob Allen.
He's not an underwear model.
He's a...
Masseuse.
[Inhales sharply] Ouch.
Oh, yeah.
This guy definitely deserves his day in court.
Thank you.
How are you?
Well, hello.
I'm Ellen Swatello.
Shut up.
The people vs. Jimmy Livanos.
Mr. Everett, it's the court's understanding you have new evidence you would like to present to trial.
Your Honor, we have an affidavit from a security guard at the Raw Denim event who witnessed Mr. Livanos socializing with his passenger.
Socializing?
Well, let's just skip the trial and lock him up right now.
Your Honor, we admitted our client was invited inside so he wouldn't have to wait in the car.
They were dancing together.
Well, he had to stretch his legs after a long car ride.
Our client has a six-star rating at Wunder.
He was Driver of the Year three times.
And, Your Honor, he has no priors, and on Yelp, his passengers have labeled him Siri's big brother because he has an amazing memory for directions.
Then maybe counsel can explain why Wunder's GPS software tracked Mr. Livanos' vehicle to a parking lot across from a closed pawn shop.
'Cause it looks like he and his co-conspirator were trying to fence the items they stole.
[Quietly] I-I got turned around.
[Quietly] After we just said your brain was Siri's big brother?
I'm deeming the evidence concerning Mr. Livanos' driving that evening admissible.
The jury will be instructed to consider it in determining Mr. Livanos' guilt.
Say goodbye to a plea deal.
We're coming after you with both barrels.
[Quietly] What just happened?
20-car pileup.
Come on, Jimmy.
What's going on?
I just got my wires crossed that night.
I made a wrong turn and pulled over in a parking lot.
Right in front of a diamond brothers pawn shop?
Yeah, also in front of Burger Shack.
Yeah, but drivers with photographic memories for directions don't get lost.
Okay, Jimmy, what's the quickest way to get from Antelope Valley to L.A.X.?
Uh, 14 south to the 5 south to the 405, exit La Tijera, shoot down Manchester to Century, and you're there.
Is he right?
The hell do I know?
I've never been to Antelope Valley.
U-unless it's rush hour, in which case, I'd take the 101 to Highland, to La Brea, to La Tijera...
Okay, so how did your wires get crossed?
[Sighs] I wish I knew.
The whole night's a blur.
It's weird.
It was a blur?
Did she slip something in your drink?
No, I don't drink on my shifts.
Wait.
So, you're saying you danced sober?
Yeah, she was cool.
Why would she do this to me?
Jimmy, was this girl hot?
Uh, she's not unattractive.
But I'm a trained professional.
I would consider that a lame excuse.
Mm-hmm.
So would a judge.
No.
Then we're gonna have to find your mystery girl, get her to tell the truth.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Just...
looking at texts.
Yeah?
Checking in on Swatello?
[Chuckles] Worried about Bob?
- He's not her type.
- Oh, yeah, 'cause she couldn't possibly be interested in a fitness freak who gives happy endings for a living.
I'm not gonna let you get in my head.
I'm not gonna do it.
Hey, Dan-o.
You want a beer?
I'm working.
Sure.
What'd the Danimal drag in?
Great, now I have to change all my passwords.
How did you crack it?
Mm-hmm.
Uh... here's something on our mystery girl.
I figured someone got her into those parties, and if it was someone famous, paparazzi would've caught them together, right?
- Okay.
- Yeah, we're following you.
That's smart, man.
Link her to a celeb who might know the mystery girl's name.
Capturebank gathers every red-carpet nip slip and crotch shot by event.
Already bookmarked.
Good man.
Here she is...
At the Raw Denim launch.
And...
Save the Squirrels fundraiser.
- Both with Jimmy.
- No celebs.
No crotch shots, either.
But...
Look closer.
What... is it some special face-recognition software?
No.
The pics... are watermarked.
"Flywire Photos."
A division of Raglan Public Relations...
Same company that dispatched the photographers to both events.
One of the photographers would recognize a familiar face.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I'll get into it.
Hey, Dan, you, uh...
You been looking for a place to live, right?
Why?
Well, we got a room if you're interested.
It's downstairs, right by...
The door to the beach.
Thanks.
I've been living here for a week now.
- He's gonna kill us.
- I'm gonna lock my door.
- You got a minute?
- No.
- You were right.
- Of course I was.
About what?
Anita's a better fit for the Twilera case.
Hmm.
Is she?
Yeah.
You know, someone with your drive, you should really be focused on making real rain here.
Mm, that's sweet of you to say, but actually, the Twilera case has turned out to be a potential monsoon.
Even your old buddy Karp wants a piece of it.
He put a call in to Bob.
Karp wants a piece of all our cases.
Also, Bob's physician at Westside General contacted me.
Turns out, Twilera has elicited bizarre behavior in a number of his patients.
Class-action suit?
6 grand just turned into $6 million.
Well, even still, I mean, a case that size is gonna suck up all of our firm's resources.
I-I really think we should explore a settlement.
We had sex in the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum.
Since when do you play it safe?
[Chuckles]You gonna put that in your harassment log?
Look, Bob's toxicology came back with traces of benzodiazepines in his system.
The defense is gonna paint him as a pill popper.
You're jealous of Bob.
[Chuckles] Of... of Bob?
I'm not...
I'm not jealous of Bob.
I am looking out for the firm's well being.
So am I. That thing you're playing with is on loan to us from Bob's doctor.
It detects drugs in the body by measuring pupil reaction times.
And we discovered that Twilera's peculiar effects on Bob linger for almost 14 hours after consumption.
And it detected Levipro...
A benzodiazepine.
He was prescribed it for his torn rotator cuff from Fantasia.
Sounds like Bob's got a weak shoulder.
I brought cronuts.
Hi.
Half croissant, half doughnut.
Oh, wow, that is so thoughtful of you, Bob.
Oh, that is really sweet.
- Please, help yourselves.
- Ohh.
Aw, uh, no, thanks.
I don't like hybrid, freakish food.
It's like, you know, are you a doughnut or a croissant?
You know, just decide.
Just make up your mind.
You just have to pick one.
[Door opens]
Oh!
I can still smell old cavendish in the air.
[Sniffs] Remember when a bog-wood pipe came with dessert?
- Times have changed.
- Ah.
Isn't...
Stanton, isn't that your table?
Yeah, where you shared biggie smalls' last supper.
Dominic, um, I do believe we've overshot the green, there.
Hmm.
Someone who's fallen as far from grace as you certainly doesn't need any more unwanted attention.
Gentlemen, here we are.
So close to the bathrooms.
Pretty sure I can hit the urinals from here.
You know, this is Stanton Infeld.
- Show some respect.
- It's... it's all right.
This table, it's fine.
It's great, lovely.
At least from here, I can see my carica...
Wha...
My caricature has been replaced by...
Mike Tyson?
Hmm.
You're the first to notice.
You know, keep this up, we're not gonna be greasing your palms during the holidays.
What will I do without my re-gifted Starbucks card?
Let me guess... using a Groupon today?
Look, direct your insults at me, or just refuse us service if you think we sully your establishment.
I'm surprised it took you this long to take the hint.
You son of a bitch!
[Grunts]
Message received.
Just so we're clear, when we said
"go to lunch to discuss our approach,"
we didn't mean decking the owner.
Not that that punch was not awesome.
Oh, wow.
What a right hand, man.
But we are on the verge of pulling the firm out of a nosedive.
And that might've erased all of our progress.
I-I don't know what came over me, boys.
You know, and it's certainly not about that toffee-nosed Dominic.
I-it's more about me.
Hang on.
Thank you.
You know, my image has damaged the firm's name.
It's a bit overwhelming.
- Stanton, your image is fine.
- With your image, we had 641 people testifying to your love-making skills.
Broadcasting my sexcapades in court also came at the expense of the dignity of the firm, and then the pressures that I wasn't aware of, they started to build up, and I...
Snapped.
Snapped, yes.
Now, uh, listen.
I-I'm not proud of my actions, but I do take responsibility for them.
Whoa.
You sucker punched the wrong guy.
And you insulted my lawyers.
You shouldn't have stolen Madeline.
Madeline?
[Chuckling] Madeline?
Come on, man.
That's 20 years ago!
And for 20 years, my position at this establishment has kept me from speaking my mind to a valued patron.
Well, the tables have turned.
I want $100,000, or I'm going straight to the police.
What... are you mad?
You have 24 hours.
You...
If he goes to the cops, that could affect your reinstatement with the bar.
Not to mention get arrested.
You know, I spent three years in a Gulag pushing a stone wheel on the Kolyma River.
Prison, I can survive.
But my dignity...
Well, Stanton, we can't just flip a cushion and find a spare $100,000.
You know, Sotheby's has been after my scrimshaw walrus penis from John Lennon for years!
- We, um...
- We sort of hocked that...
What?
To cover your last round of legal expenses.
Yeah.
Don't tell me we're out of options.
- Peter.
- Shh.
Shh.
Peter?
Shh.
Quick question...
Bra or no bra?
Are you talking to us?
And can you repeat it and say it slower?
I'm on the fence about a bra with this dress.
And... and you want our... our... our advice?
I want your queer eye.
- Here, take a pic.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Use the flash.
That's good.
[Camera shutter clicks]
Tell me you can't see my nipples.
Ooh.
We'd be lying.
Tell you what.
Let's get a second opinion and use my phone.
Good idea.
Stronger flash, yeah.
You must be the lawyers.
[Camera shutter clicks] There we go.
Perfect.
Peter Bash, Jared Franklin.
Esquires.
You don't have to go.
Tenley Lark.
I coordinate firefly from Raglan.
You called about speaking with our photographers?
Yes, trying to figure out if one of your photographers crossed paths with this woman right here.
- Sadie Juvonen.
- You know her?
She was in charge of gifting for Raglan.
We give select celebs and influencers free dresses and accessories from our designers.
Now, you said Sadie was in charge of gifting?
We let her go a month ago.
It takes a unique personality to tolerate the fashion world.
[Chuckles] You wouldn't happen to have her address, would you?
Is she in trouble?
No.
No, no, no.
No.
She, uh, did some personal shopping for one of our clients.
We're handling the returns.
Turnover is fairly high here.
My assistant may know more.
Okay.
So, Sadie knew who got the bags and where to find them.
Yeah, pinned it on Jimmy and turned her unemployment into an early retirement.
She's crashing on a friend's couch in Weho.
[Cellphone rings] Oh, great.
Excuse me.
I have to take this.
Sure.
Thank you.
I am such a pain in the ass.
Could I borrow one of you guys again for a private opinion in my dressing room?
- I'm all yours.
- I'm at your service.
Come on.
I...
Just...
Yeah. [Clears throat]
[Chuckles] Oh.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Swatello!
- You look...
- You can say it.
"Hot."
I'm trying to bait Bob into a dinner at the grill.
Oh.
You sure that's it?
What else would I be trying to do?
Oh, I don't know.
Just trying to make a certain friend of ours jealous?
[Scoffs]
I would only be trying to make someone jealous if I liked them.
Which you don't.
Actually, I don't.
- You paused.
- And now I'm leaving.
All right.
Ellen, the firm's really not in a position to splurge on client dinners.
Okay, but Karp just invited Bob to play in a scramble at Sawbridge.
[Sighs]
All right, fine.
Just don't order any appetizers.
I'm ordering calamari.
- No.
- Yep.
- No!
- Happening.
I've been sensing sexual tension between you and Miss Swatello.
You mean you've been reading my texts?
How I sense it is irrelevant.
What is relevant is her blossoming relationship with Bob.
You know something I don't?
Always, but I could find out more.
You're not seriously offering to spy on a colleague?
I'm offering to find out for my roomie if Ellen and Bob are boning.
No.
No, no, no.
That's totally unprofessional.
I'd keep it professional.
- I'm not saying that.
- And I'm not hearing you.
Wait.
What did we just agree to?
D-Dan!
[Knock on door]
Hi.
Infeld-Daniels, Franklin bash.
Uh, my roommate already told the landlord her dad sent the rent.
We're here to talk to you about the handbags you stole, Sadie.
Uh...
My name's Emma.
You guys must have the wrong address.
Oh, my God.
S-sorry to bother you.
- Yeah, we'll just wait out here for the cops.
- Yeah.
[Sirens wailing in distance]
Okay, why should I talk to you guys?
Because we just called the cops, and in about 60 seconds, you're gonna need a lawyer.
And we're running a one-day-only unemployment special.
We'll represent you pro bono in exchange for your testimony.
You just tell the cops that Jimmy Livanos had nothing to do with those purses.
[Sirens approach, stop] 40 seconds.
We're in tight with the D.A. we can get you a good deal.
- 35.
- I can't go to jail.
Well, there's an innocent man who's about to go behind bars 'cause of something you did.
- You guys can really help me?
- 20 seconds.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Never mind.
They're here.
Sadie Juvonen.
Oh, thank God you're here.
Jimmy Livanos made me rob those women.
I didn't want to do it.
She's good.
She's lying.
She's saying you were in on it from the beginning and that you were in charge.
[Sighs] How could I be such an idiot?
!
The good news is her testimony won't come in.
Why not?
Well, statements from one co-defendant against another are inadmissible.
You both have inherent reason to point the finger at each other.
I mean, how could somebody so beautiful be so evil?
In my experience, sometimes the two go hand in hand.
You know, I-I-I could've been a cab driver...
Throw the meter on, keep to myself.
But I joined Wunder because, you know, it's about more than just the ride.
You share your car!
You share your life!
Sadie's gonna take all that away from me.
- We won't let her.
- Once we put you on the stand, the jury's gonna learn what we already know...
A good guy's really big heart got him in really big trouble.
Well, your nose has healed up nicely.
I wish I could say the same thing about your reputation.
We have a counteroffer I think you'll find acceptable, Dominic.
What does this mean?
You threatened to go to the police if we didn't pay you.
Last time I checked, extortion is illegal.
So is assault.
And around we'll go.
We'd rather let bygones be bygones.
The truth is, Dominic, you caught me on a bad day.
Your insults ignited my pent-up emotions.
Oh, thanks to you, I've worked them out.
Only now, with your ego on the ropes, do you show any remorse for your arrogant behavior over the years.
Look, you shouldn't have taken down my caricature.
And you shouldn't have taken Madeline from me at the Concours D'elegance.
Her engine was a true masterpiece.
This is over a car?
You don't call a 1961 Jaguar E-type "a car."
[Laughs] You can say that again, Dominic.
[Both chuckle]
You outbid me in front of everyone after I told you that I wanted her!
Come on.
We were both half in the bag on Sazerac.
- You said no such thing.
- You calling me a liar?
I'm calling you a crazy old loon who was too drunk to remember.
20 years ago, we would've settled this like men.
Well, men don't go whining to the authorities, old boy.
And only candy asses throw sucker punches!
All right.
Come on.
Give me your best shot.
Go on.
Punch me on the chin, and I hope it feels as good for you as it did for me.
With pleasure.
Ah, no.
Come on.
Take your corners.
Peter, this has to happen.
Please, let's just settle this once and for all.
One free punch, and you're even?
You're good with this?
Okay.
Not here.
We already had too many witnesses at the restaurant.
It's not good for the firm.
It's got to be on the down-low.
Agreed?
Agreed.
[Sighs] So, can Larsen wear any rings on his punching fist?
Oh, he would, wouldn't he?
We should put a no-jewelry proviso in the contract just to cover ourselves.
Yeah.
[Whistles] D-train is in the station.
- Are you having a stroke?
- I'm speaking in code.
We're ignoring you in English.
I have information about Ellen.
Swatello?
Uh, no.
It's... it's nothing.
Shh.
We'll talk about it later.
-We'll talk about it later.
- She and Bob ordered a calamari appetizer.
Seafood... panty dropper.
You put Dan on Swatello?
I didn't put Dan on anyone.
- He accepted my wink.
- He gave you a wink?
Uh... people wink.
It's a thing.
I didn't accept a wi...
I also went through Bob's car at the valet and found these.
What is that?
Jacoby Dunhill, Simmons Associates,
Randall-Kosch.
And a parking stub...
From Gibson Marshall's building.
So Karp's not alone.
Bob's gonna walk.
Not if we get out in front of him.
Aah!
Ohh, yeah!
Harder!
Harder!
- Oh, sweet...
- Ohh, yeah!
Uh, Stanton?
Oh.
Oh.
[Coughs]
Excuse us, but, uh, we have a favor to ask you, sir.
Oh.
Well, I'll trade you.
We need you to lob a call in to Bob Allen.
The plaintiff in the Twilera case.
He needs to know that his case has the support of the firm's emperor.
Very well.
Show a little love to Bob Allen.
Will do.
Good.
Great.
Uh, what's yours?
Well, in order to prepare for my settlement punch,
I need you to pummel me when I least expect it...
Face, kidneys, your choice.
Nothing toughens a man quite like the element of surprise.
[Both grunt]
Oh!
[Groaning]
[Wheezing softly]
Hmm.
Good?
Ellen, our street intel suggests that the Twilera case might be more substantial than we predicted.
It seems that every triple-name firm in town is going after Bob.
We can't let them poach him.
Those firms wine and dine with expense accounts twice the size of our payroll.
Well, we're gonna need you to do whatever it takes to land him.
Okay.
I'll get it done.
Ow!
That's not a toy.
Well, you just gave her the green light to bang Bob.
What are you talking about?
"Whatever it takes to land him"?
Yeah, whatever it takes for her to...
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Wow.
No, I didn't mean it like that!
Look, Jimmy, when Sadie comes in, you have to play it cool.
Trust me, I'd never give her the satisfaction.
Attaboy.
We're gonna get you through this, Jimmy.
Speak of the devil.
What's she doing with the D.A.?
Hey, Jimbo.
Hey.
Did you, uh, get that childish gambino album
- we talked about?
- It's beyond.
Right?
She's the enemy.
Whoa, eyes on the prize.
- Doesn't she smell incredible?
- She smells like 10 years.
My dance card's full today, boys and girls.
Let's get to it.
Your Honor, we move to exclude the testimony of Sadie Juvonen as a co-defendant.
- I object to that motion.
- You shouldn't.
Miss Juvonen cut a deal with my office earlier this morning to turn state's evidence.
- She pled guilty.
- Does that matter?
Yeah.
Now she can say whatever she wants on the stand.
We are in recess until 9:00 A.M. tomorrow.
Hmm.
Uh, do you guys think I still have a shot with her?
Okay.
We have to prove that you weren't partners in crime.
Yeah, and flirting with the person that we're trying to paint as the villain
- sends a mixed message.
- I-I can't explain it.
I just saw her, and all these feelings returned.
[Breathes deeply]
You guys smell that?
[Sniffs] Stripper perfume?
Pink sapphire.
We said the judge might not buy our client being distracted by Sadie.
What if he was drugged?
No, no, I told you.
She didn't slip me anything.
Oh, yeah, she did.
You just weren't aware of it.
Hey, dude, we still have another fight on our hands.
They changed the proximity clause.
- What?
- Check it out.
All right.
Our ducks in a row?
Yeah, remember we went over the original language...
The face, stomach, balls.
We ironed all this out yesterday.
You know, to keep it fair, I would ask you just to punch me directly in the face.
My team made some changes.
I wasn't afforded that luxury when you sucker punched me.
Besides, everyone knows you only have one testicle, Stanton.
All right, enough dilly dallying.
- Let's just sign this thing and move on.
- Okeydoke.
- Here you go.
- Where do I sign?
- Here.
- Okay.
There we go.
[Sighs]
Remember, keep your arms at your side and...
Yeah, just keep your arms at your side.
All right.
Uh...
Uh, bring on the pain.
[Door opens]
Gladly.
Whoa!
Whoa!
I'm hereby invoking my right to a substitute hitter.
Tha... that's... that's Iron Mike Tyson right there.
Oh, my God.
Jared Franklin.
Huge fan.
We're huge fans from way back.
Thank you.
Really appreciate that.
Oh, my God. "Mike Tyson's punch-out!"
On Nintendo... we played every afternoon.
Glass Joe, piston...
- Hell of a game.
- Hell of a game!
Oh, my God.
Amazing game.
He does a spot-on impression of you.
You got to hear this.
No, I don't.
- You should do it for him.
- You should shut up.
- Get out of here.
- He'd love it.
Shut your face.
Come on.
- I would like to hear it, yeah.
- Really?
- He would like to hear it.
- All right, um...
Everyone has a plan u-until they get punched in the mouth.
Not bad.
Most people make me sound like Jay Leno.
- He's good, right?
- Really good.
Thank you very much.
I got to say, your fight against Buster Douglas...
- Oh, man.
- W-w-w-what was that?
- You took him to the mat.
- The ref gave him forever
- to get back up.
- I try to tell everybody.
Man, Buster was so lucky that night.
- So lucky.
- Never gave me a rematch, either.
Boys!
Listen.
He's here to destroy me!
That's kind of true.
I am here to kick his ass.
Okay.
We did not approve the baddest man on the planet.
Iron Mike is going to cripple Stanton.
Strong possibility, yeah.
Never walk again.
Our contract does not clarify who delivers the punch.
Oh, you are a regular John Wilkes, aren't you, Dominic?
A stabber in the dark.
A cowardly, malignant...
[Grunts] Oh!
- What the...
- Oh!
- Hey, man.
That's not cool, dude.
- That's not cool, dude!
- I'm sorry, Mike.
- Really?
- No, I didn't mean...
- Really, huh?
- What are you doing, man?
- Mike, that was a...
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't tell it to do anything.
You hit my friend.
Well, I did this as a favor for a friend, man.
I didn't expect all this stuff.
I'm sorry, Mike.
I'm sorry.
Man, I don't need this.
I do theater now.
Uh, Mi...
I'm sorry.
I loved your show, Mike!
[Stanton groans]
- Where were you?
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You...
[Straining] I think my...
diaphragm just exploded.
[Coughing]
- You think we can still get a picture?
- Yeah.
I was gonna get a picture.
The defense calls Dr. Anthony Garth, a toxicologist from the Claremont institute.
Objection.
Dr. Garth is not on our witness list.
He was a last-minute addition, Your Honor.
We submitted to prosecution late last night.
If you couldn't tell, gentlemen, I also don't like surprises.
Why should I make an exception?
Well, due to Jimmy's keen sense of direction, the prosecution finds it implausible that he accidentally drove to the parking lot across from the pawn shop.
And Dr. Garth will help us argue that Jimmy lost his sense of direction because he was drugged.
Which is why he got turned around.
Objection.
The police report does not establish any evidence of drug-related behavior.
Then you have nothing to lose by allowing our witness.
I'll allow it.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Dr. Garth, isn't it possible that a person could be drugged without exhibiting drug-related behavior?
Intoxicating effects present themselves in a myriad of ways.
Could you educate the court on the device that I'm holding?
An ocular intoximeter is used by law-enforcement agencies to detect drugs in the blood system.
Sort of like a breathalyzer for booze.
More or less.
With the court's permission, could you give a demonstration on our client?
[Sighs]
It's currently measuring pupil reaction times.
Processing the data.
[Device beeping]
Subject's system is drug free.
Great.
Thank you.
No further questions.
Mr. Everett.
Inasmuch as none of this has any relevance to the case, the people have no questions.
Thank you, Dr. Garth.
Your Honor, the defense calls Jimmy Livanos to the stand.
Jimmy, you've been called Siri's big brother because of your photographic memory for directions.
I-I know my way around town.
And you're also knowledgeable with the "Harris Road Atlas."
Yeah, like the back my hand.
The back of your hand.
Let's put him to the test.
Jimmy, where is the Los Feliz Fountain?
Uh, page 56, L72.
56, L72...
He's right.
How about the Long Beach Aquarium, the Getty Center, and Griffith Observatory?
Uh, page 191, L96, page 55, K5, and page 203, W55.
He's too fast.
Objection.
I need a GPS to figure out this line of questioning.
Your Honor, the relevance will be clear in a moment.
Overruled, barely.
But this better get relevant real quick.
I'll do my best, Your Honor.
Jimmy, can you tell me what's on page 48, T82?
That's where I got turned around that night with Sadie.
Outside of Diamond Brother's pawn shop?
Hmm.
No further questions, Your Honor.
The defense would like to recall Sadie Juvonen to the stand.
[Inhales deeply]
Mr. Livanos?
You may step down.
Uh, ha-hang on a sec.
Miss Juvonen, stay on deck.
I have one more question for Jimmy.
Jimmy, you just told us what's on page 48, T82.
Tell us what's on page 48, T83.
Uh... um...
T83?
T83.
Come on, Jimmy, don't let down all your disciples on Yelp.
Uh, page 48.
Uh... 8...
I-I don't know.
Your Honor, I'd like to have Dr. Garth retest Jimmy's pupils with Sadie Juvonen remaining in court.
[Device whirs]
Jimmy.
What's up, doc?
Nothing?
He has the same dilation as someone high on opiates.
And the only thing that's changed since Jimmy's last test is the presence of Sadie Juvonen.
Best ill-fated love outlaw movie?
"True Romance."
Slater.
That's strong, but it's not as strong as "Heathers."
That's a good one.
Hey.
How'd you make out with Bob?
Ow!
Ow!
Stop it!
Aah!
Hi, Ellen.
Take a shot?
Bob caught Dan going through his trash.
There was a confrontation, and then Bob went with Karp's firm.
You were supposed to pull Dan back.
Wait a second.
You guys knew he was snooping?
It was a winking miscommunication.
No, Jared just wanted to know if you were hooking up with Bob.
You probably don't realize this, but exposing this firm ethically and criminally is just plain...
Stupid.
I know.
And in this case...
Lucky.
Bob's a fraud.
He's drumming up bogus cases with his physician at Westside General.
Dan found shredded documents confirming it.
So, it's a good thing I activated him.
You're an idiot.
But an adorable one, right?
No.
Just an idiot.
I can't.
I think you're adorable.
Thanks, buddy.
Right back at ya.
Should we tip off Karp about Bob?
- Nah.
- Nah.
So, ladies and gentlemen, this case isn't about intention.
Jimmy Livanos never intended to assist his passenger in a crime spree.
He simply fell for what Huey Lewis called
"the power of love."
Remember that song?
I mean, look at history.
Men have had their minds blown by women since Eve took a bite out of Adam's apple.
Van Gogh cut off his own ear over a woman.
Tiger Woods has been in a majors drought for years over a woman.
Or two.
My own partner, Jared Franklin, nearly cost us a seven-figure case over a woman.
Jimmy Livanos didn't intentionally drive to a pawn shop.
His GPS brain glitched, and he drove to the wrong grid.
Why?
Because he was high on a drug called Sadie Juvonen.
If he's guilty of anything, it's getting lost...
Lost in love.
It might make him a fool, but it doesn't make him guilty of these crimes.
Thank you.
Jimmy: [Sighs] I don't know how to repay you guys.
Think of it as payback for us throwing up in your back seat.
I don't just mean for saving my ass back there.
I mean for opening my eyes.
That Sadie chick nearly ruined me.
- Won't be the last.
- Wow.
Speaking of sore losers.
Come on.
You got to be used to it by now.
Come on.
We didn't mean to beat you that bad.
Hey, uh, is she in trouble?
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
But I, uh...
I thought she had a deal.
Uh, she didn't give truthful testimony, so that deal's off the table.
She's got to go down all by herself.
Sadie, um...
When this is all, uh, done for you, uh, just click your Wunder app, and I'll be there to pick you up.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Hey, for what it's worth, I had a great night with you.
Yeah.
[Sighs]
Oh, Jimmy.
Oh, that poor guy.
Mmm.
These really are delicious!
Told you.
- What do you call them again?
- Buffalo wings.
Mmm.
Buffalo.
Mmm.
Well, it's chicken.
Well, whatever they are, they're delicious.
Oh, by the way, I commend you on your choice of power table.
You can really control the whole room from here.
Sir...
We got you a welcome-back gift.
Oh.
For me?
- Yep.
- Oh, you're too kind.
- Can I open it now?
- Of course.
Oh.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Ohh.
- You like it?
- Wow.
Doesn't it strike you as being a liitle bit over the top?
- No, it's perfect.
- Practically a photograph.
- Yeah.
- Wow.
We, uh... we got a spot over here for you.
- Oh.
Where is it?
- Starting a wall of fame right there.
- You are the first.
- Oh!
Thank you.
- What do you think?
- It's lovely.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
Well, it's good to be back.
It's good to have you back.
Looks like an unconventional approach can get you back to the top.
Yeah, in moderation.
- To Infeld.
- Daniels.
Franklin Bash.
Beckett:
This is heaven.
This is absolute heaven.
Yeah, you mean spending the day with your future husband?
No, no.
Not that.
[ Chuckles ] Not that?
No, no, no.
I mean, not only that.
It's 2:00.
I'm in my P.J.s.
We're reading the newspapers.
I never get to do this.
Because you never take any time off.
All we have to do is loaf around.
There's no work, no goals other than to waste hours on end.
Okay.
Stop describing my life.
Though there is one thing we should get done today.
We need to pick a font for our "save the date" cards.
Really?
We're gonna do that?
We don't even have a venue yet.
Yeah.
I find deadlines... inspiring.
How about this one?
No.
It's too frilly.
Agreed.
And this...
ooh, this is... far too severe.
[ German accent ] You will save the date now.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, I like that one.
You?
[ Normal voice ] Mm, I'm not really feeling it, though I guess, uh, you could convince me.
I bet I could.
Yeah, I mean, you'd have to work pretty hard to win me over, but, um...
Well, I'm prepared to do just that.
Because it's clear to me that what we both need right now is a really good font.
Yes, we do.
That's so true.
[ Cellphone ringing ] Oh!
And worst timing ever.
[ Ringing continues ]
[ Groans ]
Beckett.
Detective, how soon can you get here?
Uh, sir, I'm actually not on call today.
I'm aware of that, but something has come up, and I'm afraid it can't wait.
Well, I can get there in 20 minutes.
One more thing... come alone.
Do not bring Mr. Castle.
Uh...
Yes, sir.
[ Phone beeps ]
So, what's Gates up to aside from sabotaging our domestic bliss?
I don't know.
- But I got to go.
- Huh.
I don't suppose I could convince you to just...
- No.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.
I'm fine.
I'll just, uh...
I'll do some writing...
If I can... manage to focus.
[ Elevator bell dings ]
Yo, Beckett.
I thought you were off.
Was that the deputy commissioner?
Yeah, there's been more brass through here than a marching band.
What's going on?
It's all need-to-know, and we didn't make the list.
But whatever's happening is going down in that conference room.
Detective.
- Yep.
- Yep.
- Beckett.
- Sorry.
Yeah.
Detective Beckett,
Captain Fowler, head of narcotics.
Thank you for coming, detective.
Mm-hmm.
What I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room.
Yeah.
Understood, sir.
These six victims had their throats cut.
They were mid-to upper-level drug dealers.
Two were teenagers.
They were all murdered in the past few months when a new drug ring muscled in and took over most of the uptown heroin and cocaine trade.
A new drug ring?
Well, who are they?
The commissioner asked me to find that out and shut them down, but they're invisible, these guys.
They don't use banks, so we can't follow the money.
They make sure their street dealers never meet their suppliers.
So, when you bust a dealer, he doesn't know who he's working for.
Exactly.
So, three months in, and we have nothing.
We don't even know any of their names, except for Lazarus.
- And who is Lazarus?
- The leader.
Not his real name, of course.
Then yesterday, a phone intercept led us to this woman...
Elena Markov.
She copped to being a low-level drug courier in the ring.
Born in Russia, she came here as a mail-order bride, divorced her husband.
She learned to speak English better than we do and was getting by as a freelance translator.
She'd never been in trouble before, at least not till now.
Elena:
I needed work, and I heard about a way to make money.
All I had to do was call a number, so I did.
But once I got in, I couldn't get out.
Who was your contact in the ring?
I didn't have one.
I would get a text with a time and a place, and I'd get a package with a note hidden inside that would tell me where to take it.
Did you ever, um, see anyone?
Did you ever interact with anyone?
No.
Everything was anonymous.
I don't know them.
They don't know me.
It... it needs to stay that way.
Look, I...
I just want to get my life back.
It looked like another dead end.
Then this morning, Elena got another text from the ring.
This time, they wanted to meet her to offer her a promotion.
Which would give you guys a chance to get eyes on someone.
It's the break we've been waiting for.
So, we leveraged Elena to take the meet, but she tried to commit suicide.
She's in intensive care under police guard.
Sir, I'm sorry to hear about that, but what does this all have to do with me?
The meeting is set for 5:00 today, and a chance like this is not gonna come back around, so we combed the NYPD database for someone about Elena's age and appearance who speaks fluent Russian,
in case that's relevant.
Only one name came up... yours.
You want me to go in her place?
To the Widmark.
Show up, meet your contact, and leave.
In and out.
What if they found out that you turned Elena and that this is all a trap?
Then they wouldn't be meeting at the Widmark Hotel.
We were very careful.
No one knows she's made contact with us.
Still, there's the risk that they could see detective Beckett and realize that she's not Elena.
In the text, they asked Elena to wear a red scarf, which tells us that they don't know her on sight.
My people will be in place watching every move you make.
We can even fit you with a monitored mike, if you like.
I...
Detective, something big is going on out there, and this is our best chance to find out what.
But the meeting's in two hours, so I need your answer.
[ Gunfire ]
[ Cellphone rings ]
Reinforcements.
Castle.
Wow.
You sound like you are getting a lot of writing done.
I blame you for that.
When are you coming back?
Uh, I don't know.
A couple hours?
I have a meeting.
A... and don't ask me what it is.
Well, now I have to ask.
It...
Look, I...
I have to get going.
I should be back in time for dinner.
Maybe we can have a glass of wine together.
I will decant something amazing.
Okay.
I love you.
Bye.
[ Cellphone beeps ]
I have to tell you I don't care for Captain Fowler's hard-sell tactics.
This is a narcotics operation.
It's not your problem, so you can walk away and I'll take the heat.
Thank you, sir, but I...
I can handle this.
Then they're ready to review the plan and give you a final briefing.
Fowler:
Remember, don't move like a cop.
You're Elena.
You're intimidated by these guys.
They've been leveraging you for two months.
There will be five plainclothes officers in the lobby and more throughout the hotel.
Head to the north elevator and go to the 11th floor.
The meet is in room 1123.
Undercover officers up there will have your back.
Stay calm, memorize names and faces of whomever you meet, and you'll be out in no time.
[ Elevator bell dings ]
- Hello.
- Hi.
Which floor?
[ Sighs ] 11.
Okay.
[ Button clicks ]
Don't move a muscle.
[ Elevator bell dings ]
Elevator just got to 11.
It's empty.
She's not here.
She is not here.
Castle 6x17
- In the Belly of the Beast Original air date March 3, 2014
This is detective Kate Beckett.
If you can hear me, I've been abducted.
I'm in a white cube van, New York plates.
We've been traveling for about 20 minutes.
[ Sighs ] We've been making a lot of turns, but I think we're headed east.
Captain Fowler, if you can hear me, this is seriously ruining my dinner plans.
You promised me that you had her back.
What happened?
We were set up for a simple meet, not an orchestrated kidnapping.
The security cameras... did they get a shot of who did this?
They were disabled momentarily throughout the hotel.
What about the mike Beckett had on?
We stopped receiving audio after she got in the elevator.
The signal strength drops in enclosed spaces.
And let me guess... whoever was in room 1123 didn't know about a meeting because there never was gonna be one.
Look, we've issued a limited alert.
Limited alert?
!
We need to call in the cavalry here.
We know the drug ring tracks police radios.
Sending up a flare could make things worse.
They must have known that your girl rolled on them, or they made Beckett.
Either way, she's dead if we don't find her immediately.
[ Door opens ]
Gentlemen, we have a situation.
[ Breathing heavily ]
We've been driving for about an hour now, maybe more.
Uh, two-lane road, not a lot of traffic, um...
We're slowing down.
We've stopped.
I've got to get rid of this thing.
Man:
Get on your knees and face the wall toward the cab.
Do not move.
Don't turn around.
Time to see if you're wearing a wire.
I'm not wearing a wire.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
[ Device beeps ]
[ Slow beeping ]
[ Beeping continues ]
[ Beeps ]
Beckett:
This is detective Kate Beckett.
I'm unavailable at the moment, but please leave a message.
[ Cellphone beeps ]
Well, I know you have plans with Katherine this evening, so I'm going to make myself scarce.
Oh, very nice.
I'm off to a revival of "Brighton Beach Memoirs."
Ha.
Pray for me.
What's the matter?
I...
I can't get ahold of Beckett.
I texted her.
I left messages.
This isn't like her.
Maybe she got tied up at the precinct.
Have you tried Ryan or Esposito?
I called them both...
just go straight to voice-mail.
Just... something is not right.
[ Indistinct talking in distance ]
So, what happens now?
It's not my call.
[ Indistinct talking continues ]
Is that who we're waiting for?
They're in that room?
You sound worried.
Should I be?
What the hell makes you so special?
I'm not special.
I don't know anything.
I just move packages.
I'm not a threat to anyone.
You can just drop the act.
[ Cellphone chimes ]
[ Sighs ]
Let's go.
You're up.
[ Speaking Russian ]
[ Speaking Russian ]
You are Elena Markov?
Yes.
[ Laughs ]
It's good to finally meet you.
You can call me Mr. Jones, and this is Mr. Harden.
Hey.
I'm sorry for the lengths we go to to have a meeting, but these are the times we live in.
Uh, can I get you anything?
A drink?
No.
Thank you.
Good.
To business, then.
You should know how much we value your services,
Lazarus in particular.
Well, I do the best I can.
But always as a freelancer.
What we want to do is offer you a permanent position with our organization.
That's per week, of course.
How does that strike you?
It's very generous.
But I'm gonna need to meet Lazarus.
That's not an option.
I need to know who I'm doing business with.
It's a matter of trust.
All right.
I'll pass along the request, but you'll remain our guest here until I get an answer.
Please see miss Markov to a bedroom.
Sir, can I have a word, please?
Sure.
Would you excuse me, please?
Yes.
[ Sighs ]
- What's the problem?
- She's the problem.
She's all wrong.
[ Telephone rings ]
[ Ringing continues ]
Look, I've been watching her.
She acted like she didn't know why she was here.
[ Ringing continues ]
Esposito.
Javi, Javi, it's me.
Beckett, where are you?
We've got half the force looking for you?
Hey!
No.
Listen.
Get a trace on this phone.
Get eyes on me.
I don't know where I am or who the hell Elena Markov is, but her story is a lie.
She is more than just a low-level courier.
You never like it when we bring new people in, especially above you.
That's not what it is, not this time.
Okay, she was afraid.
All right, you keep an eye on her, and if she is wrong, then you get to do the honors, okay?
Let's go.
Gates:
Are you telling me that we can't trace Beckett's call?
It's a voice-over-Internet line fed through an anonymizer.
Okay, but can we at least narrow it down to the area where the call was made?
No, it was routed through the Ukraine, bounced all over Europe.
These guys know security.
Captain, why did Beckett tell us that Elena Markov was more than just a courier?
I have no idea.
So, there's nothing about her that you haven't told us?
Absolutely not.
Every part of her story checked out, but...
But what?
We didn't have enough time to go deep, not with things moving this fast.
We didn't even know miss Markov until yesterday.
Well, maybe you didn't know her at all.
Looks like we can fix that.
The hospital just called.
She's conscious.
Go talk to her.
Get to the bottom of this.
I'll go with you.
She knows me.
Hey, you guys have not been returning my calls.
Where's Beckett?
Mr. Castle, why don't you come into my office?
[ Indistinct talking in distance ]
[ Vehicle approaches ]
- Hurry it up!
- Quickly.
- Over here.
- Let's go.
- Come here.
Do we have any idea where she is?
Traffic-cam footage caught a white van heading away from the Widmark right when she was abducted.
We think she was in it, and we're trying to track it down.
There are reasons for hope here.
I'd love to hear them.
First of all, they didn't make her as a cop.
They think she's Elena Markov, which buys us time.
She's pretending to be Elena when she doesn't know who Elena is?
She can't keep that up forever.
Well, hopefully, she won't have to.
Once Elena tells us everything that she knows about this, it could lead us to Beckett.
Miss Markov regained consciousness about an hour ago.
She's stable, so we transferred her out of ICU.
Has she said anything yet?
Just that she's glad to be alive.
So, she's lucid?
Yes, but she's also extremely weak from her ordeal, so, please, I'd ask that you limit your time with her as much as possible.
We need answers, so we're gonna question her as long as it takes.
Room's just up here... 3410.
Ryan:
I thought you had an officer guarding her.
We do.
He must be inside with her.
Esposito:
Elena Markov, NYP... son of a bitch.
We have an officer down!
Officer down!
Elena's gone.
Either she killed him and fled...
Or someone else did and they grabbed her.
If they took Elena, that means Beckett's cover's blown.
She's as good as dead.
Beckett:
Dear Rick,
I don't know how much time I have, even to write this letter.
What I do know now is that I'm in this, and the only way I'm gonna make it out alive is to see this through.
I'm sure everyone is looking for me, and if they figure out I was here,
CSU's gonna search this house.
They're gonna look for blood, and they will find it, which will lead them to this letter.
Babe, it's your letter, and I hope you never have to read this... that I can tell you all of these things in person, but if something happens and I don't make it,
I need you to know that our partnership, our relationship is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.
You're an amazing man, and I love you with all of my heart.
Always.
Mr. Jones wants a word.
Let's go.
[ Jones sighs ]
Jones:
I've got surprising news.
Lazarus agreed to meet with you if you agree to an assignment.
What assignment?
You complete the assignment, you get the meeting.
Take it or leave it.
Deal.
What do I have to do?
What you do best.
Kill him.
Make it clean.
Harden:
We're here.
Where's here?
All you need to know is that the target's in that house.
Is he alone?
As far as I know.
Use this.
Lazarus doesn't want it to be connected to your other kills.
[ Gun clicks ]
Well, he's got to be important.
Who is he?
He's the next name on the list.
What does he do?
Why are you so curious all of a sudden?
You ever hear of recon?
I like to know what I'm walking into.
Is he a cop, is he a drug dealer, are there guns in the house?
Curiosity keeps me alive.
The guy's a civilian, a nobody.
If he's a nobody, then why are we killing him?
Because they told us to.
Look, is there...
is there a problem here?
Yeah, there's a problem.
I don't work like this.
I do my homework,
I control the variables, and this is sloppy.
You know, maybe Lazarus wanted to see how well you improvise.
You know, maybe I do, too.
Now... are you gonna kill him or what?
[ Gun cocks ]
[ Man speaking indistinctly on television ]
Who in the hell are you?
!
[ Silenced gunshots ]
[ Dog barking ]
It's done.
Show me.
What?
No.
We don't have time for this.
I said show me.
Now.
[ Barking continues ]
Like I said.
I'm done auditioning.
You tell Lazarus he wants to play games and this deal's off.
Yeah, we should get back.
Just got off with the hospital security again.
The building's locked down.
We got teams going through, but there's no sign of Elena.
And we still have no idea who this woman really is.
Fowler:
I'm afraid we do.
Security video shows her leaving her room alone, and the officer's throat was cut in the same exact manner as the murdered drug dealers... same angle, same left-handed stroke favoring the carotid.
Gates:
That's what those text messages meant about packages being delivered.
She wasn't a courier for the ring.
She was their contract killer.
A contract killer?
!
That's who Beckett is out there impersonating
- and you didn't know?
- Mr. Castle...
And now this woman is out there somewhere?
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen to Beckett when the real Elena shows up?
We're doing everything we can.
Well, it's not enough.
Hey, come on, man.
[ Cellphone rings ]
This is Gates.
What?
Where?
Potter:
She told me to get down on the floor, and then she said she was a cop and that if I wanted to live,
I had to do exactly what she said.
And then she went to the kitchen and she came back with ketchup and... and... and beet juice and... and she told me to lie as still as possible and to hold my breath.
Mr. Potter, did she say anything else about where she was, where they were keeping her?
Yeah.
She said it was some kind of a compound.
She didn't know where but that she would try to get a message out soon.
At least we know she's still alive.
Fowler:
This guy who was with her.
Did you see his face?
No.
I had my head down.
Do you have any idea why members of a drug ring would want you dead?
No.
That's not my world.
You're an attorney at Tyre, Potter, and Langston.
What kind of law do you practice?
It's mostly corporate... trust administration.
Do you do any criminal law?
No, none.
I hate this.
She's out there somewhere, has no idea how much danger she's in, and I can't help her.
No, you can't.
But this is Beckett we're talking about.
But she's also a damn good cop, so don't sell her short.
She'll figure out a way to let us know what's going on, and when she does, we'll get her out.
What if it's not in time?
So, how did it go?
The package was delivered without any issues.
Good.
Clean yourself up.
Lazarus wants to see you.
[ Sighs ]
[ Faucet knob squeaks ]
You're getting out of here... alive.
Sorry.
I really have to pee.
Do you mind?
No, it's fine.
Thank you.
[ Giggles ] Great gig, huh?
Yeah, it's amazing.
I don't know who these guys are, but they sure like to spend money.
[ Knock on door ]
Come on.
He's waiting.
This way.
You keep him in the basement?
He likes it there.
He thinks it suits him.
After you.
[ Machine whirring ]
What's the matter?
You've never seen a counting room before?
Yes.
But never to this scale.
Lazarus is a man of enormous appetites.
I'm impressed you've been able to hide this from the feds.
[ Chuckles ] You don't know the half of it.
[ Screaming in distance ]
[ Screaming continues ]
Wait here.
He's ready.
Come in.
Lazarus:
I apologize for the delay.
I had to resolve a business matter.
Of course.
I don't usually do this...
meet like this.
But for you, I'll make an exception.
Between our needs and your skill set, this could be a very profitable arrangement.
I agree.
Good.
So, now that we've met, why don't we formalize our arrangement?
You are not Elena.
What do you mean?
I know you.
No.
No, I don't think you do.
No, no, no.
I never forget a face.
Detective Beckett.
Oh, no, no, no.
She is a cop?
Homicide out of the 12th.
Last time I saw you, you tried to put me through a wall.
Accused me of murdering your mama.
And from the look on her face, she remembers me.
Don't you, detective?
Vulcan Simmons.
You're Lazarus?
Yo, guys.
It's her.
It came in from an unknown number.
But that's her badge number.
It's got to be her.
Castle: "Addr is 5."
She was trying to send an address.
Looks like she got cut off.
Run that phone number.
Find out who owns it and find out where it is.
Right.
[ Muffled shouting ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Panting ]
Let's do it without all this Kabuki theater, detective.
It's undignified.
Tell me what I want to know, and I'll give you a proper death without all this messy suffering.
[ Coughs ]
Now what was your mission and what do they know about Lazarus?
Do you want undignified?
Then wait till you see what I do to you.
You know, you're just like your mom... both playing in worlds where you don't belong.
[ Shouts ]
[ Groans ]
Your mother paid for it with her life.
So will you.
But first tell me what I want to know.
[ Panting ]
Yo.
Just got off with the carrier.
Any idea whose phone it is?
It's a pre-paid.
There's no way to identify the owner.
[ Beeps ] Hastings:
I got a hit.
The signal originated from a tower in Scarsdale.
Great.
Can you lock on the location?
No.
The message pinged off a single tower.
Without a second or third tower, there's no way to narrow it down.
Depending on signal strength, it could have originated anywhere within this 10-mile radius.
It would be easier to find a needle in a haystack.
Can you ping the GPS?
It's off, and it looks like the phone's off, as well.
I'm sorry.
I've got no other way to trace it.
That's the best I can do.
Simmons:
I know your lungs are burning.
I can feel the panic in your soul.
All you want is for this to end.
And I promise I will end it.
Just tell me what I want to know.
[ Beckett coughing ]
Simmons:
Scrub the place.
Find a patch of dirt to put her in... somewhere where she won't be found.
I love these woods.
My daddy used to take me hunting up here when I was a kid.
I spent days learning every rock, every tree, all the secret little places to hide.
Over the years, it's come in handy.
You know, I had you made from the moment you walked through the door.
I could see it in your eyes.
I thought, "no way this woman's a killer."
No.
You don't want to kill me, Harden.
You know that I'm a cop.
Yeah, I've killed cops before.
In fact, a few of them are your new neighbors.
My people will hunt you down.
They will kill you.
But we can make a deal.
You help me take down Lazarus, you can set any deal you want.
No, I'm good with the deal I got.
Thank you.
[ Branch snaps ]
Elena.
You got balls.
I'll give you that.
You're not gonna kill me?
He sent me because he owed you.
He said he wanted you to live.
Who sent you?
Who wanted me to live?
Lazarus.
Fowler:
Tactical teams raided the compound at 0600 this morning, shortly after your call.
The place was empty.
Everything's gone.
Gates:
The mansion itself is held in a trust by an offshore corporation.
It'll be months before we find out who the real owners are.
If ever.
Castle:
And what about Vulcan Simmons?
My team picked him up this morning in Washington Heights... nowhere near the compound.
Gates:
They've been questioning him all morning, but...
He had an alibi for last night.
We'll go after him, but without evidence, it will difficult to make any of your allegations stick.
Are you saying we have nothing?
[ Sighs ]
No, not nothing.
Future Forward?
Yeah, part of the money-laundering operation... whatever it was, they are funneling a lot of cash into that account.
See what happens when I leave you alone?
Babe, I wasn't alone.
When they were interrogating me, the only thing that kept me going was thinking about you, about our future, the wedding.
You were with me the whole time.
Well, at least it's not a total loss.
Now that the police know that Vulcan Simmons is Lazarus, they'll be watching him.
He will not be able to rebuild his operation.
He's not Lazarus.
If he was, then I would be dead.
Vulcan Simmons is just a figurehead.
Someone else is behind this, someone higher up, someone who wanted me alive.
Who?
Someone bigger.
Gates:
This can't be right.
Esposito:
I'm afraid it is, sir.
Fowler:
You're saying that's what Future Forward is... a political super pac?
That's where the money was going?
Yeah, and that's a connection to Evan Potter, our would-be victim.
Potter did all the legal work to establish the super pac for a client of his...
a wealthy hedge-fund manager with significant political connections named Jason Kochler.
It would appear as if drug money were being funneled into Future Forward's accounts.
Nearly $160 million in the past several months.
It was then legally laundered, passing through an anonymous shell corp and second secret super pac.
What do you mean "legally laundered"?
- Where's that money now?
- It's gone.
Federal tax and banking laws that regulate these kind of super pacs make it impossible for us to find out where that money actually came from or went.
Well, someone must be able to tell us.
Evan Potter.
No.
He just set up the pac for Kochler.
He didn't run it.
Gates:
Then we need to bring Jason Kochler in here.
We can't.
He died of a heart attack this morning.
That's why you couldn't find the money.
Someone's using it to build a massive political war chest.
Fowler:
But who?
It's impossible to know.
Bracken:
Those of you who know me know that I've gotten where I am today by doing whatever it takes to get the job done.
That is the kind of leadership this country needs, and that is why I am forming an exploratory committee for a run for the presidency of the United States.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Reporter:
Senator Bracken, an early front runner, is rumored to have significant funding already lined up from major contributors.
Beckett:
Hiding behind Vulcan Simmons, funding his campaign with dirty money, killing whoever gets in his way, just like he did with my mom.
It's him.
And we have no way of proving it.
Maybe the feds will find something.
No.
Bracken is so well-insulated.
It's genius, actually.
He has all the campaign funds that he needs without having to compromise or be beholden to any special-interest groups.
But if it really was him, why wouldn't he just let you die in the woods?
Why would he send Elena to save you?
Because when I stopped the assassination last year,
I saved him.
And he told me that he owed me.
And now we're even.
So the next time that we see each other...
[ Smooches ]
Come to bed.
This is heaven.
This is absolute heaven.
Yeah, you mean spending the day with your future husband?
No, no.
Not that.
Not that?
No, no, no.
I mean, not only that.
It's 2:00.
I'm in my P.J.s.
We're reading the newspapers.
I never get to do this.
Because you never take any time off.
All we have to do is loaf around.
There's no work, no goals other than to waste hours on end.
Okay.
Stop describing my life.
Though there is one thing we should get done today.
We need to pick a font for our "save the date" cards.
Really?
We're gonna do that?
We don't even have a venue yet.
Yeah.
I find deadlines... inspiring.
How about this one?
No.
It's too frilly.
Agreed.
And this...
ooh, this is... far too severe.
You will save the date now.
Oh, I like that one.
You?
Mm, I'm not really feeling it, though I guess, uh, you could convince me.
I bet I could.
Yeah, I mean, you'd have to work pretty hard to win me over, but, um...
Well, I'm prepared to do just that.
Because it's clear to me that what we both need right now is a really good font.
Yes, we do.
That's so true.
Oh!
And worst timing ever.
Beckett.
Detective, how soon can you get here?
Uh, sir, I'm actually not on call today.
I'm aware of that, but something has come up, and I'm afraid it can't wait.
Well, I can get there in 20 minutes.
One more thing... come alone.
Do not bring Mr. Castle.
Uh...
Yes, sir.
So, what's Gates up to aside from sabotaging our domestic bliss?
I don't know.
- But I got to go.
- Huh.
I don't suppose I could convince you to just...
- No.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.
I'm fine.
I'll just, uh...
I'll do some writing...
If I can... manage to focus.
Yo, Beckett.
I thought you were off.
Was that the deputy commissioner?
Yeah, there's been more brass through here than a marching band.
What's going on?
It's all need-to-know, and we didn't make the list.
But whatever's happening is going down in that conference room.
Detective.
- Yep.
- Yep.
- Beckett.
- Sorry.
Yeah.
Detective Beckett,
Captain Fowler, head of narcotics.
Thank you for coming, detective.
Mm-hmm.
What I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room.
Yeah.
Understood, sir.
These six victims had their throats cut.
They were mid-to upper-level drug dealers.
Two were teenagers.
They were all murdered in the past few months when a new drug ring muscled in and took over most of the uptown heroin and cocaine trade.
A new drug ring?
Well, who are they?
The commissioner asked me to find that out and shut them down, but they're invisible, these guys.
They don't use banks, so we can't follow the money.
They make sure their street dealers never meet their suppliers.
So, when you bust a dealer, he doesn't know who he's working for.
Exactly.
So, three months in, and we have nothing.
We don't even know any of their names, except for Lazarus.
- And who is Lazarus?
- The leader.
Not his real name, of course.
Then yesterday, a phone intercept led us to this woman...
Elena Markov.
She copped to being a low-level drug courier in the ring.
Born in Russia, she came here as a mail-order bride, divorced her husband.
She learned to speak English better than we do and was getting by as a freelance translator.
She'd never been in trouble before, at least not till now.
I needed work, and I heard about a way to make money.
All I had to do was call a number, so I did.
But once I got in, I couldn't get out.
Who was your contact in the ring?
I didn't have one.
I would get a text with a time and a place, and I'd get a package with a note hidden inside that would tell me where to take it.
Did you ever, um, see anyone?
Did you ever interact with anyone?
No.
Everything was anonymous.
I don't know them.
They don't know me.
It... it needs to stay that way.
Look, I...
I just want to get my life back.
It looked like another dead end.
Then this morning, Elena got another text from the ring.
This time, they wanted to meet her to offer her a promotion.
Which would give you guys a chance to get eyes on someone.
It's the break we've been waiting for.
So, we leveraged Elena to take the meet, but she tried to commit suicide.
She's in intensive care under police guard.
Sir, I'm sorry to hear about that, but what does this all have to do with me?
The meeting is set for 5:00 today, and a chance like this is not gonna come back around, so we combed the NYPD database for someone about Elena's age and appearance who speaks fluent Russian,
in case that's relevant.
Only one name came up... yours.
You want me to go in her place?
To the Widmark.
Show up, meet your contact, and leave.
In and out.
What if they found out that you turned Elena and that this is all a trap?
Then they wouldn't be meeting at the Widmark Hotel.
We were very careful.
No one knows she's made contact with us.
Still, there's the risk that they could see detective Beckett and realize that she's not Elena.
In the text, they asked Elena to wear a red scarf, which tells us that they don't know her on sight.
My people will be in place watching every move you make.
We can even fit you with a monitored mike, if you like.
I...
Detective, something big is going on out there, and this is our best chance to find out what.
But the meeting's in two hours, so I need your answer.
Reinforcements.
Castle.
Wow.
You sound like you are getting a lot of writing done.
I blame you for that.
When are you coming back?
Uh, I don't know.
A couple hours?
I have a meeting.
A... and don't ask me what it is.
Well, now I have to ask.
It...
Look, I...
I have to get going.
I should be back in time for dinner.
Maybe we can have a glass of wine together.
I will decant something amazing.
Okay.
I love you.
Bye.
I have to tell you I don't care for Captain Fowler's hard-sell tactics.
This is a narcotics operation.
It's not your problem, so you can walk away and I'll take the heat.
Thank you, sir, but I...
I can handle this.
Then they're ready to review the plan and give you a final briefing.
Remember, don't move like a cop.
You're Elena.
You're intimidated by these guys.
They've been leveraging you for two months.
There will be five plainclothes officers in the lobby and more throughout the hotel.
Head to the north elevator and go to the 11th floor.
The meet is in room 1123.
Undercover officers up there will have your back.
Stay calm, memorize names and faces of whomever you meet, and you'll be out in no time.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Which floor?
11.
Okay.
Don't move a muscle.
Elevator just got to 11.
It's empty.
She's not here.
She is not here.
Castle 6x17
- In the Belly of the Beast Original air date March 3, 2014
This is detective Kate Beckett.
If you can hear me, I've been abducted.
I'm in a white cube van, New York plates.
We've been traveling for about 20 minutes.
We've been making a lot of turns, but I think we're headed east.
Captain Fowler, if you can hear me, this is seriously ruining my dinner plans.
You promised me that you had her back.
What happened?
We were set up for a simple meet, not an orchestrated kidnapping.
The security cameras... did they get a shot of who did this?
They were disabled momentarily throughout the hotel.
What about the mike Beckett had on?
We stopped receiving audio after she got in the elevator.
The signal strength drops in enclosed spaces.
And let me guess... whoever was in room 1123 didn't know about a meeting because there never was gonna be one.
Look, we've issued a limited alert.
Limited alert?
!
We need to call in the cavalry here.
We know the drug ring tracks police radios.
Sending up a flare could make things worse.
They must have known that your girl rolled on them, or they made Beckett.
Either way, she's dead if we don't find her immediately.
Gentlemen, we have a situation.
We've been driving for about an hour now, maybe more.
Uh, two-lane road, not a lot of traffic, um...
We're slowing down.
We've stopped.
I've got to get rid of this thing.
Get on your knees and face the wall toward the cab.
Do not move.
Don't turn around.
Time to see if you're wearing a wire.
I'm not wearing a wire.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
This is detective Kate Beckett.
I'm unavailable at the moment, but please leave a message.
Well, I know you have plans with Katherine this evening, so I'm going to make myself scarce.
Oh, very nice.
I'm off to a revival of "Brighton Beach Memoirs."
Ha.
Pray for me.
What's the matter?
I...
I can't get ahold of Beckett.
I texted her.
I left messages.
This isn't like her.
Maybe she got tied up at the precinct.
Have you tried Ryan or Esposito?
I called them both...
just go straight to voice-mail.
Just... something is not right.
So, what happens now?
It's not my call.
Is that who we're waiting for?
They're in that room?
You sound worried.
Should I be?
What the hell makes you so special?
I'm not special.
I don't know anything.
I just move packages.
I'm not a threat to anyone.
You can just drop the act.
Let's go.
You're up.
You are Elena Markov?
Yes.
It's good to finally meet you.
You can call me Mr. Jones, and this is Mr. Harden.
Hey.
I'm sorry for the lengths we go to to have a meeting, but these are the times we live in.
Uh, can I get you anything?
A drink?
No.
Thank you.
Good.
To business, then.
You should know how much we value your services,
Lazarus in particular.
Well, I do the best I can.
But always as a freelancer.
What we want to do is offer you a permanent position with our organization.
That's per week, of course.
How does that strike you?
It's very generous.
But I'm gonna need to meet Lazarus.
That's not an option.
I need to know who I'm doing business with.
It's a matter of trust.
All right.
I'll pass along the request, but you'll remain our guest here until I get an answer.
Please see Miss Markov to a bedroom.
Sir, can I have a word, please?
Sure.
Would you excuse me, please?
Yes.
- What's the problem?
- She's the problem.
She's all wrong.
Look, I've been watching her.
She acted like she didn't know why she was here.
Esposito.
Javi, Javi, it's me.
Beckett, where are you?
We've got half the force looking for you?
Hey!
No.
Listen.
Get a trace on this phone.
Get eyes on me.
I don't know where I am or who the hell Elena Markov is, but her story is a lie.
She is more than just a low-level courier.
You never like it when we bring new people in, especially above you.
That's not what it is, not this time.
Okay, she was afraid.
All right, you keep an eye on her, and if she is wrong, then you get to do the honors, okay?
Let's go.
Are you telling me that we can't trace Beckett's call?
It's a voice-over-Internet line fed through an anonymizer.
Okay, but can we at least narrow it down to the area where the call was made?
No, it was routed through the Ukraine, bounced all over Europe.
These guys know security.
Captain, why did Beckett tell us that Elena Markov was more than just a courier?
I have no idea.
So, there's nothing about her that you haven't told us?
Absolutely not.
Every part of her story checked out, but...
But what?
We didn't have enough time to go deep, not with things moving this fast.
We didn't even know miss Markov until yesterday.
Well, maybe you didn't know her at all.
Looks like we can fix that.
The hospital just called.
She's conscious.
Go talk to her.
Get to the bottom of this.
I'll go with you.
She knows me.
Hey, you guys have not been returning my calls.
Where's Beckett?
Mr. Castle, why don't you come into my office?
- Hurry it up!
- Quickly.
- Over here.
- Let's go.
- Come here.
Do we have any idea where she is?
Traffic-cam footage caught a white van heading away from the Widmark right when she was abducted.
We think she was in it, and we're trying to track it down.
There are reasons for hope here.
I'd love to hear them.
First of all, they didn't make her as a cop.
They think she's Elena Markov, which buys us time.
She's pretending to be Elena when she doesn't know who Elena is?
She can't keep that up forever.
Well, hopefully, she won't have to.
Once Elena tells us everything that she knows about this, it could lead us to Beckett.
Miss Markov regained consciousness about an hour ago.
She's stable, so we transferred her out of ICU.
Has she said anything yet?
Just that she's glad to be alive.
So, she's lucid?
Yes, but she's also extremely weak from her ordeal, so, please, I'd ask that you limit your time with her as much as possible.
We need answers, so we're gonna question her as long as it takes.
Room's just up here... 3410.
I thought you had an officer guarding her.
We do.
He must be inside with her.
Elena Markov, NYP... son of a bitch.
We have an officer down!
Officer down!
Elena's gone.
Either she killed him and fled...
Or someone else did and they grabbed her.
If they took Elena, that means Beckett's cover's blown.
She's as good as dead.
Dear Rick,
I don't know how much time I have, even to write this letter.
What I do know now is that I'm in this, and the only way I'm gonna make it out alive is to see this through.
I'm sure everyone is looking for me, and if they figure out I was here,
CSU's gonna search this house.
They're gonna look for blood, and they will find it, which will lead them to this letter.
Babe, it's your letter, and I hope you never have to read this... that I can tell you all of these things in person, but if something happens and I don't make it,
I need you to know that our partnership, our relationship is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.
You're an amazing man, and I love you with all of my heart.
Always.
Mr. Jones wants a word.
Let's go.
I've got surprising news.
Lazarus agreed to meet with you if you agree to an assignment.
What assignment?
You complete the assignment, you get the meeting.
Take it or leave it.
Deal.
What do I have to do?
What you do best.
Kill him.
Make it clean.
We're here.
Where's here?
All you need to know is that the target's in that house.
Is he alone?
As far as I know.
Use this.
Lazarus doesn't want it to be connected to your other kills.
Well, he's got to be important.
Who is he?
He's the next name on the list.
What does he do?
Why are you so curious all of a sudden?
You ever hear of recon?
I like to know what I'm walking into.
Is he a cop, is he a drug dealer, are there guns in the house?
Curiosity keeps me alive.
The guy's a civilian, a nobody.
If he's a nobody, then why are we killing him?
Because they told us to.
Look, is there...
is there a problem here?
Yeah, there's a problem.
I don't work like this.
I do my homework,
I control the variables, and this is sloppy.
You know, maybe Lazarus wanted to see how well you improvise.
You know, maybe I do, too.
Now... are you gonna kill him or what?
Who in the hell are you?
!
It's done.
Show me.
What?
No.
We don't have time for this.
I said show me.
Now.
Like I said.
I'm done auditioning.
You tell Lazarus he wants to play games and this deal's off.
Yeah, we should get back.
Just got off with the hospital security again.
The building's locked down.
We got teams going through, but there's no sign of Elena.
And we still have no idea who this woman really is.
I'm afraid we do.
Security video shows her leaving her room alone, and the officer's throat was cut in the same exact manner as the murdered drug dealers... same angle, same left-handed stroke favoring the carotid.
That's what those text messages meant about packages being delivered.
She wasn't a courier for the ring.
She was their contract killer.
A contract killer?
!
That's who Beckett is out there impersonating
- and you didn't know?
- Mr. Castle...
And now this woman is out there somewhere?
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen to Beckett when the real Elena shows up?
We're doing everything we can.
Well, it's not enough.
Hey, come on, man.
This is Gates.
What?
Where?
She told me to get down on the floor, and then she said she was a cop and that if I wanted to live,
I had to do exactly what she said.
And then she went to the kitchen and she came back with ketchup and... and... and beet juice and... and she told me to lie as still as possible and to hold my breath.
Mr. Potter, did she say anything else about where she was, where they were keeping her?
Yeah.
She said it was some kind of a compound.
She didn't know where but that she would try to get a message out soon.
At least we know she's still alive.
This guy who was with her.
Did you see his face?
No.
I had my head down.
Do you have any idea why members of a drug ring would want you dead?
No.
That's not my world.
You're an attorney at Tyre, Potter, and Langston.
What kind of law do you practice?
It's mostly corporate... trust administration.
Do you do any criminal law?
No, none.
I hate this.
She's out there somewhere, has no idea how much danger she's in, and I can't help her.
No, you can't.
But this is Beckett we're talking about.
But she's also a damn good cop, so don't sell her short.
She'll figure out a way to let us know what's going on, and when she does, we'll get her out.
What if it's not in time?
So, how did it go?
The package was delivered without any issues.
Good.
Clean yourself up.
Lazarus wants to see you.
You're getting out of here... alive.
Sorry.
I really have to pee.
Do you mind?
No, it's fine.
Thank you.
Great gig, huh?
Yeah, it's amazing.
I don't know who these guys are, but they sure like to spend money.
Come on.
He's waiting.
This way.
You keep him in the basement?
He likes it there.
He thinks it suits him.
After you.
What's the matter?
You've never seen a counting room before?
Yes.
But never to this scale.
Lazarus is a man of enormous appetites.
I'm impressed you've been able to hide this from the feds.
You don't know the half of it.
Wait here.
He's ready.
Come in.
I apologize for the delay.
I had to resolve a business matter.
Of course.
I don't usually do this...
meet like this.
But for you, I'll make an exception.
Between our needs and your skill set, this could be a very profitable arrangement.
I agree.
Good.
So, now that we've met, why don't we formalize our arrangement?
You are not Elena.
What do you mean?
I know you.
No.
No, I don't think you do.
No, no, no.
I never forget a face.
Detective Beckett.
Oh, no, no, no.
She is a cop?
Homicide out of the 12th.
Last time I saw you, you tried to put me through a wall.
Accused me of murdering your mama.
And from the look on her face, she remembers me.
Don't you, detective?
Vulcan Simmons.
You're Lazarus?
Yo, guys.
It's her.
It came in from an unknown number.
But that's her badge number.
It's got to be her.
"Addr is 5."
She was trying to send an address.
Looks like she got cut off.
Run that phone number.
Find out who owns it and find out where it is.
Right.
Let's do it without all this Kabuki theater, detective.
It's undignified.
Tell me what I want to know, and I'll give you a proper death without all this messy suffering.
Now what was your mission and what do they know about Lazarus?
Do you want undignified?
Then wait till you see what I do to you.
You know, you're just like your mom... both playing in worlds where you don't belong.
Your mother paid for it with her life.
So will you.
But first tell me what I want to know.
Yo.
Just got off with the carrier.
Any idea whose phone it is?
It's a pre-paid.
There's no way to identify the owner.
I got a hit.
The signal originated from a tower in Scarsdale.
Great.
Can you lock on the location?
No.
The message pinged off a single tower.
Without a second or third tower, there's no way to narrow it down.
Depending on signal strength, it could have originated anywhere within this 10-mile radius.
It would be easier to find a needle in a haystack.
Can you ping the GPS?
It's off, and it looks like the phone's off, as well.
I'm sorry.
I've got no other way to trace it.
That's the best I can do.
I know your lungs are burning.
I can feel the panic in your soul.
All you want is for this to end.
And I promise I will end it.
Just tell me what I want to know.
Scrub the place.
Find a patch of dirt to put her in... somewhere where she won't be found.
I love these woods.
My daddy used to take me hunting up here when I was a kid.
I spent days learning every rock, every tree, all the secret little places to hide.
Over the years, it's come in handy.
You know, I had you made from the moment you walked through the door.
I could see it in your eyes.
I thought, "no way this woman's a killer."
No.
You don't want to kill me, Harden.
You know that I'm a cop.
Yeah, I've killed cops before.
In fact, a few of them are your new neighbors.
My people will hunt you down.
They will kill you.
But we can make a deal.
You help me take down Lazarus, you can set any deal you want.
No, I'm good with the deal I got.
Thank you.
Elena.
You got balls.
I'll give you that.
You're not gonna kill me?
He sent me because he owed you.
He said he wanted you to live.
Who sent you?
Who wanted me to live?
Lazarus.
Tactical teams raided the compound at 0600 this morning, shortly after your call.
The place was empty.
Everything's gone.
The mansion itself is held in a trust by an offshore corporation.
It'll be months before we find out who the real owners are.
If ever.
And what about Vulcan Simmons?
My team picked him up this morning in Washington Heights... nowhere near the compound.
They've been questioning him all morning, but...
He had an alibi for last night.
We'll go after him, but without evidence, it will difficult to make any of your allegations stick.
Are you saying we have nothing?
No, not nothing.
Future Forward?
Yeah, part of the money-laundering operation... whatever it was, they are funneling a lot of cash into that account.
See what happens when I leave you alone?
Babe, I wasn't alone.
When they were interrogating me, the only thing that kept me going was thinking about you, about our future, the wedding.
You were with me the whole time.
Well, at least it's not a total loss.
Now that the police know that Vulcan Simmons is Lazarus, they'll be watching him.
He will not be able to rebuild his operation.
He's not Lazarus.
If he was, then I would be dead.
Vulcan Simmons is just a figurehead.
Someone else is behind this, someone higher up, someone who wanted me alive.
Who?
Someone bigger.
This can't be right.
I'm afraid it is, sir.
You're saying that's what Future Forward is... a political super pac?
That's where the money was going?
Yeah, and that's a connection to Evan Potter, our would-be victim.
Potter did all the legal work to establish the super pac for a client of his...
a wealthy hedge-fund manager with significant political connections named Jason Kochler.
It would appear as if drug money were being funneled into Future Forward's accounts.
Nearly $160 million in the past several months.
It was then legally laundered, passing through an anonymous shell corp and second secret super pac.
What do you mean "legally laundered"?
- Where's that money now?
- It's gone.
Federal tax and banking laws that regulate these kind of super pacs make it impossible for us to find out where that money actually came from or went.
Well, someone must be able to tell us.
Evan Potter.
No.
He just set up the pac for Kochler.
He didn't run it.
Then we need to bring Jason Kochler in here.
We can't.
He died of a heart attack this morning.
That's why you couldn't find the money.
Someone's using it to build a massive political war chest.
But who?
It's impossible to know.
Those of you who know me know that I've gotten where I am today by doing whatever it takes to get the job done.
That is the kind of leadership this country needs, and that is why I am forming an exploratory committee for a run for the presidency of the United States.
Senator Bracken, an early front runner, is rumored to have significant funding already lined up from major contributors.
Hiding behind Vulcan Simmons, funding his campaign with dirty money, killing whoever gets in his way, just like he did with my mom.
It's him.
And we have no way of proving it.
Maybe the feds will find something.
No.
Bracken is so well-insulated.
It's genius, actually.
He has all the campaign funds that he needs without having to compromise or be beholden to any special-interest groups.
But if it really was him, why wouldn't he just let you die in the woods?
Why would he send Elena to save you?
Because when I stopped the assassination last year,
I saved him.
And he told me that he owed me.
And now we're even.
So the next time that we see each other...
Come to bed.
This is heaven.
This is absolute heaven.
Yeah, you mean spending the day with your future husband?
No, no.
Not that.
Not that?
No, no, no.
I mean, not only that.
It's 2:00.
I'm in my P.J.s.
We're reading the newspapers.
I never get to do this.
Because you never take any time off.
All we have to do is loaf around.
There's no work, no goals other than to waste hours on end.
Okay.
Stop describing my life.
Though there is one thing we should get done today.
We need to pick a font for our "save the date" cards.
Really?
We're gonna do that?
We don't even have a venue yet.
Yeah.
I find deadlines... inspiring.
How about this one?
No.
It's too frilly.
Agreed.
And this...
ooh, this is... far too severe.
You will save the date now.
Oh, I like that one.
You?
Mm, I'm not really feeling it, though I guess, uh, you could convince me.
I bet I could.
Yeah, I mean, you'd have to work pretty hard to win me over, but, um...
Well, I'm prepared to do just that.
Because it's clear to me that what we both need right now is a really good font.
Yes, we do.
That's so true.
Oh!
And worst timing ever.
Beckett.
Detective, how soon can you get here?
Uh, sir, I'm actually not on call today.
I'm aware of that, but something has come up, and I'm afraid it can't wait.
Well, I can get there in 20 minutes.
One more thing... come alone.
Do not bring Mr. Castle.
Uh...
Yes, sir.
So, what's Gates up to aside from sabotaging our domestic bliss?
I don't know.
- But I got to go.
- Huh.
I don't suppose I could convince you to just...
- No.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.
I'm fine.
I'll just, uh...
I'll do some writing...
If I can... manage to focus.
Yo, Beckett.
I thought you were off.
Was that the deputy commissioner?
Yeah, there's been more brass through here than a marching band.
What's going on?
It's all need-to-know, and we didn't make the list.
But whatever's happening is going down in that conference room.
Detective.
- Yep.
- Yep.
- Beckett.
- Sorry.
Yeah.
Detective Beckett,
Captain Fowler, head of narcotics.
Thank you for coming, detective.
Mm-hmm.
What I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room.
Yeah.
Understood, sir.
These six victims had their throats cut.
They were mid-to upper-level drug dealers.
Two were teenagers.
They were all murdered in the past few months when a new drug ring muscled in and took over most of the uptown heroin and cocaine trade.
A new drug ring?
Well, who are they?
The commissioner asked me to find that out and shut them down, but they're invisible, these guys.
They don't use banks, so we can't follow the money.
They make sure their street dealers never meet their suppliers.
So, when you bust a dealer, he doesn't know who he's working for.
Exactly.
So, three months in, and we have nothing.
We don't even know any of their names, except for Lazarus.
- And who is Lazarus?
- The leader.
Not his real name, of course.
Then yesterday, a phone intercept led us to this woman...
Elena Markov.
She copped to being a low-level drug courier in the ring.
Born in Russia, she came here as a mail-order bride, divorced her husband.
She learned to speak English better than we do and was getting by as a freelance translator.
She'd never been in trouble before, at least not till now.
I needed work, and I heard about a way to make money.
All I had to do was call a number, so I did.
But once I got in, I couldn't get out.
Who was your contact in the ring?
I didn't have one.
I would get a text with a time and a place, and I'd get a package with a note hidden inside that would tell me where to take it.
Did you ever, um, see anyone?
Did you ever interact with anyone?
No.
Everything was anonymous.
I don't know them.
They don't know me.
It... it needs to stay that way.
Look, I...
I just want to get my life back.
It looked like another dead end.
Then this morning, Elena got another text from the ring.
This time, they wanted to meet her to offer her a promotion.
Which would give you guys a chance to get eyes on someone.
It's the break we've been waiting for.
So, we leveraged Elena to take the meet, but she tried to commit suicide.
She's in intensive care under police guard.
Sir, I'm sorry to hear about that, but what does this all have to do with me?
The meeting is set for 5:00 today, and a chance like this is not gonna come back around, so we combed the NYPD database for someone about Elena's age and appearance who speaks fluent Russian,
in case that's relevant.
Only one name came up... yours.
You want me to go in her place?
To the Widmark.
Show up, meet your contact, and leave.
In and out.
What if they found out that you turned Elena and that this is all a trap?
Then they wouldn't be meeting at the Widmark Hotel.
We were very careful.
No one knows she's made contact with us.
Still, there's the risk that they could see detective Beckett and realize that she's not Elena.
In the text, they asked Elena to wear a red scarf, which tells us that they don't know her on sight.
My people will be in place watching every move you make.
We can even fit you with a monitored mike, if you like.
I...
Detective, something big is going on out there, and this is our best chance to find out what.
But the meeting's in two hours, so I need your answer.
Reinforcements.
Castle.
Wow.
You sound like you are getting a lot of writing done.
I blame you for that.
When are you coming back?
Uh, I don't know.
A couple hours?
I have a meeting.
A... and don't ask me what it is.
Well, now I have to ask.
It...
Look, I...
I have to get going.
I should be back in time for dinner.
Maybe we can have a glass of wine together.
I will decant something amazing.
Okay.
I love you.
Bye.
I have to tell you I don't care for Captain Fowler's hard-sell tactics.
This is a narcotics operation.
It's not your problem, so you can walk away and I'll take the heat.
Thank you, sir, but I...
I can handle this.
Then they're ready to review the plan and give you a final briefing.
Remember, don't move like a cop.
You're Elena.
You're intimidated by these guys.
They've been leveraging you for two months.
There will be five plainclothes officers in the lobby and more throughout the hotel.
Head to the north elevator and go to the 11th floor.
The meet is in room 1123.
Undercover officers up there will have your back.
Stay calm, memorize names and faces of whomever you meet, and you'll be out in no time.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Which floor?
11.
Okay.
Don't move a muscle.
Elevator just got to 11.
It's empty.
She's not here.
She is not here.
Castle 6x17
- In the Belly of the Beast Original air date March 3, 2014
This is detective Kate Beckett.
If you can hear me, I've been abducted.
I'm in a white cube van, New York plates.
We've been traveling for about 20 minutes.
We've been making a lot of turns, but I think we're headed east.
Captain Fowler, if you can hear me, this is seriously ruining my dinner plans.
You promised me that you had her back.
What happened?
We were set up for a simple meet, not an orchestrated kidnapping.
The security cameras... did they get a shot of who did this?
They were disabled momentarily throughout the hotel.
What about the mike Beckett had on?
We stopped receiving audio after she got in the elevator.
The signal strength drops in enclosed spaces.
And let me guess... whoever was in room 1123 didn't know about a meeting because there never was gonna be one.
Look, we've issued a limited alert.
Limited alert?
!
We need to call in the cavalry here.
We know the drug ring tracks police radios.
Sending up a flare could make things worse.
They must have known that your girl rolled on them, or they made Beckett.
Either way, she's dead if we don't find her immediately.
Gentlemen, we have a situation.
We've been driving for about an hour now, maybe more.
Uh, two-lane road, not a lot of traffic, um...
We're slowing down.
We've stopped.
I've got to get rid of this thing.
Get on your knees and face the wall toward the cab.
Do not move.
Don't turn around.
Time to see if you're wearing a wire.
I'm not wearing a wire.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
This is detective Kate Beckett.
I'm unavailable at the moment, but please leave a message.
Well, I know you have plans with Katherine this evening, so I'm going to make myself scarce.
Oh, very nice.
I'm off to a revival of "Brighton Beach Memoirs."
Ha.
Pray for me.
What's the matter?
I...
I can't get ahold of Beckett.
I texted her.
I left messages.
This isn't like her.
Maybe she got tied up at the precinct.
Have you tried Ryan or Esposito?
I called them both...
just go straight to voice-mail.
Just... something is not right.
So, what happens now?
It's not my call.
Is that who we're waiting for?
They're in that room?
You sound worried.
Should I be?
What the hell makes you so special?
I'm not special.
I don't know anything.
I just move packages.
I'm not a threat to anyone.
You can just drop the act.
Let's go.
You're up.
You are Elena Markov?
Yes.
It's good to finally meet you.
You can call me Mr. Jones, and this is Mr. Harden.
Hey.
I'm sorry for the lengths we go to to have a meeting, but these are the times we live in.
Uh, can I get you anything?
A drink?
No.
Thank you.
Good.
To business, then.
You should know how much we value your services,
Lazarus in particular.
Well, I do the best I can.
But always as a freelancer.
What we want to do is offer you a permanent position with our organization.
That's per week, of course.
How does that strike you?
It's very generous.
But I'm gonna need to meet Lazarus.
That's not an option.
I need to know who I'm doing business with.
It's a matter of trust.
All right.
I'll pass along the request, but you'll remain our guest here until I get an answer.
Please see miss Markov to a bedroom.
Sir, can I have a word, please?
Sure.
Would you excuse me, please?
Yes.
- What's the problem?
- She's the problem.
She's all wrong.
Look, I've been watching her.
She acted like she didn't know why she was here.
Esposito.
Javi, Javi, it's me.
Beckett, where are you?
We've got half the force looking for you?
Hey!
No.
Listen.
Get a trace on this phone.
Get eyes on me.
I don't know where I am or who the hell Elena Markov is, but her story is a lie.
She is more than just a low-level courier.
You never like it when we bring new people in, especially above you.
That's not what it is, not this time.
Okay, she was afraid.
All right, you keep an eye on her, and if she is wrong, then you get to do the honors, okay?
Let's go.
Are you telling me that we can't trace Beckett's call?
It's a voice-over-Internet line fed through an anonymizer.
Okay, but can we at least narrow it down to the area where the call was made?
No, it was routed through the Ukraine, bounced all over Europe.
These guys know security.
Captain, why did Beckett tell us that Elena Markov was more than just a courier?
I have no idea.
So, there's nothing about her that you haven't told us?
Absolutely not.
Every part of her story checked out, but...
But what?
We didn't have enough time to go deep, not with things moving this fast.
We didn't even know miss Markov until yesterday.
Well, maybe you didn't know her at all.
Looks like we can fix that.
The hospital just called.
She's conscious.
Go talk to her.
Get to the bottom of this.
I'll go with you.
She knows me.
Hey, you guys have not been returning my calls.
Where's Beckett?
Mr. Castle, why don't you come into my office?
- Hurry it up!
- Quickly.
- Over here.
- Let's go.
- Come here.
Do we have any idea where she is?
Traffic-cam footage caught a white van heading away from the Widmark right when she was abducted.
We think she was in it, and we're trying to track it down.
There are reasons for hope here.
I'd love to hear them.
First of all, they didn't make her as a cop.
They think she's Elena Markov, which buys us time.
She's pretending to be Elena when she doesn't know who Elena is?
She can't keep that up forever.
Well, hopefully, she won't have to.
Once Elena tells us everything that she knows about this, it could lead us to Beckett.
Miss Markov regained consciousness about an hour ago.
She's stable, so we transferred her out of ICU.
Has she said anything yet?
Just that she's glad to be alive.
So, she's lucid?
Yes, but she's also extremely weak from her ordeal, so, please, I'd ask that you limit your time with her as much as possible.
We need answers, so we're gonna question her as long as it takes.
Room's just up here... 3410.
I thought you had an officer guarding her.
We do.
He must be inside with her.
Elena Markov, NYP... son of a bitch.
We have an officer down!
Officer down!
Elena's gone.
Either she killed him and fled...
Or someone else did and they grabbed her.
If they took Elena, that means Beckett's cover's blown.
She's as good as dead.
Dear Rick,
I don't know how much time I have, even to write this letter.
What I do know now is that I'm in this, and the only way I'm gonna make it out alive is to see this through.
I'm sure everyone is looking for me, and if they figure out I was here,
CSU's gonna search this house.
They're gonna look for blood, and they will find it, which will lead them to this letter.
Babe, it's your letter, and I hope you never have to read this... that I can tell you all of these things in person, but if something happens and I don't make it,
I need you to know that our partnership, our relationship is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.
You're an amazing man, and I love you with all of my heart.
Always.
Mr. Jones wants a word.
Let's go.
I've got surprising news.
Lazarus agreed to meet with you if you agree to an assignment.
What assignment?
You complete the assignment, you get the meeting.
Take it or leave it.
Deal.
What do I have to do?
What you do best.
Kill him.
Make it clean.
We're here.
Where's here?
All you need to know is that the target's in that house.
Is he alone?
As far as I know.
Use this.
Lazarus doesn't want it to be connected to your other kills.
Well, he's got to be important.
Who is he?
He's the next name on the list.
What does he do?
Why are you so curious all of a sudden?
You ever hear of recon?
I like to know what I'm walking into.
Is he a cop, is he a drug dealer, are there guns in the house?
Curiosity keeps me alive.
The guy's a civilian, a nobody.
If he's a nobody, then why are we killing him?
Because they told us to.
Look, is there...
is there a problem here?
Yeah, there's a problem.
I don't work like this.
I do my homework,
I control the variables, and this is sloppy.
You know, maybe Lazarus wanted to see how well you improvise.
You know, maybe I do, too.
Now... are you gonna kill him or what?
Who in the hell are you?
!
It's done.
Show me.
What?
No.
We don't have time for this.
I said show me.
Now.
Like I said.
I'm done auditioning.
You tell Lazarus he wants to play games and this deal's off.
Yeah, we should get back.
Just got off with the hospital security again.
The building's locked down.
We got teams going through, but there's no sign of Elena.
And we still have no idea who this woman really is.
I'm afraid we do.
Security video shows her leaving her room alone, and the officer's throat was cut in the same exact manner as the murdered drug dealers... same angle, same left-handed stroke favoring the carotid.
That's what those text messages meant about packages being delivered.
She wasn't a courier for the ring.
She was their contract killer.
A contract killer?
!
That's who Beckett is out there impersonating
- and you didn't know?
- Mr. Castle...
And now this woman is out there somewhere?
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen to Beckett when the real Elena shows up?
We're doing everything we can.
Well, it's not enough.
Hey, come on, man.
This is Gates.
What?
Where?
She told me to get down on the floor, and then she said she was a cop and that if I wanted to live,
I had to do exactly what she said.
And then she went to the kitchen and she came back with ketchup and... and... and beet juice and... and she told me to lie as still as possible and to hold my breath.
Mr. Potter, did she say anything else about where she was, where they were keeping her?
Yeah.
She said it was some kind of a compound.
She didn't know where but that she would try to get a message out soon.
At least we know she's still alive.
This guy who was with her.
Did you see his face?
No.
I had my head down.
Do you have any idea why members of a drug ring would want you dead?
No.
That's not my world.
You're an attorney at Tyre, Potter, and Langston.
What kind of law do you practice?
It's mostly corporate... trust administration.
Do you do any criminal law?
No, none.
I hate this.
She's out there somewhere, has no idea how much danger she's in, and I can't help her.
No, you can't.
But this is Beckett we're talking about.
But she's also a damn good cop, so don't sell her short.
She'll figure out a way to let us know what's going on, and when she does, we'll get her out.
What if it's not in time?
So, how did it go?
The package was delivered without any issues.
Good.
Clean yourself up.
Lazarus wants to see you.
You're getting out of here... alive.
Sorry.
I really have to pee.
Do you mind?
No, it's fine.
Thank you.
Great gig, huh?
Yeah, it's amazing.
I don't know who these guys are, but they sure like to spend money.
Come on.
He's waiting.
This way.
You keep him in the basement?
He likes it there.
He thinks it suits him.
After you.
What's the matter?
You've never seen a counting room before?
Yes.
But never to this scale.
Lazarus is a man of enormous appetites.
I'm impressed you've been able to hide this from the feds.
You don't know the half of it.
Wait here.
He's ready.
Come in.
I apologize for the delay.
I had to resolve a business matter.
Of course.
I don't usually do this...
meet like this.
But for you, I'll make an exception.
Between our needs and your skill set, this could be a very profitable arrangement.
I agree.
Good.
So, now that we've met, why don't we formalize our arrangement?
You are not Elena.
What do you mean?
I know you.
No.
No, I don't think you do.
No, no, no.
I never forget a face.
Detective Beckett.
Oh, no, no, no.
She is a cop?
Homicide out of the 12th.
Last time I saw you, you tried to put me through a wall.
Accused me of murdering your mama.
And from the look on her face, she remembers me.
Don't you, detective?
Vulcan Simmons.
You're Lazarus?
Yo, guys.
It's her.
It came in from an unknown number.
But that's her badge number.
It's got to be her.
"Addr is 5."
She was trying to send an address.
Looks like she got cut off.
Run that phone number.
Find out who owns it and find out where it is.
Right.
Let's do it without all this Kabuki theater, detective.
It's undignified.
Tell me what I want to know, and I'll give you a proper death without all this messy suffering.
Now what was your mission and what do they know about Lazarus?
Do you want undignified?
Then wait till you see what I do to you.
You know, you're just like your mom... both playing in worlds where you don't belong.
Your mother paid for it with her life.
So will you.
But first tell me what I want to know.
Yo.
Just got off with the carrier.
Any idea whose phone it is?
It's a pre-paid.
There's no way to identify the owner.
I got a hit.
The signal originated from a tower in Scarsdale.
Great.
Can you lock on the location?
No.
The message pinged off a single tower.
Without a second or third tower, there's no way to narrow it down.
Depending on signal strength, it could have originated anywhere within this 10-mile radius.
It would be easier to find a needle in a haystack.
Can you ping the GPS?
It's off, and it looks like the phone's off, as well.
I'm sorry.
I've got no other way to trace it.
That's the best I can do.
I know your lungs are burning.
I can feel the panic in your soul.
All you want is for this to end.
And I promise I will end it.
Just tell me what I want to know.
Scrub the place.
Find a patch of dirt to put her in... somewhere where she won't be found.
I love these woods.
My daddy used to take me hunting up here when I was a kid.
I spent days learning every rock, every tree, all the secret little places to hide.
Over the years, it's come in handy.
You know, I had you made from the moment you walked through the door.
I could see it in your eyes.
I thought, "no way this woman's a killer."
No.
You don't want to kill me, Harden.
You know that I'm a cop.
Yeah, I've killed cops before.
In fact, a few of them are your new neighbors.
My people will hunt you down.
They will kill you.
But we can make a deal.
You help me take down Lazarus, you can set any deal you want.
No, I'm good with the deal I got.
Thank you.
Elena.
You got balls.
I'll give you that.
You're not gonna kill me?
He sent me because he owed you.
He said he wanted you to live.
Who sent you?
Who wanted me to live?
Lazarus.
Tactical teams raided the compound at 0600 this morning, shortly after your call.
The place was empty.
Everything's gone.
The mansion itself is held in a trust by an offshore corporation.
It'll be months before we find out who the real owners are.
If ever.
And what about Vulcan Simmons?
My team picked him up this morning in Washington Heights... nowhere near the compound.
They've been questioning him all morning, but...
He had an alibi for last night.
We'll go after him, but without evidence, it will difficult to make any of your allegations stick.
Are you saying we have nothing?
No, not nothing.
Future Forward?
Yeah, part of the money-laundering operation... whatever it was, they are funneling a lot of cash into that account.
See what happens when I leave you alone?
Babe, I wasn't alone.
When they were interrogating me, the only thing that kept me going was thinking about you, about our future, the wedding.
You were with me the whole time.
Well, at least it's not a total loss.
Now that the police know that Vulcan Simmons is Lazarus, they'll be watching him.
He will not be able to rebuild his operation.
He's not Lazarus.
If he was, then I would be dead.
Vulcan Simmons is just a figurehead.
Someone else is behind this, someone higher up, someone who wanted me alive.
Who?
Someone bigger.
This can't be right.
I'm afraid it is, sir.
You're saying that's what Future Forward is... a political super pac?
That's where the money was going?
Yeah, and that's a connection to Evan Potter, our would-be victim.
Potter did all the legal work to establish the super pac for a client of his...
a wealthy hedge-fund manager with significant political connections named Jason Kochler.
It would appear as if drug money were being funneled into Future Forward's accounts.
Nearly $160 million in the past several months.
It was then legally laundered, passing through an anonymous shell corp and second secret super pac.
What do you mean "legally laundered"?
- Where's that money now?
- It's gone.
Federal tax and banking laws that regulate these kind of super pacs make it impossible for us to find out where that money actually came from or went.
Well, someone must be able to tell us.
Evan Potter.
No.
He just set up the pac for Kochler.
He didn't run it.
Then we need to bring Jason Kochler in here.
We can't.
He died of a heart attack this morning.
That's why you couldn't find the money.
Someone's using it to build a massive political war chest.
But who?
It's impossible to know.
Those of you who know me know that I've gotten where I am today by doing whatever it takes to get the job done.
That is the kind of leadership this country needs, and that is why I am forming an exploratory committee for a run for the presidency of the United States.
Senator Bracken, an early front runner, is rumored to have significant funding already lined up from major contributors.
Hiding behind Vulcan Simmons, funding his campaign with dirty money, killing whoever gets in his way, just like he did with my mom.
It's him.
And we have no way of proving it.
Maybe the feds will find something.
No.
Bracken is so well-insulated.
It's genius, actually.
He has all the campaign funds that he needs without having to compromise or be beholden to any special-interest groups.
But if it really was him, why wouldn't he just let you die in the woods?
Why would he send Elena to save you?
Because when I stopped the assassination last year,
I saved him.
And he told me that he owed me.
And now we're even.
So the next time that we see each other...
Come to bed.
This is heaven.
This is absolute heaven.
Yeah, you mean spending the day with your future husband?
No, no.
Not that.
Not that?
No, no, no.
I mean, not only that.
It's 2:00.
I'm in my P.J.s.
We're reading the newspapers.
I never get to do this.
Because you never take any time off.
All we have to do is loaf around.
There's no work, no goals other than to waste hours on end.
Okay.
Stop describing my life.
Though there is one thing we should get done today.
We need to pick a font for our "save the date" cards.
Really?
We're gonna do that?
We don't even have a venue yet.
Yeah.
I find deadlines... inspiring.
How about this one?
No.
It's too frilly.
And this...
ooh, this is... far too severe.
You will save the date now.
Oh, I like that one.
You?
I'm not really feeling it, though I guess, you could convince me.
I bet I could.
Yeah, I mean, you'd have to work pretty hard to win me over, but, um...
Well, I'm prepared to do just that.
Because it's clear to me that what we both need right now is a really good font.
Yes, we do.
That's so true.
Oh!
And worst timing ever.
Beckett.
Detective, how soon can you get here?
Sir, I'm actually not on call today.
I'm aware of that, but something has come up, and I'm afraid it can't wait.
Well, I can get there in 20 minutes.
One more thing...
come alone.
Do not bring Mr. Castle.
Yes, sir.
Aside from sabotaging our domestic bliss?
I don't know.
But I got to go.
I don't suppose I could convince you to just... no.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
It's fine.
Don't worry about it.
I'm fine.
I'll just...
I'll do some writing...
If I can...
manage to focus.
Yo, Beckett.
I thought you were off.
Was that the deputy commissioner?
Yeah, there's been more brass through here than a marching band.
What's going on?
It's all need-to-know, and we didn't make the list.
But whatever's happening is going down in that conference room.
Detective.
Yep.
Yep.
Beckett.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Detective Beckett, Captain Fowler, head of narcotics.
Thank you for coming, detective.
What I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room.
Yeah.
Understood, sir.
These six victims had their throats cut.
They were mid-to upper-level drug dealers.
They were all murdered in the past few months when a new drug ring muscled in and took over most of the uptown heroin and cocaine trade.
A new drug ring?
Well, who are they?
The commissioner asked me to find that out and shut them down, but they're invisible, these guys.
They don't use banks, so we can't follow the money.
They make sure their street dealers never meet their suppliers.
He doesn't know who he's working for.
So, three months in, and we have nothing.
We don't even know any of their names, except for Lazarus.
And who is Lazarus?
The leader.
Not his real name, of course.
Then yesterday, a phone intercept led us to this woman...
Elena Markov.
She copped to being a low-level drug courier in the ring.
Born in Russia, she came here as a mail-order bride, divorced her husband.
She learned to speak English better than we do and was getting by as a freelance translator.
She'd never been in trouble before, at least not till now.
I needed work, and I heard about a way to make money.
All I had to do was call a number, so I did.
But once I got in, I couldn't get out.
Who was your contact in the ring?
I would get a text with a time and a place, and I'd get a package with a note hidden inside that would tell me where to take it.
Did you ever, um, see anyone?
Did you ever interact with anyone?
No.
Everything was anonymous.
I don't know them.
They don't know me.
It... it needs to stay that way.
Look, I-I just want to get my life back.
It looked like another dead end.
Then this morning, Elena got another text from the ring.
This time, they wanted to meet her to offer her a promotion.
Which would give you guys a chance to get eyes on someone.
It's the break we've been waiting for.
So, we leveraged Elena to take the meet, but she tried to commit suicide.
She's in intensive care under police guard.
Sir, I'm sorry to hear about that, but what does this all have to do with me?
And a chance like this is not gonna come back around, so we combed the NYPD database for someone about Elena's age and appearance who speaks fluent Russian, in case that's relevant.
Only one name came up...
yours.
You want me to go in her place?
To the Widmark.
Show up, meet your contact, and leave.
What if they found out that you turned Elena and that this is all a trap?
Then they wouldn't be meeting at the Widmark Hotel.
We were very careful.
No one knows she's made contact with us.
Still, there's the risk that they could see detective Beckett and realize that she's not Elena.
In the text, they asked Elena to wear a red scarf, which tells us that they don't know her on sight.
My people will be in place watching every move you make.
We can even fit you with a monitored mike, if you like.
Detective, something big is going on out there, and this is our best chance to find out what.
But the meeting's in two hours, so I need your answer.
Reinforcements.
Castle.
Wow.
You sound like you are getting a lot of writing done.
I blame you for that.
When are you coming back?
I don't know.
A couple hours?
I have a meeting.
A-and don't ask me what it is.
Well, now I have to ask.
It...
Look, I-I have to get going.
I should be back in time for dinner.
Maybe we can have a glass of wine together.
I will decant something amazing.
Okay.
I love you.
Bye.
I have to tell you I don't care for Captain Fowler's hard-sell tactics.
This is a narcotics operation.
So you can walk away and I'll take the heat.
Thank you, sir, but I-I can handle this.
Then they're ready to review the plan and give you a final briefing.
Remember, don't move like a cop.
You're Elena.
You're intimidated by these guys.
They've been leveraging you for two months.
There will be five plainclothes officers in the lobby and more throughout the hotel.
Head to the north elevator and go to the 11th floor.
The meet is in room 1123.
Undercover officers up there will have your back.
Stay calm, memorize names and faces of whomever you meet, and you'll be out in no time.
Hello.
Hi.
Which floor?
11.
Okay.
Don't move a muscle.
Elevator just got to 11.
It's empty.
She's not here.
She is not here.
This is detective Kate Beckett.
If you can hear me, I've been abducted.
I'm in a white cube van, New York plates.
We've been traveling for about 20 minutes.
We've been making a lot of turns, but I think we're headed east.
Captain Fowler, if you can hear me, this is seriously ruining my dinner plans.
You promised me that you had her back.
What happened?
We were set up for a simple meet, not an orchestrated kidnapping.
The security cameras... did they get a shot of who did this?
They were disabled momentarily throughout the hotel.
What about the mike Beckett had on?
We stopped receiving audio after she got in the elevator.
The signal strength drops in enclosed spaces.
And let me guess... whoever was in room 1123 didn't know about a meeting because there never was gonna be one.
Look, we've issued a limited alert.
Limited alert?
!
We need to call in the cavalry here.
We know the drug ring tracks police radios.
Sending up a flare could make things worse.
They must have known that your girl rolled on them, or they made Beckett.
Either way, she's dead if we don't find her immediately.
Gentlemen, we have a situation.
We've been driving for about an hour now, maybe more.
Two-lane road, not a lot of traffic, um...
We're slowing down.
We've stopped.
I've got to get rid of this thing.
Get on your knees and face the wall toward the cab.
Do not move.
Don't turn around.
Time to see if you're wearing a wire.
I'm not wearing a wire.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
I'm unavailable at the moment, but please leave a message.
Well, I know you have plans with Katherine this evening, so I'm going to make myself scarce.
Oh, very nice.
I'm off to a revival of "Brighton Beach Memoirs."
Ha.
Pray for me.
What's the matter?
I-I can't get ahold of Beckett.
I texted her.
I left messages.
This isn't like her.
Maybe she got tied up at the precinct.
I called them both...
just go straight to voice-mail.
Just...
something is not right.
So, what happens now?
It's not my call.
Is that who we're waiting for?
They're in that room?
You sound worried.
Should I be?
What the hell makes you so special?
I don't know anything.
I just move packages.
I'm not a threat to anyone.
You can just drop the act.
Let's go.
You're up.
You are Elena Markov?
Yes.
It's good to finally meet you.
You can call me Mr. Jones, and this is Mr. harden.
I'm sorry for the lengths we go to to have a meeting, but these are the times we live in.
Can I get you anything?
A drink?
No.
Thank you.
Good.
To business, then.
You should know how much we value your services,
Lazarus in particular.
Well, I do the best I can.
But always as a freelancer.
What we want to do is offer you a permanent position with our organization.
That's per week, of course.
How does that strike you?
It's very generous.
But I'm gonna need to meet Lazarus.
That's not an option.
I need to know who I'm doing business with.
It's a matter of trust.
All right.
I'll pass along the request, but you'll remain our guest here until I get an answer.
Please see miss Markov to a bedroom.
Sir, can I have a word, please?
Sure.
Would you excuse me, please?
Yes.
What's the problem?
She's the problem.
She's all wrong.
Look, I've been watching her.
She acted like she didn't know why she was here.
Esposito.
Javi, Javi, it's me.
We've got half the force looking for you?
Hey!
No.
Listen.
Get a trace on this phone.
I don't know where I am or who the hell Elena Markov is, but her story is a lie.
She is more than just a low-level courier.
You never like it when we bring new people in, especially above you.
That's not what it is, not this time.
Okay, she was afraid.
All right, you keep an eye on her, and if she is wrong, then you get to do the honors, okay?
Let's go.
Are you telling me that we can't trace Beckett's call?
It's a voice-over-Internet line fed through an anonymizer.
Okay, but can we at least narrow it down to the area where the call was made?
No, it was routed through the Ukraine, bounced all over Europe.
These guys know security.
Captain, why did Beckett tell us that Elena Markov was more than just a courier?
I have no idea.
So, there's nothing about her that you haven't told us?
Absolutely not.
Every part of her story checked out, but...
But what?
We didn't have enough time to go deep, not with things moving this fast.
We didn't even know miss Markov until yesterday.
Well, maybe you didn't know her at all.
Looks like we can fix that.
Go talk to her.
Get to the bottom of this.
I'll go with you.
She knows me.
Hey, you guys have not been returning my calls.
Where's Beckett?
Mr. Castle, why don't you come into my office?
Hurry it up!
Quickly.
Over here.
Let's go.
Come here.
Do we have any idea where she is?
Traffic-cam footage caught a white van heading away from the Widmark right when she was abducted.
We think she was in it, and we're trying to track it down.
There are reasons for hope here.
I'd love to hear them.
First of all, they didn't make her as a cop.
They think she's Elena Markov, which buys us time.
She's pretending to be Elena when she doesn't know who Elena is?
She can't keep that up forever.
Well, hopefully, she won't have to.
Once Elena tells us everything that she knows about this, it could lead us to Beckett.
Miss Markov regained consciousness about an hour ago.
She's stable, so we transferred her out of ICU.
Has she said anything yet?
Just that she's glad to be alive.
Yes, but she's also extremely weak from her ordeal, so, please, I'd ask that you limit your time with her we need answers, so we're gonna question her as long as it takes.
Room's just up here...
3410.
I thought you had an officer guarding her.
We do.
He must be inside with her.
Elena Markov, NYP... son of a bitch.
We have an officer down!
Officer down!
Elena's gone.
Either she killed him and fled...
Or someone else did and they grabbed her.
If they took Elena, that means Beckett's cover's blown.
She's as good as dead.
Dear Rick, I don't know how much time I have, even to write this letter.
What I do know now is that I'm in this, and the only way I'm gonna make it out alive is to see this through.
I'm sure everyone is looking for me, and if they figure out I was here,
CSU's gonna search this house.
They're gonna look for blood, and they will find it, which will lead them to this letter.
Babe, it's your letter, and I hope you never have to read this... that I can tell you all of these things in person, but if something happens and I don't make it,
I need you to know that our partnership, our relationship is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.
You're an amazing man, and I love you with all of my heart.
Always.
Mr. Jones wants a word.
Let's go.
I've got surprising news.
Lazarus agreed to meet with you if you agree to an assignment.
What assignment?
You complete the assignment, you get the meeting.
Take it or leave it.
Deal.
What do I have to do?
What you do best.
Kill him.
Make it clean.
We're here.
Where's here?
All you need to know is that the target's in that house.
Is he alone?
As far as I know.
Use this.
Lazarus doesn't want it to be connected to your other kills.
Well, he's got to be important.
Who is he?
He's the next name on the list.
What does he do?
Why are you so curious all of a sudden?
You ever hear of recon?
I like to know what I'm walking into.
Is he a cop, is he a drug dealer, are there guns in the house?
Curiosity keeps me alive.
The guy's a civilian, a nobody.
If he's a nobody, then why are we killing him?
Because they told us to.
Look, is there...
is there a problem here?
Yeah, there's a problem.
I don't work like this.
I do my homework,
I control the variables, and this is sloppy.
You know, maybe Lazarus wanted to see how well you improvise.
You know, maybe I do, too.
Now... are you gonna kill him or what?
Who in the hell are you?
!
It's done.
Show me.
What?
No.
We don't have time for this.
I said show me.
Now.
Like I said.
I'm done auditioning.
You tell Lazarus he wants to play games and this deal's off.
Yeah, we should get back.
Just got off with the hospital security again.
We got teams going through, but there's no sign of Elena.
And we still have no idea who this woman really is.
I'm afraid we do.
Security video shows her leaving her room alone, and the officer's throat was cut in the same exact manner as the murdered drug dealers... same angle, same left-handed stroke favoring the carotid.
That's what those text messages meant about packages being delivered.
She wasn't a courier for the ring.
She was their contract killer.
That's who Beckett is out there impersonating and you didn't know?
Mr. Castle... and now this woman is out there somewhere?
Do you have any idea what's gonna happen to Beckett when the real Elena shows up?
We're doing everything we can.
Well, it's not enough.
Hey, come on, man.
This is Gates.
What?
Where?
She told me to get down on the floor, and then she said she was a cop and that if I wanted to live,
I had to do exactly what she said.
And then she went to the kitchen and she came back with ketchup and... and...
and beet juice and... and she told me to lie as still as possible and to hold my breath.
Mr. Potter, did she say anything else about where she was, where they were keeping her?
Yeah.
She said it was some kind of a compound.
But that she would try to get a message out soon.
At least we know she's still alive.
This guy who was with her.
Did you see his face?
No.
I had my head down.
Do you have any idea why members of a drug ring would want you dead?
No.
That's not my world.
You're an attorney at Tyre, Potter, and Langston.
What kind of law do you practice?
It's mostly corporate... trust administration.
Do you do any criminal law?
No, none.
I hate this.
She's out there somewhere, has no idea how much danger she's in, and I can't help her.
No, you can't.
But this is Beckett we're talking about.
She might be your fiancée, but she's also a damn good cop, so don't sell her short.
She'll figure out a way to let us know what's going on, and when she does, we'll get her out.
What if it's not in time?
So, how did it go?
The package was delivered without any issues.
Good.
Clean yourself up.
Lazarus wants to see you.
You're getting out of here...
alive.
Sorry.
I really have to pee.
Do you mind?
No, it's fine.
Thank you.
Great gig?
I don't know who these guys are, but they sure like to spend money.
Come on.
He's waiting.
This way.
You keep him in the basement?
He likes it there.
He thinks it suits him.
After you.
What's the matter?
You've never seen a counting room before?
Yes.
But never to this scale.
Lazarus is a man of enormous appetites.
I'm impressed you've been able to hide this from the feds.
You don't know the half of it.
Wait here.
He's ready.
Come in.
I apologize for the delay.
I had to resolve a business matter.
Of course.
I don't usually do this...
meet like this.
But for you, I'll make an exception.
Between our needs and your skill set, this could be a very profitable arrangement.
I agree.
Good.
So, now that we've met, why don't we formalize our arrangement?
You are not Elena.
What do you mean?
I know you.
No.
No, I don't think you do.
No, no, no.
I never forget a face.
Detective Beckett.
Oh, no, no, no.
She is a cop?
Homicide out of the 12th.
Last time I saw you, you tried to put me through a wall.
Accused me of murdering your mama.
And from the look on her face, she remembers me.
Don't you, detective?
Vulcan Simmons.
You're Lazarus?
Yo, guys.
It's her.
It came in from an unknown number.
But that's her badge number.
It's got to be her.
"Addr is 5."
She was trying to send an address.
Looks like she got cut off.
Find out who owns it and find out where it is.
Right.
Let's do it without all this Kabuki theater, detective.
It's undignified.
Tell me what I want to know, and I'll give you a proper death without all this messy suffering.
Now what was your mission and what do they know about Lazarus?
Do you want undignified?
Then wait till you see what I do to you.
You know, you're just like your mama... both playing in worlds where you don't belong.
Your mother paid for it with her life.
So will you.
But first tell me what I want to know.
Yo.
Just got off with the carrier.
Any idea whose phone it is?
It's a pre-paid.
There's no way to identify the owner.
I got a hit.
The signal originated from a tower in Scarsdale.
Great.
Can you lock on the location?
No.
The message pinged off a single tower.
Without a second or third tower, there's no way to narrow it down.
Depending on signal strength, it could have originated anywhere within this 10-mile radius.
It would be easier to find a needle in a haystack.
It's off, and it looks like the phone's off, as well.
I'm sorry.
I've got no other way to trace it.
That's the best I can do.
I know your lungs are burning.
I can feel the panic in your soul.
All you want is for this to end.
And I promise I will end it.
Just tell me what I want to know.
Scrub the place.
Find a patch of dirt to put her in... somewhere where she won't be found.
I love these woods.
My daddy used to take me hunting up here when I was a kid.
I spent days learning every rock, every tree, all the secret little places to hide.
Over the years, it's come in handy.
From the moment you walked through the door.
I could see it in your eyes.
I thought, "no way this woman's a killer."
No.
You don't want to kill me, Harden.
You know that I'm a cop.
In fact, a few of them are your new neighbors.
My people will hunt you down.
They will kill you.
But we can make a deal.
You help me take down Lazarus, you can set any deal you want.
No, I'm good with the deal I got.
Thank you.
Elena.
You got balls.
I'll give you that.
You're not gonna kill me?
He sent me because he owed you.
He said he wanted you to live.
Who sent you?
Who wanted me to live?
Lazarus.
Tactical teams raided the compound at 0600 this morning, shortly after your call.
The place was empty.
Everything's gone.
The mansion itself is held in a trust by an offshore corporation.
It'll be months before we find out who the real owners are.
If ever.
And what about Vulcan Simmons?
My team picked him up this morning in Washington Heights... nowhere near the compound.
They've been questioning him all morning, but...
He had an alibi for last night.
We'll go after him, but without evidence, it will difficult to make any of your allegations stick.
Are you saying we have nothing?
No, not nothing.
Future Forward?
Yeah, part of the money-laundering operation... they are funneling a lot of cash into that account.
See what happens when I leave you alone?
Babe, I wasn't alone.
When they were interrogating me, the only thing that kept me going was thinking about you, about our future, the wedding.
You were with me the whole time.
Well, at least it's not a total loss.
Now that the police know that Vulcan Simmons is Lazarus, he will not be able to rebuild his operation.
He's not Lazarus.
If he was, then I would be dead.
Vulcan Simmons is just a figurehead.
Someone else is behind this, someone higher up, someone who wanted me alive.
Who?
Someone bigger.
This can't be right.
You're saying that's what Future Forward is... a political super pac?
That's where the money was going?
Yeah, and that's a connection to Evan Potter,
Potter did all the legal work to establish the super pac for a client of his...
a wealthy hedge-fund manager with significant political connections named Jason Kochler.
It would appear as if drug money were being funneled into Future Forward's accounts.
Nearly $160 million in the past several months.
Passing through an anonymous shell corp and second secret super pac.
What do you mean "legally laundered"?
Where's that money now?
It's gone.
Federal tax and banking laws that regulate these kind of super pacs make it impossible for us to find out where that money actually came from or went.
Well, someone must be able to tell us.
No.
He just set up the pac for Kochler.
Then we need to bring Jason Kochler in here.
He died of a heart attack this morning.
That's why you couldn't find the money.
Someone's using it to build a massive political war chest.
But who?
It's impossible to know.
Those of you who know me know that I've gotten where I am today by doing whatever it takes to get the job done.
That is the kind of leadership this country needs, and that is why I am forming an exploratory committee for a run for the presidency of the United States.
Senator Bracken, an early front runner, is rumored to have significant funding already lined up from major contributors.
Hiding behind Vulcan Simmons, funding his campaign with dirty money, killing whoever gets in his way, just like he did with my mom.
It's him.
And we have no way of proving it.
Maybe the feds will find something.
No.
Bracken is so well-insulated.
It's genius, actually.
He has all the campaign funds that he needs without having to compromise or be beholden to any special-interest groups.
But if it really was him, why wouldn't he just let you die in the woods?
Why would he send Elena to save you?
Because when I stopped the assassination last year,
I saved him.
And he told me that he owed me.
And now we're even.
So the next time that we see each other...
Come to bed.
Please, do not try what you are about to see at home.
We're what you call experts.
Can't you tell?
Narrator:
On this episode of "MythBusters"...
Ohh!
Kari:
Come to mama.
Yeah.
[ Laughs ]
[ Indistinct TV chatter ]
Adam:
Now!
Aah!
[ British accent ] Hello.
I'm talking to you from a bunker two leagues below a building known to the public as M5.
Behind me, the Hyneman watches hundreds of feeds from "MythBusters" of years past but not out of narcissism.
No, this has a purpose.
The powers that be have allowed the Hyneman to sift through all the constructions that he's done over the past 10 years to find one that he found unsatisfying and wants to revisit, one that will bring a smile, an invisible smile
underneath his prodigious moustache.
Would you shut up?
Narrator:
Yeah, can it, Adam, because this episode is all about second chances.
With over a decade of episodes and 850 myths to choose from...
Two... one.
...they've scanned the archives for their greatest, unsolved myth-teries.
Adam and Jamie have a blast from the past...
Adam:
Whoa!
...As they mix dynamite and DIY once again.
Oh, what modern inventions will we come up with next?
But can they deck the walls...
I call this my psychedelic spring.
...and paint a room with a boom?
Congratulations.
You finally made the death star.
Go.
Meanwhile, Kari, Tory, and Grant...
Ha-ha!
Tory:
It floats.
...are fulfilling a fan fantasy...
Oh, this is gonna be so awesome.
...going full steam ahead to split a boat...
Mythity split it.
...Testing first by sea...
Grant:
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Oh!
[ Laughs ]
Narrator: ...
And then on land.
This is it, man.
Three, two, one!
Narrator:
But can they finally splinter their timbers...
And tear a boat in two?
If there's one thing I like, it's fast.
Narrator:
Who are the MythBusters?
Adam Savage...
I reject your reality and substitute my own.
...and Jamie Hyneman.
It's almost too exciting.
Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience.
Together with Grant Imahara...
This is why we can never have anything nice.
...Kari Byron...
Science gets more fun when I get a bigger gun.
...and Tory Belleci.
Say hello to my little friend!
[ Grant laughs ]
They don't just tell the myths.
They put them to the test.
MythBusters 12x09 - Painting with Explosives / Bifurcated Boat
- Original air date June 26, 2013
First, Adam and Jamie are brushing up on their arts and blasts.
For those of you playing at home,
"painting with explosives" is a show we did years ago based on an episode of the British comedy "Mr. Bean"...
[ Film reel clicks, whirs ]
In which a stick of dynamite is placed in a bucket of paint.
[ Explosion ] And when it blows up, it perfectly paints the room it's in without destroying the room.
Yeah, but our explosives didn't do a very good job of it, did they?
No.
I think we ended up more, like, staining the walls than actually painting them.
Yeah, it was a Jackson Pollack sort of a moment.
Yeah.
Barely.
Yep.
The last time we tested this weapon of mass decoration one.
...our painters and detonators...
Coverage... total crap.
...got paint on the walls...
That's horrible.
...but you wouldn't call it home improvement.
So, you think you can actually do it this time?
You have a new design in mind?
Well, I'd like to try.
And as you know, I have a thing about actually harnessing the power of explosives to do work instead of just blowing crap up.
I have some ideas of my own.
Let's say, for this episode, we go off to our separate corners and each try a solution and see if we can't finally achieve painting with explosives.
Sounds like fun.
All right.
Boom.
[ Bird cries ]
So, the guys will split up and each craft their own room boom.
But that's going to take some bomb-range R and D.
What a lovely day.
Let's blow something up.
Narrator:
And first to take up the brush is Adam.
I'm going all the way back to basics.
I'm gonna take a little chunk of C-4 and a bag of paint and a surface, and I'm gonna blow up the C-4 and watch what it does to the paint on the surface.
Narrator:
So, Adam's plan is to start small...
C-4 goes here.
Paint hangs here.
My test canvas goes here.
Narrator: ...
Under the watchful eye of J.D. Nelson to explore what happens when paint meets explosive meets canvas.
[ Siren blaring ] Painting with explosives.
First experiment in three, two, one, go.
Fascinating.
Fascinating.
It just, like, goes, "pbht."
"Pbht."
That's not at all what I expected to happen.
That's information.
That was the whole point of this test.
That fraction of coverage is a long way from what Adam needs...
Boom.
Pbht.
...and the action replay reveals why.
Adam:
Whoa.
The paint's still there.
Wow.
It's totally not vaporizing.
Its' too far away.
That is radical.
Awesome.
Okay.
I know what to do next.
[ Grunts ] Narrator:
Yep.
For test two, Adam's got something different on his plate.
So, the difference between this blast and the last one is that I am going to move the paint much closer... in fact, right on top of the C-4... and second, as you probably already surmised by this,
I'm going to give the C-4 a reflecting backing plate, this big, heavy piece of steel.
Oh, cool.
There it is.
There you go.
I'm not actually sure if this is gonna work, but it's gonna be really different than the last one, and that's gonna tell me something.
[ Siren blares ]
In three, two, one, go.
Whoa!
[ Laughs ]
That was far more effective.
Narrator:
The backing plate certainly reflected the paint onto the board and everywhere else.
[ Lens squeaks ]
Adam:
There we go.
Hi, there.
How you doing?
Hi.
The high-speed shot of my blue-paint explosion is absolutely gorgeous.
I got exactly the vaporized fog of paint that I was looking for, and most of it ended up on the four-by-eight of wood that I had placed there to receive the paint.
It's about as far as you'd get if you wanted to roll that much paint onto that board.
Narrator:
And that's exactly the kind of coverage Adam was looking for.
But he still thinks he can improve on it.
In this test, I'll be using this.
It's actually a thin sheet of plasticized, sheet explosive, sort of a C-4 jerky, if you will.
But don't eat it!
[ Laughs ]
No.
I'm gonna paint with it.
[ Teeth clacking ]
Narrator:
But will spreading the explosive under the paint also spread the coverage?
[ Siren blares ] All right, here we go.
Final explosion in three, two, one, go.
[ Laughs ]
That was more powerful than I expected it to be.
That was a little too much oomph.
[ Chuckling ] Well, let's go see how it did with the painting anyway.
[ Laughs ]
Narrator:
It was less a lick of paint and more a riot of color.
That goes there.
But piecing back together his canvas has inspired Adam.
Well, for me, that was a very successful and excellent day and not just because I spent the day blowing stuff up.
Because in blowing stuff up, I actually learned...
I believe I learned everything I need to know to paint with explosives, including how much explosives is too much.
Time to get to work.
Narrator:
So, Adam heads back to the shop, where another mythbuster has been playing with his nozzles.
Jamie:
The way I see it, if I can get a single blast of paint going through a nozzle to cover an entire wall perfectly evenly, then if I have multiple nozzles painting multiple walls,
I can get a single blast of paint to paint a whole room.
I'm thinking that this sort of flattened orifice here is restricting the paint to where it doesn't come out in a cone, but rather, it comes out in a rectangle.
And that's exactly what I need.
Narrator:
It's exactly what he needs.
But a hose is a long way from an explosion.
Jamie:
With that in mind,
I've broken out this rig that I built some time ago because it'll allow me to test with up to about 700 P.S.I., and we'll see if that fans it out more.
Narrator:
Jamie's aiming for a rectangular spread onto the wall.
Too far open.
But it's a delicate business of tweaking his nozzle just so...
I liked the first one better.
...until eventually, he finds his goldilocks ratio.
Three, two, one.
[ Laughs ]
It's looking pretty good.
Narrator:
Yep, and with his nozzle in hand,
Jamie heads to the bomb range...
[ Tires screech ] ...to put part two of this theory to the test.
Solid as a rock.
My theory is that this time around, we need to contain the paint and the explosives in something like this high-pressure, scuba tank, and when the explosives go off, the paint will be propelled out the nozzle of the tank
kind of like a spray nozzle.
And we'll end up with our nicely painted wall, hopefully not a pipe bomb.
Narrator:
Yep.
Jamie's method all comes down to pressure.
But first, what happens when you put explosives inside a tank of paint?
[ Siren blares ] All right.
This is test one, C-4, no nozzle, in 3, 2, 1, go.
Ah.
That... that actually is quite nice.
It looked like it sent most of the paint out.
No rupture.
Narrator:
It didn't blow, so tank two is filled with paint and then fitted with the patented, Hyneman nozzle.
But will the combo of rectangular nozzle and pressurized paint cover the wall?
[ Siren blares ]
In three, two, one.
[ Laughs ]
Uh, well.
Narrator:
Once again, the tank survived, but the nozzle doesn't seem to have made any difference to the coverage.
Jamie:
We're pushing the limits with what we can get with these tanks, and the fact is that I'm not creating the kind of spread that I need.
I need more pressure to get that spread.
So, I think it's back to the drawing board.
Narrator:
Later, can the MythBusters make high art with high explosives?
Jamie:
Go.
Oh, my gosh.
And Kari, Tory, and Grant weigh anchor on water.
Mythity split it.
But will the curse of the bifurcated boat return?
Narrator:
The MythBusters have been testing, confirming, and busting for over 10 years.
And now they're closing the case on some unsolved myth-teries.
Now, if you guys don't remember the story, it goes like this.
A man is driving his speedboat out of control and crashes into a channel marker, almost splitting the boat in half.
Now, he tells the insurance company that he was only traveling at 25 miles an hour.
Kari:
When we tried it, we couldn't split the boat.
We couldn't even get a tear.
Yeah, our results were less than spectacular.
But according to you fans, that's because our methodology was totally wrong.
Because we didn't do it on water.
Exactly.
So, right here, right now, we are gonna retest it.
We're gonna kill two birds with one stone.
Narrator:
It was the myth they said was cursed.
But despite the rain...
I'm pretty much over this one.
...the problems...
Did we lose the cable?
[Bleep] [Bleep] ...the arguments...
Dude, we never use the blue rope.
- We always use the blue rope!
- No, we haven't.
...and the accidents...
Yeah!
Whoo!
Ohh!
Narrator: ...
The guys could never split the boat.
Oh, the story's busted at 25.
However, the fans say this land-loving test...
[ Laughter ] ...was a flub.
All right. 10-year take 2.
What's the plan?
Well, it's obvious.
We have to test this on water just like the fans asked.
Well, we need a boat and a channel marker, but how do we get the two to crash?
Why don't we do it the same way?
This time, we just use powerboats.
You make it sound so easy.
Now we're older and wiser.
We are older.
Narrator:
Yep.
Although the myth is the same...
crash a speedboat at 25 miles an hour into a channel marker... instead of testing on the runway, they'll float their boat on a lake.
And rather than using a tow truck, they'll use a pair of towboats.
So, to weigh anchor on water...
It's off to Big Break Marina in Oakley.
Kari:
So, that's the boat.
Oh, that is awesome.
There she is.
That brings back memories...
and not all of them good.
Tory:
Now, remember, we have to crash our boat into a channel marker.
Now, as you can see, this marina is filled with them.
But for some reason, they don't want us to crash our boat into theirs.
So, we need to plant our own.
Now, this is no easy job.
I mean, we're talking about a 40-foot pole being sunk 12 feet into the ground while on top of the water.
And luckily for us, Rob, our friend here, has a floating pile driver.
Narrator:
Indeed.
And with Rob driving our pole into the delta...
[ Pile clangs ] ...it's time to shape up and ship out.
Kari:
We've removed the engine just like last time, so we're going to replace the equivalent weight of the engine with barrels full of water.
Narrator:
And with the barrels aboard, it's time to hit the waves.
Check for holes.
Step one, it floats.
It floats.
And now to give it the equivalent ballast of an engine.
[ Pump whirs, hums ]
But to get it moving on water, it's gonna need help.
These are our towboats.
That's right.
You heard me.
Two boats.
Because there's too much water resistance for just one.
Each of these boats has a 175-horsepower engine.
That should be plenty of power to get our speedboat up to 25 miles an hour.
Narrator:
Up to 25 miles per hour...
Aaaagh!
...and into the newly installed, picture-perfect channel marker.
Before we rig all the important components to this experiment,
I thought we needed a little authenticity and make this look just like the viral photo.
Narrator:
And with the tow system working, they're ready to test.
But while the cameras reset...
[ Horn blows ]
Tory:
- What the [Bleep] Kari:
- Oh, no!
Oh [Bleep].
...tragedy strikes.
Tory:
You're probably wondering why there's a giant barge in the middle of our channel, and we were wondering the same thing.
And then, that barge got closer and closer to our channel marker, and it actually knocked it over into the water.
In fact, our crew, right now, is looking for it, trying to fish it out.
Did you guys find it yet?
Not yet.
This is so "MythBusters."
I mean, everything was going so smoothly.
Something had to go wrong.
Narrator:
But unlike the marker, this myth ain't sunk yet.
[ Film reel clicking ]
Could painting be as easy as "three, two, one, boom"?
[ Laughter ]
Well, when the MythBusters tried this, their TNT DIY was D.O.A.
I thought it would be a little better than that.
Now, armed with seven years' more explosives experience, their first stop was painting and detonation 101.
Adam:
That's information.
That was the whole point of this test.
Narrator:
And back at the shop,
Jamie's "tankful" for all that research.
Having seen this tank darn near rupture from an explosion points out the fact that when an explosive goes off, the energy from it wants to travel outward evenly in all directions.
It's almost a spherical swelling.
So, you know, maybe a cylindrical tank isn't the way to go.
Maybe we need a spherical tank.
But the problem is that you can't just go to the store and buy one like you can a scuba tank.
You got to make your own, and that's not a simple task.
Narrator:
Not a simple task, but the Hyneman mind will find a way.
In fact, it looks like he already has.
Jamie's thought up an ingenious, flat-pack design for his spherical tank.
Jamie:
There we go.
24 one-inch-thick washers and 26 assorted other parts to bolt it all together.
Looks like it ought to weigh around 3,500 pounds.
[ Laughs ] That's a big, heavy sphere.
Narrator:
Yep.
That's no moon.
[ Respirator hissing ]
So, it's off to get those washers plasma cut and then put it all together.
So, when this is all assembled, it should hold upwards of 50,000 P.S.I. from the blast.
At least, that's the plan.
Narrator:
That's the plan, but with over 50 parts all cut from one-inch, heavy-duty plate...
[ Grunts ] This thing's a beast.
...that's one giant, 3-D puzzle.
But as it's a brainteaser of his own design,
Jamie has this riddle wrapped in an enigma all figured out.
Jamie:
The sphere's being made in two halves, and each half is basically a stack of different-sized washers that get put on top of each other and welded together.
Now, the holes leave a 10-inch-diameter cavity in the middle of this sphere, and that's where the paint and the dynamite goes.
There we go.
Now, when the explosive goes off, all of that paint has got to go somewhere, and so, I'm hoping that it'll go right into these sort of funnel shapes in these nozzles and straight out and paint our walls.
What it actually will do as far as painting a house,
I'm not really sure, but I'm having a ball.
Narrator:
Get it?
He's having a ball.
And as he works long into the night, it's clear Jamie's sphere has turned to the dark side.
[ Ominous music plays ]
[ Respirator hissing ]
Jamie:
You know, if you want to contain a high explosive, that's what you got to do.
[ Laughs ] That's pretty.
Well, while Jamie's working on whatever flower of death he's building back there behind the forklift,
I have been thinking seriously about the explosions that I got out on the bomb range.
[ Harp plays ]
[ Bloop!
]
Oh.
Right.
So, they have given me the ideas that I need.
I've got all the steel cut.
I'm about to start constructing my painting device here in the shop.
Narrator:
Yep.
And just like the Hyneman, Adam's device ain't simple.
There's a lot of moving parts to this painting rig, but it's gonna be cool.
Narrator:
Adam welds some frames, and then... well, we're not quite sure what he's doing.
[ Grunts ]
Whew!
Coming along.
Narrator:
And that's exactly how he wants it to stay.
All right.
At this point, I'd like you to take a moment and speculate on how you think my painting machine works.
'Cause you know what's cool?
You're totally wrong.
I'm going way off the reservation on this one.
Oh, what modern inventions will we come up with next?
Narrator:
So, with Adam's secret device apparently complete and Jamie's giant death sphere on the back of the truck, the war on walls can begin.
Jamie:
Three, two, one, go.
Narrator:
At the Big Break Marina...
[ Horn blows ] Tory:
What the [Bleep]
Kari:
Oh, no!
...there's been a big barge break.
And it seems as though the bifurcated-boat curse is back.
Ah, good, old, bifurcated boat.
In the great tradition of the mythity split, this is a completely cursed experiment.
We lost our channel marker to that barge.
But luckily, we've procured another.
The bad news is we do lose a little authenticity as our seagull and our sign are at the bottom of the lake.
[ Bell tolls ]
Go ahead, Tory.
Back it in.
Narrator:
Yep, with 10 years of experience, our crew certainly knows how to salvage a myth.
And thanks to their quick thinking and resourcefulness...
I feel like we've done this before.
'Cause you have.
...pole two is good to go.
And now that the fans are getting their watery way, just how much difference will testing in the drink make?
Grant:
So, what's the big deal with water?
Well, here's why it might make a difference doing it on water this time.
The boat is sitting on the water.
Water is incompressible.
That means that there's pressure on the hull.
That extra pressure might translate into more impact force on the bow, potentially allowing it to split.
Second reason is that the keel is now in water, helping to keep the boat straight, so you avoid possibly getting a glancing blow.
Now, why might it not make a difference?
Well, think about it.
The weight of the boat is the same.
The speed is gonna be the same.
Therefore, we're gonna have the same amount of kinetic energy hitting that pole.
What do I think is gonna happen?
I don't think we're gonna get a split, at least not at 25.
[ Engine turns over ]
Narrator:
Grant's skeptical, but after their cursed morning,
Tory is hoping they can actually push the boat out.
[ Ducks quacking ]
Tory:
All right, there should be one word going through your guys' heads right now, and that's "bifurcation."
But will testing this myth afloat split the boat?
All right.
The boat's in place.
Channel marker's up.
Tory:
This is bifurcated boat, take two.
Mythity split it.
In three, two, one, hit it.
Narrator:
The towboats accelerate...
And the mythity split takes off...
[ Ducks quacking ] There's the boat.
Oh, the rope's tensioning!
Grant:
Boat's away.
Oh, here it comes!
Wow.
Okay.
Narrator: ...
Slowly speeding up to the mythical 25 miles per hour.
Tory:
Here comes the boater!
That looks so crazy.
Ghost boat!
Oh, it's beautiful.
Narrator:
But will the channel marker finally make its mark?
Tory:
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
Kari:
Come on!
[ Laughs ]
Here it comes!
Headed straight for the pier.
[ Laughter ]
What the heck?
!
We just took the pillar down!
That was the wrong thing to split.
[ Laughing ] The marker just got split.
[ Laughter ]
I didn't see that one coming.
I didn't, either.
I didn't see that coming, either.
That's not how it happened in the myth.
[ Laughs ]
That's a good shot, though.
It hit it right on the bow.
[ Normal voice ] It did not split the boat in half.
That is the most important thing.
That's the important thing.
Narrator:
Important because in that shocking, split-second impact, the tables on this myth turned.
The marker bifurcated, and the mythity split refused to live up to its name once again.
Grant:
So, the whole reason for this revisit is that fans said that without water, our original tests were invalid.
You know what?
They were right.
See, the resistance of the water kept the boat going straight on impact without glancing off.
However, the energy of the impact caused the pole to break and not the boat.
So ultimately, it's the same result... a busted myth.
Just a slightly different way of getting there.
Tory:
Now, they say that two of the happiest days of a boat owner's life is the day he buys the boat and the day he sells it.
But I won't be happy until we cut that boat in half.
Narrator:
Yep.
It ain't over until the mythity split splits.
...one.
Can you paint a room with a boom?
Well, after a little trial and error...
Looks like I need a little bit more work on my nozzle.
...each of the MythBusters have come up with a plan to find out.
Down at the range, it's time to test the state of their art.
I don't know what Adam's been up to, but I've had my hands full building my paint bomb, and I didn't have time to build a room to paint.
So, we brought in a team of carpenters, and they put this
8-foot-high-by-12-foot-square room together as our blank canvas.
Narrator:
The canvas is primed.
Here we go.
But strangely,
Adam's not unloading his device anywhere near it.
Allow me to introduce the snowflake, my painting machine.
It is named after both its hexagonal design and its uniqueness.
And its design is informed by exactly what I learned out here on the bomb range earlier this week.
And this is the result.
Some might feel like
I have broken the rules with this design.
Narrator:
Clearly, Adam's up to something.
All right.
Good.
And as he welds the final touches to the snowflake,
Jamie's confused.
I'm guessing the paint goes in the middle.
Yep, right along with the explosives.
So these things are in the way.
What?
Are they supposed to disperse the paint or something?
Nope.
These panels are exactly where I want them to be.
Well, how are you gonna paint the house?
I'm not gonna paint the house.
I'm going to paint art that goes in the house.
Oh.
"Paintings" with explosives.
Yeah.
I thought I'm the one that's supposed to cheat.
Yeah, I thought I'd steal your thunder this time.
Usually, it's the underhanded Hyneman who decides to bend the rules...
Hey, hey!
[ Laughs ] ...and stack the odds in his favor.
- But after 10 years...
- And that's for you.
...clearly, all that devious designing has rubbed off on Adam.
[ Adam laughs ]
Well, this all started when I was out here at the bomb range doing my preliminary tests with painting and explosives.
I really, really liked the patterns that I was getting on my target board.
And I thought, "what if we made art?"
I'm still technically "painting" with explosives.
I just figured Jamie was gonna go whole hog on getting that room covered with paint, and I could kind of do my own thing.
And that's what I did.
Narrator:
Now it's time for the snowflake to make its kinetic art debut with six marbles of C-4 and some paint.
[ Chuckles ]
I call this my psychedelic spring.
I'm ready to go.
Let's get to safety.
All right.
[ Siren blares ] You ready, sir?
- I'm ready.
- All right.
Here we go.
[ British accent ] Painting with explosives to make some art in three, two, one.
[ Normal voice ] Wow, that was quick.
[ Laughs ]
Narrator:
It was quick.
But when you slow the explosion to 1,000 frames per second...
Adam:
Wow.
That is insane.
...It's also beautiful.
That's a piece of art in and of itself.
Look!
It's like a clown's head exploded.
[ Chuckling ] That is the loveliest thing
I have ever seen.
Narrator:
But did that explosive pop of color create pop art?
[ Laughs ]
That's beautiful!
All right.
There's one.
Oh.
Oh, it's gorgeous!
That's beautiful.
The tale of destruction wreaked on the canvas.
Narrator:
As Adam canvasses his canvases...
Oh, yeah.
That's really nice.
...It's clear that all six were mostly covered with paint.
Well, I don't know much about art, but I know I like making it with explosives.
Hey, well, two of them have some nice colors going.
They show some promise.
Maybe... maybe you could take an art class or something.
[ Laughs ] What do you think?
I'm very pleased.
I'm very pleased.
But while the results of Adam's art deco are a little muddy, it's the process that was beautiful.
Nice.
Can't wait to see what Jamie comes up with.
Top that, Hyneman.
Next, will a rocket sled close the case on this unsolved myth-tery?
Tory:
This is it, man.
Hopefully, we can cut this boat in half.
And can Jamie's paint ball deck the wall?
[ Laughs ] I'd like to watch this one from the bunker.
Do not try what you are about to see at home.
We're what you call experts.
Tory:
Rocket-sled track.
[ Sighs ]
You guys ready for this?
If there's one thing I like, it's fast.
Let's do it.
Grant:
When we want to fly a wall down a track and pulverize a car, when we want to cause a rear-end collision at nearly 400 miles an hour...
[ Laughing ] That was one of the coolest things I've ever seen!
...we come here because, "A," there's no one around to get in harm's way, and, "B," nobody does extreme like our friends at new Mexico Tech.
And today is gonna be no exception.
So, why are we taking it to these extremes and using a rocket-powered sled?
Well, we tested the myth just like it stated, crashing a boat at 25 miles an hour into a channel marker, but we couldn't get it to split in half.
So, the myth is busted.
But now it's my favorite part of the show, where we replicate the results.
Now, if it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing, and I would have to say this is overdoing.
Kari:
Now, this is the boat that we're going to use.
It's not the exact same boat as the one in the myth, but it's gonna do just fine.
It will be weighted the same.
It's made of the same materials.
And the center of the bow is still hitting the center of the pole.
There's only one difference.
Narrator:
Yep, and the reason for that difference is very familiar to the MythBusters.
Grant:
Cable broke.
[Bleep]
And inside NMT's high-tech classroom...
Hey, Van.
Welcome back.
...Van Romero has the solution.
Flying the boat down a track is a little tricky.
Getting a boat to go 100, 150 miles an hour... what's gonna happen with a fast acceleration is it's probably gonna fly apart.
But we do have another option.
Instead of moving the boat down the track, let's look at moving the piling down the track.
Awesome.
If we do that, we can accelerate this pipe as fast as we want.
We won't have any problems.
The physics is identical as long as we get the closing speed to match the closing speed that we want.
Narrator:
The roles will be reversed, and the pylon will hit the boat traveling at the top speed of a speedboat.
So, it's time to trek back to the track and prepare the sled.
Grant:
The first thing you'll probably notice about the pole is unlike our previous experiment, it's metal instead of wood.
The reason for this is that at the speeds we're talking about, wood would simply shatter, where we know the metal's not gonna shatter.
The more important thing is the sheer amount of kinetic energy it's gonna generate.
The pole plus the sled weighs almost 600 pounds.
It's gonna be traveling at nearly 200 miles per hour.
See, the key to any good rocket-sled experiment... lubrication.
That's the kind of kinetic energy we need to give this boat split a fighting chance.
Narrator:
But first, the marker needs a maritime makeover.
So, we're out here in the middle of New Mexico.
There's not a lot of ocean around, so...
[ Seagull honking ]
We decided to make it more marine-like.
So, we brought a seagull.
[ Seagull honking ]
Is that the most irritating thing you've ever heard?
Narrator:
With the pole sitting pretty...
[ Honking continues ] Kari:
Aww.
...It's the boat's turn to get nautical.
Ocean spray.
We're going to add a little water to this boat just to keep the fans happy.
They really like "bifurcated boat" to be on water.
With the mythity split 3 in commission, they hoist the sails.
So, it's floating on air.
Well, there's something you don't see every day.
The boat's in place.
Now it's time to load up the sled with rockets and see if we can split this boat in half.
Three, two, one!
Narrator:
Devious Adam moved the goal posts...
Adam:
Wow, that was quick.
...and created art with explosives.
That's beautiful!
But now it's the Hyneman's turn to paint and detonate.
[ Ominous music plays ] You need that.
I do.
It's time to load it up.
The myth requires 100% wall coverage, so Jamie's reducing his boom.
On our first test, we used C-4, which is a very fast, high explosive.
This time, we've slowed it down to about 1/4 or 1/5 of that speed with ditching dynamite.
This stuff goes off at about 5,000 feet per second, and I'm hoping that it'll have a lot more push with it.
Narrator:
Maybe it'll push some paint.
But will it impress Adam?
No fricking way.
What... how... this looks like it weighs 6,000 pounds.
Oh, it's only 3,500 or so.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, my God.
How... how does this work?
Well [Sighs] you put the top on, and you bolt it down.
You pour paint in, it fills up, the dynamite goes off, and it shoots paint out through the jets.
[ Laughs ]
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to watch this one from the bunker.
Yeah.
This is... you know, this is a dangerous thing.
It is a beautiful thing.
[ Metal clangs ] [ Laughs ] Nice work.
And with the dynamite in position,
Jamie's planning to paint the town red.
Jamie:
Who knows what the right paint thickness will be for this particular spray-paint job.
I mean, normally, you thin paint a little bit when you put it in a sprayer, so I figure this wouldn't be any different.
And in any case, the thinner the paint, the more it's gonna break apart when it's sprayed.
And why not hedge my bet?
Narrator:
Well, with the paint payload on board, the sphere is locked and loaded.
Congratulations.
After all these years, you finally made the death star.
[ Sighs ]
Well, let's get out of here before it is actually the death star.
The circle is now complete.
So it's time to return to base and use the force.
[ Siren blares ] But can it paint an entire room?
Okay.
Painting with explosives, the paint ball, in three, two, one, go.
Adam:
What happened?
- Let's go check it out.
- All right.
Wow.
[ Laughs ]
That, uh, wasn't exactly what I had in mind.
But, um...
You've made a four-wall rorschach test.
[ Laughs ]
[ British accent ] Jamie, what do you see when you look at this blot?
I see Valentine's day.
Valentine's day?
Well, that's not the...
Wow.
That's quite romantic of you.
Who knew?
The death ball sprayed a red mist over the walls, but it looks less solid color and more Hollywood horror.
All that work, and this is what we get.
Well, it's food for thought, isn't it?
[ Laughs ]
And even though he didn't coat all of the walls,
Jamie's not disappointed.
Well, I'm tickled pink that my ball actually withstood the high explosive.
That was the main thing that I was worried about.
And the paint actually came out the jets quite nicely.
They did what they were supposed to.
They directed the paint at the walls, and you can even see that the jets were starting to shape the spray the way that I wanted to so that it didn't end up all right in the middle.
But as far as painting a house with explosives...
It needs a little work.
[ Normal voice ] Final analysis, painting with explosives...
what do you think?
Well, we made some fine art today, but as far as painting houses, it's just not practical.
No, it's not gonna replace house painters anytime soon.
Got to be busted.
Let's go home.
[ Laughs ]
It would actually be kind of nice to be able to paint your house in a millisecond, wouldn't it?
Narrator:
After the break...
After seven years of waiting to find out if we could actually bifurcate a boat, we're ready to go.
Narrator:
Meanwhile, at a gallery somewhere in San Francisco...
[ British accent ] What are my bomb paintings about?
Well, I mean, they're really about the universal themes of art, the explosive moment of inspiration, the randomness of our creation, the marks of detritus we leave on others' lives.
But mostly it's just 'cause I like to blow [Bleep] up.
Yeah.
Narrator:
Deep in New Mexico, things are about to get fast.
So, I heard you got some rockets for us.
[ Deep voice ] This is the most dangerous part of our day... loading the rockets onto the sled.
[ Laughs maniacally ]
Narrator:
It's dangerous all right.
In fact, it's so dangerous, it requires a costume change.
This is an incredibly tense moment, and the reason is that the rockets have their igniters pre-installed.
So, just by handling them, they could ignite, and that would be a very, very bad thing.
And the other thing that makes it difficult is that the ignition level is not very high, one volt at one amp.
When you just walk around in wool clothing, you could generate a static charge of upwards of 40,000 volts.
So, that's why we have to remove anything that's not cotton and ground ourselves because we don't want these things going off.
Narrator:
Yep, they're staying grounded 'cause the power of these rockets could knock more than their socks off.
To send this pylon down the track at 200 miles an hour, we are using vintage, Korean-war, high-velocity aircraft motors.
That's gonna give us the 200 miles an hour we need, 375 G's, and 12,000 pounds of thrust.
It's gonna annihilate the mythity split 3.
Narrator:
Indeed.
That pylon will be traveling at the maximum speed a super-fast speedboat can go, which means there's no margin for error.
To the bunker.
[ Grant laughs ]
Okay.
So, our high-speed cameras are in place.
We are ready to go.
This is the moment of truth.
What do I think is gonna happen?
Look, that's a fiberglass boat.
It's a steel pole coming at it.
That thing is gonna shatter into a million pieces.
Mark my words.
Narrator:
Well, where the curse of the bifurcated boat is involved, nothing is certain.
But they've cleared the decks.
All right, the pylon is loaded and hot.
We've got our boat in place.
Batten down the hatches.
Tory: [ Normal voice ] This is it, man.
Finally, hopefully, we can cut this boat in half.
[ Siren blares ] And now it's full steam ahead.
All right.
Rocket-sled pylon versus boat.
Three, two, one.
Yeah!
[ Laughs ]
Wow!
We got bifurcation!
It cut right down the middle!
We did it finally!
Ha-ha!
Awesome!
That was awesome.
Narrator:
Yep, it seems the curse has lifted, and they finally split the boat.
Finally!
After all this time, we bifurcated a boat.
But you know what that shows me?
That dude had to be going fast.
- Real fast.
- Yep.
Let's go check out the carnage.
All right.
Narrator:
Outside, it's clear that this ship is wrecked.
[ Laughs ]
I cannot tell you how happy I am that this boat is finally split.
It split in two.
I mean, it's annihilated, but there is a clear division.
[ Imitates explosion ]
The rocket sled does not disappoint.
Narrator:
It does not.
Reaching 200 miles per hour in only 200 feet, the rocket-powered pylon plowed into the prow, tossing the boat into the air and leaving two halves in its wake.
Grant:
All right, so, my prediction was that when the channel marker hit the boat, it would shatter into a million pieces.
But as you can see here, it actually tore a hole almost all the way down the hull, leaving this in two pretty-much-intact halves.
I've never been happier to say that I was wrong.
And it just goes to show that even a blunt object like our channel marker could turn into a knife when you add enough speed.
Kari:
There's no way that guy was going 25 miles an hour.
We tried it over and over at 25.
We tried it off water, on water.
It took 200 before it started to split it.
We didn't even get a dent at 25.
I think he might have been lying.
Tory: [ Deep voice ] Seven years in the making, four channel markers, three boats, a barge, and a crane, but nothing could bifurcate the boat until now...
With a rocket-powered sled.
But it looks like this one's still busted.
That was fun.
What do you think we could put on the rocket sled next?
- I don't know.

Uhhh.
I would like to dedicate this concert to him and to all the other victims of state terror everywhere, all over the world.
When I was young myself
We played in London.
We filmed some shows there.
I have a small piece of film here tonight.
And this... ah?
...is a clip of me singing the song Mother.
I will try to sing a double track vocal and play the acoustic guitar with that poor, miserable, fucked up little Roger from all those years ago.
So!
Wish us luck!
Good luck!

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Well, thank you.
I feel as if we've been driving around in circles for hours. (CHUCKLES)
Well, it's the landscape, isn't it?
Yeah.
It's the French, I think.
(LAUGHING)
Where was I?
Oh, yeah, there's that movie about a Russian lorry driver and he breaks down in Mongolia.
There's this scene where he gets very, very drunk and he makes this long, impassioned speech about the fact that he can't remember his grandfather's name.
When I saw that it was like a dagger in my heart.
And I went, "Oh, my God. "
I thought, "My grandfather, what the fuck was my grandfather's name?"
And I panicked.
And a few seconds later, through the panic,
I went, "George Henry. "
(SIGHS WITH RELIEF)
He was killed here in 1916.
I mean, it's impossible to imagine what it must have been like.
Pitch black, frightened out of your wits.
The guys in the trenches must have realised pretty early on that the people who were making the decisions had no fucking idea what they were doing.
Of course not.
The whole thing was insane, had been from the beginning, and would go on being crazy until the end when they called it a draw and went home.
And how old was your father when his father died?
Two.
So that's two wars that took away even the direct memory of fathers from two sons.
Yeah.
(MOURNFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
"Most rulers lie,
"yet lies are less shocking, less corrosive
"than the chosen, cultivated ignorance Chevallier addresses here.
"This ignorance denies the reality of anything which provokes pity.
"It is an error to think of such war leaders,
"or, today, economic strategists, as pitiless.
"They are abject.
"This is what we have to learn and to act upon.
"They are abject. "
(SNIFFS)
George Henry, hewer of coal.
It's been an ambition of mine to come here with you three.
Two great-grandsons, great-granddaughter, and a grandson.
It's two million men.
Amazing.
You can plan to meet people in your dreams.
- Can you?
- Yeah.
Well, when you go to bed tonight,
I want you to plan to meet George Henry in your dreams.
I once dreamt that I jumped down a hill, but I landed near a bear and it ate me.
It's possible that you were having anxieties about the Russians.
(CHUCKLING)
- Or just bears in general.
- (LAUGHING)
That's possible too.
I've never been in control of a dream where I went, "Oh, I'm dreaming.
"Now I can do this, or that, or the other. "
I had that once and then I lost control, and started getting attacked by World War 2-era Japanese soldiers.
You were getting attacked by Japanese soldiers?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
Look, Mummy.
There's an airplane up in the sky.

Where are we?
France.
And where are we on our way to?
Italy.
That's right, we are.
We'll have to go through tunnels.
I hope so.
Do you remember the last time we went through tunnels?
We must have been 17 or 18.
We were on our way to Baghdad.
No, we weren't.
It was Istanbul.
Was it?
We did go through Greece, though.
And we climbed Mount Olympus.
Do you remember being attacked by that dog?
No.
Do you remember a storm?
- No, I don't.
- (CHUCKLES)
- We're doing well, then.
- (CHUCKLES)
The human memory is a fallible device.
- Certainly at our age.
(STUTTERS)
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, and that it's not something that one should pay too much attention to.
Do you want to hear the story of the thunderstorm that you don't remember?
- Yes, please.
- All right.
So, we're going along... and there was a thunderclap.
The sound and the light were simultaneous.
And in that moment, I completely lost my identity for about one second.
And in that one second, I knew that I was unlimited.
- I was on that mountaintop.
- Mmm.
Probably no further from you than that car.
- Absolutely.
- And I don't remember any thunderbolt.
- No.
- (LAUGHS)
So you're implying it might not have happened at all.
I'm not!
I mean, well, yeah, lam, of course I am.
But on the other hand, it might easily have happened and I just don't remember it.
- Right.
- Maybe I was struck.
I used to have this dream... and the dream was that I'd murdered somebody, and I felt unbelievably guilty about it.
Finally, one day, I figured out that I thought I'd killed my father.
And I never had the dream again.
That child in me, who took responsibility for everything that happened around me,
I carried that into middle life.
I don't have to have that dream any more, and I never have.
Right.
Well, I've certainly never remembered it.
Well, all I will say, since the only thing I really mentioned is Zeus revealing my unlimited...
Right.
...is, I was in New York... because Nancy had had her second son there, and I'm holding him like that, and he looks at me, and he smiles.
And of course, we're programmed to respond to that smile, and he's programmed to give it.
But that isn't what I thought.
What I thought was, the light that came from him and which illuminated everything was identical to what happened to me when I was 18 and Zeus blessed me with a thunderbolt.
But that is all there is.
There's just that.
The smile of one's grandson, and the blessing of the King of the Gods.
And they're the same thing.
I can tell you that.
Roger, darling, did I ever tell you my story of escaping from Budapest?
- Once or twice.

(IN ENGLISH) Probably doesn't matter much.
I won't be long.
I just needed to stop for a drink because, um, I'm on my way to Italy.
I know you don't understand, and that's okay.
So, I'd like one more for the road, and then I'm out of here.

So they landed at Salerno.
Up through the boot, until they reached Monte Cassino.
And there, they stopped.
It was the Germans, on the top of the hill, like that, and the river was through here.
So they decided that they would leave men here and they would take to the sea, and they'd go up here, and that they would create a bridgehead here.
Just south of Rome.
At Anion.
So they did, in January 1944.
And my father went in, and they reinforced the bridgehead in Anion.
And they were overrun.
So this guy died.
And that's why I'm going to Anion.
Because I've never seen the memorial to my father, Eric.
So, that's the story.
I know you don't understand but I think I'll have one more, for the road.
Dear Roger, huh, I don't think
I ever told you my two escapes from Hungary.
The first one in 1944, from the German occupation.
I was seven years old.
Our building was surrounded by the Hungarian SS.
We were having lunch, and the maid brought the soup, and she suddenly started shouting, "You've got to come immediately and look,
"because all the Jews are being taken out of the building. "
And my father said, "We have to leave right now, without anything. "
And we got up, and left our apartment.
And as we came down, I saw a person run for his life, and two seconds later, two Hungarian SS running after him with a drawn gun.
My father said, "Whatever you do, you must not look,"
and opened the front door, and at that second I heard the gunshots.
And we're out in the street, and I aren't look, but I did look, and there I saw the first dead body of my life.
We walked past this dead body to the street corner and we managed to get away unnoticed.
We hid, for the rest of the war, next door to the Gestapo.
Eventually, the war ended, very undramatic ally and we went back to Budapest.
And when we walked back into the apartment, on the table were the four soup plates in the dining room, you know, still with the soup, dry, in it.
And as a child, I could not believe how this place could have survived all the destruction which happened in Europe and in the world, but the four plates were not touched.
Here I was, staring at the table, not understanding how time stood still at that place there.

On the tour,
I invite about 20 wounded veterans to the show each night.
There was one guy.
And he just nodded, and then he put his hand out, and I grabbed his hand like that to shake his hand, and he wouldn't let go of my hand.
So I thought, "Okay, he obviously wants to say something. "
And he stood there and he looked at me straight in the eyes.
Very kind of weird, piercing look.
And then he said...
"Your father would be proud of you. "
And it was a very weird moment.
I just...
I just sort of turned to jelly, really, and I felt myself Welling up.

I would like to dedicate this concert to him and to all the other victims of state terror everywhere, all over the world.
When I was young myself
We played in London.
We filmed some shows there.
I have a small piece of film here tonight.
And this... ah?
...is a clip of me singing the song Mother.
I will try to sing a double track vocal and play the acoustic guitar with that poor, miserable, fucked up little Roger from all those years ago.
So!
Wish us luck!
Merci.

# Mother, did it need to be so high?
#
Well, thank you.
I feel as if we've been driving around in circles for hours.
Well, it's the landscape, isn't it?
Yeah.
It's the French, I think.
Where was I?
Oh, yeah, there's that movie about a Russian lorry driver and he breaks down in Mongolia.
There's this scene where he gets very, very drunk and he makes this long, impassioned speech about the fact that he can't remember his grandfather's name.
When I saw that it was like a dagger in my heart.
And I went, "Oh, my God."
I thought, "My grandfather, what the fuck was my grandfather's name?"
And I panicked.
And a few seconds later, through the panic,
I went, "George Henry."
He was killed here in 1916.
I mean, it's impossible to imagine what it must have been like.
Pitch black, frightened out of your wits.
The guys in the trenches must have realised pretty early on that the people who were making the decisions had no fucking idea what they were doing.
Of course not.
The whole thing was insane, had been from the beginning, and would go on being crazy until the end when they called it a draw and went home.
And how old was your father when his father died?
Two.
So that's two wars that took away even the direct memory of fathers from two sons.
Yeah.
"Most rulers lie,
"yet lies are less shocking, less corrosive
"than the chosen, cultivated ignorance Chevallier addresses here.
"This ignorance denies the reality of anything which provokes pity.
"İt is an error to think of such war leaders,
"or, today, economic strategists, as pitiless.
"They are abject.
"This is what we have to learn and to act upon.
"They are abject."
George Henry, hewer of coal.
It's been an ambition of mine to come here with you three.
Two great-grandsons, great-granddaughter, and a grandson.
It's two million men.
Amazing.
You can plan to meet people in your dreams.
Can you?
Yeah.
Well, when you go to bed tonight,
I want you to plan to meet George Henry in your dreams.
I once dreamt that I jumped down a hill, but I landed near a bear and it ate me.
It's possible that you were having anxieties about the Russians.
Or just bears in general.
That's possible too.
I've never been in control of a dream where I went, "Oh, I'm dreaming.
"Now I can do this, or that, or the other."
I had that once and then I lost control, and started getting attacked by World War 2-era Japanese soldiers.
You were getting attacked by Japanese soldiers?
Yeah.
Wow.
Look, Mummy.
There's an aeroplane up in the sky.
# Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
# Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
# Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

# Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Where are we?
France.
And where are we on our way to?
MAN".
Italy.
That's right, we are.
We'll have to go through tunnels.
I hope so.
Do you remember the last time we went through tunnels?
We must have been 17 or 18.
We were on our way to Baghdad.
No, we weren't.
It was Istanbul.
Was it?
We did go through Greece, though.
And we climbed Mount Olympus.
Do you remember being attacked by that dog?
No.
Do you remember a storm?
No, I don't.
We're doing well, then.
The human memory is a fallible device.
Certainly at our age.
Yeah, and that it's not something that one should pay too much attention to.
Do you want to hear the story of the thunderstorm that you don't remember?
- Yes, please.
-All right.
So, we're going along... and there was a thunderclap.
The sound and the light were simultaneous.
And in that moment, I completely lost my identity for about one second.
And in that one second, I knew that I was unlimited.
- I was on that mountaintop.
-Mmm.
Probably no further from you than that car.
- Absolutely.
-And I don't remember any thunderbolt.
No.
So you're implying it might not have happened at all.
I'm not!
I mean, well, yeah, I am, of course I am.
But on the other hand, it might easily have happened and I just don't remember it.
- Right.
-Maybe I was struck.
I used to have this dream... and the dream was that I'd murdered somebody, and I felt unbelievably guilty about it.
Finally, one day, I figured out that I thought I'd killed my father.
- Mmm-hmm.
-And I never had the dream again.
That child in me, who took responsibility for everything that happened around me,
I carried that into middle life.
I don't have to have that dream any more, and I never have.
Right.
Well, I've certainly never remembered it.
Well, all I will say, since the only thing I really mentioned is Zeus revealing my unlimitedness...
Right.
...is, I was in New York... because Nancy had had her second son there, and I'm holding him like that, and he looks at me, and he smiles.
And of course, we're programmed to respond to that smile, and he's programmed to give it.
But that isn't what I thought.
What I thought was, the light that came from him and which illuminated everything was identical to what happened to me when I was 18 and Zeus blessed me with a thunderbolt.
But that is all there is.
There's just that.
The smile of one's grandson, and the blessing of the King of the Gods.
And they're the same thing.
I can tell you that.
Roger, darling, did I ever tell you my story of escaping from Budapest?
Once or twice.
A civilian national security force...
# I don't need no arms around me
# And I don't need no drugs to calm me
# I have seen the writing on the wall
# Don't think I need anything at all
# No!
Don't think I'll need anything at all
ll All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
# All in all you were all Just bricks in the wall #
# Goodbye, cruel world it I'm leaving you today
# Goodbye
# Goodbye
# Goodbye
# Goodbye, all you people
# There is nothing that you can say
# To make me change my mind
# Goodbye #
Santé.
Merci.
Merci.
François.
Probably doesn't matter much.
I won't be long.
I just needed to stop for a drink because, um, I'm on my way to Italy.
I know you don't understand, and that's okay.
So, I'd like one more for the road, and then I'm out of here.
Merci.
So they landed at Salerno.
Up through the boot, until they reached Monte Cassino.
And there, they stopped.
It was the Germans, on the top of the hill, like that, and the river was through here.
So they decided that they would leave men here and they would take to the sea, and they'd go up here, and that they would create a bridgehead here.
Just south of Rome.
At Anzio.
So they did, in January 1944.
And my father went in, and they reinforced the bridgehead in Anzio.
And they were overrun.
So this guy died.
And that's why I'm going to Anzio.
Because I've never seen the memorial to my father, Eric.
So, that's the story.
I know you don't understand, but I think I'll have one more, for the road.
Dear Roger, huh, I don't think
I ever told you my two escapes from Hungary.
The first one in 1944, from the German occupation.
I was seven years old.
Our building was surrounded by the Hungarian SS.
We were having lunch, and the maid brought the soup, and she suddenly started shouting, "You've got to come immediately and look,
"because all the Jews are being taken out of the building."
And my father said, "We have to leave right now, without anything."
And we got up, and left our apartment.
And as we came down, I saw a person run for his life, and two seconds later, two Hungarian SS running after him with a drawn gun.
My father said, "Whatever you do, you must not look,"
and opened the front door, and at that second I heard the gunshots.
And we're out in the street, and I daren't look, but I did look, and there I saw the first dead body of my life.
We walked past this dead body to the street corner and we managed to get away unnoticed.
We hid, for the rest of the war, next door to the Gestapo.
Eventually, the war ended, very undramatically and we went back to Budapest.
And when we walked back into the apartment, on the table were the four soup plates in the dining room, you know, still with the soup, dry, in it.
And as a child, I could not believe how this place could have survived all the destruction which happened in Europe and in the world, but the four plates were not touched.
Here I was, staring at the table, not understanding how time stood still at that place there.
# Hey, you, out there in the cold
# Getting lonely, getting old
# Can you feel me?
# Hey, you, standing in the aisles it With itchy feet and fading smiles
# Can you feel me?
# Hey, you, don't help them To bury the light
# Don't give in without a fight
# Hey, you, out there on your own
# Sitting naked by the phone
# Would you touch me?
# Hey, you, with your ear against the wall
# Waiting for someone to call out
# Would you touch me?
# Hey, you, would you help me to carry the stone?
It Open your heart, I'm coming home
# But it was only fantasy
# The wall was too high
# As you can see
# No matter how he tried
# He could not break free
# And the worms ate into his brain
# Hey, you, out there on the road
# Always doing what you're told
# Can you help me?
# Hey, you, out there beyond the wall
# Breaking bottles in the hall
# Can you help me?
# Hey, you, don't tell me There's no hope at all
# Together we stand, divided we fall
# We fall, we fall, we fall... #
Well, we got an hour of daylight left.
We better get started.
Is it unsafe to travel at night?
It'll be a lot less safe to stay here.
Your father's gonna pick up our trail before long.
Can Lorka ride?
MAN".
Yeah, I can ride.
Lorka, time to go!
Thank you for everything.

Where the hell are you, Simon?
What concerns me is the other end of it... which is the attachment to dogma... which translates into political action, which kills people.
- And that's...
Well, I'm with you on that, mate.
On the tour,
I invite about 20 wounded veterans to the show each night.
There was one guy.
And he just nodded, and then he put his hand out, and I grabbed his hand like that to shake his hand, and he wouldn't let go of my hand.
So I thought, "Okay, he obviously wants to say something."
And he stood there and he looked at me straight in the eyes.
Very kind of weird, piercing look.
And then he said...
"Your father would be proud of you."
And it was a very weird moment.
I just...
I just sort of turned to jelly, really, and I felt myself welling up.
I'll never forget him.

# Might like to
# Go to the show
# To feel that warm thrill of confusion
# That space cadet glow
# I've got some bad news For you sunshine
# Pink isn't well, He stayed back at the hotel
# And they sent us along As a surrogate band
# We're gonna find out where you fans really stand
# Are there any queers In the theatre tonight?
# Get them up against the wall!
# There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me ti Get him up against the wall!
# That one looks Jewish!
# And that one's a coon!
ll Who let all of this riff-raff into the room?
# There's one smoking a joint
# And that one's got spots!
It h' I had my way, I'd have all of you shot!
# You!

Are there any paranoids... in the stadium tonight?
This is for you!
It's called Run Like Hell!
We shall clap.

Follow me!
That's better.
Altogether now!
Enjoy yourselves!
# Run, Run, Run, Run
# Run, Run, Run, Run
# Run, Run, Run, Run
# Run, Run, Run, Run...
# You better make your face up in your favourite disguise
# With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
# With your empty smile
# And your hungry heart it Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
# With your nerves in tatters
# As the cockleshell shatters
# And the hammers batter
# Down your door
# You better run
# Run, Run, Run, Run
# Run, Run, Run, Run
# Run, Run, Run, Run
# Run, Run, Run, Run...
# You better run all day
# And run all night
# And keep your dirty feelings
# Deep inside
# And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
# You'd better park the car well out of sight
# Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
# They're gonna send you back to mother in a cardboard box
# You better run #
# Eins, zwei, drei, alle!
# Ahh, Ahh...
# Ooooh, you cannot reach me now
# Ooooh...
# No matter how you try
# Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
# Walk on by
# Sitting in a bunker
# Here behind my wall
# Waiting for the worms to come
# Worms to come
# In perfect isolation
# Here behind my wall
# Waiting for the worms to come
# Worms to come
We're waiting to succeed and going to convene outside Brixton Town Hall where we're going to be...
# Waiting

# To smash in their windows and kick in their doors
# Waiting
# For the final solution to strengthen the strain
# Waiting
# To follow the worms
# Waiting
# To turn on the showers And fire the ovens

We'll be moving along at about 12 o'clock down Stockwell Road.
...12 minutes to 3:00 we'll be moving along
Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall Bridge.
Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge, we 're in Westminster Borough area.
It's quite possible we may encounter some by the way we go-
# Stop!
# I wanna go home
# Take off this uniform
# And leave the show
# And I'm waiting in this cell
# Because I have to know
# Have I been guilty all this time?

# Good morning, Worm your honour ll The crown will plainly show
# The prisoner who now Stands before you
# Was caught red-handed Showing feelings
# Showing feelings of an almost human nature
# This will not do
# Call the schoolmaster!
# I always said he'd come to no good
# In the end your honour
# If they'd let me have my way I could have flayed him into shape

# Let me hammer him today?

# Toys in the attic I am crazy
# Truly gone fishing
# They must have taken My marbles away

# Your own way, have you broken any
# Homes up lately?
# Just five minutes, Worm your honour

# Over the rainbow, I am crazy
# Bars in the window
# There must have been a door there in the wall
# When I came in
# Crazy
# Over the rainbow, he is crazy
# The evidence before the court is
# Incontrivertable it There's no need for the jury to retire
# In all my years of judging I have never heard before
# Of someone more deserving

# The way you made them suffer
# Your exquisite wife and mother it Fills me with the urge to defecate!
# Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear

WATERS:
I feel as if we've been driving around in circles for hours. (CHUCKLES)
MAN:
Well, it's the landscape, isn't it?
WATERS:
Yeah.
It's the French, I think.
(LAUGHING)
Where was I?
Oh, yeah, there's that movie about a Russian lorry driver and he breaks down in Mongolia.
There's this scene where he gets very, very drunk and he makes this long, impassioned speech about the fact that he can't remember his grandfather's name.
When I saw that it was like a dagger in my heart.
And I went, "Oh, my God."
I thought, "My grandfather, what the fuck was my grandfather's name?"
And I panicked.
And a few seconds later, through the panic,
I went, "George Henry."
(SIGHS WITH RELIEF)
He was killed here in 1916.
I mean, it's impossible to imagine what it must have been like.
Pitch black, frightened out of your wits.
The guys in the trenches must have realised pretty early on that the people who were making the decisions had no fucking idea what they were doing.
Of course not.
The whole thing was insane, had been from the beginning, and would go on being crazy until the end when they called it a draw and went home.
MAN:
And how old was your father when his father died?
WATERS:
Two
So that's two wars that took away even the direct memory of fathers from two sons.
Yeah.

"Most rulers lie,
"yet lies are less shocking, less corrosive

"This ignorance denies the reality of anything which provokes pity.

"or, today, economic strategists, as pitiless.
"They are abject.
"This is what we have to learn and to act upon.
"They are abject."

George Henry, hewer of coal.
It's been an ambition of mine to come here with you three.
Two great-grandsons, great-granddaughter, and a grandson.
It's two million men.
Amazing.
WOMAN:
You can plan to meet people in your dreams.
WATERS:
Can you?
WOMAN:
Yeah.
WATERS:
Well, when you go to bed tonight,
I want you to plan to meet George Henry in your dreams.
BOY:
I once dreamt that I jumped down a hill, but I landed near a bear and it ate me.
WATERS:
It's possible that you were having anxieties about the Russians.
(CHUCKLING)
- Or just bears in general.
-(LAUGHING)
That's possible too.
I've never been in control of a dream where I went, "Oh, I'm dreaming.
"Now I can do this, or that, or the other."
I had that once and then I lost control, and started getting attacked by World War 2-era Japanese soldiers.

You were getting attacked by Japanese soldiers?

Yeah.

Wow.

(LAUGHS)
Yeah, and that it's not something that one should pay too much attention to.
Do you want to hear the story of the thunderstorm that you don't remember?
- Yes, please.
-All right.
So, we're going along... and there was a thunderclap.
The sound and the light were simultaneous.
And in that moment, I completely lost my identity for about one second.
And in that one second, I knew that I was unlimited.
- I was on that mountaintop.
-Mmm.
Probably no further from you than that car.
- Absolutely.
-And I don't remember any thunderbolt.
- No.
-(LAUGHS)
So you're implying it might not have happened at all.
I'm not!
I mean, well, yeah, I am, of course I am.
But on the other hand, it might easily have happened and I just don't remember it.
- Right.
-Maybe I was struck.
I used to have this dream... and the dream was that I'd murdered somebody, and I felt unbelievably guilty about it.
Finally, one day, I figured out that I thought I'd killed my father.
- Mmm-hmm.
-And I never had the dream again.
That child in me, who took responsibility for everything that happened around me,
I carried that into middle life.
I don't have to have that dream any more, and I never have.
Right.
Well, I've certainly never remembered it.
Well, all I will say, (CLEARS THROAT) since the only thing I really mentioned is Zeus revealing my unlimitedness...
Right.
...is, I was in New York... because Nancy had had her second son there, and I'm holding him like that, and he looks at me, and he smiles.
And of course, we're programmed to respond to that smile, and he's programmed to give it.
But that isn't what I thought.
What I thought was, the light that came from him and which illuminated everything was identical to what happened to me when I was 18 and Zeus blessed me with a thunderbolt.
But that is all there is.
There's just that.
The smile of one's grandson, and the blessing of the King of the Gods.
And they're the same thing.
I can tell you that.
Roger, darling, did I ever tell you my story of escaping from Budapest?
- Once or twice.

(IN ENGLISH) Probably doesn't matter much.
I won't be long.
I just needed to stop for a drink because, um, I'm on my way to Italy.
I know you don't understand, and that's okay.
So, I'd like one more for the road, and then I'm out of here.
(SPEAKS FRENCH)
- Merci.
-(GLASS CLINKS)
(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)
WATERS: (IN ENGLISH) So they landed at Salerno.
Up through the boot, until they reached Monte Cassino.
And there, they stopped.
It was the Germans, on the top of the hill, like that, and the river was through here.
So they decided that they would leave men here and they would take to the sea, and they'd go up here, and that they would create a bridgehead here.
Just south of Rome.
At Anzio.
So they did, in January 1944.
And my father went in, and they reinforced the bridgehead in Anzio.
And they were overrun.
So this guy died.
And that's why I'm going to Anzio.
Because I've never seen the memorial to my father, Eric.
So, that's the story.
I know you don't understand, but I think I'll have one more, for the road.
MAN 2:
Dear Roger, huh, I don't think
I ever told you my two escapes from Hungary.
The first one in 1944, from the German occupation.
I was seven years old.
Our building was surrounded by the Hungarian SS.
We were having lunch, and the maid brought the soup, and she suddenly started shouting, "You've got to come immediately and look,
"because all the Jews are being taken out of the building."
And my father said, "We have to leave right now, without anything."
And we got up, and left our apartment.
And as we came down, I saw a person run for his life, and two seconds later, two Hungarian SS running after him with a drawn gun.
My father said, "Whatever you do, you must not look,"
and opened the front door, and at that second I heard the gunshots.
And we're out in the street, and I daren't look, but I did look, and there I saw the first dead body of my life.
We walked past this dead body to the street corner and we managed to get away unnoticed.
We hid, for the rest of the war, next door to the Gestapo.
Eventually, the war ended, very undramatically and we went back to Budapest.
And when we walked back into the apartment, on the table were the four soup plates in the dining room, you know, still with the soup, dry, in it.
And as a child, I could not believe how this place could have survived all the destruction which happened in Europe and in the world, but the four plates were not touched.
Here I was, staring at the table, not understanding how time stood still at that place there.

Well, we got an hour of daylight left.
We better get started.

Is it unsafe to travel at night?

Your father's gonna pick up our trail before long.

What concerns me is the other end of it... which is the attachment to dogma... which translates into political action, which kills people.
- And that's...

Well, I'm with you on that, mate.
WATERS:
On the tour,
I invite about 20 wounded veterans to the show each night.
There was one guy.
And he just nodded, and then he put his hand out, and I grabbed his hand like that to shake his hand, and he wouldn't let go of my hand.
So I thought, "Okay, he obviously wants to say something."
And he stood there and he looked at me straight in the eyes.
Very kind of weird, piercing look.
And then he said...
"Your father would be proud of you."
And it was a very weird moment.
I just...
I just sort of turned to jelly, really, and I felt myself welling up.
I'll never forget him.

I would like to dedicate this concert to him and to all the other victims of state terror everywhere, all over the world.
When I was young myself
We played in London.
We filmed some shows there.
I have a small piece of film here tonight.
And this... ah?
...is a clip of me singing the song Mother.
I will try to sing a double track vocal and play the acoustic guitar with that poor, miserable, fucked up little Roger from all those years ago.
30!
Wish us luck!
Mercia.
Mother do you think They'll drop the bomb?
# Mother do you think They'll like this song?
# Mother do you think they'll try to break my balls?
# Ooh ahhhh
# Mother should I build the wall?
# Mother should I run for president?
# Mother should I trust the government?
# Mama will they put me in the firing line?
# Ooh ahhhh
# Is it just a waste of time?
# Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry

# Ooh babe
# Ooh babe

# You'll always be baby to me
# Mother, did it need to be so high?
#
Well, thank you.
I feel as if we've been driving around in circles for hours.
Well, it's the landscape, isn't it?
Yeah.
It's the French, I think.
Where was I?
Oh, yeah, there's that movie about a Russian lorry driver and he breaks down in Mongolia.
There's this scene where he gets very, very drunk and he makes this long, impassioned speech about the fact that he can't remember his grandfather's name.
When I saw that it was like a dagger in my heart.
And I went, "Oh, my God. "
I thought, "My grandfather, what the fuck was my grandfather's name?"
And I panicked.
And a few seconds later, through the panic,
I went, "George Henry. "
He was killed here in 1916.
I mean, it's impossible to imagine what it must have been like.
Pitch black, frightened out of your wits.
The guys in the trenches must have realised pretty early on that the people who were making the decisions had no fucking idea what they were doing.
Of course not.
The whole thing was insane, had been from the beginning, and would go on being crazy until the end when they called it a draw and went home.
And how old was your father when his father died?
Two.
So that's two wars that took away even the direct memory of fathers from two sons.
Yeah.
"Most rulers lie,
"yet lies are less shocking, less corrosive
"than the chosen, cultivated ignorance Chevallier addresses here.
"This ignorance denies the reality of anything which provokes pity.
"It is an error to think of such war leaders,
"or, today, economic strategists, as pitiless.
"They are abject.
"This is what we have to learn and to act upon.
"They are abject. "
George Henry, hewer of coal.
It's been an ambition of mine to come here with you three.
Two great-grandsons, great-granddaughter, and a grandson.
It's two million men.
Amazing.
You can plan to meet people in your dreams.
- Can you?
- Yeah.
Well, when you go to bed tonight,
I want you to plan to meet George Henry in your dreams.
I once dreamt that I jumped down a hill, but I landed near a bear and it ate me.
It's possible that you were having anxieties about the Russians.
Or just bears in general.
That's possible too.
I've never been in control of a dream where I went, "Oh, I'm dreaming.
"Now I can do this, or that, or the other. "
I had that once and then I lost control, and started getting attacked by World War 2-era Japanese soldiers.
You were getting attacked by Japanese soldiers?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
Look, Mummy.
There's an airplane up in the sky.

Where are we?
France.
And where are we on our way to?
Italy.
That's right, we are.
We'll have to go through tunnels.
I hope so.
Do you remember the last time we went through tunnels?
We must have been 17 or 18.
We were on our way to Baghdad.
No, we weren't.
It was Istanbul.
Was it?
We did go through Greece, though.
And we climbed Mount Olympus.
Do you remember being attacked by that dog?
No.
Do you remember a storm?
No, I don't.
We're doing well, then.
The human memory is a fallible device.
- Certainly at our age.
{STUTTERS)
Yeah, and that it's not something that one should pay too much attention to.
Do you want to hear the story of the thunderstorm that you don't remember?
- Yes, please.
- All right.
So, we're going along... and there was a thunderclap.
The sound and the light were simultaneous.
And in that moment, I completely lost my identity for about one second.
And in that one second, I knew that I was unlimited.
- I was on that mountaintop.
- Mmm.
Probably no further from you than that car.
- Absolutely.
- And I don't remember any thunderbolt.
No.
So you're implying it might not have happened at all.
I'm not!
I mean, well, yeah, lam, of course I am.
But on the other hand, it might easily have happened and I just don't remember it.
- Right.
- Maybe I was struck.
I used to have this dream... and the dream was that I'd murdered somebody, and I felt unbelievably guilty about it.
Finally, one day, I figured out that I thought I'd killed my father.
And I never had the dream again.
That child in me, who took responsibility for everything that happened around me,
I carried that into middle life.
I don't have to have that dream any more, and I never have.
Right.
Well, I've certainly never remembered it.
Well, all I will say, since the only thing I really mentioned is Zeus revealing my unlimited...
Right.
...is, I was in New York... because Nancy had had her second son there, and I'm holding him like that, and he looks at me, and he smiles.
And of course, we're programmed to respond to that smile, and he's programmed to give it.
But that isn't what I thought.
What I thought was, the light that came from him and which illuminated everything was identical to what happened to me when I was 18 and Zeus blessed me with a thunderbolt.
But that is all there is.
There's just that.
The smile of one's grandson, and the blessing of the King of the Gods.
And they're the same thing.
I can tell you that.
Roger, darling, did I ever tell you my story of escaping from Budapest?
Once or twice.
A civilian national security force... #1 don't need no arms around me
# And I don't need no drugs to calm me
# I have seen the writing on the wall
# Don't think I need anything at all
# No!
Don't think I'll need anything at all
# All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
# All in all you were all Just bricks in the wall #
# Goodbye, cruel world
# I'm leaving you today
# Goodbye
# Goodbye
# Goodbye
# Goodbye, all you people
# There is nothing that you can say
# To make me change my mind
# Goodbye #
Santana.
Merci.
Merci.
Francois.
Probably doesn't matter much.
I won't be long.
I just needed to stop for a drink because, um, I'm on my way to Italy.
I know you don't understand, and that's okay.
So, I'd like one more for the road, and then I'm out of here.
Mercia.
So they landed at Salerno.
Up through the boot, until they reached Monte Cassino.
And there, they stopped.
It was the Germans, on the top of the hill, like that, and the river was through here.
So they decided that they would leave men here and they would take to the sea, and they'd go up here, and that they would create a bridgehead here.
Just south of Rome.
At Anion.
So they did, in January 1944.
And my father went in, and they reinforced the bridgehead in Anion.
And they were overrun.
So this guy died.
And that's why I'm going to Anion.
Because I've never seen the memorial to my father, Eric.
So, that's the story.
I know you don't understan but I think I'll have one more, for the road.
Dear Roger, huh, I don't think
I ever told you my two escapes from Hungary.
The first one in 1944, from the German occupation.
I was seven years old.
Our building was surrounded by the Hungarian SS.
We were having lunch, and the maid brought the soup, and she suddenly started shouting, "You've got to come immediately and look,
"because all the Jews are being taken out of the building. "
And my father said, "We have to leave right now, without anything. "
And we got up, and left our apartment.
And as we came down, I saw a person run for his life, and two seconds later, two Hungarian SS running after him with a drawn gun.
My father said, "Whatever you do, you must not look,"
and opened the front door, and at that second I heard the gunshots.
And we're out in the street, and I aren't look, but I did look, and there I saw the first dead body of my life.
We walked past this dead body to the street corner and we managed to get away unnoticed.
We hid, for the rest of the war, next door to the Gestapo.
Eventually, the war ended, very undramatic ally and we went back to Budapest.
And when we walked back into the apartment, on the table were the four soup plates in the dining room, you know, still with the soup, dry, in it.
And as a child, I could not believe how this place could have survived all the destruction which happened in Europe and in the world, but the four plates were not touched.
Here I was, staring at the table, not understanding how time stood still at that place there.
# Hey, you, out there in the cold
# Getting lonely, getting old
# Can you feel me?
# Hey, you, standing in the aisles
# With itchy feet and fading smiles
# Can you feel me?
# Hey, you, don't help them To bury the light
# Don't give in without a fight
# Hey, you, out there on your own
# Sitting naked by the phone
# Would you touch me?
# Hey, you, with your ear against the wall
# Waiting for someone to call out
# Would you touch me?
# Hey, you, would you help me to carry the stone?
# Open your heart, I'm coming home
# But it was only fantasy
# The wall was too high
# As you can see
# No matter how he tried
# He could not break free
# And the worms ate into his brain
# Hey, you, out there on the road
# Always doing what you're told
# Can you help me?
# Hey, you, out there beyond the wall
# Breaking bottles in the hall
# Can you help me?
# Hey, you, don't tell me There's no hope at all
# Together we stand, divided we fall
# We fall, we fall, we fall... #
Well, we got an hour of daylight left.
We better get started.
Is it unsafe to travel at night?
It'll be a lot less safe to stay here.
Your father's gonna pick up our trail before long.
Can Lora ride?
Yeah, I can ride.
workaholic, time to go!
Thank you for everything.

Where the hell are you, Simon?
What concerns me is the other end of it... which is the attachment to dogma... which translates into political action, which kills people.
- And that's...
- Well, I'm with you on that, mate.
On the tour,
I invite about 20 wounded veterans to the show each night.
There was one guy.
And he just nodded, and then he put his hand out, and I grabbed his hand like that to shake his hand, and he wouldn't let go of my hand.
So I thought, "Okay, he obviously wants to say something. "
And he stood there and he looked at me straight in the eyes.
Very kind of weird, piercing look.
And then he said...
"Your father would be proud of you. "
And it was a very weird moment.
I just...
I just sort of turned to jelly, really, and I felt myself Welling up.
I'll never forget him.

I'm sorry too.

Thank you for keeping your promise.

Oh.
is that right?
Yeah.
The Gauna 542 engulfed an asteroid and set a high-speed collision course straight for Sidonia.
An impact which would assuredly have meant doom for our ship.
The Sidonian military took action and sent Garde squads on an extermination mission.
528)}Sidonia Public Broadcasting Report:
It was a perilous task from which 38 of the 48 Garde units would not return. their bravery led to the destruction of Gauna 542.
An IPM was launched and the asteroid was successfully destroyed.
Sidonia was saved.
But the ten surviving pilots won't be the only ones Sidonia remembers as heroes.
What am I?
Kunato!
Oh.
You're quitting the Garde program?
Is that true? but I spent my whole life in the underground.
I was alone after my grandfather died.
It was hard.
And there were lots of days I went without food.
But maybe it's because of all I went through that I appreciate all that you have here.
I really do love all the people living here in Sidonia.
The truth is that they're really so important to me. there's still a part of me that doesn't forgive you.
I want you to know that you're still one of the ones I care about!
you are a great pilot.
Let's fight to protect Sidonia side-by-side!
Wait!
Would you like to join me for your weekly meal tonight?
maybe some other time?
My dream is to pilot this and protect Sidonia from the Gauna.
That's my Tsugumori.
You took both my Garde unit and my glory.
484)}Pilot Tanikaze a true Knight of Sidonia
A great power?
Why did he get the Tsugumori?
Hoshijiro's death is your responsibility.
Don't try to blame it on me.
I should've been the one to pilot you.
I have no regrets about quitting.
this dream will end.
I want to see this world burn.

Glyndebourne is a beautiful country house in the Sussex Downs where I live with my wife, the opera singer Danielle de Niese.
What makes this place unique is that we also have a world-class opera house and everything that goes with it in the gardens.
It was founded by a passionate man - my grandfather, John Christie and his equally passionate wife, the opera singer Audrey Mildmay.
He started the Glyndebourne tradition with a love story and it continues as one.
The most unique thing about Glyndebourne is the idea that you have all the creative teams actually living in the house.
It really creates this hive of information and people, when they live in close proximity, you tend to bump into each other, idea-wise.
It's always been that way, ever since we started.
There have been strange people living in this house ever since I can remember.
Conductors, designers, directors, assistants, repetiteurs and not singers.
Except me!
Except Danni, of course!
Oh, there's Mr John Christie.
I'm very glad to welcome you.
He was an extraordinary man in many ways.
I mean, he was a captain in the First World War and even though he'd he lost an eye playing rackets at school, when he went for his medical, the doctor asked him to cover an eye, which he duly did to read out the letters,
he then read out the letters and the doctor said,
"And now for the other eye, please."
As he simply went like that...
Fooled the doctor and got through.
He earned a Military Cross for his courage and bravery.
He would boost the troops' morale by reading poetry to them in the trenches.
During ceasefires, they would shoot partridges behind the line.
He would get sauces flown out from Fortnum and Mason's and they would have slap-up meals in the trenches while they were waiting.
So I think he was a bon viveur, but he was an inspiration to many around him.
He was passionate about music and he was also mad about everything German, from the clothes to the wine, and he would go round in his lederhosen.
He felt that England did not have the same culture that Germany offered.
He loved cars and he had this wonderful old two-seater, open-topped sports car.
As a very young man, he would make trips to the Wagner festival in Germany at a time that there were no car ferries going across the Channel and he hired a barge and a raft on which he'd put his car to tow him across the Channel,
which took him quite a long time, I think.
Across Europe to get to Bayreuth to go and see Wagner, which he lapped up and was very inspired by.
Well, after the war, he went back to Eton as a master and then he inherited the estate at Glyndebourne, so at that point he gave up his schoolmastering career and he focuses attentions completely on Glyndebourne.
One of the first things that he did was knock down a court and an old conservatory and started building this beautiful, long room and it was for his friend Dr Charles Harford Lloyd, who had been the organist at Eton and was retiring
and John said to him,
"You must move to Sussex," and of course Dr Lloyd replied,
"Well, there are no good organs for me to play,"
and John said, "Fine, I'll build you one."
So he had this extraordinary room built, which was also to satisfy his own musical interests, and he would put on scenes from operas and concerts in the organ room, invite his friends...
He would act and star in some of them along with some of his friends, along with some professionals.
And this is how he met my grandmother, who came down to sing the role of Blonde in Entfuhrung by Mozart.
His usual am-dramers weren't available, but he was recommended the services of a young soprano from the Carl Rosa
Opera Company called Audrey Mildmay who came with a tenor colleague.
They came down, they were paid five guineas and they were given free board and lodgings.
They came and took part in this absolutely hilarious amateur event in the Organ Room.
The result of that was, of course, that John fell absolutely head over heels in love with his soprano, which, when you look at her, is not really surprising because she was absolutely gorgeous.
He was at that time about 50, a confirmed bachelor.
Anyway, she arrived and he fell instantly in love with her, took her upstairs, I think, and showed her his bedroom and told her that this was where they would be sleeping when they were married!
She thought that might be a proposal, but tried to ignore it.
Indeed, she wrote a letter to him afterwards, saying, "Please, dear John, do not fall in love with me."
But it was a bit late!
He already had.
The story goes that he took her three times to Rosenkavalier, the Royal Opera house, and at each time the Silver Rose was presented by Octavian to Sophie, he proposed to her.
The first two occasions, she told him,
"I just need a little bit more time."
On the third occasion, he bought her a diamond-encrusted brooch and she simply couldn't refuse!
And the rest is history.
They were married in June and they went to Germany of course, to listen to opera - where else would they go?
So they came back from their honeymoon, returned home to Glyndebourne after this wonderful trip around Europe and John came up with the idea of extending the Organ Room, effectively putting a stage across the end of the room.
And she famously remarked, "For God's sake, John -
"if you're going to spend all that money, do the thing properly."
So he took her advice and built her a 300-seat barn in the Kitchen Garden of Glyndebourne.
What they wanted to do was create the festival atmosphere that they had enjoyed in Europe in this country, to bring the standard of performance they'd been enjoying in Europe into this country.
At that point, all idea of amateur performances was completely cast aside.
He was very fortunate to secure two of Germany's top directors at that time in Carl Ebert and Fritz Busch.
This was the period just before 1933 when political interference both from the left and right was increasingly becoming a problem in Germany.
A lot of musicians were denounced in the Nazi press and one prominent musician was Fritz Busch, the general music director in Dresden.
Not Jewish, but the brother of Adolf Busch, who was a very famous violinist, who was an outspoken opponent of the Nazis and who actually left Germany in 1929.
Fritz Busch was busy working in the opera house and stormtroopers came into the building while he was rehearsing and tried to prevent him from carrying on the rehearsal.
He was forcibly removed from the opera house.
Adolf Busch, Fritz's brother and leader of the Busch Quartet, was stranded in Eastbourne after a concert and conversation turned to Glyndebourne over dinner and the fact that Captain Christie had built this opera house in the middle of the countryside and he was looking for a conductor.
Adolf said, "Well, you could speak to my brother, Fritz."
Christie and Busch finally met in the January of 1934 in Amsterdam and it was a strange meeting by all accounts.
Fritz expounded at great length about his beliefs in music, in singing, in what he wanted to achieve, in not wanting to use big names, wanting to seek out new talents and so on, and apparently John sat there, seemed to be asleep.
So Fritz believed.
Then he got up and went, "Yes, that was very interesting - thank you."
And left.
And Fritz was left apparently thinking, "Well,
"I don't think anything is going to come of that," and of course a week or so later, got the letter saying, "Right - let's start."
NEWSREEL:
Here, members of the cast were discussing the score for the night's performance.
The music, too, was under the direction of one of the original team - Dr Fritz Busch.
His influence was so very civilised and humane.
As a German, he had the discipline and the absolute method.
When Busch arrived at Glyndebourne, the tables were set out and polished, his ruler and his red pencils and even his red ink, which, to my horror - he used to write on musical scores in red ink
to show that it was for all time.
Fritz Busch suggested this whole notion of having a producer, which was completely alien because there was no such role in the British opera world at the time.
Fritz Busch had worked with Carl Ebert in Berlin and so he contacted Carl.
Carl Ebert was one of the leading figures in 1920s German theatre.
He was not Jewish, but since he was to the left, he was regarded as a persona non grata and when the opera house he was in...
the director of was the opera house that Goebbels took control of as the Gauleiter of Berlin, so he was basically removed.
Carl Ebert thought the idea was completely mad, but came over anyway to meet with John Christie and had a look at the theatre, discovered there was no fly tower, so all the scenery changes involved pulling everything out onto the grass outside the theatre,
but realised that what they were going to get out of this, because they sat down the three men and talked about the budget, they talked about what their principles were and what they wanted to achieve and they realised
they were going to get the rehearsal period they needed, the concentration, the devotion to producing the best possible opera and they both signed up for it.
This man's idea was a real new one.
He said, "I would like to give my country, in this specific
"kind of art, the kind of perfection which is unknown up to these days."
And he said, "I want to give my country something on my expenses."
That made me really quiet - I shut my mouth and said, "Well,
"if somebody really wants to sacrifice
"quite a fortune for this reason,
"then I have to contribute with all my strength,"
and so did my friend Fritz Busch, too.
And they revolutionised opera in this country.
And introduced a lot more drama into opera.
Before that, the singers hadn't needed to act and there was no demand for that.
Ebert and Busch brought dramatic intensity into the operas.
The most important thing, of course, is to improvise the words.
Really feel that it's the first time she is dictating a letter, she had only generally in mind what she wanted to say, so let's have it again - come on.
SHE SINGS
All the visions are coming from outside,
I'm nearly haunted by visions to see how people move, what kind of facial expression they have, what kind of gestures they have.
I rush up and down, I make the gestures,
I time carefully the steps, how to go in, how to go out.
The position of the singers must be to see the conductor.
Our singers have to be together, they can see that they belong to each other.
He was in himself a natural actor, so he could show very clearly to the artists what he wanted.
He always had great respect for the musical requirements and Busch made sure he did.
They'd speak in German together.
Carl was as good as gold.
Like all producers, he'd try and get away with it, but Busch was very firm about it.
Is it possible if I say we can come in a little earlier to establish the mood before we actually start singing?
Excellent idea.
And suddenly going with your cue.
Before the war, this wasn't really an operatic country.
When we had opera, it was brought in to the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, very short seasons.
There was a wonderful small company, the Carl Rosa, which went around the "provinces", but there wasn't an operatic tradition.
It was Glyndebourne really with the tutelage, with the direction of Carl Ebert and Fritz Busch.
Glyndebourne created truly professional opera in this country.
This was Ebert's creation.
Carl Ebert and Fritz Busch basically set the tone for everything that
Glyndebourne was to become, which was not the best that we can do, but the best that can be done anywhere, and that was John and Audrey's motto for Glyndebourne.
Out of the initial meeting between Fritz Busch and John Christie in Amsterdam, they confirmed a two-week season to start on 28 May 1934, with six performances of Le Nozze di Figaro and six performances of Cosi Fan Tutte.
Rudolf Bing was contacted - he had worked with both Busch and Ebert previously.
He was asked to hunt out the European continental singers while Busch himself came over to this country and auditioned all of the British singers, including Audrey Mildmay.
There was no assumption that because she was the boss's wife, she was automatically going to get a role.
She had to go through the same process as everyone else.
And that's how it all began, in 1934, and she sang the role of Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro on May 28, 1934.
The first night was sold out, pretty much, which, considering they were charging £2 a seat, which was a lot of money in anyone's terms - almost overnight they achieved exactly what they had set out to do.
They had timed their performance so that people had an hour and a half interval in the middle, they could have their dinner, stroll in the gardens, look at the views, soak up the atmosphere and enjoy absolute international class opera.
And the critics of the time, they went away absolutely bemused by what they had seen.
But they all, to a man, appreciated that they had seen something completely new and different and special.
The second night...which was the first night, of course, only seven people came.
So the opera house itself sat just over 300, it was very, very empty and then the reviews really hit the streets and after that, it was sold out every single night.
So after a repertoire that was Mozart-based, 1938 saw the introduction of Don Pasquale and Macbeth and then in 1940, they planned a repertoire that would have included
Carmen, but of course war broke out and so everything was abandoned.
Glyndebourne itself was made over as an evacuee home for one-to-five-year-olds from the East End of London.
Immediately after the war, there were lots of plans,
John trying to find a way of getting things started again, but obviously not having the money because the whole economic climate had changed.
Having started with Mozart at Glyndebourne, it was inevitable that they weren't just going to stick with that one composer.
As different music directors and different artistic directors came through the organisation, they all brought their own passions.
In 1959, Carl Ebert said he wanted to do a production of Der Rosenkavalier as his farewell gesture to Glyndebourne for the
25th anniversary and he would then retire at the end of that season.
The atmosphere was very excited here because they were doing their first Der Rosenkavalier with
Regine Crespin as the Marschallin and a Swedish soprano I adored,
Elizabeth Soderstrom, was singing Octavian.
It was a wonderful production.
A young man called John Cox was Professor Ebert's assistant - he's now head of everything in the opera world, he's a very grand figure.
That was my first season here.
I always think of it as the Silver Opera because I think of the silver anniversary of Glyndebourne on that year.
I filmed them going round the set, planning, talking to the designers, talking to costume makers and so on and so forth.
The atmosphere was just as it is now, very excited!
Opera is a wonderful art when it's all put together, all the different parts of the total staging, the costumes, the design of the singing, the orchestra.
It was his last season as artistic director.
I was in complete awe of him, he had such an incredible reputation and there was some absurd moment when Carl Ebert turned to me and put a tricorn on my head.
I don't know whether he knew who I was at the time, because I was a very mere assistant!
It was received remarkably well by the bulk of the critics, but the Times critic wrote a rather caustic review which so incensed John Christie that he wrote to every single member of the audience and asked them to write to the Times.
Which they did!
All saying that the times was completely wrong and it was beautiful and perfect and of course he was right to stand up to them!
In 1958, John Christie passed on the reins of the chairmanship to his son George.
He'd been brought up with this opera house, so it was almost in his blood.
My dad took over at the tender age of 23 and my grandfather died when he was 28.
MUSIC:
L'incoronazione Di Poppea:
Pur Ti Miro, Pur Ti Stringo
My dad, he had a tough time in the first decade or so.
The '60s were tough economically and he had to grow Glyndebourne from its rather homespun beginnings.
The next item I'd like to discuss is the bookings for The Wild Things at the National Theatre.
George was a businessman and he worked for the banking foundation and was more "in the world", as it were, than his father.
But when George came, other things were happening in any case.
I mean, the world was changing - he was part of a changing world.
He was a real realist as far as Glyndebourne's finances were concerned.
It was the beginning of sponsorship in this country.
Initially, cigarette companies were helping Glyndebourne exist, um...
And he had a lot of charm and infectious enthusiasm and was a very adept at raising funds from the corporate world.
And then as he settled into the role, as it were, he started to flex his muscles a little bit more - there were alterations to the repertoire and the way the seasons were structured.
We're going to move onto the next item on the agenda - the 1983 tour.
His greatest achievement in his eyes was the establishment of the Glyndebourne Touring Opera because he was really aware that we needed to get these productions out to a wider audience.
And if the thing doesn't work, then my own particular livelihood is at stake in quite some degree.
So, I'm very passionate about the thing!
It may wear me down, but it's worth being worn down by passion.
It was actually originally planned in 1977 that in the 1980 season there would be a Rosenkavalier.
I was luckily placed to be the person they wanted to direct it, but I didn't want to go mad, you know.
You know, making it totally Vienna 1900, Freud, Jung and all that, you know, everybody is a neurotic or a political extremist
- I didn't want to do it like that.
Well, Felicity, of course, everybody thinks of Felicity now as a Marschallin
- I never thought of her as a Marschallin.
There she was, six feet tall, slim as a rake...
I loved the character of Octavian.
I'd never played a boy on stage, so that was quite a challenge, because I tend to drift around and obviously Octavian is much more passionate and like a young puppy, really.
I always see it in terms of shapes because the phrases are so beautiful and so...
I don't know, so bendy!
Not a very musical word, but it's... sensuous and... lilting and...
I don't know - it gives one a lot of opportunities.
MUSIC AND BIRDSONG
The '80s was a golden decade for Glyndebourne with Peter Hall as the artistic director and Bernard Haitink as the music director.
At that stage, Glyndebourne was an 830-seat opera house - it had grown over the years to that size.
But it was too small for the ever-increasing demand from the audiences.
It was a cramped, hot, not-great-acoustically auditorium, creaking at the seams.
Slowly, within the ages, it dawned on him that he was going to have to knock down the dear old theatre and build a bigger one.
By having a bigger auditorium, and more seats to sell, the box office potential is enhanced and box office potential is what's going to secure Glyndebourne's long-term existence.
And so in the late '80s, he set about fundraising.
The project was £34 million.
Not an insubstantial amount at that time.
But it also...
He got his timing pretty perfect.
It was the height of the boom in the late '80s and he took every single corporate member around a model in the house here and enthused them with his vision for the new theatre.
And he managed to raise 75% of the funds from our corporate members in return for a 20-year membership.
And we had a closing gala to close the curtain on the old theatre and we managed to raise about £1 million that night.
The bulldozers came in in August 1992 and knocked down the old theatre.
We still had about £6 million to raise.
It was a nervous moment.
We raised the money in a boom economy, but we were very fortunate then in building the theatre in a slump.
It's reckoned, generally speaking, that we built a 50 million pounder for 34 million.
He knew there was going to be uproar amongst all the old, traditional audience members, and there was.
He received a lot of letters about it when he finally did take the plunge and decide to go for it.
But it was absolutely the right thing to do.
The building was built on time and on budget.
We won all sorts of awards for the architecture, the brickwork, the concrete work, the woodwork.
And we only missed one season, 1993.
We opened on May 28, 1994 with another new production of The Marriage of Figaro, exactly 60 years after the first night in 1934.
Opera enthusiasts flocked to Glyndebourne in Sussex this evening for the gala opening of the new opera house.
CORKS POP
Champagne, opera and a picnic on the lawn between the acts.
Glyndebourne has been part of the English social scene for 60 years, perhaps the world's most exclusive opera house.
Tonight, the rich and famous, but mostly the rich, came to christen the new opera house.
You paid for this new theatre and for this... ..Glyndebourne and the whole world of opera has a huge debt...
..of monumental proportions owing to you.
What he did was to take his father's dream and turn it into a much bigger dream, which is called New Glyndebourne.
He had the intelligence, the drive to force a new opera house into existence where it would have been easy to say, "We'll just go on improving the old one."
People don't want to lose the old one, but this new house is a totally different level of sound, technical quality from the old one.
That's George's achievement - he's going to leave behind a great opera house.
And now I think they've probably all forgotten about the old theatre and we're now 20 years into this new theatre and it is holding up extremely well.
I think we first put Rosenkavalier into the planning about four years ago.
There'd been a little bit of a dearth of Strauss at Glyndebourne, so we scheduled a new production of Ariadne, which appeared last year, and Rosenkavalier in 2014.
It's lovely for me, because actually I saw the last production of Rosenkavalier - amazingly, I managed to get a dress rehearsal ticket when I suppose I was in my 20s.
I remember seeing that and those amazing costumes by Erte.
And it's wonderful now to see this piece with a very different but equally brilliant creative team behind it.
One of the things that's special about this production is the three leading characters in it - the Marschallin, Octavian and Sophie, all those three singers are singing their roles for the first time.
And that makes it a very special experience, not only for us, but all of them.
I think Glyndebourne has always been about encouraging young artists.
It's never been particularly about having established international stars.
I hope it will give singers their first opportunities here, at whatever stage it is in their career.
Singers like Anna Rajah are at a different stage of their career.
She is a tremendously talented young artist and I hope will return to Glyndebourne in a principal role in the future.
I live in digs, places that Glyndebourne organised near Lewes.
The bus is really close, so every morning it's two minutes for the bus and I'm here.
This is my first professional job, which I'm thrilled about.
I remember being at music college and people talking about,
"Glyndebourne, Glyndebourne, Glyndebourne."
I really wanted to see this place and be part of it.
So when my agent told me that I had an audition with them,
I was absolutely thrilled.
So we'll have choristers this summer who are having their first professional engagement, but we'll have other, more established singers, singing roles for the first time.
I travel from London by train.
And then I get met at Lewes station by a lovely minibus which takes me into the countryside.
That takes me to work, so it's a pretty nice commute, I have to say.
Kate Royal is almost a classic Glyndebourne story.
She came out of the Guildhall just over ten years ago, she sang in our chorus in 2003.
She understudied Pamina in the Magic Flute the next year.
Glyndebourne was my first professional job.
I went to join the Glyndebourne chorus, which is something that a lot of the singers do, and I was given an understudy, which was Pamina, and I got to go on and perform the role twice,
so that was jumping in at the deep end.
And some critics were in that night and it just, from then on,
I had a career!
She's had a trajectory at Glyndebourne which has gone right from starting in the chorus to this wonderful role in Rosenkavalier, which she's singing for the first time at Glyndebourne.
Tara is an extremely special performer and we've known Tara since 2010, when she came here to sing the small role of the Sandman in Hansel and Gretel.
Since that time, she's had a huge career and is now one of the most exciting young mezzo sopranos in international opera.
I stay in Lewes.
It's a gift to be able to walk from your little house across the Downs and down to Glyndebourne!
You can take a walk like this every morning.
You're out here in the air, there's the animals, I mean, when we started at rehearsals here, it was lambing season.
It was the most incredible thing to see every morning.
So you're not only waking up the body, but you're waking up your senses.
It's fab.
I mean, I had no idea...
You know, if you think about it, there is no other opera house like this.
It's really like a little dream.
I remember first seeing the sign "Glyndebourne"
and thinking to myself, "Wow, I can't believe I'm actually here!"
MUSIC: "Also Sprach Zarathustra" from Don Juan Op.20 by Richard Strauss
I started on this one about three years ago.
I was directing something in New York and I spent the first three weeks that I was there on finalising the design for this.
Um...
But the designer, Paul Steinberg, had come to London a few times.
I'd wanted some sort of set that did actually express the wealth of anachronism that's in this.
There's 19th-century Strauss waltzes in it.
I love the three different societies it moves through.
Palace aristocracy... bourgeois life... new money.
And lowlife.
This is a very olfactory piece, as well, Der Rosenkavalier.
There's lots of stuff about smell in it.
But we tried when we designed it to feel that each set provoked a sense of smell.
I mean, we don't pump smells out into the audience or anything scary like that.
First act's like...
That's a very exclusive smell.
Very luxurious smell.
Second act is Faninal's Palace.
That could smell of new chair or new car.
Or kind of the smell you might have in a room where the air conditioning is on too cold.
And the third act, sort of...
that's a bad smell.
That's... er... mouldy carpet...
I won't say...
What was the other?
Oh, ha!
You can't say that on television in a documentary about Der Rosenkavalier!
That the third act should smell of urine!
Strauss, by the age of 29, was already the most famous composer in the world before he even started writing operas and also the most famous conductor in the world.
His reputation was based on symphonic music, basically.
Symphonic poems, like Don Juan or Also Sprach Zarathustra, which everybody knows from 2001.
It begins in C major with this very basic... ..theme and C major to C minor.
No black notes, then the introduction of black notes...
And then...
Absolutely magnificent.
He wrote two successful operas,
Elektra and Salome, which really established Strauss's reputation as a first-rate opera composer.
Hofmannsthal is known principally as the librettist for six of Richard Strauss's operas.
He wrote the play Elektra, which attracted Strauss's attention and then collaborated on five more dramas with Strauss.
He was right at the heart of a creative movement of literary modernism in Vienna and very quickly became part of a group of young writers called Jung Wien
- Young Vienna - who met in the Cafe Griensteidl and he rapidly became the dominant poet of his period.
These dark and bloodthirsty two operas,
Salome and Elektra, were in a sense popular modernism.
This was a kind of decadent, shocking modernism that was highly consumable.
Both Hofmannsthal and Strauss had ideas of wanting to do something comic, something lighter and by the time of Rosenkavalier,
Hofmannsthal wanted to do something not so much a la mode, if you like.
It's not exactly neoclassical, but he's wanting to look back to the 18th century, he's wanting to, as an Austrian, he's wanting to plug in a little bit to the Austrian Catholic sort of heritage, the cultural dramatic heritage.
So they're going back to the Mozart operas and he's going back to French comedy, to Moliere.
Artists like Hofmannsthal, and indeed to some extent, Strauss, who were members if you like of the high bourgeoisie, the lower aristocracy, they, part of them, longed for that world where everything was nicely ordered
and everyone knew where they were and where they were in the class system.
The premiere in Dresden was incredibly successful, so much so that they started putting on special Rosenkavalier trains to ply between I think it was Vienna and Dresden.
Everybody came to see it and then it came to London.
It has been a smash hit ever since.
Right from the start, Rosenkavalier was rejected by some audiences as Strauss stepping back, as a retreat from this exciting, colourful kind of modernism of Salome and Elektra.
When it was first performed in Milan, it was actually leafleted at the Scala - they had leaflets, the Futurists leafleted the audience, as happens sometimes an Italian theatres.
Basically denouncing Strauss for having denied, having absconded from the Modernist path and written this rather aggressive work that had waltzes, which they didn't believe were appropriate at La Scala.
You didn't have waltzes in serious operas because that was associated with operetta.
Salome and Elektra are very advanced chromatically.
Lots of nasty noises.
There's a dissonant sound...
Turns in Rosenkavalier to...
So everybody thinks,
"Ah, he wants to be popular, sentimental", but in fact,
Rosenkavalier in my view is even more sophisticated.
It's longer and it's more symphonically cohesive.
It's a little bit like a Mahler symphony in the sense that very disparate things - folk music, high art, symphonic things that come from Beethoven and everything in between - is brought together in a symphonic unity.
Strauss was interested in himself.
He was interested in the promotion of his music and when the Nazis came to power, he saw an opportunity for himself.
Up to that point, although he was still ostensibly the most famous composer in Germany, he was, in a way, an old man and sort of seen as yesterday's musician.
Remember, before the First World War, he was regarded as a great Modernist, but by the '20s, his music was seen as old-fashioned and he was disregarded by the younger generation of composers.
So, he saw this opportunity when the Nazis came to power to actually occupy the centre stage once again and one way in which he hoped to occupy the centre stage was by assuming a position of responsibility for the rights
of composers, something he had fought for all throughout his life.
What I mean by rights for composers is that when works are performed, the composers get proper royalties for those works and so he was really agitating this and thought that if he would be sympathetic to the new regime, he would get his way.
And he spoke very warmly about the new regime because he thought the new regime was really interested in music and he actually said to one friend, "Thank God we now are in a regime that's interested in music."
And so all through the first years of the Nazi period, all his actions seem to be very much in support of the work the Nazis were doing.
He was never a party member, but at least the beginning of this stage, he was very much demonstrating accommodation to the Nazis.
TRANSLATION FROM GERMAN
Do remember, also in '36, he conducted at the Olympic Games in the opening ceremony.
He wrote a work called the Olympic Hymn, which he conducted.
Strauss put on an opera which was also premiered in Dresden -
Die Schweigsame Frau, where the libretto was by the Jewish writer, Stefan Zweig.
The problem with the collaboration between
Zweig and Strauss was that Strauss was not Jewish and Zweig was, and when the opera was premiered in 1935,
Strauss insisted that Zweig's name appeared on the playbills, not just "comedy after Ben Jonson", but "comedy by Stefan Zweig".
That got him into trouble with the Nazis.
I believe even Hitler was down on the list of attendees for the opening night and as soon as Strauss began to make a fuss, the Nazi bigwigs stayed away.
It was illegal, actually, for an Aryan to collaborate with a Jew.
They wanted to just remove his name from the playbill and when Strauss found this out, he threatened to pull the plug on the whole thing.
And the irony is that Strauss wrote a letter to Zweig saying that he was fed up of his job as president of the Reichsmusikkammer.
He was only play-acting and all he was interested in was good art and preserving good art, and the letter was intercepted by the Gestapo and sent directly to Hitler.
Then he was made to resign, so ironically, although he was a representative of the German Government in '36, he'd fallen out with the hierarchy, but they were able to use him as a kind of puppet for their own propaganda.
The end of the Second World War, when the Americans came into Germany and Strauss was in his villa and he came out and he saw the American soldiers, he immediately introduced himself to the American soldiers.
He said, "I am Richard Strauss, the composer of Der Rosenkavalier."
He said that because he knew it was his most popular opera.
I think the key to Rosenkavalier is in the three central characters.
First of all there's the Marschallin who we see right at the beginning of the opera enjoying a night of passion with her lover, Octavian.
And she's somebody who is very much aware of the passing of time and aware of the fact that Octavian will at some point become bored with her and move on, and indeed, in Richard's production,
there's the sense that she too might become bored with him.
Octavian himself is a very interesting role that Strauss has created.
Very much in a Mozart manner, he has created it as a trouser role.
It's actually...
The character is a man, but played by a woman and confusingly during the course of the opera, the man, Octavian himself, dresses up as a woman, so there's all sorts of confusion and pandemonium that results from that.
The third character is the rather sad character of Sophie, who is just the pawn in Baron Ochs' plans to marry into money.
And she is the person who almost inevitably at the end of the opera falls in love with Octavian and the two of them finish the opera together, leaving the Marschallin back on her own again.
It tends to move chronologically between the 18th century of
Maria Theresa to the period when it was written, which is
1910 to 1912 in Vienna.
Well, I had read Zweig's The World Of Yesterday and the first third is about people who lived in Vienna, actually just before the Rosenkavalier was written.
You get a very strong idea of all those men being voracious readers, voracious consumers of theatre, all intensely hothouse plants, particularly the young Hofmannsthal, who they all idolised.
There were some films I've found - pornography - in this period.
And was amazed how playful and innocent the situations were in these films.
They were nearly all about class, always about masters with maids.
And it's written in the age of burgeoning psychoanalysis.
So, yes, it's a can of worms!
Richard wanted Kate to appear naked, so there's a Spanx under there and a bra under there and then, cos she's put seams in as if it's a garment rather than just a bodysuit.
Because it's all about the skin tone and the different textures, so it's not REAL real, but it looks it from the stage, but you're not quite sure what you're looking at.
The role of the Marschallin is one of those iconic roles for the soprano voice.
And, in all honesty, it took me a long time to say yes and to decide that it was something I felt that I could take on.
She's a very bright and confident and lively woman who just happens to be in this marriage that has forced her into this cage, really.
She is a princess, as well.
In the Austrian way, she has all sorts of different titles, she's the field marshal's wife and she's a princess.
So she's part of the nobility and she's married of course into ancestral wealth and estates and she has a beautiful house and lots of servants and people come to her with petitions and all the rest of it.
So she's at the centre of a social whirl which she is to some extent being slightly subversive of in her own lifestyle.
Well, she is the most interesting character and she does have...
She's a Christian, but her Christianity is not beleaguered by guilt.
And she sees sex as part of nature and she sees it as a very glorious thing.
Very well aware of her position in society, she knows that she cannot step outside of the boundaries.
I think it's her escape, you know, having an affair and we know that it's not just been him, there's been many before.
There'll probably be more after.
But it's her escape and her way of expressing herself, being free and just allowing herself some freedom in an otherwise very strict society.
Octavian is absolutely obsessed with her, she's so lush and exciting.
This is a young guy who is really experiencing life, he's absolutely obsessed with the Marschallin.
She's introduced him to life as a man, so to speak, life in the bedroom.
And this is overwhelmingly exciting.
The role of Octavian was always intended to be cross cast, so sung as a soprano played by a woman.
That means that from the perspective of the audience, what you see is a woman pretending to be a man, pretending to be a woman.
So I spend, let's say, at least 80% of my opera time as a boy.
It's almost the inverse of the scene in Life Of Brian where you've got the stoning scene and you've got men pretending to be women pretending to be men.
But, unlike in Life Of Brian, where it's always quite clear that they are men putting on a falsetto, in the opera, it's always clear that it is a woman because she's singing as a soprano.
Let me tell you, to play a little boy is so much fun!
You can get so dirty, it's all really loose in your body, none of this where ladies have to sit upright and keep their knees together and have great posture - none of that nonsense!
Hofmannsthal certainly was interested in androgyny.
In, if you like, erotically charged same-sex relationships.
And that certainly is then present in Rosenkavalier.
Indeed, one can read the opening to the first act as a sort of lesbian love scene.
It's a sort of safe way of looking at homoeroticism.
It's a slightly titillating and licentious way of looking at female homoeroticism I think, yes.
The starting point is very often our music director and what they want to do.
This summer, we have a new music director, Robin Ticciati, and he has chosen an opera by Strauss.
I am a continuation.
I am joining a train.
The history of the place is huge and carries with it an incredibly deep artistic belief and philosophy and so I want to join that.
We are in the Organ Room at Glyndebourne where there have been many rehearsals with singers and pianists to set up an opera, the beginnings of the opera process.
And...um...
I'm often asked what the conductor does before the orchestra comes in an opera process.
For me, these four weeks, five weeks of just singers, director and pianist is a way of setting up the opera and the scene.
I thought we would start in the middle of Act Two, Baron Ochs.
Baron Ochs has just found Octavian and Sophie together.
And we're left with this noise at 133.
Just five bars of orchestra.
And there's a mixture of trombones, tuba, basset horns, clarinets and you can hear that all immediately in the piano and the whole thing about setting up a relationship with the pianist in the room, it's about creating an energy whereby
the singers can imagine their character, imagine the feeling of the pit, but four weeks before the orchestra arrive.
I mean, even in this third bar, the tuba appears - tell me about the tuba.
You spend years preparing the score.
It's a great sound, isn't it?
It's very dark...
And it all melds into... a strong legato to...
..this extreme chord.
With the timpani.
So you're always thinking orchestrally.
Yes.
The first time we did that, we played it through and then when we were in the scene, I remember just sharing with Duncan a little more of the tuba line and Richard said, "Ah!"
"That's the moment where just Octavian and Sophie
"could just melt back into the atmosphere
"and really feel the presence of Ochs on the scene."
Let's just play it once again with that.
And so it's the idea of creating a palette, orchestral palette, where the singers feel completely in the world of Der Rosenkavalier.
But the first kiss, you know,
Sophie never kissed anyone before in our production and we were really experimenting about the places where there would be stillness.
If you play just before two before 116...
Just that chord.
Just on this...
Or whatever chord it is, that's the beautiful thing about music, no-one has to know, but anyone can feel that.
I think the beautiful thing about Glyndebourne is the fact that it never apologises for the rehearsal length.
This is what we do here.
It gives you an opportunity to go to the heart of a piece of music.
I was very happy to make my debut here because I knew we would have a lot of time and, for this role, we need...
For this opera, we need a lot of time.
Every opera and every important thing that we do in our life must be done with a lot of work and determination and this is the case with Rosenkavalier, with the rehearsal.
Every detail was worked very hard.
SHE SINGS AN EXCERPT
The role of Sophie, it's never a disappointment when you get a perfect Sophie after a perfect Marschallin in Act One.
With a good Sophie, you should, really, more or less forget about the Marschallin until she comes back in Act Three.
Sophie is her father's daughter, there's a sort of feistiness, there's a row between father and daughter in the second act.
She backs down at the last minute when she sees that it's affecting his health.
But she has spirit, she has feistiness.
Sophie is a very young girl, she's 15.
She's innocent, she is very clever and, um... she is looking forward to be married, which is OK.
Strauss is, um... ..a master in putting the music in the right place.
I think the role of Sophie is written in a certain way that it makes Sophie very young.
Strauss uses the orchestra and the various sections and instruments as vocalists, every inch as much of the singers - they play an equal part.
First of all, the way Strauss composed operas, he would read the libretto and when he was reading the libretto he would put in little scraps of melody in the side of the column, so...
At the Presentation of the Rose, in Act Two, he would think of that, or...
Something like that.
That is to say he has little bit of themes like this...
And so forth, which he then puts on a sort of conveyor belt of symphonic continuity, but for that, he has to go to the beginning and then compose through logically.
I suppose the cue for orchestral illustration of human emotions really for Strauss comes particularly from Wagner and the use of the orchestra and of course the leitmotifs.
I mean, for the Marschallin, you have this extremely short motif, you first hear it in the passage where the lower strings are sighing.
And... # Dee-da-dum... #
They're sighing away there, but it's the solo wind, you've got the oboe and then the clarinet and then the flute going...
# Da da-dee dum
# Da da-dee dum... #
And that motif goes through 100 manifestations of the Marschallin's countless changing moods.
Strauss knew immediately the importance of the linking, of how motifs would link material in these operas.
Of course he uses that knowledge with his knowledge of Wagner to actually understand how the motovic material works in Rosenkavalier.
When they're indicating a character, when they're indicating a mood, it's understanding those small, important moments within the score as well, whilst managing to take that whole global approach.
Actually, the orchestra is the storyteller.
The orchestra tells everything.
You don't know your character yet?
No.
OK, so...
This is you.
A lot of people think Glyndebourne is just about singers and people working on the stage.
I'm just going to raise it up and down...
But we're very lucky here that we're able to attract some exceptional craftspeople to come and work here at Glyndebourne.
We have amazing props makers, costume makers, stage crew, people of all kinds of skills and crafts.
And in a way I think we add something extra to the whole community of Sussex by bringing these very wonderful specialists into the community here.
Often they start here commuting from London, then they love Sussex and they come down here and stay.
We have 150 full-time posts here at Glyndebourne.
But that expands to well over 500 in the summer.
It's like a real... craft industry here, cos everybody's so good at it and so wants to do it.
It's quite unusual to find such a level of skill.
The dye shop, the men's tailoring department, you know, there's not one single element which doesn't work.
Richard Jones was really keen that we didn't end up with a very 18th century kind of look for everything.
Really high wigs or all those sort of drapes.
And also to try and allow the performers to still be themselves.
This is a smaller cut of the fleur-de-lis print we did for the servants, which was basically a copy of the set, but Nicky added fleur-de-lis that she'd found online and we went to a traditional printers, locally.
So you've got random images of fleur-de-lis on top of
Paul Steinberg's design of the set, which then...
Jenny did the orange - we had an orange velvet fleur-de-lis here and lots of different trims and tassels all in orange, which upstairs magicked into fabulous costumes.
THEY SING IN GERMAN
I was thinking about the fact that you have so many people on stage, but she still has to stand out.
And I had found a reference for something that was very inspiring - this is a fashion photograph - and it was really inspiring because it was incredibly white and the 18th century is associated with white skin, white wigs.
And I also wanted to really zap the colour up against the white, so it was like a really extreme contrast.
And in the end I found these 19th century seed packets that we then took to the printers.
You know, it's really toxic colour onstage, which is absolutely spot-on.
THEY SING IN GERMAN
'It's just a lovely chance to, not to try and modernise Rosenkavalier, 'because that's impossible.
'The difficulty is with a role like that, 'it's fixed in people's minds as to what they expect.'
Some of the greatest singers have sung her and my job, I guess, is to try to... acknowledge that and be aware of it but also to steer the audience in a new direction.
She's very strong and I think that perhaps in a lot of past productions that hasn't come across so well and she's become a bit of a victim of her own circumstance and I really wanted to try and bring more positivity to her, really.
I think there can be an expectation that the Marschallin should be played, by the actress, as someone who goes on to a sort of default setting of...
depression and dignity.
And I've... ..tried to work against that slightly.
'It was an interesting process trying to find what drives her.'
'She's very well aware of her position in society.
'She knows that she cannot step outside of the boundaries,' so she's coming to terms with that in the piece, coming to terms with her role and how she can fulfil that but still be happy, still be a happy human being.
And she is not an old woman.
She's still beautiful, she's still young.
But she is feeling the ageing process and the specific situation with Octavian being a younger lover, and later, Sophie the girl he falls in love with, leads her to reflect on the larger issues of time and impermanence.
Marschallin is Hofmannsthal's mouthpiece for this sense of - das Gleitende, he called it - where everything is in flux.
The Marschallin is a middle-aged woman having an affair with a young man of 17.
'And effectively trying to stop the clocks by doing it.'
'The libretto is shot through with endless references 'to the present, the past, the future.'
When she talks to Octavian, she says,
"It's going to be heute oder morgen - today or tomorrow."
Time is such an important part of...
Well, the Marschallin talks about it and talks about sometimes she gets up and stops all the clocks.
She can't believe how time...
You're in it and then all of a sudden it just slips away through your fingers and...
Like sand running through a timer, you know?
The text is so, so wonderful, the Hofmannsthal text.
Absolutely extraordinary.
And I think...
Strauss' music is glorious but the text is so...relevant to everybody, really.
I think everyone can identify with the Marschallin, who says,
"How can it be that...
"that I was the young girl and I shall be the old woman,
"and I'm still the same?"
Oh.
Gets me every time when I say that because it's obvious, absolutely obvious, but so true.
And you don't...
You don't realise it.
I think when you're young you think you're going to grow up or you're going to grow old, but inside you're just the same, it's just everybody else...
SHE LAUGHS
REPORTER:
After rehearsal, the cast could relax in the lovely grounds, which are as much a part of a Glyndebourne festival as the performances themselves.
We live in an artistic commune here, really.
I mean, the house is filled with people who are involved with the operas.
That's not something you see in every opera house.
I think that really promotes a very high level of creativity.
Cos when you're happy you can create.
When I first came here, people asked me, "Where are you working?"
And I'd say, and they'd say "Where's that?
What does it do?
Really?"
"Sussex?
An opera company?
No, you're kidding."
When I think of what I learned down here - learned to drive,
I learned to swim.
All kinds of things.
You were here and that was it.
Great parties, amazing parties.
Especially with the chorus.
But...
It was a life.
It was a way of life.
I enjoyed very much this opera house.
What is very beautiful after the rehearsing - the rehearsal - you can go out and see the sheep...
..beautiful nature...
It's just wonderful.
It's like a little piece of heaven.
Got these wonderful gardens to walk in, there's fresh air, you've time to let your head relax.
You have countryside and you have the sheep.
I remember when I first came to Glyndebourne, the first thing I remember were the sheep in the fields.
It's a bit like planet opera and that can become quite oppressive.
It's a little opera bubble, you know?
And it's wonderful.
You know, if you were in London it's a little different.
You might be working in the morning and a bit in the afternoon and then you're somewhere else, in a different world, in a sense.
Well, when you're living at Glyndebourne, this doesn't happen.
I mean, I live in South London and you can sort of long for the trains to draw in at the junction on Vauxhall just so that you can smell the streets.
It's very peaceful but then when you go inside to Glyndebourne, you're working with the music and I just think it's really nice to have both.
You can want to run away, yeah.
REPORTER:
By the croquet lawn, Mr Harvey, the head gardener, trims the flowers in the white border he's designed for this year's display.
'People always think this idea of presenting a silver rose 'to the daughter's nobility 'is a long-established Viennese tradition.'
Hofmannsthal made it up.
He based it on the papal tradition of the church, the Pope, presenting a golden rose to the daughters of the nobility.
And, of course, when Octavian arrives, Strauss gives him a great operatic set piece, which we sit back and think, "This is wonderful."
But, of course, as Adorno, the great Marxist critic said,
"What is the offer?
It's merely a fake rose."
It's not a real one at all, it's a silver rose, it's a fake.
And, of course, it is an incredibly poetic idea.
I mean, people are manufacturing silver roses for people who love Rosenkavalier, you know, because it's such a beautiful thing.
'One of the things I love most is the presentation of the rose because'
Richard has done this extraordinary thing of slightly refocusing that particular scene, so the moment and the beginning when Sophie and Octavian usually fall in love with each other, when they're stammering and stuttering their lines out,
actually becomes a little piece of artifice of the sort of ceremony they're going through, where they actually had to be prompted to say those lines.
But then when they really do fall in love, the choreography of this moment where the two of them are just rocking gently from side to side, I think, is just so beautiful and so touching.
'The presentation of the rose is Octavian's key, 'which is F-sharp major.'
And G-major, which is Sophie's key
Coming together...
F-major.
And so forth.
Sophie and he are perfectly aware that it's an artificial rose - it's been made, as the music is being made.
The point is that there has to be, though, an emotional unity between all the characters.
And Hofmannsthal, when he wrote this marvellous, short summary of Rosenkavalier, he comes up with a phrase at the end - "Eintracht der Lebendigen,"
the unity of everybody living.
Octavian is the glue between Ochs and the Countess, for example, and he comes together with Sophie, and all of the characters on the stage, right down to the serving maids and so forth - they are together in this wonderful unity.
'Everybody... 'depends on each other to have any kind of future.'
In any kind of good existence, we all must depend on each other.
And Richard's made that exceptionally clear.
Yeah, it's a very delicate, lovely piece but, actually, is quite heavy and quite strong and probably could cause someone some kind of anguish.
'Rosenkavalier is the opening production of the 2014 season 'and it's just one of six productions and 76 performances 'we're doing at Glyndebourne this summer.'
REPORTER:
At Victoria Station in the middle of the afternoon it is unusual to see one's fellow travellers in evening dress.
But the train for Glyndebourne leaves at 3:45, so as to be in time for the evening performance.
John Christie wanted people to dress in evening dress to respect the artists.
He said, "The artists have made an effort
"and we as audience members should make an effort."
Mother's coming by car.
Mm.
Father told me.
The first night of the season is the reopening of the theatre that has been closed for several months.
So there's a huge amount of preparation that is needed just to start the festival off again each year.
I suppose we're one of those organisations where we want everything to appear very smooth and there's a lot of paddling that goes on underneath.
So first night's completely nerve-racking for everybody here, not just the artists on the stage, but actually let's not forget the people working front of house.
I will be over there and when I give clearance to the stage manager to say we're ready, I will cue the doors to close on that side.
So you all just need to keep an eye on those doors.
And as soon as that one closes, everybody just follow suit.
OK?
Great.
And is there anything anybody wants to ask me, tell me?
Say?
MAN:
We haven't had any payslips for the last week.
No payslips for last week?
OK.
We were paid...
You were paid, that's the main thing.
REPORTER:
Outside the station, a number of coaches stand by to take the London audience to the Sussex opera house, in time for the evening performance.
Follow that bus.
Glyndebourne?
Right, sir.
It's incredibly important that people come here and have a great experience when they arrive here.
And Jules is one of those remarkable people who cares passionately about how people feel when they're here and has extraordinary levels of customer service, which we're very proud of.
The audience come off the train, get onto the bus, and they get brought up to Glyndebourne and at the end of the evening they're taken back to Lewes Station.
This is our coach park and it's also for chauffeurs.
You can walk wherever you want to and you can bring whatever you want to for a picnic.
We see lots of people here with very lavish picnics.
You can come here with your sandwiches from Marks Spencer if you want to.
And I've done that myself in the past before I worked here and it's a very easy way and relaxed way of spending the interval.
And indeed, if you have a simple picnic, you've got even more time to walk around the grounds.
It's a perfect Glyndebourne day - hot and sunny.
A lot of our audience go to the restaurants but some people bring their own picnics.
And people have their favourite spots as well, so they try and get here as early as they can to grab their favourite place.
The shows start quite early, so it's very light, it's sunny outside and the audiences are there, you can hear the audience having their picnic and doing all of that stuff.
So it is quite hard to focus.
What I'm interested in is value for money.
I've been here once before and that was six years ago.
I've been saving up to come back again and tonight's the night.
Look, the first thing to say is that opera is a very expensive art form, wherever it's put on, Glyndebourne or anywhere else.
I think people often don't do the maths when they go to an opera performance and realise that, you know, take this Rosenkavalier, there are 70 people in the pit playing in the LPO, there's a chorus of 30,
there's another 15-odd principals, there's probably six actors, and there's always people backstage.
Did you want to go in today?
Is it one or two?
Just for me.
Yes, I think I've got one for you.
Being a conductor, you probably like to be over the pit.
PA SYSTEM:
Mr Ticciati, Mr Ticciati, this is your call.
Thankfully, I'm not singing.
BELL RINGS Ah, the bell.
Now for your initiation.
Perhaps we'll see you in the interval.
BELL RINGS
First bell.
Blue circle, box G.
Quickest way is just to go straight ahead there, up to the next level.
OK.
He's just gone...
I mean, he'll be back in a second.

That's fine.

OPERATIC MUSIC BEGINS
A Broadway show doctor says, "Always put in an amazing 11 o'clock number."
And, of course, it's got the best 11 o'clock number of all shows in the form of this trio between these three women.
THEY SING IN GERMAN
'Which is launched by the Marschallin' in this incredibly taxing opening phrase.
It's just so iconic and everyone's waiting for that line.
'It is one of the only moments where we just stand and sing.'
SHE SINGS IN GERMAN
'But then, of course, Sophie dovetails with her 'and at times goes above her.'
'Strauss just pulls it all together 'and produces this extraordinary, affecting moment.'
THEY SING IN GERMAN
'And the way he blends the three voices together in that trio 'is so beautiful.'
'The female voices shamelessly consume you.'
'And they're always rising phrases and climaxes' and it goes on and up and up.
I'm not very articulate about describing music, I just...
I just love it and it seems absolutely... ..right and perfect to me for what he's describing.
THEY SING IN GERMAN
'The Marschallin is engaging in a soliloquy with us 'of remembering things she said in the first act -'
' "I've got to give up this boy,"
' "He's got to go off with this beautiful girl and they're going to
' "marry and I've got to realise that I'm getting older."
'So, in a sense, it is through her eyes.'
It is the farewell to an older world.
And she realises that she has got to move into a new kind of life.
THEY SING IN GERMAN
'I had to really think carefully about how I was going to not allow 'that to affect me and not allow yourself to get 'too emotionally involved, personally involved.'
And that's something which, as a singer, is crucial because if you let yourself go, emotionally, you can't sing, you know?
And nobody wants to see a weeping soprano struggling their way through the trio of Rosenkavalier.
THEY SING IN GERMAN
'Strauss, he understood very well a woman's soul.
The feeling of a young woman like Sophie.
The feeling of an older woman like the Marschallin.
'Octavian, he is in such a difficult position.'

'He's not over the Marschallin but he has to let her go.
'And he knows she's going to walk out that door,' he knows his heart will break, yet he knows that the possible love of his life is just standing on the other side of the room.
So torn.
And he sees that both the women are torn.
He's hurt both of them.
And he can't help both of them.
And it's just this emotional roller coaster with the most incredible music.
The most incredible music.
SHE SINGS IN GERMAN
'And it was the music that was played at Strauss' funeral.'
Where all where all the sopranos fell out, one by one, cos they were all in tears.
It's wonderfully appropriate this season is dedicated to George.
Rosenkavalier, it was our 25th anniversary production, it's here in our 80th year.
It was one of his favourite operas.
He was listening to the music the night before he died.
And I just think it's magical.
I will miss him for his choice of repertoire, directors.
He always had something to say about it.
He knew more about opera than anyone I know.
And I will miss him and his wisdom.
APPLAUSE
I hope in 80 years from now people will be looking back and saying,
"It hasn't changed very much."
Because although we innovate and we find new ways of doing things, the core of Glyndebourne has always been exactly the same.
And I often think,
"What would John Christie think now if he looked at Glyndebourne?"
And I think he would say,
"That's great, they're still doing fantastic work.
"They're still giving their audiences an amazing experience.
"They're still looking after young artists."
Which was very important to him.
But the thing I think he would be really surprised about would be the range and breadth of what we're doing.
And I hope he would be absolutely thrilled we're reaching a vast audience that in 1934 he could never even have dreamt of.
Hot in Cleveland is recorded in front of a live studio audience.
Where is Melanie?
She should be back from her date with Mitch by now.
Joy, honey, you got to stop torturing yourself, and tell Melanie you are in love with Mitch.
I can't.
Things would be so much simpler if she weren't my friend.
I could slash her tires.
Shave her head while she's sleeping.
Put hot sauce in her eye drops.
Instead, I did none of those things and they are probably having sex right now.
No, it's only the third date.
Melanie doesn't put out on third date.
You see Joy, a third date is when a man likes you enough to ask you....
I've had third dates.
Really?
With the same man?
Calm down Joy.
I mean Melanie's hobbling around in a cast.
I doubt he finds that a turn on.
She'll find some way to make that broken toes sexy and cute.
That gimpy tramp.
Melanie, darling!
How was your date?
Oh, were you on a date?
I can't remember.
- Yeah, I broke up with Mitch.
It's over.
- Oh, thank God.
My prayer's have been answered.
Don't use your eye drops.
What's going on?
Oh, Melanie, I need to tell you something.
Have a seat.
You remember when I left that message, saying I met the man I was going to marry.
Yes, of course.
Oh, my God, Joy.
You didn't mean Mitch.
Yes.
So this whole time we've been going out, you've kept that a secret?
That must have been torture.
Only when I saw him at work or you at home.
Honey, I'm so sorry.
Why didn't you say something?
I was really never into him.
Well, I am.
So how should I play this?
What's my next move?
Well, he was really upset when I left.
It's from Mitch.
He wants me to come over.
What are you gonna do?
Well, it's late, and he's vulnerable, so I really shouldn't take advantage of that situation.
But I've just typed that I'm on my way over.
So there's no way to take that back now.
And send.
Mitch?
Joy.
Come on in.
I'm having champagne... to celebrate drinking this bottle of bourbon.
Look, I'm sorry you and Melanie broke up.
She dumped my fat ass.
Mitch, you're not fat anymore.
I thought that losing 300 pounds would be good for my heart, but it wasn't.
It's broken like every lawn chair I ever sat on.
Okay, I can see you're in kind of a dark place right now.
Wrong.
I'm having a party.
I invited all my old girlfriends:
Little Debbie, Dolly Madison,
Mrs. Butterworth.
Mitch, I've been where you are a bunch of times, and you just have to get through the part where everything hurts.
But eventually you'll find someone who appreciates all the wonderful, wonderful things about you.
I thought she was the one.
Is there anything worse than wanting someone so badly and they're right there and they don't want you back?
No, there isn't.
What did I do wrong, Joy?
Should I not have looked into her eyes and said, "I was lost until I met you"?
No, that's a nice thing to say.
And was I wrong to touch her cheek like this?
No, that's a lovely thing to do.
When I was so desperate to kiss her, was I wrong to lean in...
Oh... just do it.
- Joy?
- Yes, Mitch.
I don't feel so good.
I'm on hold.
My agent says it'll really help my Oscar bid if I can be the face of a major charity.
I want to be a unicorn ambassador.
That's UNICEF ambassador.
Well, that sounds a little less magical, but it makes more sense.
Ah, hello?
Yes, um, just a moment.
One of my third-world adopted children needs my attention.
Shinktawa.
You finish your sandwich.
Other children are starving in the country that you come from.
So I understand that you've been looking for a new celebrity spokesperson, and... uh-huh.
Oh, well...
How nice for her.
Okay.
Good-bye.
So get this:
Salma Hayek is now the spokesperson for UNICEF.
That selfless bitch.
Well, I just talked to Mitch on the phone.
He doesn't even remember me coming over last night.
All he wanted to talk about were his crazy plans to win Melanie back.
I mean, what has she got that I haven't got?
Shut up, Elka.
I didn't say anything.
Boobs.
Hi, guys.
How'd it go with Ross Barkley?
Who's Ross Barkley?
He's the publisher of the Cleveland Plain Dealer.
Wait a minute.
Ross Barkley?
Isn't he also the billionaire who runs the hunger charity
People Feeding People?
Yeah, that's the guy.
I'm helping Elka with her campaign for city council, so I went to him for an endorsement, and I'm sorry, Elka.
He said no.
But I need his endorsement to win.
I sang your praises.
I mean, I was so charming, he even asked me out on a date.
But he is going to endorse councilman Powell.
It's gonna be in the paper on Sunday.
Well, then go out with him tonight and fix it.
And while you're out with him, ask him to make me the new spokesperson for People Feeding People.
Can you believe these two?
Basically asking me to prostitute myself.
Do it.
Do it tonight.
I need Mitch to see that you've moved on.
Take this guy to the bar,
I'll bring Mitch, he'll see you being all prostitutey with Ross Barkley, and I'll be there to pick up the pieces.
So you want me to sleep with this guy to further all your selfish interests?
No one said you had to sleep with him.
But we're not forbidding it.
Great.
You know what, you guys always do this to me.
You guilt me into doing something that I shouldn't be doing.
And it really hurts my feelings that this is how you play me.
Melanie's right.
It's okay if I die alone.
And Victoria never gets her Oscar.
And surely Elka has another 92 years to run for office.
The important thing is that you don't have to suffer through one dinner with a billionaire.
Nice try, guys.
Not this time.
Five, four, three, two...
Oh, forgot the foot.
Three, two...
Fine.
I'll do it!
Thank you.
So Bono says to me,
"Ross, you're never gonna use the helicopter."
Yeah, I think you told me that one already.
This is a different yacht.
Oh, my God.
Melanie's here on a hot date.
I had no idea.
What a painful and clear reminder to you that she's moved on.
Who's that lug in the suit?
Oh, my.
That's Ross Barkley, the billionaire playboy.
She's had her eye on him for a while.
Well, since there's no chance of winning her back, we should go somewhere else.
There's a wine bar on the lake not far from here.
No, no, no, no.
If I'm gonna move on,
I need to figure out if she's really into this guy.
Fine, but it could be devastating.
Luckily I have these very bare shoulders for you to cry on.
So we both want something from Ross Barkley.
You want his endorsement for city council, and I want to be a spokesperson for People Feeding People.
Now, the chances of both of us getting what we want are slim.
I know.
I'll go first.
No, I'll go first.
Fine, you go first.
Wait.
Why did you give in so easily?
You think he'll turn me down, and then he'll feel bad, and then he'll say yes to you?
I'll go second.
Perfect.
I'll go first.
Oh, that's what you wanted all along.
Uh, this is like that game, where one of the wine glasses has poison in it, and you don't know which one it is.
Calm down, Victoria.
And drink your wine.
So Jerry Jones says to me,
"you know more about football than any man I've ever met."
And this is Jerry Jones talking.
Yeah, still don't know who that is.
Joy, you know Melanie's tells.
What is she feeling right now?
Well, I do know that that's the look Melanie gives when she's really into someone.
Really?
Looks like she wants to be somewhere else.
Yeah, in his bed.
If Melanie looks like she's having a good time, she really isn't.
But if she looks bored and disgusted, she's having a great time.
Really?
And if she's stifling a yawn...
She's stifling an orgasm.
So anyway, I just started hosting a radio talk show called Ask Melanie.
You're Ask Melanie?
You know my show?
No...
I almost called in a few times.
I'm a huge fan.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Look at that smile.
That means she's not into him, right?
Oh, that's not a real smile.
That's just gas.
She's like a baby.
Once she burps, it'll be gone.
So the secret to my job, and it took me a while to learn this, is to be 100% nonjudgmental.
Oh, that is so good to hear.
Because the thing I wanted to ask you on the radio,
I can't tell anyone.
You can tell me now.
See, I was in a plane crash in the mountains of Peru.
Oh, my God.
That must have been terrible.
I was the sole survivor.
Once the food ran out,
I really only had one horrible option.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Yes.
Wow.
She looks nauseous.
I'm really jealous.
She never looked at me like that.
You know, everyone thinks it'll taste like chicken.
It doesn't.
It tastes like whitefish.
How is your whitefish, by the way?
It's okay.
Hello.
Ross Barkley, right?
I'm Victoria Chase, and I'm a huge fan of People Feeding People.
I don't mean to offer myself up to you on a platter, but...
I'd really like to be your spokesperson.
And I know you're busy right now, but I thought maybe sometime we could get together and chew the fat and flesh out some ideas.
And if you have any questions, just feel free to grill me.
Are you not listening?
He's a cannibal.
He eats people.
He ate one person, Melanie.
Don't exaggerate.
We've all done things.
Yeah, we ate that eggplant dish you made last week.
Look, the man's plane crashed.
It was the only way he could survive.
Any one of us in that situation would have done the same thing.
Suppose you're right.
Oh.
There you go.
And could you just try to look a little more into him, like his cannibalism was just a loveable quirk?
Fine.
Okay, I'll ask.
Do we taste like chicken?
No.
Whitefish.
Fish?
We taste like fish?
Pork I could believe, but fish?
Huh.
I thought we'd be chewy, not flaky.
Melanie, humans tasting like fish doesn't even make sense.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm deferring to the man who actually ate human flesh!
What did Melanie say?
I'm sorry, Mitch.
She's crazy about him.
She thinks he's the sexiest man she's ever met.
Really?
Him?
I'm in better shape than he is.
Oh, Melanie hates guys who work out too much.
The bigger, the better, that's her motto.
Oh, my God.
That's it.
Melanie's into bigger guys.
That's why she broke up with me.
She likes a man with meat on his bones.
Apparently she's not alone.
Why did I lose all that weight?
Stupid, stupid, stupid.
Okay, now's my chance.
I'm gonna go win her back.
Oh, Mitch, that's not a good idea.
Melanie, give me one month.
I'll gain 100 pounds.
What are you talking about?
I'm too thin, right?
I'm not your type.
That's why you like Ross.
You need something to grab on to.
- Is that what joy said?
- Yes.
Well, my secret's out.
I like big guts, and I cannot lie.
Hey, so what do you weigh, buddy?
Two bills?
2 1/4?
That used to be my left leg.
Hear that Melanie.
You didn't even eat your bread.
Dude, I used to sweat butter.
You call yourself big?
No, I don't.
Who are you?
I'm your worst nightmare.
I'm the guy that's gonna gain 300 pounds and steal your girl.
Hold up there.
I need some dessert.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm fine.
Right now nothing can me.
Well, I was happy to help, Ross, but now it is time to put the whole thing behind you.
- Not yet.
- Mm.
There is one more thing I need to confess.
No, really?
Because, like I tell my callers, sometimes it's best to keep things bottled up.
I liked it.
I liked the taste.
It was delicious.
I've been chasing that taste ever since.
So close.
He ate a man, and he liked it.
Come on, Melanie.
Put that to a catchy tune, and it's a Katy Perry song.
Joy makes an excellent point.
Now who thinks Melanie should get back to her date with a cannibal?
No, I'm not gonna do it.
It's one date.
And you can't break up with him now.
Mitch will think you're still available.
And Victoria needs the charity cred, and dear, sweet Elka needs her endorsement.
Oh, bless you, my angel.
You're doing it again.
You guilted me into this date, and now you think you can guilt me into sticking with it.
Well, it's not gonna work.
Not this time.
So you're ending the date?
No.
But you're never gonna do anything for us like this again?
No, I probably will.
Then what was the point of that outburst?
I don't know.
Melanie speaks very highly of you, Elka.
Why don't you tell me why you want to be on the city council?
To serve man.
With your help, I could eat my opponent for breakfast.
Melanie.
You told her?
No.
What?
No.
The way I see it, there are two people you could endorse.
One is a football hero.
The other knows you eat people.
You know what, I may have said something, but she really does deserve your endorsement.
Okay, fine.
She's got it.
Really?
That's great.
Okay.
And while you're being so generous, my friend, Victoria, would make a great spokesperson for your charity, People Feeding People.
- Done.
- Really?
Yay!
Lip-reader.
Of course she's attracted to him.
Look at this Wikipedia page.
He's rich.
He's won a Pulitzer Prize.
He...
- Oh, my God.
- What?
Flight 577.
That plane that crashed in Peru ten years ago.
Ross was on that plane...
The only survivor.
- I got to go talk to him.
- Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Excuse me, Mr. Barkley, I'm so sorry about before.
I was way out of line.
Is it true that you were on flight 577?
Yes, I was.
My best friend Mark Greaves was on that plane.
My God, I sat next to him.
Did you talk to him?
Yes, he was a great guy.
Very friendly.
He was a fashion designer, right?
Yes.
He had great taste.
Yes, he really did.
Melanie's the first woman I've been interested in since my divorce.
Maybe there's just no one out there for me.
No, there is.
Honestly, she's there.
At the market.
In a bookstore.
On a couch.
I'm a pretty good detective.
Maybe I could help you find her.
You are a good detective.
We're a great team.
We're like Nick and Nora Charles in The Thin Man.
Oh, I love those movies.
Really?
Me too.
I've got one DVR'd.
We could watch it right now.
I'd love to.
You're a great girl, Joy.
I can't believe that Simon guy left you twice.
How do you know about Simon?
I do my research.
I also know you got stood up at the altar;
you were briefly married to Victoria;
you got dumped by a homeless guy.
Yeah, yeah, you did your research.
You deserve better.
You're so beautiful and sensitive and caring.
You really think I'm beautiful and...
And, well, to be honest,
I pretty stopped listening after "beautiful."
You know who else is beautiful?
- Melanie?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's watch the movie.
Thanks for being here for me, Joy.
It's my pleasure.
Hey, you know what?
Maybe we could help each other find someone.
I could help you find a new Simon;
you could help me find someone exactly like Melanie.
Oh, yes.
Won't that be fun?
Dolphins - the cleverest creatures in the ocean.
Spy creatures delve into their secret lives to reveal new surprising behaviour and yet more mysterious events.
Encounter the greatest dolphin in the ocean and discover their family secrets.
Hitch a ride on the back of a dolphin.
And take a leap into another world.
In South Africa, a super pod of common dolphins is on the move.
Spy Dolphin joins them and films from the camera in its eye.
The dolphins are after a special meal, one only served up at this time of year.
The feast happens every winter, but in the vast ocean, it's difficult to find.
To track it down, they must work as a team.
(Whistling)
Speed is everything.
They must beat other predators to the meal.
By working together, they gain the advantage.
And here it is - the greatest fish migration on the planet.
The sardines may number millions, but to catch them, they must still work as a team.
They dive deep beneath the shoal and start to herd it upwards.
The fish stick together for safety.
The dolphins' task is to break down their defences.
(Whistling)
They use loud calls and bursts of bubbles to help drive them.
(Whistling and chattering)
The shoal fragments into more manageable bait balls.
Now the feeding begins.
But sardines are never eaten alone.
Gannets have been watching from above.
They seize the moment.
(Screeching)
Gannets aren't the only gatecrashers.
Bronze whaler sharks join the party.
The dolphins wisely beat a retreat just in the nick of time.
A 13-metre Bryde's Whale.
And he's not the only ocean giant attracted by the gathering.
The world's largest dolphin is here too the orca.
Orcas always travel as a family and they too rely on teamwork.
(Whistling)
But they aren't after the sardines.
They're here for the dolphins.
They dive deep to take them by surprise.
A close shave for the dolphin...
and a disappointment for the orcas.
But working as a family, they will gain plenty more chances.
In neighbouring Mozambique, Spy Turtle is following a pod of bottlenose.
He's one of many different spy creatures who have been watching how these dolphins work together as a team.
(Clicking)
Spy Baby joins the underwater menagerie.
This new remote-controlled spy creature also has cameras for eyes.
He's on the trail of a young male that has just left his mother's pod.
He's having to survive without the support of family or friends and it's not something he likes very much.
He unearths a tubeworm - not the quality of seafood he's used to.
(Squeaks)
He's in need of company, and for now, the new spy creature will do nicely.
(Chatters)
Spy Baby records his lonely call... (Whistling)
...then plays it back to him.
(Whistling)
The dolphin responds with his signature whistle.
And Spy Baby plays this back as well.
(Whistling)
These unique whistles are used like names, repeating the call is a sign of friendship.
He picks up a mangrove seed and presents it to Spy Baby.
It's another friendly gesture.
Offering gifts is common among dolphins, but Spy baby can never be the companion he needs.
(Squeaks)
He must find real dolphins if he is to thrive in this new stage of life.
To discover more about single dolphins, the spy team enlists some special support.
In the Caribbean, there is a bottlenose dolphin with a very useful talent.
He's happy to carry tiny cameras into the wild.
Each day, this tame dolphin is given free rein to explore the open ocean.
He returns when he wishes with a recording of his adventures.
From this unique position, it's clear how he glides through the water with such ease.
Powerful beats of his tail give him perfect control as he searches for company.
But another dolphin finds him first.
(Whistling)
He could hear his call from ten miles away.
By happily swimming side-by-side, they show they're friends.
Only dolphins that know each other come this close.
(Squeaks)
They partner up as they start looking for a meal.
Despite the wealth of fish life on the reef, the dolphin has learnt to be choosy.
Many fish are distasteful or poisonous.
Up ahead is a barracuda - a wholesome meal.
But it's quick and has a nasty nip.
It's not worth the trouble.
A giant snapper presents the next opportunity.
But it too is armed to the teeth and best avoided.
Surprisingly, the barren seabed offers the easiest possibilities.
(Clicking)
He scans it with sonar, moving his head like a minesweeper.
When he finds a hidden fish, he ID's it by upping the sonar's intensity.
(Clicking intensifies)
A tasty titbit for all the effort.
Single dolphins have to rely on their personal skills and abilities for everything.
It's a different matter for those that hunt as a pod.
In South Carolina, bottlenose take teamwork to a whole new level.
The results are spectacular.
Fish explode onto the shore.
They just have to be plucked from the mud.
Spy Dolphin moves in for a closer look.
He follows as the dolphins patrol the shallow creeks to find yet more fish shoals.
(Whirring)
The technique requires close cooperation.
But one dolphin makes the final decision, selecting which mud bank to use.
He then leads the charge.
The fish leap and panic, right onto the shore.
The dolphins may hunt like this 15 times on each low tide.
These techniques are only known by a few local individuals and they have to be learnt by younger members of the group.
Stranding is a serious hazard for dolphins.
But these have mastered the knack.
As dolphins are so intelligent, they can tailor the way they catch food to exploit specific local conditions.
(Sonar clicking)
In Mozambique, the dolphin that's left his pod still cuts a lonely figure.
His task now is to find a companion.
And Spy Baby doesn't measure up to the job.
(Clicking)
But Spy Baby soon spots someone who might.
But it's not a bottlenose.
It's a rare humpback dolphin - a different species entirely.
Regardless, the young bottlenose still seems interested.
And something extraordinary appears to be happening.
They seem to be making friends.
This is the first time such a peculiar partnership has ever been filmed.
They strengthen their relationship by swimming close together.
It may not be a match made in heaven, but at least it's company.
Orcas are never lonely - their families stay together for life.
British Colombia has among the highest number of orca pods in the world.
The family is led by the eldest female, while her daughters and granddaughters follow behind.
Unlike most dolphins, the males stay with their family.
His dorsal fin is nearly two metres high.
They stay together for life and any hunting knowledge gained is kept exclusively within the group.
A calf learns the family secrets from an early age.
What he knows depends on which pod he's in.
This pod specialises in hunting fish.
And as salmon migrate into the bay, the whales are in for a treat.
The orcas know just how to catch them and stealth is not required.
They rely on shock and awe.
They make as much noise as possible, slapping the water with their two-metre wide tails.
(Water crashes)
The shockwaves stun or disorientate the fish.
And breaching adds to the confusion.
They then charge into the shoal, knocking the fish for six.
Each orca must catch 50 salmon a day.
And their group skills make sure that none go hungry.
Another nearby pod favours completely different food.
They specialise in catching dolphins and seals.
They've acquired a different set of skills geared to outsmarting their quick-thinking prey.
They spot their food by "Spy Hopping".
A wake may be the only sign.
They check again.
It's just what they've been looking for.
Dall's Porpoises - the fastest dolphins in the ocean.
They reach speeds of over 35 miles per hour.
Orcas nearly match them for speed, but the porpoises are much more manoeuvrable.
As the orcas dive, they switch to stealth mode and try to sneak up undetected.
But the porpoises just keep on accelerating.
The orcas' endurance is tested to the limit.
And the porpoises race to freedom.
The orcas look for far easier prey.
A lone sea lion is an unsuspecting target.
Despite living close to one another, the pods that hunt mammals never interact with those that catch fish.
They not only pursue different prey, they even have different calls and dialects.
Back in Mozambique, another spy creature joins the surveillance team.
This is Spy Puffer, a puffer fish with a camera in its mouth.
He immediately starts filming the young male and his humpback friend.
They seem to be getting along just fine.
A second puffer fish joins - this one has cameras for eyes.
They make a great double act.
One films forwards, the other sideways.
They immediately prove popular!
(Whirring)
Close by, Spy Baby has found yet more dolphins.
It's a gang of young males that have also just left their mothers.
They seem totally unfazed by their first meeting with Spy Baby.
(Chattering and squeaking)
These young males hang out together, both for company and to share knowledge.
The young bottlenose may have made a friend, but it's the wisdom of the crowd he needs.
He cautiously approaches the gang with the humpback by his side.
He whistles out with his name, but there's no guarantee he'll be accepted, especially with his strange friend in tow.
The humpback stays close as the bottlenose tries to join the pod.
He's seeking reassurance from his friend.
A pod doesn't accept newcomers willingly - even those of the same species.
A dolphin starts to drive the humpback away.
(Chattering and whistling)
(Squeaks)
And anyway, humpbacks tend to prefer their own company.
As he turns to leave, his bottlenose friend must decide whether to stay or join him.
But to the bottlenose, it's clear where his choice should be.
As the humpback returns to a solitary life, his friend chances his luck with the motley crew.
The pod has a strong hierarchy but he has an unusual method to wheedle his way in.
(Chattering)
He begins to act like a female - deploying feminine charm to win them over.
It seems to be working.
They even perform mating rituals.
By discovering his feminine side, he's gradually accepted.
Every male undergoes this initiation rite before he is allowed to join the gang.
This is his new family now and he'll soon be party to everything they know.
Such strange rites of passage have never been filmed before and have previously been mistaken for males attacking females.
In other parts of the world, more strange rituals are still being discovered.
Recently, in Shark Bay, Western Australia, some bottlenose dolphins have taken to wearing what look like hats.
They're actually sea sponges, which they balance on their noses.
This is the first time this behaviour has been filmed but the reason they carry them remains a mystery.
One thought is that they use them to protect their noses as they root around in the sand.
But some look a bit big for the job!
As they live in such cloudy water, the real reason has yet to be confirmed.
(Blows air)
Sometimes...
mysteries just add to an animal's intrigue.
Just a few miles away, the unique behaviour of another bottlenose pod is better understood.
Each day they enter this shallow bay.
(Chatter)
They seek the fish that gather around the shoreline.
As the fish dart away they instinctively head to the shore, where it's too shallow for dolphins.
But this is all part of the dolphins' strategy.
Fish that make a break for it are chased right back.
As usual, the young are watching and learning.
The fish soon fringe the shallows.
But they've been lulled into a false sense of security.
The dolphin now steps on the accelerator, powering into the dangerously shallow water.
The sudden turn of speed raises her back clean out of the water.
A few thrusts from the tail and she hydroplanes across the surface, covering ten metres in less than a second.
Using this technique, she easily outpaces the surprised fish and also avoids becoming stranded.
It's a skill known only by the dolphins of Shark Bay.
(Gulls cry)
In South Carolina, some bottlenose pods have found a far easier way to get a meal.
They simply learn the routines of the local shrimping boats.
When their nets are ready to be hauled, the dolphins rush out to join them.
And grab any dead or injured fish that fall through.
But sometimes even that much effort's not required.
The unwanted catch is thrown back into the sea and into the mouths of the waiting dolphins.
It's the ultimate breakfast buffet.
Dolphins may be incredibly inventive, but they are also clever enough to grab a takeaway when they can.
They are ever adaptable, constantly watching and learning new skills.
In Mozambique, the young bottlenose has been in the gang for many weeks.
And from them has picked up many new talents along the way.
He's also found a new friend.
Most males have a best mate within a pod.
Once formed, this bromance can last a lifetime.
As ever, Spy Creatures watch their every move.
The mock turtle is already proving a hit.
And so are the puffers.
The young male gives his newfound friend a guided tour.
(Squeaking and clicking)
The pair are becoming inseparable.
The reef is a rich stomping ground for these teenage tearaways.
The young male learnt most of his skills from his mother.
But he's making a whole new set of discoveries with his latest pals.
A real puffer fish offers the chance for bored teenagers to have some fun.
He tries to hide, but he won't get off that lightly.
His next defence is to inflate like a ball.
Now the game can really begin.
Playing catch is a great pastime.
They take turns to carry and pass it between each other.
But something far more extraordinary seems to be happening.
When attacked puffer fish release a neurotoxin.
In high doses it can kill, but in small doses it has a narcotic effect.
It seems to be affecting the dolphins.
They appear totally blissed out by the whole experience.
And remarkably, all take turns in passing the puffer around.
This is the first time that apparent recreational drug use has been documented in dolphins.
With the dolphins otherwise engaged, the puffer deflates.
He's free to go on his way.
It looks like they will be distracted for quite some time.
Back in the Caribbean, the camera dolphin shows just how much he interacts with other dolphins.
If another dolphin calls... (Whistling) ...he immediately answers.
(Chatter and whistling)
He uses dozens of different calls, telling all the dolphins in the local area where he is and what he's doing.
(Bellow-like call)
The lips of the blowhole act like a mouth, adjusting the sound.
(Clicking)
Before long his calls are answered.
(Squeaking)
In murky water it's the only way they can stay in contact.
Different pods have different dialects or accents, and each sound has a specific meaning.
(Chatter)
They hear a far greater range of frequencies than we can, so we can only eavesdrop on a fraction of their conversations.
(Chatter and whistling)
Blasts of bubbles add emphasis to what he's saying.
And special calls are reserved for the opposite sex.
Some of their sounds are quite bizarre.
(High-pitched yelping)
(Bellow-like call)
This is actually a love song and it seems to be working.
The females allow him to approach but not for long!
(High-pitched yelping)
(Bellow-like call)
He catches up and this time the females wait for him.
He checks her out.
But she's still nursing, so of no interest at all.
(Whines)
He takes a deep breath.
Time for a well-earned rest after all his efforts.
He starts to go to sleep.
And the fish play dare around their snoozing predator.
Dolphins have a bizarre way of sleeping.
Each half of their brain rests in turn, allowing the other half to stay awake and alert to danger.
In Mozambique, the male pod is still very much awake.
And Spy Squid is on filming duty.
He's found a hawksbill turtle.
Squid takes a closer look.
But he needs to be careful.
A potato cod has him in his sights.
Squid beats a retreat.
And then goes back to work.
It's not a moment too soon - the pod is chattering with excitement.
(Chatter)
The two friends stick close together as the reason for their concern becomes clear.
(Whistling)
Another gang of males is approaching.
The home pod takes up defensive positions as the two groups square up for a territorial fight.
Then... it all kicks off.
(Chatter and whistling)
When two pods come together the existing hierarchy can break down.
It's how new groups and alliances are formed.
The pair decide that, for now, they're safer on their own.
They leave the rest to fight it out.
They may rejoin the pod when things calm down.
Bottlenose can choose when to be social or alone, but some dolphins don't have this option.
It's late summer in Patagonia and the beaches are packed with breeding sea lions.
(Barking)
And as their young are about to enter the water, an orca pod arrives like clockwork.
They are a family that has hunted here for generations, and they have devised a spectacular way to get a meal.
The adult sea lions are wise to their plan and usually see them coming.
But the new pups aren't so smart.
The orcas patrol the surf zone waiting for one of them to make a mistake.
Sooner or later they have to enter the water.
And this is when the orcas strike.
A near miss, but she'll have plenty of other chances.
(Barking and grunting)
But when it comes to catching sea lion pups, there is one orca better than all the rest.
The expert is a 50-year-old-male, who's hunted these waters all his life.
The technique is a family tradition, and training starts at an early age.
They have been hunting sea lions like this for generations.
Each orca uses their own subtle variations, but none is as accomplished as the old male.
(Sea lion honks)
This should be suicidal for a ten-ton Orca.
Around the world hundreds die from stranding each year.
Even he seems to be struggling.
But he has survived for half a century.
He clearly knows what he's doing.
He's never left high and dry.
Even in a pod where skills are shared, there is always one individual who outshines the rest.
Despite the value of working in a pod, in Mozambique, the two dolphin friends discover there can be advantages to being independent.
They meet a group of females and are already faring better for being on their own.
A female has even started to show some interest:
Flirting with the young male.
(Chatter)
Things are going well, but the pair won't be alone.
His best friend plays gooseberry in this new romance.
Not put off, the female shows her interest by some seductive moves.
She also blushes pink - a total giveaway!
And there's nothing subtle about her fin slaps.
Yet all the time the courting pair are accompanied by the young male's friend.
But this best mate has a job to do, watching his friend's back while he's otherwise engaged.
He chases off other males that might muscle in.
In dolphin world it's what best friends are for.
And to guarantee success the courting male gathers a bouquet of seaweed for the new love of his life.
As the happy couple play with the garland their relationship is complete.
It seems that the friend isn't doing too badly either - he's found himself a girlfriend too.
It's a match made in underwater heaven.
Back in the Caribbean the camera dolphin is doing what dolphins love the most- racing through the waves.
Like all the dolphins we've seen, he has taken us on an incredible journey into his secret world.
He then treats us to something extraordinary.
He barrel rolls with joy.
Then, for the first time...
the view from his back as he leaps.
Dolphins are the cleverest creatures in the ocean.
And as they have shown us, they certainly have the most fun.
Out on the reef, Spy Squid goes on one last adventure.
He soon meets his arch-enemy:
The potato cod.
Another joins...
And yet another.
This doesn't look good.
He valiantly keeps filming but he's completely surrounded.
And then... catastrophe.
Among the fishes he rests in pieces.
But like all the Spy Creatures...
his job is done.
Sheila Amanda Sazs, will you marry me?
Yes, I will marry you.
- I want to go legit.
- You can't.
Then I get Lola Jensen to hack into the bar and just put me in there, just like she did with Harvard.
Rule number one of not getting caught, you don't move the goddamn body.
Harvey, I'm stuck.
I can't live my whole life like this.
You want me to set up your new corporation?
I want you to join my new corporation.
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.
Our job blows yours out of the water.
Scottie, I need you to give Louis his transaction back.
Does this have something to do with that favor he did you?
- Yes.
- Tell me what it is.
- I can't.
- Guess we're not sharing everything with each other after all.
- Scottie.
- You can't have it both ways, Harvey.
- Louis, I don't want kids.
- What are you talking about?
I don't like kids.
I was willing to give up Harvard for you.
You can't give up something for me?
I understand.
Can I just say something please?
I know you keep saying that I won't feel this way forever, but why is it when the guys shows up with chicken vindaloo 40 minutes late with no naan and no silverware, instead of throwing the chutney in his face,
I'm thanking him and I am tipping him $20?
Do you want to tell me why that happens?
I don't care.
I hate myself.
I hate my life.
The woman I love is gone, my heart is broken, and I really-- to be honest with you,
I just don't have the will to live.
[Beeps]
Hold on.
It's my associate.
Katrina.
Louis, it's 7:55.
Yeah.
I have an 8:00 a.m.
Please cover it for me.
In fact, cover everything, and unless the building is on fire and Sheila's in it,
I'm not coming in.
Louis, what happened?
You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
My heart's been shattered into a thousand million pieces, and if I can't put my heart into my work, then I'm not gonna do any work at all, so...
How long do you think you'll be out?
I don't know.
Today, tomorrow, the rest of the year.
You know, just don't call here again because I'm not gonna answer the number.
Doc?
Dr. Lipschitz?
Hello?
What, are you shitting me?
That was not 50 minutes.
Waiting outside for me?
Bold gesture.
I called you three times.
I had to do something.
- You must be feeling bad.
- I am.
What for?
You're just doing your job.
Scottie, I'm sorry.
What happened with Louis, I didn't like doing it.
- Yeah, but you still did it.
- And what I'm doing now is asking you to let it go.
Harvey, it's not that you picked Louis over me.
It's that you wouldn't tell me why.
I couldn't tell you why.
There's a difference.
And I'm asking you to trust me.
Okay.
I can let it go, but keeping things from me just can't keep happening, okay?
I can't tell you whether or not that's okay, and I definitely can't tell you why.
Too soon?
What are you going to do to make it up to me?
Nothing right now.
I'm taking Mike to the marathon footwear brunch.
You're taking a date to an I.P.O. event?
That's so cute.
It's not a date.
He's never gonna put out.
Well, it's too bad that you're not taking me because I was thinking of letting you...
[Whispers indistinctly]
Mr. Specter.
James Quelling.
I'm in a bit of a hurry, Mr. Quelling.
- I want to do you a favor.
- I don't need any favors.
Yeah, you do, unless you want Friday's headline to read,
"Marathon Footwear builds playgrounds that kill children."
My client builds playgrounds that help children.
And uses a synthetic full of toxins to do it.
Look, I don't know who you are, but I know what you're trying to do, and it isn't gonna work.
Look, I'm a reasonable man.
This is a huge moment for your client.
I won't file this before Friday.
You think I'm gonna let you extort my client?
No, I think you're gonna protect your client from a claim that could ruin them.
In fact, I'm counting on it.
Nice offices.
Enjoy that brunch.
- I got a job offer.
- Holy shit.
From who?
Last night.
Jonathan Sidwell.
But I thought Louis was his lawyer.
He doesn't want me to be his lawyer.
He wants me to be a partner.
- Investment banking?
- Yeah.
- And?
- I don't know.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
What do you think?
I think that I love you, and what you want to do is what I want you to do.
I don't know what to do.
Okay.
Did you talk to Harvey?
If I do that, all he'll hear is, "Hey, Harvey,
"thanks for doing everything for me.
I'm thinking about quitting." Well...
No, but you said that you don't think of him as just your boss.
You consider him a friend.
- So?
- So if he can't have an honest conversation with your best interests in mind, he's not your friend, and-- and he shouldn't be your boss.

I have to talk to you about something.
Well, unless its value is in excess of $575 million, it can wait.
Yeah.
Yeah, it can wait.
Good because our I.P.O. is in jeopardy unless we can deal with this.
Endangering children?
Wait, these things just opened.
This is a bullshit claim.
Maybe, but a bullshit claim on the right day is better than a great claim on a bullshit day.
Did you come up with that all by yourself?
My grandmother taught it to me.
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to find everything there is to know about this Quelling guy.
Harvey, why don't you just pay him off?
Protect the I.P.O.?
I worked my ass off for this day.
He's trying to hijack it.
I'm not gonna be extorted by some piece of shit I've never heard of.
Okay.
On it.
Jessica.
Donna, what can I do for you?
I was just walking by reception, and I thought you might like to know--you know, because it's your firm and-- Donna, get to it.
Charles Van Dyke is in the lobby.
- Right now?
- 30 seconds ago.
You were right to come to me.
Would you like me to send him on his way?
I prefer to take care of Charles Van Dyke myself.
Excellent.
You can stare at it all you want, Charles, but it's not going to change.
I was just thinking,
"I can't believe you put the mailroom boy's name on the wall." I think what you mean is that you can't believe yours was ever taken off.
I put that behind me years ago.
What are you doing here, Charles?
I suggest we go in your office and talk.
Right here is just fine.
What do you want?
I want a 30% increase in my dividend check.
- Good-bye, Charles.
- I thought you'd say that.
This is formal notice of my demand to audit your books.
You have until Friday to comply.
You gave up this right when we ran you out of town.
I think you're forgetting I retain that right in the event of any material change in my dividend.
Your dividend went up.
Materially.
You think we're hiding profits.
From what I know of you, you're always hiding something.
- I'm gonna make it fast, Jim.
- James.
That's not what your ex-wife calls you.
She calls you Jim.
That's one of the nicer names she uses.
She's been calling you a lot these days.
Wow, you found out I'm divorced.
Well, I'll withdraw the lawsuit.
It's not the divorce, Jimbo, it's the huge wall of mounting debt that's closing in on you since you tanked the tobacco litigation.
I didn't tank it.
I lost.
You didn't just lose.
You had an offer that would have set you up for life.
Instead, you rolled the dice, went to verdict, and now you got nothing.
Which is why your wife left you, and now you're coming after us with a fabricated claim.
I didn't fabricate anything.
I have expert reports here.
You've got one report of possible toxins in the playground material.
And not one sick child.
And you have an I.P.O. on Friday, and if this suit appears in the Journal that morning, what do you think the stock price is gonna be when they ring that bell?
Got me.
Give me your number.
- 100,000 and we're done.
- Done.
We'll draw up the paperwork.
I've got it right here.
But one thing, this precludes you from representing any other plaintiffs with the same action.
[Laughs] You got me.
I have 100 other plaintiffs waiting in the wings.
That's a $10 million hit you just avoided.
I tell you what.
Give me a million, and we're really done.
James, this covers your debts and gets you out from under.
You think that means I'm gonna take less than it's worth?
- It isn't worth anything.
- It is today.
You know where to reach me.
Thought you said you were willing to go as high as 500,000.
Yeah, that was before
I realized what we were dealing with.
This guy doesn't owe money 'cause he got divorced.
He got divorced 'cause he owes money.
- What are you talking about?
- He's a gambler.
How does that help us?
He doesn't know I'm one.
Where's Louis?
- Jessica.
- Where is he?
He's not answering his phone.
He's not answering his emails.
The thing is I don't know if he--
Katrina, your job as gatekeeper does not apply to me, so I'm going to ask you one more time.
Why isn't Louis in the building?
He must still be in court.
Is there something I can do?
What you can do is find Louis and have him come up with a way around this demand to look at our books.
When should I tell him you need it?
Yesterday.
You were right.
Quelling's got a game.
- What night?
- Every night.
Well, I hope you know where tonight's game is because--
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.
You and I are going.
- Um...
- What?
I got a job offer, Harvey.
Supposed to go have drinks to talk about it tonight.
I can move it, it's just, that's... that's why I hesitated.
- When?
- When what?
When'd you get the job offer?
- The other night.
- And you didn't mention it.
I didn't know what I thought.
- And now you do?
- No.
It's--
Who?
Jonathan Sidwell.
The spin-off idea?
- Yeah.
- I should have known.
He wants you to be his general counsel?
No, he wants to make me an investment banker.
Well, if it were me...
I'd take it.
What?
Why?
Because you can compete there like you do here with nothing hanging over your head.
What if I don't want to stop being a lawyer?
Well, then don't take the job.
I mean, what do you want from me?
- I want your advice.
- I just gave you my advice.
No, you told me what you would do.
I want to know what you think I should do.
Mike, last week, you said you'd do anything to stop being a fraud, so my advice is take it.
Still be in the majors, just be a different sport.
[Clears throat]
Excuse me, do you have a minute?
Look, you and I have never--
No, we haven't.
I need your help.
You must be scraping the bottom of the barrel if you're coming to me.
It's about Louis.
He and Sheila are done.
That's awful.
It's worse than awful.
Jessica needs him on a case right now.
He won't leave his apartment.
He won't even answer his phone.
Then I'll just go over there right now.
That won't work.
Even if it did, we don't have time.
So then why are you here?
Rachel, you don't trust me.
I get that, but Louis asked me to cover for him, and that is what I'm going to do.
You're the best paralegal here, and you're his friend.
So will you help me or not?
I will.
So...
I figured out what you can do to make it up to me tonight.
I thought we were good.
Yeah, I'm just--I'm feeling some residual anger.
Scottie, I'm kind of busy right now, and I have plans tonight.
Taking Mike on another I.P.O. date?
- What difference does it make?
- Hmm.
Sounds mysterious.
Bet you can't tell me what it is.
- I'm playing poker.
- Poker?
Can I come?
It's a work thing.
- You bring Mike to work things.
- Scottie, I told you I'm busy.
You can't come.
Can I get back to work now?
- What got into you?
- Nothing.
Sometimes at the office, I'm working.
Fair enough, boss.
Are you sure that's how you want to play that?
Play what, the fact that I'm busy?
The fact that you just snapped at her when we both know what you're really angry about.
I'm not angry.
I'm annoyed at the interruption.
You're angry that Mike wants to leave, and you just took it out on her.
- I'm not angry about that.
- No, you're hurt, and the anger covers the hurt, but I knew you didn't know that.
I was annoyed about the interruption just like I'm annoyed right now.
Bullshit.
You're feeling exactly what I'm feeling.
The idea of Mike leaving sucks, and the sooner you get your brain around that, the sooner you can maybe do something about it.
Can I get back to work now?
You can get back to work whenever you want.
But if all you're gonna do is stick your head in the sand, then you're not going to have an associate or a girlfriend to get back to work from.
- You give it to her?
- I gave it to her.
She suspect anything?
I wouldn't be standing here if she did.
- And?
- She thought it was awesome.
Well, she should.
Louis didn't just come up with a way to keep Charles Van Dyke out of our books.
Louis came up with a way to blow him out of the water.
That Louis.
He is one hell of an attorney.
- Thank you, Louis.
- Right back at you, Louis.
Don't get used to it.
Don't worry.
I'm not looking to work here again.
Not here, but you are looking to work?
I've always been able to see through your bullshit, Charles.
Which is why I'm offering you these, five cases.
We're co-counsel, split the profits 50/50.
It announces to the world that you are back in business, which is what you really want.
You came to me bearing gifts.
I still have the card.
"To the man who hired me for all you've done."
Two days later, you shoved me out.
I take this to mean you're passing on my offer.
I'm shitting on your offer.
Okay, Charles.
You were right.
Your dividend check did have the wrong amount, but from now on, it's going to have the right amount, zero.
- I don't think so.
- Oh, the firm you had your exit agreement with no longer exists.
We became Pearson Darby, then Pearson Specter, which means you're not entitled to a thing.
That's not in the spirit of our agreement.
And neither is your claim.
There's only one problem.
You should have dug deeper into the fine print.
The entity referred to in our agreement is defined in your bylaws as "any partnership in which the name partner is Jessica Pearson."
You didn't know.
My number just tripled.
Your call.
Our hearing is Friday.
You guys playing cards?
You're out of your league.
This game is for real players.
Why don't I give it a try?
Buyin is 25,000.
- What's the limit?
- There is no limit.
Maybe I am out of my league.
Raise $45,000.
I'm putting you all-in.
I've seen guys like you before.
You think if you bully me with your big stack,
I'm gonna run and hide.
Here's the difference between you and me, Jimbo,
I lose, I pull out another 25 grand, and another 25 after that.
You lose, you've got nothing.
You're bluffing.
Then call or get up and walk away, but I've sat across from you 1,000 times before.
You won't walk.
Tough beat.
Take your winnings.
What winnings?
I thought maybe it was time we do a little negotiating.
Well, you have my offer.
- I have a counter.
- I'm all ears.
I want a 50% increase in base salary.
I want a guaranteed bonus not tied to our investment returns, a four-week vacation, and I want a piece.
- A piece?
- A piece.
- No.
- No piece?
No negotiating.
Look, I know what you're doing.
You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.
But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.
I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass.
- I do kick ass.
- And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.
But you don't.
I don't yet.
[Clears throat]
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be interviewing other people.
Once I find the right person, job is gone.
I'm not dropping my suit when you're going public in two days.
James, you've read all about Hessington Oil.
The odds were stacked against me.
I won anyway, because I win.
You won because Edward Darby came forward.
You got lucky.
Guys like you always think other people get lucky.
I don't get lucky.
I make my own luck, and in this case, it's bleeding you dry.
Right there.
You just gave me your tell.
You have no other money.
You're done.
There's $100,000 in that pile.
It's the exact amount of the deal we offered you.
Sign it.
We'll fix the paperwork tomorrow.
This is $1,000.
Cash me out.
He doesn't play anymore the rest of the night.
You didn't sleep well.
I didn't sleep at all.
It's a big decision.
You still haven't told me what you think.
Mike, I can't make the decision for you.
I don't want you to make it for me.
I just want to know what you think.
And I already told you that I will support you with whatever you decide.
And the way you can support me right now is by telling me how you feel.
- It's not my place.
- Not your place?
Just admit it.
You want me to take the job, but you're too afraid to say it.
Okay, you want to know the truth?
You already know what you want to do.
And if I try to change your mind and it goes wrong, then I'm afraid you're gonna hold it against me.
Would you just say it?
Yes.
I want you to take the job.
Look, I know that you love what you do, but every day, you go into work with the possibility of being caught, and it is eating away at you.
If you stay there, that's just not gonna change.
- Jessica.
How did--
- It go?
I'll tell you how it went.
I got hung out to dry.
What?
No, it was a good move.
Oh, it would have been if our own bylaws didn't supersede it.
Th--that's impossible.
It was convoluted and buried in the fine print, and something Louis Litt never would have missed.
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.
You're not.
He wouldn't have missed it.
So when you came into my office and told me Louis had come up with that move, you were full of shit.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to help.
Well, that kind of thing only happens once.
You know how I know it's not gonna happen again?
Pack up your shit.
I don't care what kind of deal you have with Harvey.
You're done.
Why wouldn't you tell her?
I said I would cover.
I didn't say I would cover when it suited me.
Yeah, but he wouldn't want you to get fired over this.
I should be fired.
I let Jessica look stupid.
Katrina--
Thank you for your help, Rachel.
I really appreciate it, but if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone.
He's not here.
Where is he?
To tell you the truth, I don't know.
All he said was he had a late night.
Hmm.
Well, I can come back.
- I was just--
- You're taking the job, aren't you?
I don't know.
Yeah, you do.
You just don't want to admit it.
[Sighs]
Yeah.
I'm taking the job.
[Sighs]
God damn it.
Do you know what that man has done for you?
Do you know what it took for him to start trusting someone?
- Donna--
- Don't interrupt me.
So someone's dangling some money in front of you.
- It's not about that.
- I don't care what it's about.
I'm gonna say what he won't.
He needs you.
You need this job, and if you can't see that, then you might as well just leave right now.
Donna, someone's offering me a way out.
- So you don't care about him.
- Of course I do, but I also care about my life with Rachel.
I don't want to live my life like this anymore.
Then you better be the best goddamn investment banker this city has ever seen.
Scottie, I'm sorry I was angry in your direction, but it was really about something else.
Let me guess, Donna explained your feelings to you, and now you're here to apologize.
Maybe.
What was the something else?
Mike got a job offer.
And you don't want him to do it.
No, I don't.
Well, if you want him to stay, you know what's actually a nice tactic?
Telling him you want him to stay.
What?
Had I known "tell me what's going on with you"
meant "I'm going to tell you what to do,"
I might not have taken you up on it.
Oh, okay. [Laughs] Mmm.
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay.
You have that paperwork for me?
Well, I got something for you, but it's not that.
Didn't you learn your lesson last night?
I learned to listen.
When you talked, you mentioned Hessington Oil, so I looked back into it.
Turns out you don't create your own luck.
Your associate does.
What the hell are you talking about?
He conspired with Harold Gunderson to file a lawsuit against your own client so you could bribe witnesses not to testify.
- We didn't bribe anyone.
- [Scoffs]
- That was a legal settlement.
- Don't try to tell me two rookie associates who went to law school together and started at the same firm made this happen without collusion.
I don't need to tell you anything 'cause there's nothing to tell.
Well, you're gonna have to tell someone something, because that suit was filed one day, settled the next, and those witnesses cancelled their flights to New York.
That is a bribe, and when I bring it to the attention of the bar, you and your associate are going to be in deep shit.
Now who showed his tell?
Here's your money back.
And either I go to the bar, or you settle for $2 million.
You have until tomorrow.
Where's Mike?
He's in there.
Harvey--
- Harvey.
- Not now.
You need to call Lola Jensen.
What?
You need to get her to hack into the bar and put your name in.
What the hell are you talking about?
A week ago, you told me that the number one rule was not to move the goddamn body.
A week ago, people weren't sniffing around you.
- Harvey, my job offer is not--
- This isn't about your offer.
Quelling knows about your bullshit lawsuit with Harold Gunderson.
He turned me in?
No, but he will if we don't cave.
- He can't prove anything.
- He doesn't have to.
He hands you in to the bar, they look you up, we're done.
Not if I'm not here.
Oh, that's why you're in here.
You're taking the job.
I am.
And you think an addicted gambler who lost his wife, his child, and his house is gonna stop coming for you just because you're not working here?
You said it yourself.
Hacking into the bar is twice the crime I've been committing.
I am telling you Quelling is on the trail.
You don't do this, we're gonna get caught.
- There's got to be another way.
- There isn't.
- I don't believe that.
- Then you better figure something out fast, because tomorrow morning, we're done, and you quitting isn't gonna change that.
[Sighs]
You can't fire Katrina Bennett.
I can fire whoever I want to.
She was covering for Louis.
What are you talking about?
Louis's engagement is over, and he's losing it.
He won't come in to work, he won't pick up his phone, and he just didn't want anyone to know.
Then why are you telling me?
Because I helped her cover for him.
Are you saying I should fire you too?
I am saying that...
We made a mistake, but that we were just looking out for Louis, and I know how much you value loyalty, so I don't think that should be the thing that costs Katrina her job... or mine.
- Jessica.
- I need you.
No, listen, I just need a little more time.
And had you asked me for it, I would have said yes, but instead, you had Katrina cover for you.
Oh, that little traitor.
What, did she rat me out?
No, she didn't.
She's so loyal to you that she tried to pass off her work for yours.
Louis, Van Dyke wants to look at our books.
What?
We can't have that.
I know.
This was her fix.
Oh, no, and you used this on him?
I did, and then I fired Katrina.
- Jessica.
- I know.
I can't fire her for being loyal.
But I can't afford you sitting here licking your wounds while I get my ass handed to me.
Please, just listen to me, okay?
I cannot see straight.
I cannot think straight, and even if I wanted to come and help you, I wouldn't be any good to you, so...
Louis...
I know you loved Sheila, but do you love your firm?
You know I do.
And when you love a woman, can you stand the thought of her being with another man?
- No.
- Well, Louis,
Van Dyke is trying to get into Pearson Specter's pants.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm gonna put on a goddamn chastity belt.
How?
'Cause Katrina actually was on the right track.
Van Dyke's claim is gone if the partnership is gone.
The bylaws say it's not.
No, it is if we become an L.L.C.
We can't do that by tomorrow.
We'd have to rewrite every contract.
Boy, wow, Jessica, you sometimes really surprise me.
You don't think I know that?
I have an army of associates that I've trained within an inch of their lives.
My name is Louis goddamn Marlowe Litt, and my firm is under siege, so don't you tell me what I can and cannot do!
- Hey.
- Hey.
I don't want to interrupt, but I was just wondering what happened with Mike.
He's leaving.
[Sighs]
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
Can I ask you something?
Did you tell him that you wanted him to stay?
I didn't get around to it.
You--you didn't get around to it?
I was gonna tell him, and then he told me he was leaving, and then other shit came up, so...
So you just dropped it?
I told you other shit came up.
What other shit?
I mean, you had an emergency case filing, so you let your protege walk out the door?
- It's complicated.
- Okay.
Well...then share it with me.
Quelling came after us.
The Hessington witnesses.
What?
That's bullshit.
You may have blurred some lines, but you certainly didn't cross any.
Fight him.
- No, I can't.
- Why?
Look, I don't want to talk about it.
What is going on here?
When somebody pisses you off, you get in the ring.
What are you saying?
What I'm saying is that you're not taking on Quelling, but you're letting Mike walk out the door without trying to stop him.
I think one thing changed the other, and I want to know why.
Maybe what changed is his desire to be here, and maybe what I have to say doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.
Now, what is this really about?
Because it's sure as hell not about some stupid case.
You know what?
God damn it!
For once, can't it just be about what I said it's about?
You didn't say what it was about.
Harvey, I'm really sorry that the Mike thing turned out this way.
I am, but I can't say that I didn't see it coming.
- Scottie, it isn't--
- What?
It isn't what?
It isn't what it seems?
Because I don't know what it seems.
All I know is that any time I ask you about anything, all you say is, "I can't talk about it."
I'm just gonna stop asking.
Then we'll just make up later, and we can do it all over again tomorrow.
[Knock at door]
Quelling can't hurt us anymore.
- You went to see Lola.
- I looked at his accounts.
I wanted to find out where all that money came from to find all those clients.
He doesn't have the money.
And yet his rent gets paid, and they don't turn off his electricity.
Holy shit.
Guess you didn't have to see Lola after all.
You think I got access to that with a court order?
So you did go see her?
You put the idea in my head.
I just came up with a different agenda.
We got him.
No.
You got him.
What?
Your going-away present.
Be a lawyer one last time.
Knock this guy out.
[Knock at door]
You have my settlement check.
I don't have a dime for you.
Then I guess the bar is going to be hearing from me first thing in the morning.
Well, then, they'll also be hearing from me.
Disciplinary rule 5-107a, "accepting compensation--"
- I know what it says.
- Then you also know the penalty is being disbarred.
You took money from our client's competitors to trump up your bullshit suit.
You didn't come by that legally.
And they're not gonna care.
I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't have a hell of a lot to lose, so sign my deal or get the hell out of my office.
Well, here's the thing, James.
I don't either...
Because today is my last day as a lawyer anyway.
- Bullshit.
- Look at me.
Good luck in front of the bar.
I wasn't always like this.
I had tobacco in my sights.
They offered me a lot of money.
I could have made a fortune.
But $15,000 per client for people with cancer?
I risked going to verdict because I wanted to get those people something that could make a difference!
And I lost everything...
My clients, my wife, my kids!
You lost them because you gambled them away, James.
I know that.
Please.
Being a lawyer is what I am.
It's who I am.
And if you take that away...
It's up to you, James.
I'll drop the suit.
I promise.
Louis, where the hell are you?
You said you could get it done.
I walk through those doors, our books fly open.
Get here now.
Well, this should be fun.
We've never been across the aisle from each other.
Which is why you don't realize that it won't be fun.
We'll see what we see.
Case 41432, Van Dyke versus Pearson.
Look at that.
Game time.
Ladies first.
Ladies first.
Son of a bitch.
For being polite?
Were you being polite when you hired me?
What does one have to do with the other?
"To the man who hired me, for all you've done."
Do you want to know what I meant when I wrote that card?
The day you made me that offer, I asked you,
"did it have anything to do with gender or race?"
You swore it didn't.
You lied to me.
- It didn't.
- You're lying now.
You know, Daniel Hardman may have used people, but he didn't give a shit about their gender or their color.
- He showed you the list.
- Right next to my name, an asterisk.
Not "Law Review."
Not second in my class.
Diversity.
- You were treated the same.
- You tell yourself that, but we both know the truth, which is why I sleep at night just fine.
Well, it doesn't change the facts in this case, does it?
No.
No, it doesn't, but this will.
Charles, you remember Louis Litt?
Sorry, I couldn't run.
Doctor wanted me to take it easy.
Hey, Charles.
[Spanks him] Great to see you.
You told me that story to stall.
- That was a stall...
- Hmm.
But this is for me.
When I saw that asterisk next to my name, it made me sick to my stomach, because in one second,
I understood how you will always see me.
So that card was a thank you, because if I hadn't have felt sick, then I might not have worked as hard as I did to get where I am today.
You woke the dragon, Charles.
How do you like me now?
I know you're there.
You need anything?
No.
The I.P.O. is wrapped up.
We go public Monday morning.
I wasn't talking about the I.P.O.
I was talking about how you're feeling about Mike.
I know.
Okay.
Good night, Harvey.
I'm gonna tell Scottie.
About Mike?
Are you crazy?
You can't have it both ways, Donna.
You can't tell me to open up and then keep my secrets.
You spent more than a year covering it up.
You tried to get him to commit another crime to cover it up, and now-- You said I should tell her what's really bothering me!
I meant your feelings.
I didn't mean confess to a felony.
These are my goddamn feelings!
Donna, I did something when I hired him.
It's caused all of this.
I can't tell her, and it's driving me crazy!
Okay.
Look, Mike is gone, Harvey.
I hate that he's gone, but the jeopardy's gone too.
It's done.
And now you want to turn around and tell someone who--
Someone who what?
Nothing.
No, you better finish that sentence.
Someone who's pissed at you, Harvey.
Someone who keeps finding a reason to be pissed at you, and it's not the third time, and it's not the fifth time, and it's not the last time.
I thought you were trying to help my relationship, not shit on it.
Okay, you want to yell at me?
Fine.
Because I know you're not mad at me.
And I know you're only telling me this stupid idea because you want me to tell you what you already know.
You can't, Harvey.
It's good that you want to, but you can't.
Could I have a minute?
Congratulate me.
I'm officially a member of the New York bar.
You went to Lola?
I made a mistake.
I want to stay.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Sheila Amanda Sazs, will you marry me?
Yes, I will marry you.
- I want to go legit.
- You can't.
Then I get Lola Jensen to hack into the bar and just put me in there, just like she did with Harvard.
Rule number one of not getting caught, you don't move the goddamn body.
Harvey, I'm stuck.
I can't live my whole life like this.
You want me to set up your new corporation?
I want you to join my new corporation.
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.
Our job blows yours out of the water.
Scottie, I need you to give Louis his transaction back.
Does this have something to do with that favor he did you?
- Yes.
- Tell me what it is.
- I can't.
- Guess we're not sharing everything with each other after all.
- Scottie.
- You can't have it both ways, Harvey.
- Louis, I don't want kids.
- What are you talking about?
I don't like kids.
I was willing to give up Harvard for you.
You can't give up something for me?
I understand.
Can I just say something please?
I know you keep saying that I won't feel this way forever, but why is it when the guys shows up with chicken vindaloo 40 minutes late with no naan and no silverware, instead of throwing the chutney in his face,
I'm thanking him and I am tipping him $20?
Do you want to tell me why that happens?
I don't care.
I hate myself.
I hate my life.
The woman I love is gone, my heart is broken, and I really-- to be honest with you,
I just don't have the will to live.
Hold on.
It's my associate.
Katrina.
Louis, it's 7:55.
Yeah.
I have an 8:00 a.m.
Please cover it for me.
In fact, cover everything, and unless the building is on fire and Sheila's in it,
I'm not coming in.
Louis, what happened?
You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
My heart's been shattered into a thousand million pieces, and if I can't put my heart into my work, then I'm not gonna do any work at all, so...
How long do you think you'll be out?
I don't know.
Today, tomorrow, the rest of the year.
You know, just don't call here again because I'm not gonna answer the number.
Doc?
Dr. Lipschitz?
Hello?
What, are you shitting me?
That was not 50 minutes.
Waiting outside for me?
Bold gesture.
I called you three times.
I had to do something.
- You must be feeling bad.
- I am.
What for?
You're just doing your job.
Scottie, I'm sorry.
What happened with Louis, I didn't like doing it.
- Yeah, but you still did it.
- And what I'm doing now is asking you to let it go.
Harvey, it's not that you picked Louis over me.
It's that you wouldn't tell me why.
I couldn't tell you why.
There's a difference.
And I'm asking you to trust me.
Okay.
I can let it go, but keeping things from me just can't keep happening, okay?
I can't tell you whether or not that's okay, and I definitely can't tell you why.
Too soon?
What are you going to do to make it up to me?
Nothing right now.
I'm taking Mike to the marathon footwear brunch.
You're taking a date to an I.P.O. event?
That's so cute.
It's not a date.
He's never gonna put out.
Well, it's too bad that you're not taking me because I was thinking of letting you...
Mr. Specter.
James Quelling.
I'm in a bit of a hurry, Mr. Quelling.
- I want to do you a favor.
- I don't need any favors.
Yeah, you do, unless you want Friday's headline to read,
"Marathon Footwear builds playgrounds that kill children."
My client builds playgrounds that help children.
And uses a synthetic full of toxins to do it.
Look, I don't know who you are, but I know what you're trying to do, and it isn't gonna work.
Look, I'm a reasonable man.
This is a huge moment for your client.
I won't file this before Friday.
You think I'm gonna let you extort my client?
No, I think you're gonna protect your client from a claim that could ruin them.
In fact, I'm counting on it.
Nice offices.
Enjoy that brunch.
- I got a job offer.
- Holy shit.
From who?
Last night.
Jonathan Sidwell.
But I thought Louis was his lawyer.
He doesn't want me to be his lawyer.
He wants me to be a partner.
- Investment banking?
- Yeah.
- And?
- I don't know.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
What do you think?
I think that I love you, and what you want to do is what I want you to do.
I don't know what to do.
Okay.
Did you talk to Harvey?
If I do that, all he'll hear is, "Hey, Harvey,
"thanks for doing everything for me.
I'm thinking about quitting." Well...
No, but you said that you don't think of him as just your boss.
You consider him a friend.
- So?
- So if he can't have an honest conversation with your best interests in mind, he's not your friend, and-- and he shouldn't be your boss.

I have to talk to you about something.
Well, unless its value is in excess of $575 million, it can wait.
Yeah.
Yeah, it can wait.
Good because our I.P.O. is in jeopardy unless we can deal with this.
Endangering children?
Wait, these things just opened.
This is a bullshit claim.
Maybe, but a bullshit claim on the right day is better than a great claim on a bullshit day.
Did you come up with that all by yourself?
My grandmother taught it to me.
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to find everything there is to know about this Quelling guy.
Harvey, why don't you just pay him off?
Protect the I.P.O.?
I worked my ass off for this day.
He's trying to hijack it.
I'm not gonna be extorted by some piece of shit I've never heard of.
Okay.
On it.
Jessica.
Donna, what can I do for you?
I was just walking by reception, and I thought you might like to know--you know, because it's your firm and-- Donna, get to it.
Charles Van Dyke is in the lobby.
- Right now?
- 30 seconds ago.
You were right to come to me.
Would you like me to send him on his way?
I prefer to take care of Charles Van Dyke myself.
Excellent.
You can stare at it all you want, Charles, but it's not going to change.
I was just thinking,
"I can't believe you put the mailroom boy's name on the wall." I think what you mean is that you can't believe yours was ever taken off.
I put that behind me years ago.
What are you doing here, Charles?
I suggest we go in your office and talk.
Right here is just fine.
What do you want?
I want a 30% increase in my dividend check.
- Good-bye, Charles.
- I thought you'd say that.
This is formal notice of my demand to audit your books.
You have until Friday to comply.
You gave up this right when we ran you out of town.
I think you're forgetting I retain that right in the event of any material change in my dividend.
Your dividend went up.
Materially.
You think we're hiding profits.
From what I know of you, you're always hiding something.
- I'm gonna make it fast, Jim.
- James.
That's not what your ex-wife calls you.
She calls you Jim.
That's one of the nicer names she uses.
She's been calling you a lot these days.
Wow, you found out I'm divorced.
Well, I'll withdraw the lawsuit.
It's not the divorce, Jimbo, it's the huge wall of mounting debt that's closing in on you since you tanked the tobacco litigation.
I didn't tank it.
I lost.
You didn't just lose.
You had an offer that would have set you up for life.
Instead, you rolled the dice, went to verdict, and now you got nothing.
Which is why your wife left you, and now you're coming after us with a fabricated claim.
I didn't fabricate anything.
I have expert reports here.
You've got one report of possible toxins in the playground material.
And not one sick child.
And you have an I.P.O. on Friday, and if this suit appears in the Journal that morning, what do you think the stock price is gonna be when they ring that bell?
Got me.
Give me your number.
- 100,000 and we're done.
- Done.
We'll draw up the paperwork.
I've got it right here.
But one thing, this precludes you from representing any other plaintiffs with the same action.
You got me.
I have 100 other plaintiffs waiting in the wings.
That's a $10 million hit you just avoided.
I tell you what.
Give me a million, and we're really done.
James, this covers your debts and gets you out from under.
You think that means I'm gonna take less than it's worth?
- It isn't worth anything.
- It is today.
You know where to reach me.
Thought you said you were willing to go as high as 500,000.
Yeah, that was before
I realized what we were dealing with.
This guy doesn't owe money 'cause he got divorced.
He got divorced 'cause he owes money.
- What are you talking about?
- He's a gambler.
How does that help us?
He doesn't know I'm one.
Where's Louis?
- Jessica.
- Where is he?
He's not answering his phone.
He's not answering his emails.
The thing is I don't know if he--
Katrina, your job as gatekeeper does not apply to me, so I'm going to ask you one more time.
Why isn't Louis in the building?
He must still be in court.
Is there something I can do?
What you can do is find Louis and have him come up with a way around this demand to look at our books.
When should I tell him you need it?
Yesterday.
You were right.
Quelling's got a game.
- What night?
- Every night.
Well, I hope you know where tonight's game is because--
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.
You and I are going.
- Um...
- What?
I got a job offer, Harvey.
Supposed to go have drinks to talk about it tonight.
I can move it, it's just, that's... that's why I hesitated.
- When?
- When what?
When'd you get the job offer?
- The other night.
- And you didn't mention it.
I didn't know what I thought.
- And now you do?
- No.
It's--
Who?
Jonathan Sidwell.
The spin-off idea?
- Yeah.
- I should have known.
He wants you to be his general counsel?
No, he wants to make me an investment banker.
Well, if it were me...
I'd take it.
What?
Why?
Because you can compete there like you do here with nothing hanging over your head.
What if I don't want to stop being a lawyer?
Well, then don't take the job.
I mean, what do you want from me?
- I want your advice.
- I just gave you my advice.
No, you told me what you would do.
I want to know what you think I should do.
Mike, last week, you said you'd do anything to stop being a fraud, so my advice is take it.
Still be in the majors, just be a different sport.
Excuse me, do you have a minute?
Look, you and I have never--
No, we haven't.
I need your help.
You must be scraping the bottom of the barrel if you're coming to me.
It's about Louis.
He and Sheila are done.
That's awful.
It's worse than awful.
Jessica needs him on a case right now.
He won't leave his apartment.
He won't even answer his phone.
Then I'll just go over there right now.
That won't work.
Even if it did, we don't have time.
So then why are you here?
Rachel, you don't trust me.
I get that, but Louis asked me to cover for him, and that is what I'm going to do.
You're the best paralegal here, and you're his friend.
So will you help me or not?
I will.
So...
I figured out what you can do to make it up to me tonight.
I thought we were good.
Yeah, I'm just--I'm feeling some residual anger.
Scottie, I'm kind of busy right now, and I have plans tonight.
Taking Mike on another I.P.O. date?
- What difference does it make?
- Hmm.
Sounds mysterious.
Bet you can't tell me what it is.
- I'm playing poker.
- Poker?
Can I come?
It's a work thing.
- You bring Mike to work things.
- Scottie, I told you I'm busy.
You can't come.
Can I get back to work now?
- What got into you?
- Nothing.
Sometimes at the office, I'm working.
Fair enough, boss.
Are you sure that's how you want to play that?
Play what, the fact that I'm busy?
The fact that you just snapped at her when we both know what you're really angry about.
I'm not angry.
I'm annoyed at the interruption.
You're angry that Mike wants to leave, and you just took it out on her.
- I'm not angry about that.
- No, you're hurt, and the anger covers the hurt, but I knew you didn't know that.
I was annoyed about the interruption just like I'm annoyed right now.
Bullshit.
You're feeling exactly what I'm feeling.
The idea of Mike leaving sucks, and the sooner you get your brain around that, the sooner you can maybe do something about it.
Can I get back to work now?
You can get back to work whenever you want.
But if all you're gonna do is stick your head in the sand, then you're not going to have an associate or a girlfriend to get back to work from.
- You give it to her?
- I gave it to her.
She suspect anything?
I wouldn't be standing here if she did.
- And?
- She thought it was awesome.
Well, she should.
Louis didn't just come up with a way to keep Charles Van Dyke out of our books.
Louis came up with a way to blow him out of the water.
That Louis.
He is one hell of an attorney.
- Thank you, Louis.
- Right back at you, Louis.
Don't get used to it.
Don't worry.
I'm not looking to work here again.
Not here, but you are looking to work?
I've always been able to see through your bullshit, Charles.
Which is why I'm offering you these, five cases.
We're co-counsel, split the profits 50/50.
It announces to the world that you are back in business, which is what you really want.
You came to me bearing gifts.
I still have the card.
"To the man who hired me for all you've done."
Two days later, you shoved me out.
I take this to mean you're passing on my offer.
I'm shitting on your offer.
Okay, Charles.
You were right.
Your dividend check did have the wrong amount, but from now on, it's going to have the right amount, zero.
- I don't think so.
- Oh, the firm you had your exit agreement with no longer exists.
We became Pearson Darby, then Pearson Specter, which means you're not entitled to a thing.
That's not in the spirit of our agreement.
And neither is your claim.
There's only one problem.
You should have dug deeper into the fine print.
The entity referred to in our agreement is defined in your bylaws as "any partnership in which the name partner is Jessica Pearson."
You didn't know.
My number just tripled.
Your call.
Our hearing is Friday.
You guys playing cards?
You're out of your league.
This game is for real players.
Why don't I give it a try?
Buyin is 25,000.
- What's the limit?
- There is no limit.
Maybe I am out of my league.
Raise $45,000.
I'm putting you all-in.
I've seen guys like you before.
You think if you bully me with your big stack,
I'm gonna run and hide.
Here's the difference between you and me, Jimbo,
I lose, I pull out another 25 grand, and another 25 after that.
You lose, you've got nothing.
You're bluffing.
Then call or get up and walk away, but I've sat across from you 1,000 times before.
You won't walk.
Tough beat.
Take your winnings.
What winnings?
I thought maybe it was time we do a little negotiating.
Well, you have my offer.
- I have a counter.
- I'm all ears.
I want a 50% increase in base salary.
I want a guaranteed bonus not tied to our investment returns, a four-week vacation, and I want a piece.
- A piece?
- A piece.
- No.
- No piece?
No negotiating.
Look, I know what you're doing.
You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.
But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.
I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass.
- I do kick ass.
- And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.
But you don't.
I don't yet.
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be interviewing other people.
Once I find the right person, job is gone.
I'm not dropping my suit when you're going public in two days.
James, you've read all about Hessington Oil.
The odds were stacked against me.
I won anyway, because I win.
You won because Edward Darby came forward.
You got lucky.
Guys like you always think other people get lucky.
I don't get lucky.
I make my own luck, and in this case, it's bleeding you dry.
Right there.
You just gave me your tell.
You have no other money.
You're done.
There's $100,000 in that pile.
It's the exact amount of the deal we offered you.
Sign it.
We'll fix the paperwork tomorrow.
This is $1,000.
Cash me out.
He doesn't play anymore the rest of the night.
You didn't sleep well.
I didn't sleep at all.
It's a big decision.
You still haven't told me what you think.
Mike, I can't make the decision for you.
I don't want you to make it for me.
I just want to know what you think.
And I already told you that I will support you with whatever you decide.
And the way you can support me right now is by telling me how you feel.
- It's not my place.
- Not your place?
Just admit it.
You want me to take the job, but you're too afraid to say it.
Okay, you want to know the truth?
You already know what you want to do.
And if I try to change your mind and it goes wrong, then I'm afraid you're gonna hold it against me.
Would you just say it?
Yes.
I want you to take the job.
Look, I know that you love what you do, but every day, you go into work with the possibility of being caught, and it is eating away at you.
If you stay there, that's just not gonna change.
- Jessica.
How did--
- It go?
I'll tell you how it went.
I got hung out to dry.
What?
No, it was a good move.
Oh, it would have been if our own bylaws didn't supersede it.
Th--that's impossible.
It was convoluted and buried in the fine print, and something Louis Litt never would have missed.
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.
You're not.
He wouldn't have missed it.
So when you came into my office and told me Louis had come up with that move, you were full of shit.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to help.
Well, that kind of thing only happens once.
You know how I know it's not gonna happen again?
Pack up your shit.
I don't care what kind of deal you have with Harvey.
You're done.
Why wouldn't you tell her?
I said I would cover.
I didn't say I would cover when it suited me.
Yeah, but he wouldn't want you to get fired over this.
I should be fired.
I let Jessica look stupid.
Katrina--
Thank you for your help, Rachel.
I really appreciate it, but if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone.
He's not here.
Where is he?
To tell you the truth, I don't know.
All he said was he had a late night.
Hmm.
Well, I can come back.
- I was just--
- You're taking the job, aren't you?
I don't know.
Yeah, you do.
You just don't want to admit it.
Yeah.
I'm taking the job.
God damn it.
Do you know what that man has done for you?
Do you know what it took for him to start trusting someone?
- Donna--
- Don't interrupt me.
So someone's dangling some money in front of you.
- It's not about that.
- I don't care what it's about.
I'm gonna say what he won't.
He needs you.
You need this job, and if you can't see that, then you might as well just leave right now.
Donna, someone's offering me a way out.
- So you don't care about him.
- Of course I do, but I also care about my life with Rachel.
I don't want to live my life like this anymore.
Then you better be the best goddamn investment banker this city has ever seen.
Scottie, I'm sorry I was angry in your direction, but it was really about something else.
Let me guess, Donna explained your feelings to you, and now you're here to apologize.
Maybe.
What was the something else?
Mike got a job offer.
And you don't want him to do it.
No, I don't.
Well, if you want him to stay, you know what's actually a nice tactic?
Telling him you want him to stay.
What?
Had I known "tell me what's going on with you"
meant "I'm going to tell you what to do,"
I might not have taken you up on it.
Oh, okay.
Mmm.
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay.
You have that paperwork for me?
Well, I got something for you, but it's not that.
Didn't you learn your lesson last night?
I learned to listen.
When you talked, you mentioned Hessington Oil, so I looked back into it.
Turns out you don't create your own luck.
Your associate does.
What the hell are you talking about?
He conspired with Harold Gunderson to file a lawsuit against your own client so you could bribe witnesses not to testify.
We didn't bribe anyone.
- That was a legal settlement.
- Don't try to tell me two rookie associates who went to law school together and started at the same firm made this happen without collusion.
I don't need to tell you anything 'cause there's nothing to tell.
Well, you're gonna have to tell someone something, because that suit was filed one day, settled the next, and those witnesses cancelled their flights to New York.
That is a bribe, and when I bring it to the attention of the bar, you and your associate are going to be in deep shit.
Now who showed his tell?
Here's your money back.
And either I go to the bar, or you settle for $2 million.
You have until tomorrow.
Where's Mike?
He's in there.
Harvey--
- Harvey.
- Not now.
You need to call Lola Jensen.
What?
You need to get her to hack into the bar and put your name in.
What the hell are you talking about?
A week ago, you told me that the number one rule was not to move the goddamn body.
A week ago, people weren't sniffing around you.
- Harvey, my job offer is not--
- This isn't about your offer.
Quelling knows about your bullshit lawsuit with Harold Gunderson.
He turned me in?
No, but he will if we don't cave.
- He can't prove anything.
- He doesn't have to.
He hands you in to the bar, they look you up, we're done.
Not if I'm not here.
Oh, that's why you're in here.
You're taking the job.
I am.
And you think an addicted gambler who lost his wife, his child, and his house is gonna stop coming for you just because you're not working here?
You said it yourself.
Hacking into the bar is twice the crime I've been committing.
I am telling you Quelling is on the trail.
You don't do this, we're gonna get caught.
- There's got to be another way.
- There isn't.
- I don't believe that.
- Then you better figure something out fast, because tomorrow morning, we're done, and you quitting isn't gonna change that.
You can't fire Katrina Bennett.
I can fire whoever I want to.
She was covering for Louis.
What are you talking about?
Louis's engagement is over, and he's losing it.
He won't come in to work, he won't pick up his phone, and he just didn't want anyone to know.
Then why are you telling me?
Because I helped her cover for him.
Are you saying I should fire you too?
I am saying that...
We made a mistake, but that we were just looking out for Louis, and I know how much you value loyalty, so I don't think that should be the thing that costs Katrina her job... or mine.
- Jessica.
- I need you.
No, listen, I just need a little more time.
And had you asked me for it, I would have said yes, but instead, you had Katrina cover for you.
Oh, that little traitor.
What, did she rat me out?
No, she didn't.
She's so loyal to you that she tried to pass off her work for yours.
Louis, Van Dyke wants to look at our books.
What?
We can't have that.
I know.
This was her fix.
Oh, no, and you used this on him?
I did, and then I fired Katrina.
- Jessica.
- I know.
I can't fire her for being loyal.
But I can't afford you sitting here licking your wounds while I get my ass handed to me.
Please, just listen to me, okay?
I cannot see straight.
I cannot think straight, and even if I wanted to come and help you, I wouldn't be any good to you, so...
Louis...
I know you loved Sheila, but do you love your firm?
You know I do.
And when you love a woman, can you stand the thought of her being with another man?
- No.
- Well, Louis,
Van Dyke is trying to get into Pearson Specter's pants.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm gonna put on a goddamn chastity belt.
How?
'Cause Katrina actually was on the right track.
Van Dyke's claim is gone if the partnership is gone.
The bylaws say it's not.
No, it is if we become an L.L.C.
We can't do that by tomorrow.
We'd have to rewrite every contract.
Boy, wow, Jessica, you sometimes really surprise me.
You don't think I know that?
I have an army of associates that I've trained within an inch of their lives.
My name is Louis goddamn Marlowe Litt, and my firm is under siege, so don't you tell me what I can and cannot do!
- Hey.
- Hey.
I don't want to interrupt, but I was just wondering what happened with Mike.
He's leaving.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
Can I ask you something?
Did you tell him that you wanted him to stay?
I didn't get around to it.
You--you didn't get around to it?
I was gonna tell him, and then he told me he was leaving, and then other shit came up, so...
So you just dropped it?
I told you other shit came up.
What other shit?
I mean, you had an emergency case filing, so you let your protege walk out the door?
- It's complicated.
- Okay.
Well...then share it with me.
Quelling came after us.
The Hessington witnesses.
What?
That's bullshit.
You may have blurred some lines, but you certainly didn't cross any.
Fight him.
- No, I can't.
- Why?
Look, I don't want to talk about it.
What is going on here?
When somebody pisses you off, you get in the ring.
What are you saying?
What I'm saying is that you're not taking on Quelling, but you're letting Mike walk out the door without trying to stop him.
I think one thing changed the other, and I want to know why.
Maybe what changed is his desire to be here, and maybe what I have to say doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.
Now, what is this really about?
Because it's sure as hell not about some stupid case.
You know what?
God damn it!
For once, can't it just be about what I said it's about?
You didn't say what it was about.
Harvey, I'm really sorry that the Mike thing turned out this way.
I am, but I can't say that I didn't see it coming.
- Scottie, it isn't--
- What?
It isn't what?
It isn't what it seems?
Because I don't know what it seems.
All I know is that any time I ask you about anything, all you say is, "I can't talk about it."
I'm just gonna stop asking.
Then we'll just make up later, and we can do it all over again tomorrow.
Quelling can't hurt us anymore.
- You went to see Lola.
- I looked at his accounts.
I wanted to find out where all that money came from to find all those clients.
He doesn't have the money.
And yet his rent gets paid, and they don't turn off his electricity.
Holy shit.
Guess you didn't have to see Lola after all.
You think I got access to that with a court order?
So you did go see her?
You put the idea in my head.
I just came up with a different agenda.
We got him.
No.
You got him.
What?
Your going-away present.
Be a lawyer one last time.
Knock this guy out.
You have my settlement check.
I don't have a dime for you.
Then I guess the bar is going to be hearing from me first thing in the morning.
Well, then, they'll also be hearing from me.
Disciplinary rule 5-107a, "accepting compensation--"
- I know what it says.
- Then you also know the penalty is being disbarred.
You took money from our client's competitors to trump up your bullshit suit.
You didn't come by that legally.
And they're not gonna care.
I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't have a hell of a lot to lose, so sign my deal or get the hell out of my office.
Well, here's the thing, James.
I don't either...
Because today is my last day as a lawyer anyway.
- Bullshit.
- Look at me.
Good luck in front of the bar.
I wasn't always like this.
I had tobacco in my sights.
They offered me a lot of money.
I could have made a fortune.
But $15,000 per client for people with cancer?
I risked going to verdict because I wanted to get those people something that could make a difference!
And I lost everything...
My clients, my wife, my kids!
You lost them because you gambled them away, James.
I know that.
Please.
Being a lawyer is what I am.
It's who I am.
And if you take that away...
It's up to you, James.
I'll drop the suit.
I promise.
Louis, where the hell are you?
You said you could get it done.
I walk through those doors, our books fly open.
Get here now.
Well, this should be fun.
We've never been across the aisle from each other.
Which is why you don't realize that it won't be fun.
We'll see what we see.
Case 41432, Van Dyke versus Pearson.
Look at that.
Game time.
Ladies first.
Ladies first.
Son of a bitch.
For being polite?
Were you being polite when you hired me?
What does one have to do with the other?
"To the man who hired me, for all you've done."
Do you want to know what I meant when I wrote that card?
The day you made me that offer, I asked you,
"did it have anything to do with gender or race?"
You swore it didn't.
You lied to me.
- It didn't.
- You're lying now.
You know, Daniel Hardman may have used people, but he didn't give a shit about their gender or their color.
- He showed you the list.
- Right next to my name, an asterisk.
Not "Law Review."
Not second in my class.
Diversity.
- You were treated the same.
- You tell yourself that, but we both know the truth, which is why I sleep at night just fine.
Well, it doesn't change the facts in this case, does it?
No.
No, it doesn't, but this will.
Charles, you remember Louis Litt?
Sorry, I couldn't run.
Doctor wanted me to take it easy.
Hey, Charles.
Great to see you.
You told me that story to stall.
- That was a stall...
- Hmm.
But this is for me.
When I saw that asterisk next to my name, it made me sick to my stomach, because in one second,
I understood how you will always see me.
So that card was a thank you, because if I hadn't have felt sick, then I might not have worked as hard as I did to get where I am today.
You woke the dragon, Charles.
How do you like me now?
I know you're there.
You need anything?
No.
The I.P.O. is wrapped up.
We go public Monday morning.
I wasn't talking about the I.P.O.
I was talking about how you're feeling about Mike.
I know.
Okay.
Good night, Harvey.
I'm gonna tell Scottie.
About Mike?
Are you crazy?
You can't have it both ways, Donna.
You can't tell me to open up and then keep my secrets.
You spent more than a year covering it up.
You tried to get him to commit another crime to cover it up, and now-- You said I should tell her what's really bothering me!
I meant your feelings.
I didn't mean confess to a felony.
These are my goddamn feelings!
Donna, I did something when I hired him.
It's caused all of this.
I can't tell her, and it's driving me crazy!
Okay.
Look, Mike is gone, Harvey.
I hate that he's gone, but the jeopardy's gone too.
It's done.
And now you want to turn around and tell someone who--
Someone who what?
Nothing.
No, you better finish that sentence.
Someone who's pissed at you, Harvey.
Someone who keeps finding a reason to be pissed at you, and it's not the third time, and it's not the fifth time, and it's not the last time.
I thought you were trying to help my relationship, not shit on it.
Okay, you want to yell at me?
Fine.
Because I know you're not mad at me.
And I know you're only telling me this stupid idea because you want me to tell you what you already know.
You can't, Harvey.
It's good that you want to, but you can't.
Could I have a minute?
Congratulate me.
I'm officially a member of the New York bar.
You went to Lola?
I made a mistake.
I want to stay.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Sheila Amanda Sazs, will you marry me?
Yes, I will marry you.
- I want to go legit.
- You can't.
Then I get Lola Jensen to hack into the bar and just put me in there, just like she did with Harvard.
Rule number one of not getting caught, you don't move the goddamn body.
Harvey, I'm stuck.
I can't live my whole life like this.
You want me to set up your new corporation?
I want you to join my new corporation.
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.
Our job blows yours out of the water.
Scottie, I need you to give Louis his transaction back.
Does this have something to do with that favor he did you?
- Yes.
- Tell me what it is.
- I can't.
- Guess we're not sharing everything with each other after all.
- Scottie.
- You can't have it both ways, Harvey.
- Louis, I don't want kids.
- What are you talking about?
I don't like kids.
I was willing to give up Harvard for you.
You can't give up something for me?
I understand.
Can I just say something please?
I know you keep saying that I won't feel this way forever, but why is it when the guys shows up with chicken vindaloo 40 minutes late with no naan and no silverware, instead of throwing the chutney in his face,
I'm thanking him and I am tipping him $20?
Do you want to tell me why that happens?
I don't care.
I hate myself.
I hate my life.
The woman I love is gone, my heart is broken, and I really-- to be honest with you,
I just don't have the will to live.
Hold on.
It's my associate.
Katrina.
Louis, it's 7:55.
Yeah.
I have an 8:00 a.m.
Please cover it for me.
In fact, cover everything, and unless the building is on fire and Sheila's in it,
I'm not coming in.
Louis, what happened?
You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
My heart's been shattered into a thousand million pieces, and if I can't put my heart into my work, then I'm not gonna do any work at all, so...
How long do you think you'll be out?
I don't know.
Today, tomorrow, the rest of the year.
You know, just don't call here again because I'm not gonna answer the number.
Doc?
Dr. Lipschitz?
Hello?
What, are you shitting me?
That was not 50 minutes.
Waiting outside for me?
Bold gesture.
I called you three times.
I had to do something.
- You must be feeling bad.
- I am.
What for?
You're just doing your job.
Scottie, I'm sorry.
What happened with Louis, I didn't like doing it.
- Yeah, but you still did it.
- And what I'm doing now is asking you to let it go.
Harvey, it's not that you picked Louis over me.
It's that you wouldn't tell me why.
I couldn't tell you why.
There's a difference.
And I'm asking you to trust me.
Okay.
I can let it go, but keeping things from me just can't keep happening, okay?
I can't tell you whether or not that's okay, and I definitely can't tell you why.
Too soon?
What are you going to do to make it up to me?
Nothing right now.
I'm taking Mike to the marathon footwear brunch.
You're taking a date to an I.P.O. event?
That's so cute.
It's not a date.
He's never gonna put out.
Well, it's too bad that you're not taking me because I was thinking of letting you...
Mr. Specter.
James Quelling.
I'm in a bit of a hurry, Mr. quelling.
- I want to do you a favor.
- I don't need any favors.
Yeah, you do, unless you want Friday's headline to read,
"Marathon Footwear builds playgrounds that kill children."
My client builds playgrounds that help children.
And uses a synthetic full of toxins to do it.
Look, I don't know who you are, but I know what you're trying to do, and it isn't gonna work.
Look, I'm a reasonable man.
This is a huge moment for your client.
I won't file this before Friday.
You think I'm gonna let you extort my client?
No, I think you're gonna protect your client from a claim that could ruin them.
In fact, I'm counting on it.
Nice offices.
Enjoy that brunch.
- I got a job offer.
- Holy shit.
From who?
Last night.
Jonathan Sidwell.
But I thought Louis was his lawyer.
He doesn't want me to be his lawyer.
He wants me to be a partner.
- Investment banking?
- Yeah.
- And?
- I don't know.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
What do you think?
I think that I love you, and what you want to do is what I want you to do.
I don't know what to do.
Okay.
Did you talk to Harvey?
If I do that, all he'll hear is, "Hey, Harvey,
"thanks for doing everything for me.
I'm thinking about quitting." Well...
No, but you said that you don't think of him as just your boss.
You consider him a friend.
- So?
- So if he can't have an honest conversation with your best interests in mind, he's not your friend, and-- and he shouldn't be your boss.

I have to talk to you about something.
Well, unless its value is in excess of $575 million, it can wait.
Yeah.
Yeah, it can wait.
Good because our I.P.O. is in jeopardy unless we can deal with this.
Endangering children?
Wait, these things just opened.
This is a bullshit claim.
Maybe, but a bullshit claim on the right day is better than a great claim on a bullshit day.
Did you come up with that all by yourself?
My grandmother taught it to me.
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to find everything there is to know about this quelling guy.
Harvey, why don't you just pay him off?
Protect the I.P.O.?
I worked my ass off for this day.
He's trying to hijack it.
I'm not gonna be extorted by some piece of shit I've never heard of.
Okay.
On it.
Jessica.
Donna, what can I do for you?
I was just walking by reception, and I thought you might like to know--you know, because it's your firm and-- Donna, get to it.
Charles Van Dyke is in the lobby.
- Right now?
- 30 seconds ago.
You were right to come to me.
Would you like me to send him on his way?
I prefer to take care of Charles van dyke myself.
Excellent.
You can stare at it all you want, Charles, but it's not going to change.
I was just thinking,
"I can't believe you put the mailroom boy's name on the wall." I think what you mean is that you can't believe yours was ever taken off.
I put that behind me years ago.
What are you doing here, Charles?
I suggest we go in your office and talk.
Right here is just fine.
What do you want?
I want a 30% increase in my dividend check.
- Good-bye, Charles.
- I thought you'd say that.
This is formal notice of my demand to audit your books.
You have until Friday to comply.
You gave up this right when we ran you out of town.
I think you're forgetting I retain that right in the event of any material change in my dividend.
Your dividend went up.
Materially.
You think we're hiding profits.
From what I know of you, you're always hiding something.
- I'm gonna make it fast, Jim.
- James.
That's not what your ex-wife calls you.
She calls you Jim.
That's one of the nicer names she uses.
She's been calling you a lot these days.
Wow, you found out I'm divorced.
Well, I'll withdraw the lawsuit.
It's not the divorce, Jimbo, it's the huge wall of mounting debt that's closing in on you since you tanked the tobacco litigation.
I didn't tank it.
I lost.
You didn't just lose.
You had an offer that would have set you up for life.
Instead, you rolled the dice, went to verdict, and now you got nothing.
Which is why your wife left you, and now you're coming after us with a fabricated claim.
I didn't fabricate anything.
I have expert reports here.
You've got one report of possible toxins in the playground material.
And not one sick child.
And you have an I.P.O. on Friday, and if this suit appears in the Journal that morning, what do you think the stock price is gonna be when they ring that bell?
Got me.
Give me your number.
- 100,000 and we're done.
- Done.
We'll draw up the paperwork.
I've got it right here.
But one thing, this precludes you from representing any other plaintiffs with the same action.
You got me.
I have 100 other plaintiffs waiting in the wings.
That's a $10 million hit you just avoided.
I tell you what.
Give me a million, and we're really done.
James, this covers your debts and gets you out from under.
You think that means I'm gonna take less than it's worth?
- It isn't worth anything.
- It is today.
You know where to reach me.
Thought you said you were willing to go as high as 500,000.
Yeah, that was before
I realized what we were dealing with.
This guy doesn't owe money 'cause he got divorced.
He got divorced 'cause he owes money.
- What are you talking about?
- He's a gambler.
How does that help us?
He doesn't know I'm one.
Where's Louis?
- Jessica.
- Where is he?
He's not answering his phone.
He's not answering his emails.
The thing is I don't know if he--
Katrina, your job as gatekeeper does not apply to me, so I'm going to ask you one more time.
Why isn't Louis in the building?
He must still be in court.
Is there something I can do?
What you can do is find Louis and have him come up with a way around this demand to look at our books.
When should I tell him you need it?
Yesterday.
You were right.
Quelling's got a game.
- What night?
- Every night.
Well, I hope you know where tonight's game is because--
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.
You and I are going.
- Um...
- What?
I got a job offer, Harvey.
Supposed to go have drinks to talk about it tonight.
I can move it, it's just, that's... that's why I hesitated.
- When?
- When what?
When'd you get the job offer?
- The other night.
- And you didn't mention it.
I didn't know what I thought.
- And now you do?
- No.
It's--
Who?
Jonathan Sidwell.
The spin-off idea?
- Yeah.
- I should have known.
He wants you to be his general counsel?
No, he wants to make me an investment banker.
Well, if it were me...
I'd take it.
What?
Why?
Because you can compete there like you do here with nothing hanging over your head.
What if I don't want to stop being a lawyer?
Well, then don't take the job.
I mean, what do you want from me?
- I want your advice.
- I just gave you my advice.
No, you told me what you would do.
I want to know what you think I should do.
Mike, last week, you said you'd do anything to stop being a fraud, so my advice is take it.
Still be in the majors, just be a different sport.
Excuse me, do you have a minute?
Look, you and I have never--
No, we haven't.
I need your help.
You must be scraping the bottom of the barrel if you're coming to me.
It's about Louis.
He and Sheila are done.
That's awful.
It's worse than awful.
Jessica needs him on a case right now.
He won't leave his apartment.
He won't even answer his phone.
Then I'll just go over there right now.
That won't work.
Even if it did, we don't have time.
So then why are you here?
Rachel, you don't trust me.
I get that, but Louis asked me to cover for him, and that is what I'm going to do.
You're the best paralegal here, and you're his friend.
So will you help me or not?
I will.
So...
I figured out what you can do to make it up to me tonight.
I thought we were good.
Yeah, I'm just--I'm feeling some residual anger.
Scottie, I'm kind of busy right now, and I have plans tonight.
Taking Mike on another I.P.O. date?
- What difference does it make?
- Hmm.
Sounds mysterious.
Bet you can't tell me what it is.
- I'm playing poker.
- Poker?
Can I come?
It's a work thing.
- You bring Mike to work things.
- Scottie, I told you I'm busy.
You can't come.
Can I get back to work now?
- What got io you?
- Nothing.
Sometimes at the office, I'm working.
Fair enough, boss.
Are you sure that's how you want to play that?
Play what, the fact that I'm busy?
The fact that you just snapped at her when we both know what you're really angry about.
I'm not angry.
I'm annoyed at the interruption.
You're angry that Mike wants to leave, and you just took it out on her.
- I'm not angry about that.
- No, you're hurt, and the anger covers the hurt, but I knew you didn't know that.
I was annoyed about the interruption just like I'm annoyed right now.
Bullshit.
You're feeling exactly what I'm feeling.
The idea of Mike leaving sucks, and the sooner you get your brain around that, the sooner you can maybe do something about it.
Can I get back to work now?
You can get back to work whenever you want.
But if all you're gonna do is stick your head in the sand, then you're not going to have an associate or a girlfriend to get back to work from.
- You give it to her?
- I gave it to her.
She suspect anything?
I wouldn't be standing here if she did.
- And?
- She thought it was awesome.
Well, she should.
Louis didn't just come up with a way to keep Charles Van Dyke out of our books.
Louis came up with a way to blow him out of the water.
That Louis.
He is one hell of an attorney.
- Thank you, Louis.
- Right back at you, Louis.
Don't get used to it.
Don't worry.
I'm not looking to work here again.
Not here, but you are looking to work?
I've always been able to see through your bullshit, Charles.
Which is why I'm offering you these, five cases.
We're co-counsel, split the profits 50/50.
It announces to the world that you are back in business, which is what you really want.
You came to me bearing gifts.
I still have the card.
"To the man who hired me for all you've done."
Two days later, you shoved me out.
I take this to mean you're passing on my offer.
I'm shitting on your offer.
Okay, Charles.
You were right.
Your dividend check did have the wrong amount, but from now on, it's going to have the right amount, zero.
- I don't think so.
- Oh, the firm you had your exit agreement with no longer exists.
We became Pearson Darby, then Pearson Specter, which means you're not entitled to a thing.
That's not in the spirit of our agreement.
And neither is your claim.
There's only one problem.
You should have dug deeper into the fine print.
The entity referred to in our agreement is defined in your bylaws as "any partnership in which the name partner is Jessica Pearson."
You didn't know.
My number just tripled.
Your call.
Our hearing is Friday.
You guys playing cards?
You're out of your league.
This game is for real players.
Why don't I give it a try?
Buyin is 25,000.
- What's the limit?
- There is no limit.
Maybe I am out of my league.
Raise $45,000.
I'm putting you all-in.
I've seen guys like you before.
You think if you bully me with your big stack,
I'm gonna run and hide.
Here's the difference between you and me, Jimbo,
I lose, I pull out another 25 grand, and another 25 after that.
You lose, you've got nothing.
You're bluffing.
Then call or get up and walk away, but I've sat across from you 1,000 times before.
You won't walk.
Tough beat.
Take your winnings.
What winnings?
I thought maybe it was time we do a little negotiating.
Well, you have my offer.
- I have a counter.
- I'm all ears.
I want a 50% increase in base salary.
I want a guaranteed bonus not tied to our investment returns, a four-week vacation, and I want a piece.
- A piece?
- A piece.
- No.
- No piece?
No negotiating.
Look, I know what you're doing.
You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.
But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.
I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass.
- I do kick ass.
- And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.
But you don't.
I don't yet.
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be interviewing other people.
Once I find the right person, job is gone.
I'm not dropping my suit when you're going public in two days.
James, you've read all about Hessington Oil.
The odds were stacked against me.
I won anyway, because I win.
You won because Edward Darby came forward.
You got lucky.
Guys like you always think other people get lucky.
I don't get lucky.
I make my own luck, and in this case, it's bleeding you dry.
Right there.
You just gave me your tell.
You have no other money.
You're done.
There's $100,000 in that pile.
It's the exact amount of the deal we offered you.
Sign it.
We'll fix the paperwork tomorrow.
This is $1,000.
Cash me out.
He doesn't play anymore the rest of the night.
You didn't sleep well.
I didn't sleep at all.
It's a big decision.
You still haven't told me what you think.
Mike, I can't make the decision for you.
I don't want you to make it for me.
I just want to know what you think.
And I already told you that I will support you with whatever you decide.
And the way you can support me right now is by telling me how you feel.
- It's not my place.
- Not your place?
Just admit it.
You want me to take the job, but you're too afraid to say it.
Okay, you want to know the truth?
You already know what you want to do.
And if I try to change your mind and it goes wrong, then I'm afraid you're gonna hold it against me.
Would you just say it?
Yes.
I want you to take the job.
Look, I know that you love what you do, but every day, you go into work with the possibility of being caught, and it is eating away at you.
If you stay there, that's just not gonna change.
- Jessica.
How did--
- It go?
I'll tell you how it went.
I got hung out to dry.
What?
No, it was a good move.
Oh, it would have been if our own bylaws didn't supersede it.
Th--that's impossible.
It was convoluted and buried in the fine print, and something Louis Litt never would have missed.
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.
You're not.
He wouldn't have missed it.
So when you came into my office and told me Louis had come up with that move, you were full of shit.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to help.
Well, that kind of thing only happens once.
You know how I know it's not gonna happen again?
Pack up your shit.
I don't care what kind of deal you have with Harvey.
You're done.
Why wouldn't you tell her?
I said I would cover.
I didn't say I would cover when it suited me.
Yeah, but he wouldn't want you to get fired over this.
I should be fired.
I let Jessica look stupid.
Katrina--
Thank you for your help, Rachel.
I really appreciate it, but if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone.
He's not here.
Where is he?
To tell you the truth, I don't know.
All he said was he had a late night.
Hmm.
Well, I can come back.
- I was just--
- You're taking the job, aren't you?
I don't know.
Yeah, you do.
You just don't want to admit it.
Yeah.
I'm taking the job.
God damn it.
Do you know what that man has done for you?
Do you know what it took for him to start trusting someone?
- Donna--
- Don't interrupt me.
So someone's dangling some money in front of you.
- It's not about that.
- I don't care what it's about.
I'm gonna say what he won't.
He needs you.
You need this job, and if you can't see that, then you might as well just leave right now.
Donna, someone's offering me a way out.
- So you don't care about him.
- Of course I do, but I also care about my life with Rachel.
I don't want to live my life like this anymore.
Then you better be the best goddamn investment banker this city has ever seen.
Scottie, I'm sorry I was angry in your direction, but it was really about something else.
Let me guess, Donna explained your feelings to you, and now you're here to apologize.
Maybe.
What was the something else?
Mike got a job offer.
And you don't want him to do it.
No, I don't.
Well, if you want him to stay, you know what's actually a nice tactic?
Telling him you want him to stay.
What?
Had I known "tell me what's going on with you"
meant "I'm going to tell you what to do,"
I might not have taken you up on it.
Oh, okay.
Mmm.
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay.
You have that paperwork for me?
Well, I got something for you, but it's not that.
Didn't you learn your lesson last night?
I learned to listen.
When you talked, you mentioned Hessington Oil, so I looked back into it.
Turns out you don't create your own luck.
Your associate does.
What the hell are you talking about?
He conspired with Harold Gunderson to file a lawsuit against your own client so you could bribe witnesses not to testify.
We didn't bribe anyone.
- That was a legal settlement.
- Don't try to tell me two rookie associates who went to law school together and started at the same firm made this happen without collusion.
I don't need to tell you anything 'cause there's nothing to tell.
Well, you're gonna have to tell someone something, because that suit was filed one day, settled the next, and those witnesses cancelled their flights to New York.
That is a bribe, and when I bring it to the attention of the bar, you and your associate are going to be in deep shit.
Now who showed his tell?
Here's your money back.
And either I go to the bar, or you settle for $2 million.
You have until tomorrow.
Where's Mike?
He's in there.
Harvey--
- Harvey.
- Not now.
You need to call Lola Jensen.
What?
You need to get her to hack into the bar and put your name in.
What the hell are you talking about?
A week ago, you told me that the number one rule was not to move the goddamn body.
A week ago, people weren't sniffing around you.
- Harvey, my job offer is not--
- This isn't about your offer.
Quelling knows about your bullshit lawsuit with Harold Gunderson.
He turned me in?
No, but he will if we don't cave.
- He can't prove anything.
- He doesn't have to.
He hands you in to the bar, they look you up, we're done.
Not if I'm not here.
Oh, that's why you're in here.
You're taking the job.
I am.
And you think an addicted gambler who lost his wife, his child, and his house is gonna stop coming for you just because you're not working here?
You said it yourself.
Hacking into the bar is twice the crime I've been committing.
I am telling you Quelling is on the trail.
You don't do this, we're gonna get caught.
- There's got to be another way.
- There isn't.
- I don't believe that.
- Then you better figure something out fast, because tomorrow morning, we're done, and you quitting isn't gonna change that.
You can't fire Katrina Bennett.
I can fire whoever I want to.
She was covering for Louis.
What are you talking about?
Louis's engagement is over, and he's losing it.
He won't come in to work, he won't pick up his phone, and he just didn't want anyone to know.
Then why are you telling me?
Because I helped her cover for him.
Are you saying I should fire you too?
I am saying that...
We made a mistake, but that we were just looking out for Louis, and I know how much you value loyalty, so I don't think that should be the thing that costs Katrina her job... or mine.
- Jessica.
- I need you.
No, listen, I just need a little more time.
And had you asked me for it, I would have said yes, but instead, you had Katrina cover for you.
Oh, that little traitor.
What, did she rat me out?
No, she didn't.
She's so loyal to you that she tried to pass off her work for yours.
Louis, Van Dyke wants to look at our books.
What?
We can't have that.
I know.
This was her fix.
Oh, no, and you used this on him?
I did, and then I fired Katrina.
- Jessica.
- I know.
I can't fire her for being loyal.
But I can't afford you sitting here licking your wounds while I get my ass handed to me.
Please, just listen to me, okay?
I cannot see straight.
I cannot think straight, and even if I wanted to come and help you, I wouldn't be any good to you, so...
Louis...
I know you loved Sheila, but do you love your firm?
You know I do.
And when you love a woman, can you stand the thought of her being with another man?
- No.
- Well, Louis,
Van Dyke is trying to get into Pearson Specter's pants.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm gonna put on a goddamn chastity belt.
How?
'Cause Katrina actually was on the right track.
Van Dyke's claim is gone if the partnership is gone.
The bylaws say it's not.
No, it is if we become an L.L.C.
We can't do that by tomorrow.
We'd have to rewrite every contract.
Boy, wow, Jessica, you sometimes really surprise me.
You don't think I know that?
I have an army of associates that I've trained within an inch of their lives.
My name is Louis goddamn Marlowe Litt, and my firm is under siege, so don't you tell me what I can and cannot do!
- Hey.
- Hey.
I don't want to interrupt, but I was just wondering what happened with Mike.
He's leaving.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
Can I ask you something?
Did you tell him that you wanted him to stay?
I didn't get around to it.
You--you didn't get around to it?
I was gonna tell him, and then he told me he was leaving, and then other shit came up, so...
So you just dropped it?
I told you other shit came up.
What other shit?
I mean, you had an emergency case filing, so you let your protege walk out the door?
- It's complicated.
- Okay.
Well...then share it with me.
Quelling came after us.
The Hessington witnesses.
What?
That's bullshit.
You may have blurred some lines, but you certainly didn't cross any.
Fight him.
- No, I can't.
- Why?
Look, I don't want to talk about it.
What is going on here?
When somebody pisses you off, you get in the ring.
What are you saying?
What I'm saying is that you're not taking on Quelling, but you're letting Mike walk out the door without trying to stop him.
I think one thing changed the other, and I want to know why.
Maybe what changed is his desire to be here, and maybe what I have to say doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.
Now, what is this really about?
Because it's sure as hell not about some stupid case.
You know what?
God damn it!
For once, can't it just be about what I said it's about?
You didn't say what it was about.
Harvey, I'm really sorry that the Mike thing turned out this way.
I am, but I can't say that I didn't see it coming.
- Scottie, it isn't--
- What?
It isn't what?
It isn't what it seems?
Because I don't know what it seems.
All I know is that any time I ask you about anything, all you say is, "I can't talk about it."
I'm just gonna stop asking.
Then we'll just make up later, and we can do it all over again tomorrow.
Quelling can't hurt us anymore.
- You went to see Lola.
- I looked at his accounts.
I wanted to find out where all that money came from to find all those clients.
He doesn't have the money.
And yet his rent gets paid, and they don't turn off his electricity.
Holy shit.
Guess you didn't have to see Lola after all.
You think I got access to that with a court order?
So you did go see her?
You put the idea in my head.
I just came up with a different agenda.
We got him.
No.
You got him.
What?
Your going-away present.
Be a lawyer one last time.
Knock this guy out.
You have my settlement check.
I don't have a dime for you.
Then I guess the bar is going to be hearing from me first thing in the morning.
Well, then, they'll also be hearing from me.
Disciplinary rule 5-107a, "accepting compensation--"
- I know what it says.
- Then you also know the penalty is being disbarred.
You took money from our client's competitors to trump up your bullshit suit.
You didn't come by that legally.
And they're not gonna care.
I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't have a hell of a lot to lose, so sign my deal or get the hell out of my office.
Well, here's the thing, James.
I don't either...
Because today is my last day as a lawyer anyway.
- Bullshit.
- Look at me.
Good luck in front of the bar.
I wasn't always like this.
I had tobacco in my sights.
They offered me a lot of money.
I could have made a fortune.
But $15,000 per client for people with cancer?
I risked going to verdict because I wanted to get those people something that could make a difference!
And I lost everything...
My clients, my wife, my kids!
You lost them because you gambled them away, James.
I know that.
Please.
Being a lawyer is what I am.
It's who I am.
And if you take that away...
It's up to you, James.
I'll drop the suit.
I promise.
Louis, where the hell are you?
You said you could get it done.
I walk through those doors, our books fly open.
Get here now.
Well, this should be fun.
We've never been across the aisle from each other.
Which is why you don't realize that it won't be fun.
We'll see what we see.
Case 41432, Van Dyke versus Pearson.
Look at that.
Game time.
Ladies first.
Ladies first.
Son of a bitch.
For being polite?
Were you being polite when you hired me?
What does one have to do with the other?
"To the man who hired me, for all you've done."
Do you want to know what I meant when I wrote that card?
The day you made me that offer, I asked you,
"did it have anything to do with gender or race?"
You swore it didn't.
You lied to me.
- It didn't.
- You're lying now.
You know, Daniel Hardman may have used people, but he didn't give a shit about their gender or their color.
- He showed you the list.
- Right next to my name, an asterisk.
Not "Law Review."
Not second in my class.
Diversity.
- You were treated the same.
- You tell yourself that, but we both know the truth, which is why I sleep at night just fine.
Well, it doesn't change the facts in this case, does it?
No.
No, it doesn't, but this will.
Charles, you remember Louis Litt?
Sorry, I couldn't run.
Doctor wanted me to take it easy.
Hey, Charles.
Great to see you.
You told me that story to stall.
- That was a stall...
- Hmm.
But this is for me.
When I saw that asterisk next to my name, it made me sick to my stomach, because in one second,
I understood how you will always see me.
So that card was a thank you, because if I hadn't have felt sick, then I might not have worked as hard as I did to get where I am today.
You woke the dragon, Charles.
How do you like me now?
I know you're there.
You need anything?
No.
The I.P.O. is wrapped up.
We go public Monday morning.
I wasn't talking about the I.P.O.
I was talking about how you're feeling about Mike.
I know.
Okay.
Good night, Harvey.
I'm gonna tell Scottie.
About Mike?
Are you crazy?
You can't have it both ways, Donna.
You can't tell me to open up and then keep my secrets.
You spent more than a year covering it up.
You tried to get him to commit another crime to cover it up, and now-- You said I should tell her what's really bothering me!
I meant your feelings.
I didn't mean confess to a felony.
These are my goddamn feelings!
Donna, I did something when I hired him.
It's caused all of this.
I can't tell her, and it's driving me crazy!
Okay.
Look, Mike is gone, Harvey.
I hate that he's gone, but the jeopardy's gone too.
It's done.
And now you want to turn around and tell someone who--
Someone who what?
Nothing.
No, you better finish that sentence.
Someone who's pissed at you, Harvey.
Someone who keeps finding a reason to be pissed at you, and it's not the third time, and it's not the fifth time, and it's not the last time.
I thought you were trying to help my relationship, not shit on it.
Okay, you want to yell at me?
Fine.
Because I know you're not mad at me.
And I know you're only telling me this stupid idea because you want me to tell you what you already know.
You can't, Harvey.
It's good that you want to, but you can't.
Could I have a minute?
Congratulate me.
I'm officially a member of the New York bar.
You went to Lola?
I made a mistake.
I want to stay.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Sheila Amanda Sazs, will you marry me?
Yes, I will marry you.
- I want to go legit.
- You can't.
Then I get Lola Jensen to hack into the bar and just put me in there, just like she did with Harvard.
Rule number one of not getting caught, you don't move the goddamn body.
Harvey, I'm stuck.
I can't live my whole life like this.
You want me to set up your new corporation?
I want you to join my new corporation.
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.
Our job blows yours out of the water.
Scottie, I need you to give Louis his transaction back.
Does this have something to do with that favor he did you?
- Yes.
- Tell me what it is.
- I can't.
- Guess we're not sharing everything with each other after all.
- Scottie.
- You can't have it both ways, Harvey.
- Louis, I don't want kids.
- What are you talking about?
I don't like kids.
I was willing to give up Harvard for you.
You can't give up something for me?
I understand.
Can I just say something please?
I know you keep saying that I won't feel this way forever, but why is it when the guys shows up with chicken vindaloo 40 minutes late with no naan and no silverware, instead of throwing the chutney in his face,
I'm thanking him and I am tipping him $20?
Do you want to tell me why that happens?
I don't care.
I hate myself.
I hate my life.
The woman I love is gone, my heart is broken, and I really-- to be honest with you,
I just don't have the will to live.
[Beeps]
Hold on.
It's my associate.
Katrina.
Louis, it's 7:55.
Yeah.
I have an 8:00 a.m.
Please cover it for me.
In fact, cover everything, and unless the building is on fire and Sheila's in it,
I'm not coming in.
Louis, what happened?
You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
My heart's been shattered into a thousand million pieces, and if I can't put my heart into my work, then I'm not gonna do any work at all, so...
How long do you think you'll be out?
I don't know.
Today, tomorrow, the rest of the year.
You know, just don't call here again because I'm not gonna answer the number.
Doc?
Dr. Lipschitz?
Hello?
What, are you shitting me?
That was not 50 minutes.
Waiting outside for me?
Bold gesture.
I called you three times.
I had to do something.
- You must be feeling bad.
- I am.
What for?
You're just doing your job.
Scottie, I'm sorry.
What happened with Louis, I didn't like doing it.
- Yeah, but you still did it.
- And what I'm doing now is asking you to let it go.
Harvey, it's not that you picked Louis over me.
It's that you wouldn't tell me why.
I couldn't tell you why.
There's a difference.
And I'm asking you to trust me.
Okay.
I can let it go, but keeping things from me just can't keep happening, okay?
I can't tell you whether or not that's okay, and I definitely can't tell you why.
Too soon?
What are you going to do to make it up to me?
Nothing right now.
I'm taking Mike to the marathon footwear brunch.
You're taking a date to an I.P.O. event?
That's so cute.
It's not a date.
He's never gonna put out.
Well, it's too bad that you're not taking me because I was thinking of letting you...
[Whispers indistinctly]
Mr. Specter.
James Quelling.
I'm in a bit of a hurry, Mr. quelling.
- I want to do you a favor.
- I don't need any favors.
Yeah, you do, unless you want Friday's headline to read,
"Marathon Footwear builds playgrounds that kill children."
My client builds playgrounds that help children.
And uses a synthetic full of toxins to do it.
Look, I don't know who you are, but I know what you're trying to do, and it isn't gonna work.
Look, I'm a reasonable man.
This is a huge moment for your client.
I won't file this before Friday.
You think I'm gonna let you extort my client?
No, I think you're gonna protect your client from a claim that could ruin them.
In fact, I'm counting on it.
Nice offices.
Enjoy that brunch.
- I got a job offer.
- Holy shit.
From who?
Last night.
Jonathan Sidwell.
But I thought Louis was his lawyer.
He doesn't want me to be his lawyer.
He wants me to be a partner.
- Investment banking?
- Yeah.
- And?
- I don't know.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
What do you think?
I think that I love you, and what you want to do is what I want you to do.
I don't know what to do.
Okay.
Did you talk to Harvey?
If I do that, all he'll hear is, "Hey, Harvey,
"thanks for doing everything for me.
I'm thinking about quitting." Well...
No, but you said that you don't think of him as just your boss.
You consider him a friend.
- So?
- So if he can't have an honest conversation with your best interests in mind, he's not your friend, and-- and he shouldn't be your boss.

I have to talk to you about something.
Well, unless its value is in excess of $575 million, it can wait.
Yeah.
Yeah, it can wait.
Good because our I.P.O. is in jeopardy unless we can deal with this.
Endangering children?
Wait, these things just opened.
This is a bullshit claim.
Maybe, but a bullshit claim on the right day is better than a great claim on a bullshit day.
Did you come up with that all by yourself?
My grandmother taught it to me.
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to find everything there is to know about this quelling guy.
Harvey, why don't you just pay him off?
Protect the I.P.O.?
I worked my ass off for this day.
He's trying to hijack it.
I'm not gonna be extorted by some piece of shit I've never heard of.
Okay.
On it.
Jessica.
Donna, what can I do for you?
I was just walking by reception, and I thought you might like to know--you know, because it's your firm and-- Donna, get to it.
Charles Van Dyke is in the lobby.
- Right now?
- 30 seconds ago.
You were right to come to me.
Would you like me to send him on his way?
I prefer to take care of Charles van dyke myself.
Excellent.
You can stare at it all you want, Charles, but it's not going to change.
I was just thinking,
"I can't believe you put the mailroom boy's name on the wall." I think what you mean is that you can't believe yours was ever taken off.
I put that behind me years ago.
What are you doing here, Charles?
I suggest we go in your office and talk.
Right here is just fine.
What do you want?
I want a 30% increase in my dividend check.
- Good-bye, Charles.
- I thought you'd say that.
This is formal notice of my demand to audit your books.
You have until Friday to comply.
You gave up this right when we ran you out of town.
I think you're forgetting I retain that right in the event of any material change in my dividend.
Your dividend went up.
Materially.
You think we're hiding profits.
From what I know of you, you're always hiding something.
- I'm gonna make it fast, Jim.
- James.
That's not what your ex-wife calls you.
She calls you Jim.
That's one of the nicer names she uses.
She's been calling you a lot these days.
Wow, you found out I'm divorced.
Well, I'll withdraw the lawsuit.
It's not the divorce, Jimbo, it's the huge wall of mounting debt that's closing in on you since you tanked the tobacco litigation.
I didn't tank it.
I lost.
You didn't just lose.
You had an offer that would have set you up for life.
Instead, you rolled the dice, went to verdict, and now you got nothing.
Which is why your wife left you, and now you're coming after us with a fabricated claim.
I didn't fabricate anything.
I have expert reports here.
You've got one report of possible toxins in the playground material.
And not one sick child.
And you have an I.P.O. on Friday, and if this suit appears in the Journal that morning, what do you think the stock price is gonna be when they ring that bell?
Got me.
Give me your number.
- 100,000 and we're done.
- Done.
We'll draw up the paperwork.
I've got it right here.
But one thing, this precludes you from representing any other plaintiffs with the same action.
[Laughs] You got me.
I have 100 other plaintiffs waiting in the wings.
That's a $10 million hit you just avoided.
I tell you what.
Give me a million, and we're really done.
James, this covers your debts and gets you out from under.
You think that means I'm gonna take less than it's worth?
- It isn't worth anything.
- It is today.
You know where to reach me.
Thought you said you were willing to go as high as 500,000.
Yeah, that was before
I realized what we were dealing with.
This guy doesn't owe money 'cause he got divorced.
He got divorced 'cause he owes money.
- What are you talking about?
- He's a gambler.
How does that help us?
He doesn't know I'm one.
Where's Louis?
- Jessica.
- Where is he?
He's not answering his phone.
He's not answering his emails.
The thing is I don't know if he--
Katrina, your job as gatekeeper does not apply to me, so I'm going to ask you one more time.
Why isn't Louis in the building?
He must still be in court.
Is there something I can do?
What you can do is find Louis and have him come up with a way around this demand to look at our books.
When should I tell him you need it?
Yesterday.
You were right.
Quelling's got a game.
- What night?
- Every night.
Well, I hope you know where tonight's game is because--
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.
You and I are going.
- Um...
- What?
I got a job offer, Harvey.
Supposed to go have drinks to talk about it tonight.
I can move it, it's just, that's... that's why I hesitated.
- When?
- When what?
When'd you get the job offer?
- The other night.
- And you didn't mention it.
I didn't know what I thought.
- And now you do?
- No.
It's--
Who?
Jonathan Sidwell.
The spin-off idea?
- Yeah.
- I should have known.
He wants you to be his general counsel?
No, he wants to make me an investment banker.
Well, if it were me...
I'd take it.
What?
Why?
Because you can compete there like you do here with nothing hanging over your head.
What if I don't want to stop being a lawyer?
Well, then don't take the job.
I mean, what do you want from me?
- I want your advice.
- I just gave you my advice.
No, you told me what you would do.
I want to know what you think I should do.
Mike, last week, you said you'd do anything to stop being a fraud, so my advice is take it.
Still be in the majors, just be a different sport.
[Clears throat]
Excuse me, do you have a minute?
Look, you and I have never--
No, we haven't.
I need your help.
You must be scraping the bottom of the barrel if you're coming to me.
It's about Louis.
He and Sheila are done.
That's awful.
It's worse than awful.
Jessica needs him on a case right now.
He won't leave his apartment.
He won't even answer his phone.
Then I'll just go over there right now.
That won't work.
Even if it did, we don't have time.
So then why are you here?
Rachel, you don't trust me.
I get that, but Louis asked me to cover for him, and that is what I'm going to do.
You're the best paralegal here, and you're his friend.
So will you help me or not?
I will.
So...
I figured out what you can do to make it up to me tonight.
I thought we were good.
Yeah, I'm just--I'm feeling some residual anger.
Scottie, I'm kind of busy right now, and I have plans tonight.
Taking Mike on another I.P.O. date?
- What difference does it make?
- Hmm.
Sounds mysterious.
Bet you can't tell me what it is.
- I'm playing poker.
- Poker?
Can I come?
It's a work thing.
- You bring Mike to work things.
- Scottie, I told you I'm busy.
You can't come.
Can I get back to work now?
- What got io you?
- Nothing.
Sometimes at the office, I'm working.
Fair enough, boss.
Are you sure that's how you want to play that?
Play what, the fact that I'm busy?
The fact that you just snapped at her when we both know what you're really angry about.
I'm not angry.
I'm annoyed at the interruption.
You're angry that Mike wants to leave, and you just took it out on her.
- I'm not angry about that.
- No, you're hurt, and the anger covers the hurt, but I knew you didn't know that.
I was annoyed about the interruption just like I'm annoyed right now.
Bullshit.
You're feeling exactly what I'm feeling.
The idea of Mike leaving sucks, and the sooner you get your brain around that, the sooner you can maybe do something about it.
Can I get back to work now?
You can get back to work whenever you want.
But if all you're gonna do is stick your head in the sand, then you're not going to have an associate or a girlfriend to get back to work from.
- You give it to her?
- I gave it to her.
She suspect anything?
I wouldn't be standing here if she did.
- And?
- She thought it was awesome.
Well, she should.
Louis didn't just come up with a way to keep Charles Van Dyke out of our books.
Louis came up with a way to blow him out of the water.
That Louis.
He is one hell of an attorney.
- Thank you, Louis.
- Right back at you, Louis.
Don't get used to it.
Don't worry.
I'm not looking to work here again.
Not here, but you are looking to work?
I've always been able to see through your bullshit, Charles.
Which is why I'm offering you these, five cases.
We're co-counsel, split the profits 50/50.
It announces to the world that you are back in business, which is what you really want.
You came to me bearing gifts.
I still have the card.
"To the man who hired me for all you've done."
Two days later, you shoved me out.
I take this to mean you're passing on my offer.
I'm shitting on your offer.
Okay, Charles.
You were right.
Your dividend check did have the wrong amount, but from now on, it's going to have the right amount, zero.
- I don't think so.
- Oh, the firm you had your exit agreement with no longer exists.
We became Pearson Darby, then Pearson Specter, which means you're not entitled to a thing.
That's not in the spirit of our agreement.
And neither is your claim.
There's only one problem.
You should have dug deeper into the fine print.
The entity referred to in our agreement is defined in your bylaws as "any partnership in which the name partner is Jessica Pearson."
You didn't know.
My number just tripled.
Your call.
Our hearing is Friday.
You guys playing cards?
You're out of your league.
This game is for real players.
Why don't I give it a try?
Buyin is 25,000.
- What's the limit?
- There is no limit.
Maybe I am out of my league.
Raise $45,000.
I'm putting you all-in.
I've seen guys like you before.
You think if you bully me with your big stack,
I'm gonna run and hide.
Here's the difference between you and me, Jimbo,
I lose, I pull out another 25 grand, and another 25 after that.
You lose, you've got nothing.
You're bluffing.
Then call or get up and walk away, but I've sat across from you 1,000 times before.
You won't walk.
Tough beat.
Take your winnings.
What winnings?
I thought maybe it was time we do a little negotiating.
Well, you have my offer.
- I have a counter.
- I'm all ears.
I want a 50% increase in base salary.
I want a guaranteed bonus not tied to our investment returns, a four-week vacation, and I want a piece.
- A piece?
- A piece.
- No.
- No piece?
No negotiating.
Look, I know what you're doing.
You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.
But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.
I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass.
- I do kick ass.
- And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.
But you don't.
I don't yet.
[Clears throat]
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be interviewing other people.
Once I find the right person, job is gone.
I'm not dropping my suit when you're going public in two days.
James, you've read all about Hessington Oil.
The odds were stacked against me.
I won anyway, because I win.
You won because Edward Darby came forward.
You got lucky.
Guys like you always think other people get lucky.
I don't get lucky.
I make my own luck, and in this case, it's bleeding you dry.
Right there.
You just gave me your tell.
You have no other money.
You're done.
There's $100,000 in that pile.
It's the exact amount of the deal we offered you.
Sign it.
We'll fix the paperwork tomorrow.
This is $1,000.
Cash me out.
He doesn't play anymore the rest of the night.
You didn't sleep well.
I didn't sleep at all.
It's a big decision.
You still haven't told me what you think.
Mike, I can't make the decision for you.
I don't want you to make it for me.
I just want to know what you think.
And I already told you that I will support you with whatever you decide.
And the way you can support me right now is by telling me how you feel.
- It's not my place.
- Not your place?
Just admit it.
You want me to take the job, but you're too afraid to say it.
Okay, you want to know the truth?
You already know what you want to do.
And if I try to change your mind and it goes wrong, then I'm afraid you're gonna hold it against me.
Would you just say it?
Yes.
I want you to take the job.
Look, I know that you love what you do, but every day, you go into work with the possibility of being caught, and it is eating away at you.
If you stay there, that's just not gonna change.
- Jessica.
How did--
- It go?
I'll tell you how it went.
I got hung out to dry.
What?
No, it was a good move.
Oh, it would have been if our own bylaws didn't supersede it.
Th--that's impossible.
It was convoluted and buried in the fine print, and something Louis Litt never would have missed.
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.
You're not.
He wouldn't have missed it.
So when you came into my office and told me Louis had come up with that move, you were full of shit.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to help.
Well, that kind of thing only happens once.
You know how I know it's not gonna happen again?
Pack up your shit.
I don't care what kind of deal you have with Harvey.
You're done.
Why wouldn't you tell her?
I said I would cover.
I didn't say I would cover when it suited me.
Yeah, but he wouldn't want you to get fired over this.
I should be fired.
I let Jessica look stupid.
Katrina--
Thank you for your help, Rachel.
I really appreciate it, but if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone.
He's not here.
Where is he?
To tell you the truth, I don't know.
All he said was he had a late night.
Hmm.
Well, I can come back.
- I was just--
- You're taking the job, aren't you?
I don't know.
Yeah, you do.
You just don't want to admit it.
[Sighs]
Yeah.
I'm taking the job.
[Sighs]
God damn it.
Do you know what that man has done for you?
Do you know what it took for him to start trusting someone?
- Donna--
- Don't interrupt me.
So someone's dangling some money in front of you.
- It's not about that.
- I don't care what it's about.
I'm gonna say what he won't.
He needs you.
You need this job, and if you can't see that, then you might as well just leave right now.
Donna, someone's offering me a way out.
- So you don't care about him.
- Of course I do, but I also care about my life with Rachel.
I don't want to live my life like this anymore.
Then you better be the best goddamn investment banker this city has ever seen.
Scottie, I'm sorry I was angry in your direction, but it was really about something else.
Let me guess, Donna explained your feelings to you, and now you're here to apologize.
Maybe.
What was the something else?
Mike got a job offer.
And you don't want him to do it.
No, I don't.
Well, if you want him to stay, you know what's actually a nice tactic?
Telling him you want him to stay.
What?
Had I known "tell me what's going on with you"
meant "I'm going to tell you what to do,"
I might not have taken you up on it.
Oh, okay. [Laughs] Mmm.
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay.
You have that paperwork for me?
Well, I got something for you, but it's not that.
Didn't you learn your lesson last night?
I learned to listen.
When you talked, you mentioned Hessington Oil, so I looked back into it.
Turns out you don't create your own luck.
Your associate does.
What the hell are you talking about?
He conspired with Harold Gunderson to file a lawsuit against your own client so you could bribe witnesses not to testify.
- We didn't bribe anyone.
- [Scoffs]
- That was a legal settlement.
- Don't try to tell me two rookie associates who went to law school together and started at the same firm made this happen without collusion.
I don't need to tell you anything 'cause there's nothing to tell.
Well, you're gonna have to tell someone something, because that suit was filed one day, settled the next, and those witnesses cancelled their flights to New York.
That is a bribe, and when I bring it to the attention of the bar, you and your associate are going to be in deep shit.
Now who showed his tell?
Here's your money back.
And either I go to the bar, or you settle for $2 million.
You have until tomorrow.
Where's Mike?
He's in there.
Harvey--
- Harvey.
- Not now.
You need to call Lola Jensen.
What?
You need to get her to hack into the bar and put your name in.
What the hell are you talking about?
A week ago, you told me that the number one rule was not to move the goddamn body.
A week ago, people weren't sniffing around you.
- Harvey, my job offer is not--
- This isn't about your offer.
Quelling knows about your bullshit lawsuit with Harold Gunderson.
He turned me in?
No, but he will if we don't cave.
- He can't prove anything.
- He doesn't have to.
He hands you in to the bar, they look you up, we're done.
Not if I'm not here.
Oh, that's why you're in here.
You're taking the job.
I am.
And you think an addicted gambler who lost his wife, his child, and his house is gonna stop coming for you just because you're not working here?
You said it yourself.
Hacking into the bar is twice the crime I've been committing.
I am telling you Quelling is on the trail.
You don't do this, we're gonna get caught.
- There's got to be another way.
- There isn't.
- I don't believe that.
- Then you better figure something out fast, because tomorrow morning, we're done, and you quitting isn't gonna change that.
[Sighs]
You can't fire Katrina Bennett.
I can fire whoever I want to.
She was covering for Louis.
What are you talking about?
Louis's engagement is over, and he's losing it.
He won't come in to work, he won't pick up his phone, and he just didn't want anyone to know.
Then why are you telling me?
Because I helped her cover for him.
Are you saying I should fire you too?
I am saying that...
We made a mistake, but that we were just looking out for Louis, and I know how much you value loyalty, so I don't think that should be the thing that costs Katrina her job... or mine.
- Jessica.
- I need you.
No, listen, I just need a little more time.
And had you asked me for it, I would have said yes, but instead, you had Katrina cover for you.
Oh, that little traitor.
What, did she rat me out?
No, she didn't.
She's so loyal to you that she tried to pass off her work for yours.
Louis, Van Dyke wants to look at our books.
What?
We can't have that.
I know.
This was her fix.
Oh, no, and you used this on him?
I did, and then I fired Katrina.
- Jessica.
- I know.
I can't fire her for being loyal.
But I can't afford you sitting here licking your wounds while I get my ass handed to me.
Please, just listen to me, okay?
I cannot see straight.
I cannot think straight, and even if I wanted to come and help you, I wouldn't be any good to you, so...
Louis...
I know you loved Sheila, but do you love your firm?
You know I do.
And when you love a woman, can you stand the thought of her being with another man?
- No.
- Well, Louis,
Van Dyke is trying to get into Pearson Specter's pants.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm gonna put on a goddamn chastity belt.
How?
'Cause Katrina actually was on the right track.
Van Dyke's claim is gone if the partnership is gone.
The bylaws say it's not.
No, it is if we become an L.L.C.
We can't do that by tomorrow.
We'd have to rewrite every contract.
Boy, wow, Jessica, you sometimes really surprise me.
You don't think I know that?
I have an army of associates that I've trained within an inch of their lives.
My name is Louis goddamn Marlowe Litt, and my firm is under siege, so don't you tell me what I can and cannot do!
- Hey.
- Hey.
I don't want to interrupt, but I was just wondering what happened with Mike.
He's leaving.
[Sighs]
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
Can I ask you something?
Did you tell him that you wanted him to stay?
I didn't get around to it.
You--you didn't get around to it?
I was gonna tell him, and then he told me he was leaving, and then other shit came up, so...
So you just dropped it?
I told you other shit came up.
What other shit?
I mean, you had an emergency case filing, so you let your protege walk out the door?
- It's complicated.
- Okay.
Well...then share it with me.
Quelling came after us.
The Hessington witnesses.
What?
That's bullshit.
You may have blurred some lines, but you certainly didn't cross any.
Fight him.
- No, I can't.
- Why?
Look, I don't want to talk about it.
What is going on here?
When somebody pisses you off, you get in the ring.
What are you saying?
What I'm saying is that you're not taking on Quelling, but you're letting Mike walk out the door without trying to stop him.
I think one thing changed the other, and I want to know why.
Maybe what changed is his desire to be here, and maybe what I have to say doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.
Now, what is this really about?
Because it's sure as hell not about some stupid case.
You know what?
God damn it!
For once, can't it just be about what I said it's about?
You didn't say what it was about.
Harvey, I'm really sorry that the Mike thing turned out this way.
I am, but I can't say that I didn't see it coming.
- Scottie, it isn't--
- What?
It isn't what?
It isn't what it seems?
Because I don't know what it seems.
All I know is that any time I ask you about anything, all you say is, "I can't talk about it."
I'm just gonna stop asking.
Then we'll just make up later, and we can do it all over again tomorrow.
[Knock at door]
Quelling can't hurt us anymore.
- You went to see Lola.
- I looked at his accounts.
I wanted to find out where all that money came from to find all those clients.
He doesn't have the money.
And yet his rent gets paid, and they don't turn off his electricity.
Holy shit.
Guess you didn't have to see Lola after all.
You think I got access to that with a court order?
So you did go see her?
You put the idea in my head.
I just came up with a different agenda.
We got him.
No.
You got him.
What?
Your going-away present.
Be a lawyer one last time.
Knock this guy out.
[Knock at door]
You have my settlement check.
I don't have a dime for you.
Then I guess the bar is going to be hearing from me first thing in the morning.
Well, then, they'll also be hearing from me.
Disciplinary rule 5-107a, "accepting compensation--"
- I know what it says.
- Then you also know the penalty is being disbarred.
You took money from our client's competitors to trump up your bullshit suit.
You didn't come by that legally.
And they're not gonna care.
I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't have a hell of a lot to lose, so sign my deal or get the hell out of my office.
Well, here's the thing, James.
I don't either...
Because today is my last day as a lawyer anyway.
- Bullshit.
- Look at me.
Good luck in front of the bar.
I wasn't always like this.
I had tobacco in my sights.
They offered me a lot of money.
I could have made a fortune.
But $15,000 per client for people with cancer?
I risked going to verdict because I wanted to get those people something that could make a difference!
And I lost everything...
My clients, my wife, my kids!
You lost them because you gambled them away, James.
I know that.
Please.
Being a lawyer is what I am.
It's who I am.
And if you take that away...
It's up to you, James.
I'll drop the suit.
I promise.
Louis, where the hell are you?
You said you could get it done.
I walk through those doors, our books fly open.
Get here now.
Well, this should be fun.
We've never been across the aisle from each other.
Which is why you don't realize that it won't be fun.
We'll see what we see.
Case 41432, Van Dyke versus Pearson.
Look at that.
Game time.
Ladies first.
Ladies first.
Son of a bitch.
For being polite?
Were you being polite when you hired me?
What does one have to do with the other?
"To the man who hired me, for all you've done."
Do you want to know what I meant when I wrote that card?
The day you made me that offer, I asked you,
"did it have anything to do with gender or race?"
You swore it didn't.
You lied to me.
- It didn't.
- You're lying now.
You know, Daniel Hardman may have used people, but he didn't give a shit about their gender or their color.
- He showed you the list.
- Right next to my name, an asterisk.
Not "Law Review."
Not second in my class.
Diversity.
- You were treated the same.
- You tell yourself that, but we both know the truth, which is why I sleep at night just fine.
Well, it doesn't change the facts in this case, does it?
No.
No, it doesn't, but this will.
Charles, you remember Louis Litt?
Sorry, I couldn't run.
Doctor wanted me to take it easy.
Hey, Charles.
[Spanks him] Great to see you.
You told me that story to stall.
- That was a stall...
- Hmm.
But this is for me.
When I saw that asterisk next to my name, it made me sick to my stomach, because in one second,
I understood how you will always see me.
So that card was a thank you, because if I hadn't have felt sick, then I might not have worked as hard as I did to get where I am today.
You woke the dragon, Charles.
How do you like me now?
I know you're there.
You need anything?
No.
The I.P.O. is wrapped up.
We go public Monday morning.
I wasn't talking about the I.P.O.
I was talking about how you're feeling about Mike.
I know.
Okay.
Good night, Harvey.
I'm gonna tell Scottie.
About Mike?
Are you crazy?
You can't have it both ways, Donna.
You can't tell me to open up and then keep my secrets.
You spent more than a year covering it up.
You tried to get him to commit another crime to cover it up, and now-- You said I should tell her what's really bothering me!
I meant your feelings.
I didn't mean confess to a felony.
These are my goddamn feelings!
Donna, I did something when I hired him.
It's caused all of this.
I can't tell her, and it's driving me crazy!
Okay.
Look, Mike is gone, Harvey.
I hate that he's gone, but the jeopardy's gone too.
It's done.
And now you want to turn around and tell someone who--
Someone who what?
Nothing.
No, you better finish that sentence.
Someone who's pissed at you, Harvey.
Someone who keeps finding a reason to be pissed at you, and it's not the third time, and it's not the fifth time, and it's not the last time.
I thought you were trying to help my relationship, not shit on it.
Okay, you want to yell at me?
Fine.
Because I know you're not mad at me.
And I know you're only telling me this stupid idea because you want me to tell you what you already know.
You can't, Harvey.
It's good that you want to, but you can't.
Could I have a minute?
Congratulate me.
I'm officially a member of the New York bar.
You went to Lola?
I made a mistake.
I want to stay.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Sheila Amanda Sazs, will you marry me?
Yes, I will marry you.
- I want to go legit.
- You can't.
Then I get Lola Jensen to hack into the bar and just put me in there, just like she did with Harvard.
Rule number one of not getting caught, you don't move the goddamn body.
Harvey, I'm stuck.
I can't live my whole life like this.
You want me to set up your new corporation?
I want you to join my new corporation.
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.
Our job blows yours out of the water.
Scottie, I need you to give Louis his transaction back.
Does this have something to do with that favor he did you?
- Yes.
- Tell me what it is.
- I can't.
- Guess we're not sharing everything with each other after all.
- Scottie.
- You can't have it both ways, Harvey.
- Louis, I don't want kids.
- What are you talking about?
I don't like kids.
I was willing to give up Harvard for you.
You can't give up something for me?
I understand.
Can I just say something please?
I know you keep saying that I won't feel this way forever, but why is it when the guys shows up with chicken vindaloo 40 minutes late with no naan and no silverware, instead of throwing the chutney in his face,
I'm thanking him and I am tipping him $20?
Do you want to tell me why that happens?
I don't care.
I hate myself.
I hate my life.
The woman I love is gone, my heart is broken, and I really-- to be honest with you,
I just don't have the will to live.
Hold on.
It's my associate.
Katrina.
Louis, it's 7:55.
Yeah.
I have an 8:00 a.m.
Please cover it for me.
In fact, cover everything, and unless the building is on fire and Sheila's in it,
I'm not coming in.
Louis, what happened?
You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
My heart's been shattered into a thousand million pieces, and if I can't put my heart into my work, then I'm not gonna do any work at all, so...
How long do you think you'll be out?
I don't know.
Today, tomorrow, the rest of the year.
You know, just don't call here again because I'm not gonna answer the number.
Doc?
Dr. Lipschitz?
Hello?
What, are you shitting me?
That was not 50 minutes.
Waiting outside for me?
Bold gesture.
I called you three times.
I had to do something.
- You must be feeling bad.
- I am.
What for?
You're just doing your job.
Scottie, I'm sorry.
What happened with Louis, I didn't like doing it.
- Yeah, but you still did it.
- And what I'm doing now is asking you to let it go.
Harvey, it's not that you picked Louis over me.
It's that you wouldn't tell me why.
I couldn't tell you why.
There's a difference.
And I'm asking you to trust me.
Okay.
I can let it go, but keeping things from me just can't keep happening, okay?
I can't tell you whether or not that's okay, and I definitely can't tell you why.
Too soon?
What are you going to do to make it up to me?
Nothing right now.
I'm taking Mike to the marathon footwear brunch.
You're taking a date to an I.P.O. event?
That's so cute.
It's not a date.
He's never gonna put out.
Well, it's too bad that you're not taking me because I was thinking of letting you...
Mr. Specter.
James Quelling.
I'm in a bit of a hurry, Mr. quelling.
- I want to do you a favor.
- I don't need any favors.
Yeah, you do, unless you want Friday's headline to read,
"Marathon Footwear builds playgrounds that kill children."
My client builds playgrounds that help children.
And uses a synthetic full of toxins to do it.
Look, I don't know who you are, but I know what you're trying to do, and it isn't gonna work.
Look, I'm a reasonable man.
This is a huge moment for your client.
I won't file this before Friday.
You think I'm gonna let you extort my client?
No, I think you're gonna protect your client from a claim that could ruin them.
In fact, I'm counting on it.
Nice offices.
Enjoy that brunch.
- I got a job offer.
- Holy shit.
From who?
Last night.
Jonathan Sidwell.
But I thought Louis was his lawyer.
He doesn't want me to be his lawyer.
He wants me to be a partner.
- Investment banking?
- Yeah.
- And?
- I don't know.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
What do you think?
I think that I love you, and what you want to do is what I want you to do.
I don't know what to do.
Okay.
Did you talk to Harvey?
If I do that, all he'll hear is, "Hey, Harvey,
"thanks for doing everything for me.
I'm thinking about quitting." Well...
No, but you said that you don't think of him as just your boss.
You consider him a friend.
- So?
- So if he can't have an honest conversation with your best interests in mind, he's not your friend, and-- and he shouldn't be your boss.

I have to talk to you about something.
Well, unless its value is in excess of $575 million, it can wait.
Yeah.
Yeah, it can wait.
Good because our I.P.O. is in jeopardy unless we can deal with this.
Endangering children?
Wait, these things just opened.
This is a bullshit claim.
Maybe, but a bullshit claim on the right day is better than a great claim on a bullshit day.
Did you come up with that all by yourself?
My grandmother taught it to me.
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to find everything there is to know about this quelling guy.
Harvey, why don't you just pay him off?
Protect the I.P.O.?
I worked my ass off for this day.
He's trying to hijack it.
I'm not gonna be extorted by some piece of shit I've never heard of.
Okay.
On it.
Jessica.
Donna, what can I do for you?
I was just walking by reception, and I thought you might like to know--you know, because it's your firm and-- Donna, get to it.
Charles Van Dyke is in the lobby.
- Right now?
- 30 seconds ago.
You were right to come to me.
Would you like me to send him on his way?
I prefer to take care of Charles van dyke myself.
Excellent.
You can stare at it all you want, Charles, but it's not going to change.
I was just thinking,
"I can't believe you put the mailroom boy's name on the wall." I think what you mean is that you can't believe yours was ever taken off.
I put that behind me years ago.
What are you doing here, Charles?
I suggest we go in your office and talk.
Right here is just fine.
What do you want?
I want a 30% increase in my dividend check.
- Good-bye, Charles.
- I thought you'd say that.
This is formal notice of my demand to audit your books.
You have until Friday to comply.
You gave up this right when we ran you out of town.
I think you're forgetting I retain that right in the event of any material change in my dividend.
Your dividend went up.
Materially.
You think we're hiding profits.
From what I know of you, you're always hiding something.
- I'm gonna make it fast, Jim.
- James.
That's not what your ex-wife calls you.
She calls you Jim.
That's one of the nicer names she uses.
She's been calling you a lot these days.
Wow, you found out I'm divorced.
Well, I'll withdraw the lawsuit.
It's not the divorce, Jimbo, it's the huge wall of mounting debt that's closing in on you since you tanked the tobacco litigation.
I didn't tank it.
I lost.
You didn't just lose.
You had an offer that would have set you up for life.
Instead, you rolled the dice, went to verdict, and now you got nothing.
Which is why your wife left you, and now you're coming after us with a fabricated claim.
I didn't fabricate anything.
I have expert reports here.
You've got one report of possible toxins in the playground material.
And not one sick child.
And you have an I.P.O. on Friday, and if this suit appears in the Journal that morning, what do you think the stock price is gonna be when they ring that bell?
Got me.
Give me your number.
- 100,000 and we're done.
- Done.
We'll draw up the paperwork.
I've got it right here.
But one thing, this precludes you from representing any other plaintiffs with the same action.
You got me.
I have 100 other plaintiffs waiting in the wings.
That's a $10 million hit you just avoided.
I tell you what.
Give me a million, and we're really done.
James, this covers your debts and gets you out from under.
You think that means I'm gonna take less than it's worth?
- It isn't worth anything.
- It is today.
You know where to reach me.
Thought you said you were willing to go as high as 500,000.
Yeah, that was before
I realized what we were dealing with.
This guy doesn't owe money 'cause he got divorced.
He got divorced 'cause he owes money.
- What are you talking about?
- He's a gambler.
How does that help us?
He doesn't know I'm one.
Where's Louis?
- Jessica.
- Where is he?
He's not answering his phone.
He's not answering his emails.
The thing is I don't know if he--
Katrina, your job as gatekeeper does not apply to me, so I'm going to ask you one more time.
Why isn't Louis in the building?
He must still be in court.
Is there something I can do?
What you can do is find Louis and have him come up with a way around this demand to look at our books.
When should I tell him you need it?
Yesterday.
You were right.
Quelling's got a game.
- What night?
- Every night.
Well, I hope you know where tonight's game is because--
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.
You and I are going.
- Um...
- What?
I got a job offer, Harvey.
Supposed to go have drinks to talk about it tonight.
I can move it, it's just, that's... that's why I hesitated.
- When?
- When what?
When'd you get the job offer?
- The other night.
- And you didn't mention it.
I didn't know what I thought.
- And now you do?
- No.
It's--
Who?
Jonathan Sidwell.
The spin-off idea?
- Yeah.
- I should have known.
He wants you to be his general counsel?
No, he wants to make me an investment banker.
Well, if it were me...
I'd take it.
What?
Why?
Because you can compete there like you do here with nothing hanging over your head.
What if I don't want to stop being a lawyer?
Well, then don't take the job.
I mean, what do you want from me?
- I want your advice.
- I just gave you my advice.
No, you told me what you would do.
I want to know what you think I should do.
Mike, last week, you said you'd do anything to stop being a fraud, so my advice is take it.
Still be in the majors, just be a different sport.
Excuse me, do you have a minute?
Look, you and I have never--
No, we haven't.
I need your help.
You must be scraping the bottom of the barrel if you're coming to me.
It's about Louis.
He and Sheila are done.
That's awful.
It's worse than awful.
Jessica needs him on a case right now.
He won't leave his apartment.
He won't even answer his phone.
Then I'll just go over there right now.
That won't work.
Even if it did, we don't have time.
So then why are you here?
Rachel, you don't trust me.
I get that, but Louis asked me to cover for him, and that is what I'm going to do.
You're the best paralegal here, and you're his friend.
So will you help me or not?
I will.
So...
I figured out what you can do to make it up to me tonight.
I thought we were good.
Yeah, I'm just--I'm feeling some residual anger.
Scottie, I'm kind of busy right now, and I have plans tonight.
Taking Mike on another I.P.O. date?
- What difference does it make?
- Hmm.
Sounds mysterious.
Bet you can't tell me what it is.
- I'm playing poker.
- Poker?
Can I come?
It's a work thing.
- You bring Mike to work things.
- Scottie, I told you I'm busy.
You can't come.
Can I get back to work now?
- What got io you?
- Nothing.
Sometimes at the office, I'm working.
Fair enough, boss.
Are you sure that's how you want to play that?
Play what, the fact that I'm busy?
The fact that you just snapped at her when we both know what you're really angry about.
I'm not angry.
I'm annoyed at the interruption.
You're angry that Mike wants to leave, and you just took it out on her.
- I'm not angry about that.
- No, you're hurt, and the anger covers the hurt, but I knew you didn't know that.
I was annoyed about the interruption just like I'm annoyed right now.
Bullshit.
You're feeling exactly what I'm feeling.
The idea of Mike leaving sucks, and the sooner you get your brain around that, the sooner you can maybe do something about it.
Can I get back to work now?
You can get back to work whenever you want.
But if all you're gonna do is stick your head in the sand, then you're not going to have an associate or a girlfriend to get back to work from.
- You give it to her?
- I gave it to her.
She suspect anything?
I wouldn't be standing here if she did.
- And?
- She thought it was awesome.
Well, she should.
Louis didn't just come up with a way to keep Charles Van Dyke out of our books.
Louis came up with a way to blow him out of the water.
That Louis.
He is one hell of an attorney.
- Thank you, Louis.
- Right back at you, Louis.
Don't get used to it.
Don't worry.
I'm not looking to work here again.
Not here, but you are looking to work?
I've always been able to see through your bullshit, Charles.
Which is why I'm offering you these, five cases.
We're co-counsel, split the profits 50/50.
It announces to the world that you are back in business, which is what you really want.
You came to me bearing gifts.
I still have the card.
"To the man who hired me for all you've done."
Two days later, you shoved me out.
I take this to mean you're passing on my offer.
I'm shitting on your offer.
Okay, Charles.
You were right.
Your dividend check did have the wrong amount, but from now on, it's going to have the right amount, zero.
- I don't think so.
- Oh, the firm you had your exit agreement with no longer exists.
We became Pearson Darby, then Pearson Specter, which means you're not entitled to a thing.
That's not in the spirit of our agreement.
And neither is your claim.
There's only one problem.
You should have dug deeper into the fine print.
The entity referred to in our agreement is defined in your bylaws as "any partnership in which the name partner is Jessica Pearson."
You didn't know.
My number just tripled.
Your call.
Our hearing is Friday.
You guys playing cards?
You're out of your league.
This game is for real players.
Why don't I give it a try?
Buyin is 25,000.
- What's the limit?
- There is no limit.
Maybe I am out of my league.
Raise $45,000.
I'm putting you all-in.
I've seen guys like you before.
You think if you bully me with your big stack,
I'm gonna run and hide.
Here's the difference between you and me, Jimbo,
I lose, I pull out another 25 grand, and another 25 after that.
You lose, you've got nothing.
You're bluffing.
Then call or get up and walk away, but I've sat across from you 1,000 times before.
You won't walk.
Tough beat.
Take your winnings.
What winnings?
I thought maybe it was time we do a little negotiating.
Well, you have my offer.
- I have a counter.
- I'm all ears.
I want a 50% increase in base salary.
I want a guaranteed bonus not tied to our investment returns, a four-week vacation, and I want a piece.
- A piece?
- A piece.
- No.
- No piece?
No negotiating.
Look, I know what you're doing.
You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.
But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.
I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass.
- I do kick ass.
- And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.
But you don't.
I don't yet.
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be interviewing other people.
Once I find the right person, job is gone.
I'm not dropping my suit when you're going public in two days.
James, you've read all about Hessington Oil.
The odds were stacked against me.
I won anyway, because I win.
You won because Edward Darby came forward.
You got lucky.
Guys like you always think other people get lucky.
I don't get lucky.
I make my own luck, and in this case, it's bleeding you dry.
Right there.
You just gave me your tell.
You have no other money.
You're done.
There's $100,000 in that pile.
It's the exact amount of the deal we offered you.
Sign it.
We'll fix the paperwork tomorrow.
This is $1,000.
Cash me out.
He doesn't play anymore the rest of the night.
You didn't sleep well.
I didn't sleep at all.
It's a big decision.
You still haven't told me what you think.
Mike, I can't make the decision for you.
I don't want you to make it for me.
I just want to know what you think.
And I already told you that I will support you with whatever you decide.
And the way you can support me right now is by telling me how you feel.
- It's not my place.
- Not your place?
Just admit it.
You want me to take the job, but you're too afraid to say it.
Okay, you want to know the truth?
You already know what you want to do.
And if I try to change your mind and it goes wrong, then I'm afraid you're gonna hold it against me.
Would you just say it?
Yes.
I want you to take the job.
Look, I know that you love what you do, but every day, you go into work with the possibility of being caught, and it is eating away at you.
If you stay there, that's just not gonna change.
- Jessica.
How did--
- It go?
I'll tell you how it went.
I got hung out to dry.
What?
No, it was a good move.
Oh, it would have been if our own bylaws didn't supersede it.
Th--that's impossible.
It was convoluted and buried in the fine print, and something Louis Litt never would have missed.
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.
You're not.
He wouldn't have missed it.
So when you came into my office and told me Louis had come up with that move, you were full of shit.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to help.
Well, that kind of thing only happens once.
You know how I know it's not gonna happen again?
Pack up your shit.
I don't care what kind of deal you have with Harvey.
You're done.
Why wouldn't you tell her?
I said I would cover.
I didn't say I would cover when it suited me.
Yeah, but he wouldn't want you to get fired over this.
I should be fired.
I let Jessica look stupid.
Katrina--
Thank you for your help, Rachel.
I really appreciate it, but if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone.
He's not here.
Where is he?
To tell you the truth, I don't know.
All he said was he had a late night.
Hmm.
Well, I can come back.
- I was just--
- You're taking the job, aren't you?
I don't know.
Yeah, you do.
You just don't want to admit it.
Yeah.
I'm taking the job.
God damn it.
Do you know what that man has done for you?
Do you know what it took for him to start trusting someone?
- Donna--
- Don't interrupt me.
So someone's dangling some money in front of you.
- It's not about that.
- I don't care what it's about.
I'm gonna say what he won't.
He needs you.
You need this job, and if you can't see that, then you might as well just leave right now.
Donna, someone's offering me a way out.
- So you don't care about him.
- Of course I do, but I also care about my life with Rachel.
I don't want to live my life like this anymore.
Then you better be the best goddamn investment banker this city has ever seen.
Scottie, I'm sorry I was angry in your direction, but it was really about something else.
Let me guess, Donna explained your feelings to you, and now you're here to apologize.
Maybe.
What was the something else?
Mike got a job offer.
And you don't want him to do it.
No, I don't.
Well, if you want him to stay, you know what's actually a nice tactic?
Telling him you want him to stay.
What?
Had I known "tell me what's going on with you"
meant "I'm going to tell you what to do,"
I might not have taken you up on it.
Oh, okay.
Mmm.
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay.
You have that paperwork for me?
Well, I got something for you, but it's not that.
Didn't you learn your lesson last night?
I learned to listen.
When you talked, you mentioned Hessington Oil, so I looked back into it.
Turns out you don't create your own luck.
Your associate does.
What the hell are you talking about?
He conspired with Harold Gunderson to file a lawsuit against your own client so you could bribe witnesses not to testify.
We didn't bribe anyone.
- That was a legal settlement.
- Don't try to tell me two rookie associates who went to law school together and started at the same firm made this happen without collusion.
I don't need to tell you anything 'cause there's nothing to tell.
Well, you're gonna have to tell someone something, because that suit was filed one day, settled the next, and those witnesses cancelled their flights to New York.
That is a bribe, and when I bring it to the attention of the bar, you and your associate are going to be in deep shit.
Now who showed his tell?
Here's your money back.
And either I go to the bar, or you settle for $2 million.
You have until tomorrow.
Where's Mike?
He's in there.
Harvey--
- Harvey.
- Not now.
You need to call Lola Jensen.
What?
You need to get her to hack into the bar and put your name in.
What the hell are you talking about?
A week ago, you told me that the number one rule was not to move the goddamn body.
A week ago, people weren't sniffing around you.
- Harvey, my job offer is not--
- This isn't about your offer.
Quelling knows about your bullshit lawsuit with Harold Gunderson.
He turned me in?
No, but he will if we don't cave.
- He can't prove anything.
- He doesn't have to.
He hands you in to the bar, they look you up, we're done.
Not if I'm not here.
Oh, that's why you're in here.
You're taking the job.
I am.
And you think an addicted gambler who lost his wife, his child, and his house is gonna stop coming for you just because you're not working here?
You said it yourself.
Hacking into the bar is twice the crime I've been committing.
I am telling you Quelling is on the trail.
You don't do this, we're gonna get caught.
- There's got to be another way.
- There isn't.
- I don't believe that.
- Then you better figure something out fast, because tomorrow morning, we're done, and you quitting isn't gonna change that.
You can't fire Katrina Bennett.
I can fire whoever I want to.
She was covering for Louis.
What are you talking about?
Louis's engagement is over, and he's losing it.
He won't come in to work, he won't pick up his phone, and he just didn't want anyone to know.
Then why are you telling me?
Because I helped her cover for him.
Are you saying I should fire you too?
I am saying that...
We made a mistake, but that we were just looking out for Louis, and I know how much you value loyalty, so I don't think that should be the thing that costs Katrina her job... or mine.
- Jessica.
- I need you.
No, listen, I just need a little more time.
And had you asked me for it, I would have said yes, but instead, you had Katrina cover for you.
Oh, that little traitor.
What, did she rat me out?
No, she didn't.
She's so loyal to you that she tried to pass off her work for yours.
Louis, Van Dyke wants to look at our books.
What?
We can't have that.
I know.
This was her fix.
Oh, no, and you used this on him?
I did, and then I fired Katrina.
- Jessica.
- I know.
I can't fire her for being loyal.
But I can't afford you sitting here licking your wounds while I get my ass handed to me.
Please, just listen to me, okay?
I cannot see straight.
I cannot think straight, and even if I wanted to come and help you, I wouldn't be any good to you, so...
Louis...
I know you loved Sheila, but do you love your firm?
You know I do.
And when you love a woman, can you stand the thought of her being with another man?
- No.
- Well, Louis,
Van Dyke is trying to get into Pearson Specter's pants.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm gonna put on a goddamn chastity belt.
How?
'Cause Katrina actually was on the right track.
Van Dyke's claim is gone if the partnership is gone.
The bylaws say it's not.
No, it is if we become an L.L.C.
We can't do that by tomorrow.
We'd have to rewrite every contract.
Boy, wow, Jessica, you sometimes really surprise me.
You don't think I know that?
I have an army of associates that I've trained within an inch of their lives.
My name is Louis goddamn Marlowe Litt, and my firm is under siege, so don't you tell me what I can and cannot do!
- Hey.
- Hey.
I don't want to interrupt, but I was just wondering what happened with Mike.
He's leaving.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
Can I ask you something?
Did you tell him that you wanted him to stay?
I didn't get around to it.
You--you didn't get around to it?
I was gonna tell him, and then he told me he was leaving, and then other shit came up, so...
So you just dropped it?
I told you other shit came up.
What other shit?
I mean, you had an emergency case filing, so you let your protege walk out the door?
- It's complicated.
- Okay.
Well...then share it with me.
Quelling came after us.
The Hessington witnesses.
What?
That's bullshit.
You may have blurred some lines, but you certainly didn't cross any.
Fight him.
- No, I can't.
- Why?
Look, I don't want to talk about it.
What is going on here?
When somebody pisses you off, you get in the ring.
What are you saying?
What I'm saying is that you're not taking on Quelling, but you're letting Mike walk out the door without trying to stop him.
I think one thing changed the other, and I want to know why.
Maybe what changed is his desire to be here, and maybe what I have to say doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.
Now, what is this really about?
Because it's sure as hell not about some stupid case.
You know what?
God damn it!
For once, can't it just be about what I said it's about?
You didn't say what it was about.
Harvey, I'm really sorry that the Mike thing turned out this way.
I am, but I can't say that I didn't see it coming.
- Scottie, it isn't--
- What?
It isn't what?
It isn't what it seems?
Because I don't know what it seems.
All I know is that any time I ask you about anything, all you say is, "I can't talk about it."
I'm just gonna stop asking.
Then we'll just make up later, and we can do it all over again tomorrow.
Quelling can't hurt us anymore.
- You went to see Lola.
- I looked at his accounts.
I wanted to find out where all that money came from to find all those clients.
He doesn't have the money.
And yet his rent gets paid, and they don't turn off his electricity.
Holy shit.
Guess you didn't have to see Lola after all.
You think I got access to that with a court order?
So you did go see her?
You put the idea in my head.
I just came up with a different agenda.
We got him.
No.
You got him.
What?
Your going-away present.
Be a lawyer one last time.
Knock this guy out.
You have my settlement check.
I don't have a dime for you.
Then I guess the bar is going to be hearing from me first thing in the morning.
Well, then, they'll also be hearing from me.
Disciplinary rule 5-107a, "accepting compensation--"
- I know what it says.
- Then you also know the penalty is being disbarred.
You took money from our client's competitors to trump up your bullshit suit.
You didn't come by that legally.
And they're not gonna care.
I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't have a hell of a lot to lose, so sign my deal or get the hell out of my office.
Well, here's the thing, James.
I don't either...
Because today is my last day as a lawyer anyway.
- Bullshit.
- Look at me.
Good luck in front of the bar.
I wasn't always like this.
I had tobacco in my sights.
They offered me a lot of money.
I could have made a fortune.
But $15,000 per client for people with cancer?
I risked going to verdict because I wanted to get those people something that could make a difference!
And I lost everything...
My clients, my wife, my kids!
You lost them because you gambled them away, James.
I know that.
Please.
Being a lawyer is what I am.
It's who I am.
And if you take that away...
It's up to you, James.
I'll drop the suit.
I promise.
Louis, where the hell are you?
You said you could get it done.
I walk through those doors, our books fly open.
Get here now.
Well, this should be fun.
We've never been across the aisle from each other.
Which is why you don't realize that it won't be fun.
We'll see what we see.
Case 41432, Van Dyke versus Pearson.
Look at that.
Game time.
Ladies first.
Ladies first.
Son of a bitch.
For being polite?
Were you being polite when you hired me?
What does one have to do with the other?
"To the man who hired me, for all you've done."
Do you want to know what I meant when I wrote that card?
The day you made me that offer, I asked you,
"did it have anything to do with gender or race?"
You swore it didn't.
You lied to me.
- It didn't.
- You're lying now.
You know, Daniel Hardman may have used people, but he didn't give a shit about their gender or their color.
- He showed you the list.
- Right next to my name, an asterisk.
Not "Law Review."
Not second in my class.
Diversity.
- You were treated the same.
- You tell yourself that, but we both know the truth, which is why I sleep at night just fine.
Well, it doesn't change the facts in this case, does it?
No.
No, it doesn't, but this will.
Charles, you remember Louis Litt?
Sorry, I couldn't run.
Doctor wanted me to take it easy.
Hey, Charles.
Great to see you.
You told me that story to stall.
- That was a stall...
- Hmm.
But this is for me.
When I saw that asterisk next to my name, it made me sick to my stomach, because in one second,
I understood how you will always see me.
So that card was a thank you, because if I hadn't have felt sick, then I might not have worked as hard as I did to get where I am today.
You woke the dragon, Charles.
How do you like me now?
I know you're there.
You need anything?
No.
The I.P.O. is wrapped up.
We go public Monday morning.
I wasn't talking about the I.P.O.
I was talking about how you're feeling about Mike.
I know.
Okay.
Good night, Harvey.
I'm gonna tell Scottie.
About Mike?
Are you crazy?
You can't have it both ways, Donna.
You can't tell me to open up and then keep my secrets.
You spent more than a year covering it up.
You tried to get him to commit another crime to cover it up, and now-- You said I should tell her what's really bothering me!
I meant your feelings.
I didn't mean confess to a felony.
These are my goddamn feelings!
Donna, I did something when I hired him.
It's caused all of this.
I can't tell her, and it's driving me crazy!
Okay.
Look, Mike is gone, Harvey.
I hate that he's gone, but the jeopardy's gone too.
It's done.
And now you want to turn around and tell someone who--
Someone who what?
Nothing.
No, you better finish that sentence.
Someone who's pissed at you, Harvey.
Someone who keeps finding a reason to be pissed at you, and it's not the third time, and it's not the fifth time, and it's not the last time.
I thought you were trying to help my relationship, not shit on it.
Okay, you want to yell at me?
Fine.
Because I know you're not mad at me.
And I know you're only telling me this stupid idea because you want me to tell you what you already know.
You can't, Harvey.
It's good that you want to, but you can't.
Could I have a minute?
Congratulate me.
I'm officially a member of the New York bar.
You went to Lola?
I made a mistake.
I want to stay.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Sheila Amanda Sazs, will you marry me?
Yes, I will marry you.
- I want to go legit.
- You can't.
Then I get Lola Jensen to hack into the bar and just put me in there, just like she did with Harvard.
Rule number one of not getting caught, you don't move the goddamn body.
Harvey, I'm stuck.
I can't live my whole life like this.
You want me to set up your new corporation?
I want you to join my new corporation.
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.
Our job blows yours out of the water.
Scottie, I need you to give Louis his transaction back.
Does this have something to do with that favor he did you?
- Yes.
- Tell me what it is.
- I can't.
- Guess we're not sharing everything with each other after all.
- Scottie.
- You can't have it both ways, Harvey.
- Louis, I don't want kids.
- What are you talking about?
I don't like kids.
I was willing to give up Harvard for you.
You can't give up something for me?
I understand.
Can I just say something please?
I know you keep saying that I won't feel this way forever, but why is it when the guys shows up with chicken vindaloo 40 minutes late with no naan and no silverware, instead of throwing the chutney in his face,
I'm thanking him and I am tipping him $20?
Do you want to tell me why that happens?
I don't care.
I hate myself.
I hate my life.
The woman I love is gone, my heart is broken, and I really-- to be honest with you,
I just don't have the will to live.
Hold on.
It's my associate.
Katrina.
Louis, it's 7:55.
Yeah.
I have an 8:00 a.m.
Please cover it for me.
In fact, cover everything, and unless the building is on fire and Sheila's in it,
I'm not coming in.
Louis, what happened?
You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
My heart's been shattered into a thousand million pieces, and if I can't put my heart into my work, then I'm not gonna do any work at all, so...
How long do you think you'll be out?
I don't know.
Today, tomorrow, the rest of the year.
You know, just don't call here again because I'm not gonna answer the number.
Doc?
Dr. Lipschitz?
Hello?
What, are you shitting me?
That was not 50 minutes.
Waiting outside for me?
Bold gesture.
I called you three times.
I had to do something.
- You must be feeling bad.
- I am.
What for?
You're just doing your job.
Scottie, I'm sorry.
What happened with Louis, I didn't like doing it.
- Yeah, but you still did it.
- And what I'm doing now is asking you to let it go.
Harvey, it's not that you picked Louis over me.
It's that you wouldn't tell me why.
I couldn't tell you why.
There's a difference.
And I'm asking you to trust me.
Okay.
I can let it go, but keeping things from me just can't keep happening, okay?
I can't tell you whether or not that's okay, and I definitely can't tell you why.
Too soon?
What are you going to do to make it up to me?
Nothing right now.
I'm taking Mike to the marathon footwear brunch.
You're taking a date to an I.P.O. event?
That's so cute.
It's not a date.
He's never gonna put out.
Well, it's too bad that you're not taking me because I was thinking of letting you...
Mr. Specter.
James Quelling.
I'm in a bit of a hurry, Mr. quelling.
- I want to do you a favor.
- I don't need any favors.
Yeah, you do, unless you want Friday's headline to read,
"Marathon Footwear builds playgrounds that kill children."
My client builds playgrounds that help children.
And uses a synthetic full of toxins to do it.
Look, I don't know who you are, but I know what you're trying to do, and it isn't gonna work.
Look, I'm a reasonable man.
This is a huge moment for your client.
I won't file this before Friday.
You think I'm gonna let you extort my client?
No, I think you're gonna protect your client from a claim that could ruin them.
In fact, I'm counting on it.
Nice offices.
Enjoy that brunch.
- I got a job offer.
- Holy shit.
From who?
Last night.
Jonathan Sidwell.
But I thought Louis was his lawyer.
He doesn't want me to be his lawyer.
He wants me to be a partner.
- Investment banking?
- Yeah.
- And?
- I don't know.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
What do you think?
I think that I love you, and what you want to do is what I want you to do.
I don't know what to do.
Okay.
Did you talk to Harvey?
If I do that, all he'll hear is, "Hey, Harvey,
"thanks for doing everything for me.
I'm thinking about quitting." Well...
No, but you said that you don't think of him as just your boss.
You consider him a friend.
- So?
- So if he can't have an honest conversation with your best interests in mind, he's not your friend, and-- and he shouldn't be your boss.

I have to talk to you about something.
Well, unless its value is in excess of $575 million, it can wait.
Yeah.
Yeah, it can wait.
Good because our I.P.O. is in jeopardy unless we can deal with this.
Endangering children?
Wait, these things just opened.
This is a bullshit claim.
Maybe, but a bullshit claim on the right day is better than a great claim on a bullshit day.
Did you come up with that all by yourself?
My grandmother taught it to me.
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to find everything there is to know about this quelling guy.
Harvey, why don't you just pay him off?
Protect the I.P.O.?
I worked my ass off for this day.
He's trying to hijack it.
I'm not gonna be extorted by some piece of shit I've never heard of.
Okay.
On it.
Jessica.
Donna, what can I do for you?
I was just walking by reception, and I thought you might like to know--you know, because it's your firm and-- Donna, get to it.
Charles Van Dyke is in the lobby.
- Right now?
- 30 seconds ago.
You were right to come to me.
Would you like me to send him on his way?
I prefer to take care of Charles van dyke myself.
Excellent.
You can stare at it all you want, Charles, but it's not going to change.
I was just thinking,
"I can't believe you put the mailroom boy's name on the wall." I think what you mean is that you can't believe yours was ever taken off.
I put that behind me years ago.
What are you doing here, Charles?
I suggest we go in your office and talk.
Right here is just fine.
What do you want?
I want a 30% increase in my dividend check.
- Good-bye, Charles.
- I thought you'd say that.
This is formal notice of my demand to audit your books.
You have until Friday to comply.
You gave up this right when we ran you out of town.
I think you're forgetting I retain that right in the event of any material change in my dividend.
Your dividend went up.
Materially.
You think we're hiding profits.
From what I know of you, you're always hiding something.
- I'm gonna make it fast, Jim.
- James.
That's not what your ex-wife calls you.
She calls you Jim.
That's one of the nicer names she uses.
She's been calling you a lot these days.
Wow, you found out I'm divorced.
Well, I'll withdraw the lawsuit.
It's not the divorce, Jimbo, it's the huge wall of mounting debt that's closing in on you since you tanked the tobacco litigation.
I didn't tank it.
I lost.
You didn't just lose.
You had an offer that would have set you up for life.
Instead, you rolled the dice, went to verdict, and now you got nothing.
Which is why your wife left you, and now you're coming after us with a fabricated claim.
I didn't fabricate anything.
I have expert reports here.
You've got one report of possible toxins in the playground material.
And not one sick child.
And you have an I.P.O. on Friday, and if this suit appears in the Journal that morning, what do you think the stock price is gonna be when they ring that bell?
Got me.
Give me your number.
- 100,000 and we're done.
- Done.
We'll draw up the paperwork.
I've got it right here.
But one thing, this precludes you from representing any other plaintiffs with the same action.
You got me.
I have 100 other plaintiffs waiting in the wings.
That's a $10 million hit you just avoided.
I tell you what.
Give me a million, and we're really done.
James, this covers your debts and gets you out from under.
You think that means I'm gonna take less than it's worth?
- It isn't worth anything.
- It is today.
You know where to reach me.
Thought you said you were willing to go as high as 500,000.
Yeah, that was before
I realized what we were dealing with.
This guy doesn't owe money 'cause he got divorced.
He got divorced 'cause he owes money.
- What are you talking about?
- He's a gambler.
How does that help us?
He doesn't know I'm one.
Where's Louis?
- Jessica.
- Where is he?
He's not answering his phone.
He's not answering his emails.
The thing is I don't know if he--
Katrina, your job as gatekeeper does not apply to me, so I'm going to ask you one more time.
Why isn't Louis in the building?
He must still be in court.
Is there something I can do?
What you can do is find Louis and have him come up with a way around this demand to look at our books.
When should I tell him you need it?
Yesterday.
You were right.
Quelling's got a game.
- What night?
- Every night.
Well, I hope you know where tonight's game is because--
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.
You and I are going.
- Um...
- What?
I got a job offer, Harvey.
Supposed to go have drinks to talk about it tonight.
I can move it, it's just, that's... that's why I hesitated.
- When?
- When what?
When'd you get the job offer?
- The other night.
- And you didn't mention it.
I didn't know what I thought.
- And now you do?
- No.
It's--
Who?
Jonathan Sidwell.
The spin-off idea?
- Yeah.
- I should have known.
He wants you to be his general counsel?
No, he wants to make me an investment banker.
Well, if it were me...
I'd take it.
What?
Why?
Because you can compete there like you do here with nothing hanging over your head.
What if I don't want to stop being a lawyer?
Well, then don't take the job.
I mean, what do you want from me?
- I want your advice.
- I just gave you my advice.
No, you told me what you would do.
I want to know what you think I should do.
Mike, last week, you said you'd do anything to stop being a fraud, so my advice is take it.
Still be in the majors, just be a different sport.
Excuse me, do you have a minute?
Look, you and I have never--
No, we haven't.
I need your help.
You must be scraping the bottom of the barrel if you're coming to me.
It's about Louis.
He and Sheila are done.
That's awful.
It's worse than awful.
Jessica needs him on a case right now.
He won't leave his apartment.
He won't even answer his phone.
Then I'll just go over there right now.
That won't work.
Even if it did, we don't have time.
So then why are you here?
Rachel, you don't trust me.
I get that, but Louis asked me to cover for him, and that is what I'm going to do.
You're the best paralegal here, and you're his friend.
So will you help me or not?
I will.
So...
I figured out what you can do to make it up to me tonight.
I thought we were good.
Yeah, I'm just--I'm feeling some residual anger.
Scottie, I'm kind of busy right now, and I have plans tonight.
Taking Mike on another I.P.O. date?
- What difference does it make?
- Hmm.
Sounds mysterious.
Bet you can't tell me what it is.
- I'm playing poker.
- Poker?
Can I come?
It's a work thing.
- You bring Mike to work things.
- Scottie, I told you I'm busy.
You can't come.
Can I get back to work now?
- What got io you?
- Nothing.
Sometimes at the office, I'm working.
Fair enough, boss.
Are you sure that's how you want to play that?
Play what, the fact that I'm busy?
The fact that you just snapped at her when we both know what you're really angry about.
I'm not angry.
I'm annoyed at the interruption.
You're angry that Mike wants to leave, and you just took it out on her.
- I'm not angry about that.
- No, you're hurt, and the anger covers the hurt, but I knew you didn't know that.
I was annoyed about the interruption just like I'm annoyed right now.
Bullshit.
You're feeling exactly what I'm feeling.
The idea of Mike leaving sucks, and the sooner you get your brain around that, the sooner you can maybe do something about it.
Can I get back to work now?
You can get back to work whenever you want.
But if all you're gonna do is stick your head in the sand, then you're not going to have an associate or a girlfriend to get back to work from.
- You give it to her?
- I gave it to her.
She suspect anything?
I wouldn't be standing here if she did.
- And?
- She thought it was awesome.
Well, she should.
Louis didn't just come up with a way to keep Charles Van Dyke out of our books.
Louis came up with a way to blow him out of the water.
That Louis.
He is one hell of an attorney.
- Thank you, Louis.
- Right back at you, Louis.
Don't get used to it.
Don't worry.
I'm not looking to work here again.
Not here, but you are looking to work?
I've always been able to see through your bullshit, Charles.
Which is why I'm offering you these, five cases.
We're co-counsel, split the profits 50/50.
It announces to the world that you are back in business, which is what you really want.
You came to me bearing gifts.
I still have the card.
"To the man who hired me for all you've done."
Two days later, you shoved me out.
I take this to mean you're passing on my offer.
I'm shitting on your offer.
Okay, Charles.
You were right.
Your dividend check did have the wrong amount, but from now on, it's going to have the right amount, zero.
- I don't think so.
- Oh, the firm you had your exit agreement with no longer exists.
We became Pearson Darby, then Pearson Specter, which means you're not entitled to a thing.
That's not in the spirit of our agreement.
And neither is your claim.
There's only one problem.
You should have dug deeper into the fine print.
The entity referred to in our agreement is defined in your bylaws as "any partnership in which the name partner is Jessica Pearson."
You didn't know.
My number just tripled.
Your call.
Our hearing is Friday.
You guys playing cards?
You're out of your league.
This game is for real players.
Why don't I give it a try?
Buyin is 25,000.
- What's the limit?
- There is no limit.
Maybe I am out of my league.
Raise $45,000.
I'm putting you all-in.
I've seen guys like you before.
You think if you bully me with your big stack,
I'm gonna run and hide.
Here's the difference between you and me, Jimbo,
I lose, I pull out another 25 grand, and another 25 after that.
You lose, you've got nothing.
You're bluffing.
Then call or get up and walk away, but I've sat across from you 1,000 times before.
You won't walk.
Tough beat.
Take your winnings.
What winnings?
I thought maybe it was time we do a little negotiating.
Well, you have my offer.
- I have a counter.
- I'm all ears.
I want a 50% increase in base salary.
I want a guaranteed bonus not tied to our investment returns, a four-week vacation, and I want a piece.
- A piece?
- A piece.
- No.
- No piece?
No negotiating.
Look, I know what you're doing.
You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.
But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.
I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass.
- I do kick ass.
- And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.
But you don't.
I don't yet.
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be interviewing other people.
Once I find the right person, job is gone.
I'm not dropping my suit when you're going public in two days.
James, you've read all about Hessington Oil.
The odds were stacked against me.
I won anyway, because I win.
You won because Edward Darby came forward.
You got lucky.
Guys like you always think other people get lucky.
I don't get lucky.
I make my own luck, and in this case, it's bleeding you dry.
Right there.
You just gave me your tell.
You have no other money.
You're done.
There's $100,000 in that pile.
It's the exact amount of the deal we offered you.
Sign it.
We'll fix the paperwork tomorrow.
This is $1,000.
Cash me out.
He doesn't play anymore the rest of the night.
You didn't sleep well.
I didn't sleep at all.
It's a big decision.
You still haven't told me what you think.
Mike, I can't make the decision for you.
I don't want you to make it for me.
I just want to know what you think.
And I already told you that I will support you with whatever you decide.
And the way you can support me right now is by telling me how you feel.
- It's not my place.
- Not your place?
Just admit it.
You want me to take the job, but you're too afraid to say it.
Okay, you want to know the truth?
You already know what you want to do.
And if I try to change your mind and it goes wrong, then I'm afraid you're gonna hold it against me.
Would you just say it?
Yes.
I want you to take the job.
Look, I know that you love what you do, but every day, you go into work with the possibility of being caught, and it is eating away at you.
If you stay there, that's just not gonna change.
- Jessica.
How did--
- It go?
I'll tell you how it went.
I got hung out to dry.
What?
No, it was a good move.
Oh, it would have been if our own bylaws didn't supersede it.
Th--that's impossible.
It was convoluted and buried in the fine print, and something Louis Litt never would have missed.
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.
You're not.
He wouldn't have missed it.
So when you came into my office and told me Louis had come up with that move, you were full of shit.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to help.
Well, that kind of thing only happens once.
You know how I know it's not gonna happen again?
Pack up your shit.
I don't care what kind of deal you have with Harvey.
You're done.
Why wouldn't you tell her?
I said I would cover.
I didn't say I would cover when it suited me.
Yeah, but he wouldn't want you to get fired over this.
I should be fired.
I let Jessica look stupid.
Katrina--
Thank you for your help, Rachel.
I really appreciate it, but if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone.
He's not here.
Where is he?
To tell you the truth, I don't know.
All he said was he had a late night.
Hmm.
Well, I can come back.
- I was just--
- You're taking the job, aren't you?
I don't know.
Yeah, you do.
You just don't want to admit it.
Yeah.
I'm taking the job.
God damn it.
Do you know what that man has done for you?
Do you know what it took for him to start trusting someone?
- Donna--
- Don't interrupt me.
So someone's dangling some money in front of you.
- It's not about that.
- I don't care what it's about.
I'm gonna say what he won't.
He needs you.
You need this job, and if you can't see that, then you might as well just leave right now.
Donna, someone's offering me a way out.
- So you don't care about him.
- Of course I do, but I also care about my life with Rachel.
I don't want to live my life like this anymore.
Then you better be the best goddamn investment banker this city has ever seen.
Scottie, I'm sorry I was angry in your direction, but it was really about something else.
Let me guess, Donna explained your feelings to you, and now you're here to apologize.
Maybe.
What was the something else?
Mike got a job offer.
And you don't want him to do it.
No, I don't.
Well, if you want him to stay, you know what's actually a nice tactic?
Telling him you want him to stay.
What?
Had I known "tell me what's going on with you"
meant "I'm going to tell you what to do,"
I might not have taken you up on it.
Oh, okay.
Mmm.
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay.
You have that paperwork for me?
Well, I got something for you, but it's not that.
Didn't you learn your lesson last night?
I learned to listen.
When you talked, you mentioned Hessington Oil, so I looked back into it.
Turns out you don't create your own luck.
Your associate does.
What the hell are you talking about?
He conspired with Harold Gunderson to file a lawsuit against your own client so you could bribe witnesses not to testify.
We didn't bribe anyone.
- That was a legal settlement.
- Don't try to tell me two rookie associates who went to law school together and started at the same firm made this happen without collusion.
I don't need to tell you anything 'cause there's nothing to tell.
Well, you're gonna have to tell someone something, because that suit was filed one day, settled the next, and those witnesses cancelled their flights to New York.
That is a bribe, and when I bring it to the attention of the bar, you and your associate are going to be in deep shit.
Now who showed his tell?
Here's your money back.
And either I go to the bar, or you settle for $2 million.
You have until tomorrow.
Where's Mike?
He's in there.
Harvey--
- Harvey.
- Not now.
You need to call Lola Jensen.
What?
You need to get her to hack into the bar and put your name in.
What the hell are you talking about?
A week ago, you told me that the number one rule was not to move the goddamn body.
A week ago, people weren't sniffing around you.
- Harvey, my job offer is not--
- This isn't about your offer.
Quelling knows about your bullshit lawsuit with Harold Gunderson.
He turned me in?
No, but he will if we don't cave.
- He can't prove anything.
- He doesn't have to.
He hands you in to the bar, they look you up, we're done.
Not if I'm not here.
Oh, that's why you're in here.
You're taking the job.
I am.
And you think an addicted gambler who lost his wife, his child, and his house is gonna stop coming for you just because you're not working here?
You said it yourself.
Hacking into the bar is twice the crime I've been committing.
I am telling you Quelling is on the trail.
You don't do this, we're gonna get caught.
- There's got to be another way.
- There isn't.
- I don't believe that.
- Then you better figure something out fast, because tomorrow morning, we're done, and you quitting isn't gonna change that.
You can't fire Katrina Bennett.
I can fire whoever I want to.
She was covering for Louis.
What are you talking about?
Louis's engagement is over, and he's losing it.
He won't come in to work, he won't pick up his phone, and he just didn't want anyone to know.
Then why are you telling me?
Because I helped her cover for him.
Are you saying I should fire you too?
I am saying that...
We made a mistake, but that we were just looking out for Louis, and I know how much you value loyalty, so I don't think that should be the thing that costs Katrina her job... or mine.
- Jessica.
- I need you.
No, listen, I just need a little more time.
And had you asked me for it, I would have said yes, but instead, you had Katrina cover for you.
Oh, that little traitor.
What, did she rat me out?
No, she didn't.
She's so loyal to you that she tried to pass off her work for yours.
Louis, Van Dyke wants to look at our books.
What?
We can't have that.
I know.
This was her fix.
Oh, no, and you used this on him?
I did, and then I fired Katrina.
- Jessica.
- I know.
I can't fire her for being loyal.
But I can't afford you sitting here licking your wounds while I get my ass handed to me.
Please, just listen to me, okay?
I cannot see straight.
I cannot think straight, and even if I wanted to come and help you, I wouldn't be any good to you, so...
Louis...
I know you loved Sheila, but do you love your firm?
You know I do.
And when you love a woman, can you stand the thought of her being with another man?
- No.
- Well, Louis,
Van Dyke is trying to get into Pearson Specter's pants.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm gonna put on a goddamn chastity belt.
How?
'Cause Katrina actually was on the right track.
Van Dyke's claim is gone if the partnership is gone.
The bylaws say it's not.
No, it is if we become an L.L.C.
We can't do that by tomorrow.
We'd have to rewrite every contract.
Boy, wow, Jessica, you sometimes really surprise me.
You don't think I know that?
I have an army of associates that I've trained within an inch of their lives.
My name is Louis goddamn Marlowe Litt, and my firm is under siege, so don't you tell me what I can and cannot do!
- Hey.
- Hey.
I don't want to interrupt, but I was just wondering what happened with Mike.
He's leaving.
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
Can I ask you something?
Did you tell him that you wanted him to stay?
I didn't get around to it.
You--you didn't get around to it?
I was gonna tell him, and then he told me he was leaving, and then other shit came up, so...
So you just dropped it?
I told you other shit came up.
What other shit?
I mean, you had an emergency case filing, so you let your protege walk out the door?
- It's complicated.
- Okay.
Well...then share it with me.
Quelling came after us.
The Hessington witnesses.
What?
That's bullshit.
You may have blurred some lines, but you certainly didn't cross any.
Fight him.
- No, I can't.
- Why?
Look, I don't want to talk about it.
What is going on here?
When somebody pisses you off, you get in the ring.
What are you saying?
What I'm saying is that you're not taking on Quelling, but you're letting Mike walk out the door without trying to stop him.
I think one thing changed the other, and I want to know why.
Maybe what changed is his desire to be here, and maybe what I have to say doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.
Now, what is this really about?
Because it's sure as hell not about some stupid case.
You know what?
God damn it!
For once, can't it just be about what I said it's about?
You didn't say what it was about.
Harvey, I'm really sorry that the Mike thing turned out this way.
I am, but I can't say that I didn't see it coming.
- Scottie, it isn't--
- What?
It isn't what?
It isn't what it seems?
Because I don't know what it seems.
All I know is that any time I ask you about anything, all you say is, "I can't talk about it."
I'm just gonna stop asking.
Then we'll just make up later, and we can do it all over again tomorrow.
Quelling can't hurt us anymore.
- You went to see Lola.
- I looked at his accounts.
I wanted to find out where all that money came from to find all those clients.
He doesn't have the money.
And yet his rent gets paid, and they don't turn off his electricity.
Holy shit.
Guess you didn't have to see Lola after all.
You think I got access to that with a court order?
So you did go see her?
You put the idea in my head.
I just came up with a different agenda.
We got him.
No.
You got him.
What?
Your going-away present.
Be a lawyer one last time.
Knock this guy out.
You have my settlement check.
I don't have a dime for you.
Then I guess the bar is going to be hearing from me first thing in the morning.
Well, then, they'll also be hearing from me.
Disciplinary rule 5-107a, "accepting compensation--"
- I know what it says.
- Then you also know the penalty is being disbarred.
You took money from our client's competitors to trump up your bullshit suit.
You didn't come by that legally.
And they're not gonna care.
I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't have a hell of a lot to lose, so sign my deal or get the hell out of my office.
Well, here's the thing, James.
I don't either...
Because today is my last day as a lawyer anyway.
- Bullshit.
- Look at me.
Good luck in front of the bar.
I wasn't always like this.
I had tobacco in my sights.
They offered me a lot of money.
I could have made a fortune.
But $15,000 per client for people with cancer?
I risked going to verdict because I wanted to get those people something that could make a difference!
And I lost everything...
My clients, my wife, my kids!
You lost them because you gambled them away, James.
I know that.
Please.
Being a lawyer is what I am.
It's who I am.
And if you take that away...
It's up to you, James.
I'll drop the suit.
I promise.
Louis, where the hell are you?
You said you could get it done.
I walk through those doors, our books fly open.
Get here now.
Well, this should be fun.
We've never been across the aisle from each other.
Which is why you don't realize that it won't be fun.
We'll see what we see.
Case 41432, Van Dyke versus Pearson.
Look at that.
Game time.
Ladies first.
Ladies first.
Son of a bitch.
For being polite?
Were you being polite when you hired me?
What does one have to do with the other?
"To the man who hired me, for all you've done."
Do you want to know what I meant when I wrote that card?
The day you made me that offer, I asked you,
"did it have anything to do with gender or race?"
You swore it didn't.
You lied to me.
- It didn't.
- You're lying now.
You know, Daniel Hardman may have used people, but he didn't give a shit about their gender or their color.
- He showed you the list.
- Right next to my name, an asterisk.
Not "Law Review."
Not second in my class.
Diversity.
- You were treated the same.
- You tell yourself that, but we both know the truth, which is why I sleep at night just fine.
Well, it doesn't change the facts in this case, does it?
No.
No, it doesn't, but this will.
Charles, you remember Louis Litt?
Sorry, I couldn't run.
Doctor wanted me to take it easy.
Hey, Charles.
Great to see you.
You told me that story to stall.
- That was a stall...
- Hmm.
But this is for me.
When I saw that asterisk next to my name, it made me sick to my stomach, because in one second,
I understood how you will always see me.
So that card was a thank you, because if I hadn't have felt sick, then I might not have worked as hard as I did to get where I am today.
You woke the dragon, Charles.
How do you like me now?
I know you're there.
You need anything?
No.
The I.P.O. is wrapped up.
We go public Monday morning.
I wasn't talking about the I.P.O.
I was talking about how you're feeling about Mike.
I know.
Okay.
Good night, Harvey.
I'm gonna tell Scottie.
About Mike?
Are you crazy?
You can't have it both ways, Donna.
You can't tell me to open up and then keep my secrets.
You spent more than a year covering it up.
You tried to get him to commit another crime to cover it up, and now-- You said I should tell her what's really bothering me!
I meant your feelings.
I didn't mean confess to a felony.
These are my goddamn feelings!
Donna, I did something when I hired him.
It's caused all of this.
I can't tell her, and it's driving me crazy!
Okay.
Look, Mike is gone, Harvey.
I hate that he's gone, but the jeopardy's gone too.
It's done.
And now you want to turn around and tell someone who--
Someone who what?
Nothing.
No, you better finish that sentence.
Someone who's pissed at you, Harvey.
Someone who keeps finding a reason to be pissed at you, and it's not the third time, and it's not the fifth time, and it's not the last time.
I thought you were trying to help my relationship, not shit on it.
Okay, you want to yell at me?
Fine.
Because I know you're not mad at me.
And I know you're only telling me this stupid idea because you want me to tell you what you already know.
You can't, Harvey.
It's good that you want to, but you can't.
Could I have a minute?
Congratulate me.
I'm officially a member of the New York bar.
You went to Lola?
I made a mistake.
I want to stay.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Sheila Amanda Sazs, will you marry me?
Yes, I will marry you.
- I want to go legit.
- You can't.
Then I get Lola Jensen to hack into the bar and just put me in there, just like she did with Harvard.
Rule number one of not getting caught, you don't move the goddamn body.
Harvey, I'm stuck.
I can't live my whole life like this.
You want me to set up your new corporation?
I want you to join my new corporation.
We're not lawyers.
We're investment bankers.
Our job blows yours out of the water.
Scottie, I need you to give Louis his transaction back.
Does this have something to do with that favor he did you?
- Yes.
- Tell me what it is.
- I can't.
- Guess we're not sharing everything with each other after all.
- Scottie.
- You can't have it both ways, Harvey.
- Louis, I don't want kids.
- What are you talking about?
I don't like kids.
I was willing to give up Harvard for you.
You can't give up something for me?
I understand.
Can I just say something please?
I know you keep saying that I won't feel this way forever, but why is it when the guys shows up with chicken vindaloo 40 minutes late with no naan and no silverware, instead of throwing the chutney in his face,
I'm thanking him and I am tipping him $20?
Do you want to tell me why that happens?
I don't care.
I hate myself.
I hate my life.
The woman I love is gone, my heart is broken, and I really-- to be honest with you,
I just don't have the will to live.
[Beeps]
Hold on.
It's my associate.
Katrina.
Louis, it's 7:55.
Yeah.
I have an 8:00 a.m.
Please cover it for me.
In fact, cover everything, and unless the building is on fire and Sheila's in it,
I'm not coming in.
Louis, what happened?
You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
My heart's been shattered into a thousand million pieces, and if I can't put my heart into my work, then I'm not gonna do any work at all, so...
How long do you think you'll be out?
I don't know.
Today, tomorrow, the rest of the year.
You know, just don't call here again because I'm not gonna answer the number.
Doc?
Dr. Lipschitz?
Hello?
What, are you shitting me?
That was not 50 minutes.
Waiting outside for me?
Bold gesture.
I called you three times.
I had to do something.
- You must be feeling bad.
- I am.
What for?
You're just doing your job.
Scottie, I'm sorry.
What happened with Louis, I didn't like doing it.
- Yeah, but you still did it.
- And what I'm doing now is asking you to let it go.
Harvey, it's not that you picked Louis over me.
It's that you wouldn't tell me why.
I couldn't tell you why.
There's a difference.
And I'm asking you to trust me.
Okay.
I can let it go, but keeping things from me just can't keep happening, okay?
I can't tell you whether or not that's okay, and I definitely can't tell you why.
Too soon?
What are you going to do to make it up to me?
Nothing right now.
I'm taking Mike to the marathon footwear brunch.
You're taking a date to an I.P.O. event?
That's so cute.
It's not a date.
He's never gonna put out.
Well, it's too bad that you're not taking me because I was thinking of letting you...
[Whispers indistinctly]
Mr. Specter.
James Quelling.
I'm in a bit of a hurry, Mr. quelling.
- I want to do you a favor.
- I don't need any favors.
Yeah, you do, unless you want Friday's headline to read,
"Marathon Footwear builds playgrounds that kill children."
My client builds playgrounds that help children.
And uses a synthetic full of toxins to do it.
Look, I don't know who you are, but I know what you're trying to do, and it isn't gonna work.
Look, I'm a reasonable man.
This is a huge moment for your client.
I won't file this before Friday.
You think I'm gonna let you extort my client?
No, I think you're gonna protect your client from a claim that could ruin them.
In fact, I'm counting on it.
Nice offices.
Enjoy that brunch.
- I got a job offer.
- Holy shit.
From who?
Last night.
Jonathan Sidwell.
But I thought Louis was his lawyer.
He doesn't want me to be his lawyer.
He wants me to be a partner.
- Investment banking?
- Yeah.
- And?
- I don't know.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
What do you think?
I think that I love you, and what you want to do is what I want you to do.
I don't know what to do.
Okay.
Did you talk to Harvey?
If I do that, all he'll hear is, "Hey, Harvey,
"thanks for doing everything for me.
I'm thinking about quitting." Well...
No, but you said that you don't think of him as just your boss.
You consider him a friend.
- So?
- So if he can't have an honest conversation with your best interests in mind, he's not your friend, and-- and he shouldn't be your boss.

I have to talk to you about something.
Well, unless its value is in excess of $575 million, it can wait.
Yeah.
Yeah, it can wait.
Good because our I.P.O. is in jeopardy unless we can deal with this.
Endangering children?
Wait, these things just opened.
This is a bullshit claim.
Maybe, but a bullshit claim on the right day is better than a great claim on a bullshit day.
Did you come up with that all by yourself?
My grandmother taught it to me.
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to find everything there is to know about this quelling guy.
Harvey, why don't you just pay him off?
Protect the I.P.O.?
I worked my ass off for this day.
He's trying to hijack it.
I'm not gonna be extorted by some piece of shit I've never heard of.
Okay.
On it.
Jessica.
Donna, what can I do for you?
I was just walking by reception, and I thought you might like to know--you know, because it's your firm and-- Donna, get to it.
Charles Van Dyke is in the lobby.
- Right now?
- 30 seconds ago.
You were right to come to me.
Would you like me to send him on his way?
I prefer to take care of Charles van dyke myself.
Excellent.
You can stare at it all you want, Charles, but it's not going to change.
I was just thinking,
"I can't believe you put the mailroom boy's name on the wall." I think what you mean is that you can't believe yours was ever taken off.
I put that behind me years ago.
What are you doing here, Charles?
I suggest we go in your office and talk.
Right here is just fine.
What do you want?
I want a 30% increase in my dividend check.
- Good-bye, Charles.
- I thought you'd say that.
This is formal notice of my demand to audit your books.
You have until Friday to comply.
You gave up this right when we ran you out of town.
I think you're forgetting I retain that right in the event of any material change in my dividend.
Your dividend went up.
Materially.
You think we're hiding profits.
From what I know of you, you're always hiding something.
- I'm gonna make it fast, Jim.
- James.
That's not what your ex-wife calls you.
She calls you Jim.
That's one of the nicer names she uses.
She's been calling you a lot these days.
Wow, you found out I'm divorced.
Well, I'll withdraw the lawsuit.
It's not the divorce, Jimbo, it's the huge wall of mounting debt that's closing in on you since you tanked the tobacco litigation.
I didn't tank it.
I lost.
You didn't just lose.
You had an offer that would have set you up for life.
Instead, you rolled the dice, went to verdict, and now you got nothing.
Which is why your wife left you, and now you're coming after us with a fabricated claim.
I didn't fabricate anything.
I have expert reports here.
You've got one report of possible toxins in the playground material.
And not one sick child.
And you have an I.P.O. on Friday, and if this suit appears in the Journal that morning, what do you think the stock price is gonna be when they ring that bell?
Got me.
Give me your number.
- 100,000 and we're done.
- Done.
We'll draw up the paperwork.
I've got it right here.
But one thing, this precludes you from representing any other plaintiffs with the same action.
[Laughs] You got me.
I have 100 other plaintiffs waiting in the wings.
That's a $10 million hit you just avoided.
I tell you what.
Give me a million, and we're really done.
James, this covers your debts and gets you out from under.
You think that means I'm gonna take less than it's worth?
- It isn't worth anything.
- It is today.
You know where to reach me.
Thought you said you were willing to go as high as 500,000.
Yeah, that was before
I realized what we were dealing with.
This guy doesn't owe money 'cause he got divorced.
He got divorced 'cause he owes money.
- What are you talking about?
- He's a gambler.
How does that help us?
He doesn't know I'm one.
Where's Louis?
- Jessica.
- Where is he?
He's not answering his phone.
He's not answering his emails.
The thing is I don't know if he--
Katrina, your job as gatekeeper does not apply to me, so I'm going to ask you one more time.
Why isn't Louis in the building?
He must still be in court.
Is there something I can do?
What you can do is find Louis and have him come up with a way around this demand to look at our books.
When should I tell him you need it?
Yesterday.
You were right.
Quelling's got a game.
- What night?
- Every night.
Well, I hope you know where tonight's game is because--
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.
You and I are going.
- Um...
- What?
I got a job offer, Harvey.
Supposed to go have drinks to talk about it tonight.
I can move it, it's just, that's... that's why I hesitated.
- When?
- When what?
When'd you get the job offer?
- The other night.
- And you didn't mention it.
I didn't know what I thought.
- And now you do?
- No.
It's--
Who?
Jonathan Sidwell.
The spin-off idea?
- Yeah.
- I should have known.
He wants you to be his general counsel?
No, he wants to make me an investment banker.
Well, if it were me...
I'd take it.
What?
Why?
Because you can compete there like you do here with nothing hanging over your head.
What if I don't want to stop being a lawyer?
Well, then don't take the job.
I mean, what do you want from me?
- I want your advice.
- I just gave you my advice.
No, you told me what you would do.
I want to know what you think I should do.
Mike, last week, you said you'd do anything to stop being a fraud, so my advice is take it.
Still be in the majors, just be a different sport.
[Clears throat]
Excuse me, do you have a minute?
Look, you and I have never--
No, we haven't.
I need your help.
You must be scraping the bottom of the barrel if you're coming to me.
It's about Louis.
He and Sheila are done.
That's awful.
It's worse than awful.
Jessica needs him on a case right now.
He won't leave his apartment.
He won't even answer his phone.
Then I'll just go over there right now.
That won't work.
Even if it did, we don't have time.
So then why are you here?
Rachel, you don't trust me.
I get that, but Louis asked me to cover for him, and that is what I'm going to do.
You're the best paralegal here, and you're his friend.
So will you help me or not?
I will.
So...
I figured out what you can do to make it up to me tonight.
I thought we were good.
Yeah, I'm just--I'm feeling some residual anger.
Scottie, I'm kind of busy right now, and I have plans tonight.
Taking Mike on another I.P.O. date?
- What difference does it make?
- Hmm.
Sounds mysterious.
Bet you can't tell me what it is.
- I'm playing poker.
- Poker?
Can I come?
It's a work thing.
- You bring Mike to work things.
- Scottie, I told you I'm busy.
You can't come.
Can I get back to work now?
- What got io you?
- Nothing.
Sometimes at the office, I'm working.
Fair enough, boss.
Are you sure that's how you want to play that?
Play what, the fact that I'm busy?
The fact that you just snapped at her when we both know what you're really angry about.
I'm not angry.
I'm annoyed at the interruption.
You're angry that Mike wants to leave, and you just took it out on her.
- I'm not angry about that.
- No, you're hurt, and the anger covers the hurt, but I knew you didn't know that.
I was annoyed about the interruption just like I'm annoyed right now.
Bullshit.
You're feeling exactly what I'm feeling.
The idea of Mike leaving sucks, and the sooner you get your brain around that, the sooner you can maybe do something about it.
Can I get back to work now?
You can get back to work whenever you want.
But if all you're gonna do is stick your head in the sand, then you're not going to have an associate or a girlfriend to get back to work from.
- You give it to her?
- I gave it to her.
She suspect anything?
I wouldn't be standing here if she did.
- And?
- She thought it was awesome.
Well, she should.
Louis didn't just come up with a way to keep Charles Van Dyke out of our books.
Louis came up with a way to blow him out of the water.
That Louis.
He is one hell of an attorney.
- Thank you, Louis.
- Right back at you, Louis.
Don't get used to it.
Don't worry.
I'm not looking to work here again.
Not here, but you are looking to work?
I've always been able to see through your bullshit, Charles.
Which is why I'm offering you these, five cases.
We're co-counsel, split the profits 50/50.
It announces to the world that you are back in business, which is what you really want.
You came to me bearing gifts.
I still have the card.
"To the man who hired me for all you've done."
Two days later, you shoved me out.
I take this to mean you're passing on my offer.
I'm shitting on your offer.
Okay, Charles.
You were right.
Your dividend check did have the wrong amount, but from now on, it's going to have the right amount, zero.
- I don't think so.
- Oh, the firm you had your exit agreement with no longer exists.
We became Pearson Darby, then Pearson Specter, which means you're not entitled to a thing.
That's not in the spirit of our agreement.
And neither is your claim.
There's only one problem.
You should have dug deeper into the fine print.
The entity referred to in our agreement is defined in your bylaws as "any partnership in which the name partner is Jessica Pearson."
You didn't know.
My number just tripled.
Your call.
Our hearing is Friday.
You guys playing cards?
You're out of your league.
This game is for real players.
Why don't I give it a try?
Buyin is 25,000.
- What's the limit?
- There is no limit.
Maybe I am out of my league.
Raise $45,000.
I'm putting you all-in.
I've seen guys like you before.
You think if you bully me with your big stack,
I'm gonna run and hide.
Here's the difference between you and me, Jimbo,
I lose, I pull out another 25 grand, and another 25 after that.
You lose, you've got nothing.
You're bluffing.
Then call or get up and walk away, but I've sat across from you 1,000 times before.
You won't walk.
Tough beat.
Take your winnings.
What winnings?
I thought maybe it was time we do a little negotiating.
Well, you have my offer.
- I have a counter.
- I'm all ears.
I want a 50% increase in base salary.
I want a guaranteed bonus not tied to our investment returns, a four-week vacation, and I want a piece.
- A piece?
- A piece.
- No.
- No piece?
No negotiating.
Look, I know what you're doing.
You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.
But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.
I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass.
- I do kick ass.
- And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.
But you don't.
I don't yet.
[Clears throat]
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be interviewing other people.
Once I find the right person, job is gone.
I'm not dropping my suit when you're going public in two days.
James, you've read all about Hessington Oil.
The odds were stacked against me.
I won anyway, because I win.
You won because Edward Darby came forward.
You got lucky.
Guys like you always think other people get lucky.
I don't get lucky.
I make my own luck, and in this case, it's bleeding you dry.
Right there.
You just gave me your tell.
You have no other money.
You're done.
There's $100,000 in that pile.
It's the exact amount of the deal we offered you.
Sign it.
We'll fix the paperwork tomorrow.
This is $1,000.
Cash me out.
He doesn't play anymore the rest of the night.
You didn't sleep well.
I didn't sleep at all.
It's a big decision.
You still haven't told me what you think.
Mike, I can't make the decision for you.
I don't want you to make it for me.
I just want to know what you think.
And I already told you that I will support you with whatever you decide.
And the way you can support me right now is by telling me how you feel.
- It's not my place.
- Not your place?
Just admit it.
You want me to take the job, but you're too afraid to say it.
Okay, you want to know the truth?
You already know what you want to do.
And if I try to change your mind and it goes wrong, then I'm afraid you're gonna hold it against me.
Would you just say it?
Yes.
I want you to take the job.
Look, I know that you love what you do, but every day, you go into work with the possibility of being caught, and it is eating away at you.
If you stay there, that's just not gonna change.
- Jessica.
How did--
- It go?
I'll tell you how it went.
I got hung out to dry.
What?
No, it was a good move.
Oh, it would have been if our own bylaws didn't supersede it.
Th--that's impossible.
It was convoluted and buried in the fine print, and something Louis Litt never would have missed.
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.
You're not.
He wouldn't have missed it.
So when you came into my office and told me Louis had come up with that move, you were full of shit.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to help.
Well, that kind of thing only happens once.
You know how I know it's not gonna happen again?
Pack up your shit.
I don't care what kind of deal you have with Harvey.
You're done.
Why wouldn't you tell her?
I said I would cover.
I didn't say I would cover when it suited me.
Yeah, but he wouldn't want you to get fired over this.
I should be fired.
I let Jessica look stupid.
Katrina--
Thank you for your help, Rachel.
I really appreciate it, but if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone.
He's not here.
Where is he?
To tell you the truth, I don't know.
All he said was he had a late night.
Hmm.
Well, I can come back.
- I was just--
- You're taking the job, aren't you?
I don't know.
Yeah, you do.
You just don't want to admit it.
[Sighs]
Yeah.
I'm taking the job.
[Sighs]
God damn it.
Do you know what that man has done for you?
Do you know what it took for him to start trusting someone?
- Donna--
- Don't interrupt me.
So someone's dangling some money in front of you.
- It's not about that.
- I don't care what it's about.
I'm gonna say what he won't.
He needs you.
You need this job, and if you can't see that, then you might as well just leave right now.
Donna, someone's offering me a way out.
- So you don't care about him.
- Of course I do, but I also care about my life with Rachel.
I don't want to live my life like this anymore.
Then you better be the best goddamn investment banker this city has ever seen.
Scottie, I'm sorry I was angry in your direction, but it was really about something else.
Let me guess, Donna explained your feelings to you, and now you're here to apologize.
Maybe.
What was the something else?
Mike got a job offer.
And you don't want him to do it.
No, I don't.
Well, if you want him to stay, you know what's actually a nice tactic?
Telling him you want him to stay.
What?
Had I known "tell me what's going on with you"
meant "I'm going to tell you what to do,"
I might not have taken you up on it.
Oh, okay. [Laughs] Mmm.
- I'll see you in there.
- Okay.
You have that paperwork for me?
Well, I got something for you, but it's not that.
Didn't you learn your lesson last night?
I learned to listen.
When you talked, you mentioned Hessington Oil, so I looked back into it.
Turns out you don't create your own luck.
Your associate does.
What the hell are you talking about?
He conspired with Harold Gunderson to file a lawsuit against your own client so you could bribe witnesses not to testify.
- We didn't bribe anyone.
- [Scoffs]
- That was a legal settlement.
- Don't try to tell me two rookie associates who went to law school together and started at the same firm made this happen without collusion.
I don't need to tell you anything 'cause there's nothing to tell.
Well, you're gonna have to tell someone something, because that suit was filed one day, settled the next, and those witnesses cancelled their flights to New York.
That is a bribe, and when I bring it to the attention of the bar, you and your associate are going to be in deep shit.
Now who showed his tell?
Here's your money back.
And either I go to the bar, or you settle for $2 million.
You have until tomorrow.
Where's Mike?
He's in there.
Harvey--
- Harvey.
- Not now.
You need to call Lola Jensen.
What?
You need to get her to hack into the bar and put your name in.
What the hell are you talking about?
A week ago, you told me that the number one rule was not to move the goddamn body.
A week ago, people weren't sniffing around you.
- Harvey, my job offer is not--
- This isn't about your offer.
Quelling knows about your bullshit lawsuit with Harold Gunderson.
He turned me in?
No, but he will if we don't cave.
- He can't prove anything.
- He doesn't have to.
He hands you in to the bar, they look you up, we're done.
Not if I'm not here.
Oh, that's why you're in here.
You're taking the job.
I am.
And you think an addicted gambler who lost his wife, his child, and his house is gonna stop coming for you just because you're not working here?
You said it yourself.
Hacking into the bar is twice the crime I've been committing.
I am telling you Quelling is on the trail.
You don't do this, we're gonna get caught.
- There's got to be another way.
- There isn't.
- I don't believe that.
- Then you better figure something out fast, because tomorrow morning, we're done, and you quitting isn't gonna change that.
[Sighs]
You can't fire Katrina Bennett.
I can fire whoever I want to.
She was covering for Louis.
What are you talking about?
Louis's engagement is over, and he's losing it.
He won't come in to work, he won't pick up his phone, and he just didn't want anyone to know.
Then why are you telling me?
Because I helped her cover for him.
Are you saying I should fire you too?
I am saying that...
We made a mistake, but that we were just looking out for Louis, and I know how much you value loyalty, so I don't think that should be the thing that costs Katrina her job... or mine.
- Jessica.
- I need you.
No, listen, I just need a little more time.
And had you asked me for it, I would have said yes, but instead, you had Katrina cover for you.
Oh, that little traitor.
What, did she rat me out?
No, she didn't.
She's so loyal to you that she tried to pass off her work for yours.
Louis, Van Dyke wants to look at our books.
What?
We can't have that.
I know.
This was her fix.
Oh, no, and you used this on him?
I did, and then I fired Katrina.
- Jessica.
- I know.
I can't fire her for being loyal.
But I can't afford you sitting here licking your wounds while I get my ass handed to me.
Please, just listen to me, okay?
I cannot see straight.
I cannot think straight, and even if I wanted to come and help you, I wouldn't be any good to you, so...
Louis...
I know you loved Sheila, but do you love your firm?
You know I do.
And when you love a woman, can you stand the thought of her being with another man?
- No.
- Well, Louis,
Van Dyke is trying to get into Pearson Specter's pants.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm gonna put on a goddamn chastity belt.
How?
'Cause Katrina actually was on the right track.
Van Dyke's claim is gone if the partnership is gone.
The bylaws say it's not.
No, it is if we become an L.L.C.
We can't do that by tomorrow.
We'd have to rewrite every contract.
Boy, wow, Jessica, you sometimes really surprise me.
You don't think I know that?
I have an army of associates that I've trained within an inch of their lives.
My name is Louis goddamn Marlowe Litt, and my firm is under siege, so don't you tell me what I can and cannot do!
- Hey.
- Hey.
I don't want to interrupt, but I was just wondering what happened with Mike.
He's leaving.
[Sighs]
I'm sorry.
It's fine.
Can I ask you something?
Did you tell him that you wanted him to stay?
I didn't get around to it.
You--you didn't get around to it?
I was gonna tell him, and then he told me he was leaving, and then other shit came up, so...
So you just dropped it?
I told you other shit came up.
What other shit?
I mean, you had an emergency case filing, so you let your protege walk out the door?
- It's complicated.
- Okay.
Well...then share it with me.
Quelling came after us.
The Hessington witnesses.
What?
That's bullshit.
You may have blurred some lines, but you certainly didn't cross any.
Fight him.
- No, I can't.
- Why?
Look, I don't want to talk about it.
What is going on here?
When somebody pisses you off, you get in the ring.
What are you saying?
What I'm saying is that you're not taking on Quelling, but you're letting Mike walk out the door without trying to stop him.
I think one thing changed the other, and I want to know why.
Maybe what changed is his desire to be here, and maybe what I have to say doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.
Now, what is this really about?
Because it's sure as hell not about some stupid case.
You know what?
God damn it!
For once, can't it just be about what I said it's about?
You didn't say what it was about.
Harvey, I'm really sorry that the Mike thing turned out this way.
I am, but I can't say that I didn't see it coming.
- Scottie, it isn't--
- What?
It isn't what?
It isn't what it seems?
Because I don't know what it seems.
All I know is that any time I ask you about anything, all you say is, "I can't talk about it."
I'm just gonna stop asking.
Then we'll just make up later, and we can do it all over again tomorrow.
[Knock at door]
Quelling can't hurt us anymore.
- You went to see Lola.
- I looked at his accounts.
I wanted to find out where all that money came from to find all those clients.
He doesn't have the money.
And yet his rent gets paid, and they don't turn off his electricity.
Holy shit.
Guess you didn't have to see Lola after all.
You think I got access to that with a court order?
So you did go see her?
You put the idea in my head.
I just came up with a different agenda.
We got him.
No.
You got him.
What?
Your going-away present.
Be a lawyer one last time.
Knock this guy out.
[Knock at door]
You have my settlement check.
I don't have a dime for you.
Then I guess the bar is going to be hearing from me first thing in the morning.
Well, then, they'll also be hearing from me.
Disciplinary rule 5-107a, "accepting compensation--"
- I know what it says.
- Then you also know the penalty is being disbarred.
You took money from our client's competitors to trump up your bullshit suit.
You didn't come by that legally.
And they're not gonna care.
I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't have a hell of a lot to lose, so sign my deal or get the hell out of my office.
Well, here's the thing, James.
I don't either...
Because today is my last day as a lawyer anyway.
- Bullshit.
- Look at me.
Good luck in front of the bar.
I wasn't always like this.
I had tobacco in my sights.
They offered me a lot of money.
I could have made a fortune.
But $15,000 per client for people with cancer?
I risked going to verdict because I wanted to get those people something that could make a difference!
And I lost everything...
My clients, my wife, my kids!
You lost them because you gambled them away, James.
I know that.
Please.
Being a lawyer is what I am.
It's who I am.
And if you take that away...
It's up to you, James.
I'll drop the suit.
I promise.
Louis, where the hell are you?
You said you could get it done.
I walk through those doors, our books fly open.
Get here now.
Well, this should be fun.
We've never been across the aisle from each other.
Which is why you don't realize that it won't be fun.
We'll see what we see.
Case 41432, Van Dyke versus Pearson.
Look at that.
Game time.
Ladies first.
Ladies first.
Son of a bitch.
For being polite?
Were you being polite when you hired me?
What does one have to do with the other?
"To the man who hired me, for all you've done."
Do you want to know what I meant when I wrote that card?
The day you made me that offer, I asked you,
"did it have anything to do with gender or race?"
You swore it didn't.
You lied to me.
- It didn't.
- You're lying now.
You know, Daniel Hardman may have used people, but he didn't give a shit about their gender or their color.
- He showed you the list.
- Right next to my name, an asterisk.
Not "Law Review."
Not second in my class.
Diversity.
- You were treated the same.
- You tell yourself that, but we both know the truth, which is why I sleep at night just fine.
Well, it doesn't change the facts in this case, does it?
No.
No, it doesn't, but this will.
Charles, you remember Louis Litt?
Sorry, I couldn't run.
Doctor wanted me to take it easy.
Hey, Charles.
[Spanks him] Great to see you.
You told me that story to stall.
- That was a stall...
- Hmm.
But this is for me.
When I saw that asterisk next to my name, it made me sick to my stomach, because in one second,
I understood how you will always see me.
So that card was a thank you, because if I hadn't have felt sick, then I might not have worked as hard as I did to get where I am today.
You woke the dragon, Charles.
How do you like me now?
I know you're there.
You need anything?
No.
The I.P.O. is wrapped up.
We go public Monday morning.
I wasn't talking about the I.P.O.
I was talking about how you're feeling about Mike.
I know.
Okay.
Good night, Harvey.
I'm gonna tell Scottie.
About Mike?
Are you crazy?
You can't have it both ways, Donna.
You can't tell me to open up and then keep my secrets.
You spent more than a year covering it up.
You tried to get him to commit another crime to cover it up, and now-- You said I should tell her what's really bothering me!
I meant your feelings.
I didn't mean confess to a felony.
These are my goddamn feelings!
Donna, I did something when I hired him.
It's caused all of this.
I can't tell her, and it's driving me crazy!
Okay.
Look, Mike is gone, Harvey.
I hate that he's gone, but the jeopardy's gone too.
It's done.
And now you want to turn around and tell someone who--
Someone who what?
Nothing.
No, you better finish that sentence.
Someone who's pissed at you, Harvey.
Someone who keeps finding a reason to be pissed at you, and it's not the third time, and it's not the fifth time, and it's not the last time.
I thought you were trying to help my relationship, not shit on it.
Okay, you want to yell at me?
Fine.
Because I know you're not mad at me.
And I know you're only telling me this stupid idea because you want me to tell you what you already know.
You can't, Harvey.
It's good that you want to, but you can't.
Could I have a minute?
Congratulate me.
I'm officially a member of the New York bar.
You went to Lola?
I made a mistake.
I want to stay.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
We have had a very productive day today so far.
I am feeling really good about it!
[sighs]
Okay, Patrick.
You haven't spoken yet.
I am super excited to hear what you have to say.
Well...
I finally met Andy's parents the other night and I really do not like his mom.
She is this super positive, overly perky little blonde who...
You know what?
I think I'm just going to wait for Charlie when he gets back next week and tell him.
Well, actually, Charlie is barred from practicing until the week after, so you should tell me.
Come on.
You can do it!
No, I really can't.
I don't understand why Charlie's not allowed to help us with our anger.
I mean, all he did was firebomb a garbage truck.
Well, Lacey when you firebomb a garbage truck, you get a suspension and a hefty fine.
A hefty fine?
Garbage, hefty... nothing?
Oh, my God, I will be so glad when Charlie is back.
Glad...
it's also a garbage bag.
- I don't get it.
- I am playing your game, woman!
- Nolan:
Hey, Charlie.
- Sorry, not allowed to talk.
Just going to grab a snack before I head out.
- Gotta get to anger therapy.
- If the court's making you go, why don't you just join your own group, give yourself some advice, and go back to bed?
Nolan, that's ridiculous.
And I already suggested that but the judge said no.
If you've got to go to anger therapy, here's something I've learned to make the most of it... show up a little bit drunk.
I would love to, Ed, but I made the mistake of showing up sober the first time and now the therapist knows the difference.
- All right, carry on.
- Thank you.
Now, Ed, it says here in Charlie's notes that you've been, "A little crabby lately because of your hemorrhoids,
DNMIG." What does that stand for?
- "Do not mention in group."
- Oh.
Sorry.
No problem.
I reiterate, I'm little bit drunk.
Nolan, what about you?
You just been sitting there like lazy little ferret.
That's so much cuter than what I was thinking.
Actually, everything's great in "Ferret Land."
Got an awesome new girlfriend.
Told her all about you.
- And she wants to get together with everybody.
- Fun!
- Not you.
- Not me.
So why don't you tell us about her?
- Well, she's a behavioral psychologist.
- I think you're saying that wrong.
It's pronounced, "homeless Dumpster woman."
No, she really is a behavioral psychologist.
Nolan, honey.
Don't take this the wrong way, but why the hell would any kind of scientist want to date you?
I mean, that would be like me dating a rock.
- Again, no offense.
- Come on, guys.
People from wildly different backgrounds can be attracted to each other.
I mean, look at me, I've got a Ph.D.
and once I slept with a man who only had a master's.
Oh, come on!
That was way better than the "hefty" joke.
I don't know how y'all stand this.
I'm half in the bag and I want to taste the business end of a shotgun.
- Oh, you're still here.
- Yup, about to leave.
- So, how did it go with the group?
- Good.
You know, despite their squabbling, I really get the sense that they'd like to spend some quality time with each other...
- doing something terrible to me.
- No, no, no, come on.
It just feels that way because it's, you know, true.
Doesn't your anger therapy start at 5:00?
- You're gonna be late.
- So you're saying I'm going to miss a few minutes of people talking about their anger?
Oh, no.
Wherever will I find that again?
Such a waste of my time.
What are you saying?
That you don't need to get your anger under control?
You firebombed a garbage truck.
Bombing that truck was just a momentary lapse of judgment.
It was also, in the words of Jerry across the street, "Bitchin'!"
Oh, my God, you are in so much denial.
- I'm really worried about you.
- Jordan, it was one incident.
Save for that, the last three years have been firebomb-free.
And what happened the year before that?
Another incident.
The settlement precludes me from discussing it.
Look, I've been through anger therapy with a very good therapist and I got all this under control.
- How did your cell phone break last week?
- I told you, I dropped it.
Oh, I didn't realize that things could drop horizontally 90 miles an hour against a wall.
I can still throw the heat, can't I?
[sighs]
Okay.
Now I'm going to open up this next question to the whole group.
- What color is anger?
- "What color is anger?"
Is "Oh, my God, I'd rather take a bath with a hair dryer than listen to this putz" a color?
Charlie, now I realize you're a therapist and you think you know all of this, but if you practiced it, you probably wouldn't be here.
I'm sorry, Dr. Woo.
From now on, I'll be hanging on your every word.
Or from a pipe in the basement.
Give me a rope.
No, this is good.
Because Charlie is making fun of me.
Now, do I get mad?
No.
Do I yell?
No.
But do I channel all that negative energy into requiring Charlie to attend an extra week of anger therapy?
Yes.
Wait a minute.
That voice... were you that little raccoon in "Kung Fu Panda"?
I'm just kidding.
That was Dustin Hoffman.
- Wait, are you Dustin Hoffman?
- Thankfully, we're out of time.
Oh, by the way, the correct answer is anger can be any color you're thinking of when you're feeling angry.
Wow.
Who would have thought the answer would be stupider than the question?
- Oh, hey, it's Jane, right?
- Yeah.
- You wanna go grab some coffee?
- Uh, I don't know if that's a good idea.
I'm in here because I slapped a barista.
Okay.
You want to go get a drink?
I mean, unless you throat-punched a cocktail waitress or something.
I'm just trying to break my pattern of dating guys with anger issues.
All they do is support my bad instincts to go off on people.
Yeah, look, my anger issues are under control.
I'm only in here because I was defending myself against a crazed garbage man.
You know, that old story.
So you really don't have any anger issues.
Well, I did, I did, but I've overcome them.
And I swear, if I get angry about anything at all, then it's game over.
But that's not gonna happen.
You know, Charlie, I've been giving it some consideration and I've decided that you need two extra weeks of therapy.
Two weeks?
But I gotta get back to my patients.
I think I might be doing them a favor.
I mean, if the way you act in my group is any indication of the way you are as a therapist,
- well, you suck.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, I'd like to take you outside and... thank you personally for your honest assessment of my abilities.
Hell, I'll just do it here.
Thank you.

- Charlie and the Temper of Doom
File this, please.
I've got to go fix my hair.
My boyfriend's going to be here any second.
Ooh, girl, you should go to Johnny Mack in cell block D.
Johnny used to be a hairdresser.
He's responsible for this fine 'do.
And a massacre at a convenience store in Connecticut.
Thanks.
I have a comb.
T.G.I.F., am I right?
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for a Mr. Charlie Goodson.
Oh, he's not here.
May I tell him who's calling?
I'm Mr. Ventura from the American Psychological Association.
Ooh, fancy pants.
Can I tell him what this is about?
Yes, I wanted to have a word with him.
I was here for a parole hearing this morning and was hoping to avoid driving out to his house.
Okay, let me get this down.
"Mr. Ventura from APA don't like to drive."
Let him know that I will be at his home promptly at 9 A.M.
Monday morning to discuss a probationary issue related to his latest anger incident.
Mm-hmm.
"Issue, incident, sweet butt."
Okay, got it.
You may leave now.
Shoo!
Shoo!
Use your shoes and walk away.
Excuse me.
What can I do for you, Mr. Tasty Morsel?
- Hey, is Jordan here?
- She's off making herself pretty for you.
I see you've already done that for me.
Oh, my God, is this how women feel when I hit on them?
'Cause you just made me feel pretty special.
- Hey, Sean.
- Hey.
[smooches] Any messages?
Oh, yes, a very important one.
You should have gone to Johnny Mack.
Ooh, that's crispy.
- If I was in prison, I'd do very well.
- It's prison.
Anything that stands still for more than a second does well.
Before we go, I have to ask you a favor.
You know how Charlie firebombed a garbage truck?
Yeah, I read about it on Jerry's blog.
Apparently, it was bitchin'.
Something like that is going to happen again and when it does, they're gonna throw Charlie in jail.
No, they're not.
What he did was completely justified.
It wasn't even that big of a deal.
What do you want me to do about it?
I want you to get Charlie so angry that he loses it.
This way, he can't say the garbage truck was an isolated incident.
Are you insane?
I don't want to make him mad.
- Dude sets trucks on fire.
- Sean, Charlie is your best friend, if something happens to him after you've had the chance to help him, you're going to blame yourself.
All right.
Fine.
I don't know when I'm going to do it.
He has a date tonight, I don't want to mess that up.
That'll just piss him off.
Well, that's true.
Since we're trying to make him angry, we really wouldn't want to piss him off.
I have an idea.
How about we do it tonight?
- Thank you.
- You handled that very well.
What was I going to do, go all Gordon Ramsay on her because my lasagna had a tiny paper clip in it?
That's what I would've done, yeah.
No, no, you'd have done what I just did.
You'd have written a little note saying,
"Please stop doing paperwork in the kitchen,"
then attached it to the garlic bread with the paper clip and sent it back.
- Charlie.
Hey, man.
- Sean, what are you doing here?
Just grabbing a drink.
Who's this?
Oh, this is Jane.
Jane, this my buddy Sean.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Do you mind?
- A little.
Wow.
What a pleasure to meet you.
You are beautiful.
You really undersold her saying she was "average-looking".
He's just joking.
We screw around with each other a lot.
No, we don't.
So what are you guys... you celebrating?
Did Charlie tell you he's finally allowed to donate blood again?
Doubled his income.
Doubled it.
Look, I don't know what you're on right now, but we should get you home before you masturbate in a church again.
Our Lady of Tears, indeed.
How fast do you think you can wrap this up so you and I can get outta here?
Five, 10 minutes?
I mean, without being rude.
Sean, how about you and I take a little walk to the bar and reinforce our friendship?
Charlie, can't you see that I am on a date?
Okay, let's go.
Fun friend walk.
Ow, ow, ow.
That's...
that hurts my arm.
Charlie, that hurts my arm.
Ow!
- What the hell are you doing?
- Just chill, all right?
Jordan just wanted me to prove that you can't control your anger so maybe you would take therapy a little more seriously.
Why would you go along with that?
I need bonus points, all right?
I...
It gets me out of doing the sappy couple's stuff.
Like going to the Botanical Gardens.
Oh, well, if you do have to go, make sure you check out the Japanese Tea Garden in the back.
Why do you know that?
When I was married, I messed up a lot.
I practically lived in that garden.
Well, if it isn't ugly and stupid and Sean.
- Did Jordan ask you to say that?
- No.
- Did she pay you to say that?
- Yeah.
$50, dick.
I just made another 10.
So did Jordan hire anybody else to get me angry?
I don't know, but she seemed pretty set on proving that you have a problem.
Hey, dork.
- How much she paying you?
- 20 bucks.
- Cool, thank you.
- No problem.
So you never told me why you slapped that barista.
Because she gave me the worst cup of coffee I ever had.
Eh, let's have juice instead.
It's okay, Charlie.
You didn't write "Ho" on the side of my cup.
Let me see this.
Oh, good, good.
It's not one of my Christmas mugs.
[doorbell rings]
I'll be right back.
[doorbell rings] Coming.
Uh, hi.
Can I help you?
- Charlie Goodson?
- That's right.
I'm Mr. Ventura from the American Psychological Association.
I'm here to discuss your ongoing anger problem.
Oh, really?
Clearly a little more thought went into this one.
And I give you credit for not just walking in and calling me a "dick".
No, we seldom do that.
- Here is my card.
May I come in?
- Your card. [chuckles]
Wow, you really went all out.
Reno Ventura. [chuckles] That's the stupid name you came up with?
Actually, it's the name my parents came up with.
You don't say.
Is your mother's name Jordan?
No, it's Margaret.
It was Margaret.
She passed a month ago.
Yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Okay, I'm not going to waste anymore time.
I'm not going to get angry.
And, no offense, but you don't look smart enough to be a psychologist.
- Excuse me?
- It's not your fault, but your eyes are really close and it gives you a slightly inbred look.
I don't think you realize how serious this situation is.
[mocking] Oh, no.
I don't realize how serious the situation is.
Sir, may I remind you, the wrong recommendation from me and your license will be suspended.
Look, Reno Ventura "Pet Detective,"
if you don't get the hell out of here right now,
I am going to suspend you by your underwear off that balcony.
- Get your hands off me.
- Then get the hell out of here!
Charlie!
What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of one of your anger shills who says he works for the APA.
Yeah, maybe the American "Pa-lease" Association.
That is Reno Ventura, the new chairman of the ethics committee.
Remember when he got elected and you asked me, "Who's the clown that's running ethics?"
And I said, "Reno Ventura." And you said something about a pet detective?
Oh, boy.
I just used that one again.
- Look, Mr. Ventura, I am so...
- Don't bother, Goodson!
I came here to determine whether you were stable enough to continue to have a practice.
I think I have my answer.
Have a nice day!
- This is all your fault.
- I didn't send him here!
But you sent the others, it made me think that he was in on it, too!
I know.
That's why I'm here.
I came to apologize for going overboard.
- I really was just trying to help.
- Well, stop helping!
Every time you try to apologize or help something bad happens to me.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Charlie?
Are you angry?
No.
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can see you again.
You obviously have a problem.
I'm gonna get dressed and take off.
Have a nice day!
- I feel awful.
- It's fine.
It's fine.
Now if you'll excuse me, this is time of day when I like to take my pool cues outside and smash them against a tree.
- So you're upset?
- Well, yeah.
I mean, Jordan set up these three people to screw with me the day before.
I just assumed that the APA guy was part of it.
- I've never been so angry.
- I understand.
Charlie, what color are you seeing?
You know what, Will?
I'm not doing the color thing.
Got ya.
It's all right.
Let's try an exercise.
I want you to close your eyes and I want you to imagine yourself somewhere where you're relaxed and happy.
A rolling river.
A babbling brook.
- A calm ocean.
- And how do you feel?
Good... because I'm drowning Jordan in all of them.
It doesn't sound like your quite ready to give up your anger towards Jordan now, but how do you think it makes her feel?
Purple.
I feel purple.
Personally, I like the color thing.
Now how do you feel about how you've made Charlie feel?
I have already said that I'm sorry.
Look, Charlie, I just got worried about you
- when you firebombed that truck.
- Charlie?
- Can you forgive her?
- I guess so.
I take back what I said earlier.
If you were on fire, I would spit on you.
- Thank you, Charlie.
- This is wonderful.
See, I think you two can still have a positive working relationship.
If I'm allowed to work.
The guy from the APA won't even talk to me one-on-one.
He's scared to be alone with me.
- You grabbed me by the lapel of my suit!
- I thought you were someone else.
- You made fun of my eyes.
- I was jealous.
They're beautiful.
Mr. Ventura, how does that make you feel?
Flattered.
And after listening to Dr. Denby, I do understand the situation and I fully accept Goodson's explanation and apology.
That's great.
That's great.
Thank you.
I just wish Jane would understand and agree to see me again.
Not gonna happen.
Dr. Woo told me to stay away from anyone with an anger problem.
I told you, I don't have an anger problem.
If you take away the thing happened with Ventura, firebombing, a few smashed cell phones, some punched out dry wall... all right, I might have an anger problem.
So you'll attend the next four or five weeks with a new conscientious attitude?
What do you want me to say?
That my anger's green?
- Fine, it's green.
- Charlie, anger is never green.
Oh, yeah?
Then how do you explain the Hulk?
[laughing]
You know what?
You are funny.
- Let's go out tonight.
- Cool with me.
Suck on that color, Woo.
Okay, welcome, everyone.
As you can see, Jordan will be silently observing our group for a few days.
So don't feel self-conscious about talking in front of her.
We have had a very productive day today so far.
I am feeling really good about it!
[sighs]
Okay, Patrick.
You haven't spoken yet.
I am super excited to hear what you have to say.
Well...
I finally met Andy's parents the other night and I really do not like his mom.
She is this super positive, overly perky little blonde who...
You know what?
I think I'm just going to wait for Charlie when he gets back next week and tell him.
Well, actually, Charlie is barred from practicing until the week after, so you should tell me.
Come on.
You can do it!
No, I really can't.
I don't understand why Charlie's not allowed to help us with our anger.
I mean, all he did was firebomb a garbage truck.
Well, Lacey when you firebomb a garbage truck, you get a suspension and a hefty fine.
A hefty fine?
Garbage, hefty... nothing?
Oh, my God, I will be so glad when Charlie is back.
Glad...
it's also a garbage bag.
- I don't get it.
- I am playing your game, woman!
- Nolan:
Hey, Charlie.
- Sorry, not allowed to talk.
Just going to grab a snack before I head out.
- Gotta get to anger therapy.
- If the court's making you go, why don't you just join your own group, give yourself some advice, and go back to bed?
Nolan, that's ridiculous.
And I already suggested that but the judge said no.
If you've got to go to anger therapy, here's something I've learned to make the most of it... show up a little bit drunk.
I would love to, Ed, but I made the mistake of showing up sober the first time and now the therapist knows the difference.
- All right, carry on.
- Thank you.
Now, Ed, it says here in Charlie's notes that you've been, "A little crabby lately because of your hemorrhoids,
DNMIG." What does that stand for?
- "Do not mention in group."
- Oh.
Sorry.
No problem.
I reiterate, I'm little bit drunk.
Nolan, what about you?
You just been sitting there like lazy little ferret.
That's so much cuter than what I was thinking.
Actually, everything's great in "Ferret Land."
Got an awesome new girlfriend.
Told her all about you.
- And she wants to get together with everybody.
- Fun!
- Not you.
- Not me.
So why don't you tell us about her?
- Well, she's a behavioral psychologist.
- I think you're saying that wrong.
It's pronounced, "homeless Dumpster woman."
No, she really is a behavioral psychologist.
Nolan, honey.
Don't take this the wrong way, but why the hell would any kind of scientist want to date you?
I mean, that would be like me dating a rock.
- Again, no offense.
- Come on, guys.
People from wildly different backgrounds can be attracted to each other.
I mean, look at me, I've got a Ph.D.
and once I slept with a man who only had a master's.
Oh, come on!
That was way better than the "hefty" joke.
I don't know how y'all stand this.
I'm half in the bag and I want to taste the business end of a shotgun.
- Oh, you're still here.
- Yup, about to leave.
- So, how did it go with the group?
- Good.
You know, despite their squabbling, I really get the sense that they'd like to spend some quality time with each other...
- doing something terrible to me.
- No, no, no, come on.
It just feels that way because it's, you know, true.
Doesn't your anger therapy start at 5:00?
- You're gonna be late.
- So you're saying I'm going to miss a few minutes of people talking about their anger?
Oh, no.
Wherever will I find that again?
Such a waste of my time.
What are you saying?
That you don't need to get your anger under control?
You firebombed a garbage truck.
Bombing that truck was just a momentary lapse of judgment.

And, no offense, but you don't look smart enough to be a psychologist.
- Excuse me?
- It's not your fault, but your eyes are really close and it gives you a slightly inbred look.
I don't think you realize how serious this situation is.
[mocking] Oh, no.
I don't realize how serious the situation is.
Sir, may I remind you, the wrong recommendation from me and your license will be suspended.
Look, Reno Ventura "Pet Detective,"
if you don't get the hell out of here right now,
I am going to suspend you by your underwear off that balcony.
- Get your hands off me.
- Then get the hell out of here!
Charlie!
What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of one of your anger shills who says he works for the APA.
Yeah, maybe the American "Pa-lease" Association.
That is Reno Ventura, the new chairman of the ethics committee.
Remember when he got elected and you asked me, "Who's the clown that's running ethics?"
And I said, "Reno Ventura." And you said something about a pet detective?
Oh, boy.
I just used that one again.
- Look, Mr. Ventura, I am so...
- Don't bother, Goodson!
I came here to determine whether you were stable enough to continue to have a practice.
I think I have my answer.
Have a nice day!
- This is all your fault.
- I didn't send him here!
But you sent the others, it made me think that he was in on it, too!
I know.
That's why I'm here.
I came to apologize for going overboard.
- I really was just trying to help.
- Well, stop helping!
Every time you try to apologize or help something bad happens to me.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Charlie?
Are you angry?
No.
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can see you again.
You obviously have a problem.
I'm gonna get dressed and take off.
Have a nice day!
- I feel awful.
- It's fine.
It's fine.
Now if you'll excuse me, this is time of day when I like to take my pool cues outside and smash them against a tree.
- So you're upset?
- Well, yeah.
I mean, Jordan set up these three people to screw with me the day before.
I just assumed that the APA guy was part of it.
- I've never been so angry.
- I understand.
Charlie, what color are you seeing?
You know what, Will?
I'm not doing the color thing.
Got ya.
It's all right.
Let's try an exercise.
I want you to close your eyes and I want you to imagine yourself somewhere where you're relaxed and happy.
A rolling river.
A babbling brook.
- A calm ocean.
- And how do you feel?
Good... because I'm drowning Jordan in all of them.
It doesn't sound like your quite ready to give up your anger towards Jordan now, but how do you think it makes her feel?
Purple.
I feel purple.
Personally, I like the color thing.
Now how do you feel about how you've made Charlie feel?
I have already said that I'm sorry.
Look, Charlie, I just got worried about you
- when you firebombed that truck.
- Charlie?
- Can you forgive her?
- I guess so.
I take back what I said earlier.
If you were on fire, I would spit on you.
- Thank you, Charlie.
- This is wonderful.
See, I think you two can still have a positive working relationship.
If I'm allowed to work.
The guy from the APA won't even talk to me one-on-one.
He's scared to be alone with me.
- You grabbed me by the lapel of my suit!
- I thought you were someone else.
- You made fun of my eyes.
- I was jealous.
They're beautiful.
Mr. Ventura, how does that make you feel?
Flattered.
And after listening to Dr. Denby, I do understand the situation and I fully accept Goodson's explanation and apology.
That's great.
That's great.
Thank you.
I just wish Jane would understand and agree to see me again.
Not gonna happen.
Dr. Woo told me to stay away from anyone with an anger problem.
I told you, I don't have an anger problem.
If you take away the thing happened with Ventura, firebombing, a few smashed cell phones, some punched out dry wall... all right, I might have an anger problem.
So you'll attend the next four or five weeks with a new conscientious attitude?
What do you want me to say?
That my anger's green?
- Fine, it's green.
- Charlie, anger is never green.
Oh, yeah?
Then how do you explain the Hulk?
[laughing]
You know what?
You are funny.
- Let's go out tonight.
- Cool with me.
Suck on that color, Woo.
Okay, welcome, everyone.
As you can see, Jordan will be silently observing our group for a few days.
So don't feel self-conscious about talking in front of her.
Jackie:
Previously on "Nurse Jackie"...
Nancy Wood.
Does that name ring a bell?
That's the patient who stole Carrie's DEA number.
WASQ wants me to do medical segments from the hospital.
I get a prescription from pain medication from Coop and you administer it.
- It says here you got a prescription yesterday.
- Yes.
Well, then it seems a little surprising that your urine analysis came back clean.
Should I go back to school and get a master's degree?
I think it's a great idea, Zoey.
Good, because I wanted to ask if you'd write me a recommendation.
(Snorts, sighs)
You look great.
I'm having dinner with my ex-husband and his new fiancée.
Want me to come with, make him jealous?
We can't have sex in your office.
I don't want to have sex in your office.
It's, like... it's more than that.
Jackie Peyton, these are my boys.
Hey, Mrs. Peyton.
Your boys cannot be at my house.
Wow, you're gonna choose the drugs over us.
Take all the time you need to pack.
I want you out of my house.
Hey, it's Jackie.
You wanna go to a wedding with me?
(Theme music playing)
(Man vocalizing)
We're going to do a small incision here.
I never thought I would do this.
Well, what we're talking about doing is very minor.
This washes off, right?
'Cause tonight is my ex-husband's wedding, which is probably why I'm going down this rabbit hole.
You should've booked sooner.
Revenge eye lifts are my favorite.
(Chuckles)
And don't wait to fill this prescription for painkillers.
You want to have these on hand the minute you get home after surgery, okay?
You bet.
Hi, yes, it's Jackie Peyton.
I was just in.
Yeah, listen, I'm having some second thoughts about this eye lift procedure.
Can I cancel?
It was for next week.
And I will absolutely let you know if I change my mind, okay?
Great, thanks so much for your time.
Okay.
Given the destruction from Hurricane Penny in Florida, it's important to remain prepared if disaster strikes our coastline again.
Establish a family phone tree.
That way everyone can check in with someone in an unaffected area.
You guys, that was good.
- I'm so excited.
- I know.
You two have so much chemistry, I should be jealous.
No, be brutally honest, please.
Everyone I know is gonna be watching this.
Okay, next time, just soften your hands when you gesture.
You're doing this claw hand thing for emphasis.
- You do do that.
- Oh, my God, I do.
And just turn your bodies on a slight angle.
Just... yeah, that's beautiful.
- You're good at this.
- He is amazing at everything.
And I'm late for work.
You're gonna be great.
Are you still up for dinner with my brother later?
- Of course.
- All right, bye.
Dinner with the brother?
Major.
No, it's not, really.
I've basically met his whole family.
It's all so easy.
No drama.
I will leave that to you straight people.
Ooh, dress bag.
Yeah, tonight is Kevin's wedding.
You're going to Kevin's wedding?
Isn't that maybe kind of awkward?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, it is.
Fiona's freaking out.
She has to walk down the aisle.
She begged me to go.
I'm just trying to do the right thing.
Here is your letter of recommendation for your master's program.
Well, I can't read this in front of you.
(Squealing)
Jesus, what did you write?
The truth.
(Squealing)
I can't send that letter in.
- Why not?
- 'Cause I wanna frame it.
No one is ever gonna write anything that nice about me ever again.
Yes, they will.
Dr. Roman, this is Anna, type one diabetic.
Hey, my blood sugar's really out of whack and I couldn't regulate it.
Uh, you're smart to come in.
Let's run a panel and if her levels are elevated,
I want eight units of regular insulin intravenously.
Hey, I need Jackie.
Oh, yeah.
She's fine, go ahead.
- One, two, three.
- What've we got?
Multiple lacerations on the forehead and extremities.
Female, 50, she was hit by a cab.
Oh, Jesus, Helen.
Shit, there's bruising on the chest wall.
- Let's get a 12-lead EKG and a blood panel.
- Got it.
The cab didn't hit me.
I stepped in front of him.
I don't want that poor guy getting arrested.
- Okay.
- What the hell is all this?
Uh, we need to find out if you've injured your heart and lungs.
- Let's hope so.
- Why don't we sedate her so she stops talking?
- What is your problem?
- She's been in here before.
- Yes, she has.
- I don't like saving people who don't want to live.
You look awful.
Yeah, Helen's back.
Sounds like she might get what she wants after all.
Yeah, she has a cardiac contusion.
With her history, she's probably not gonna make it.
I'm very sorry.
Well, we're gonna keep her comfortable.
It's rough everywhere today.
Three people got fired after those drug screenings came back.
They found Nancy Wood?
They found two radiologists who were smoking weed and a security guard with a coke problem.
And I've got the DEA on my ass because of my prescription for your pills.
Gloria, if it helps you, I will pee in a cup right now.
And your test will come up positive because I've been the one handing you pills every day, so... my hands are neatly tied, aren't they?
Why are you looking at me like that?
That's the thing.
I probably should be looking at you.
Gloria, how big of an asshole do you think I am?
I'll let you know when I find Nancy Wood.
What's wrong?
You look like something's wrong.
Can I help you?
No.
Don't worry about me.
Please.
It might be the last thing I do.
I need you to rest.
I need to show you how to use this so you're not in pain, okay?
Oh, good.
- So there's nobody I can call?
- Nah.
There used to be people.
When I was part of the order,
I had 65 sisters.
Now there's just you.
Well, I'm here all day, okay?
You've done so much for me.
I wish there was a way I could repay you.
Angel.
Ahem.
"Her empathy is matched only by her attention to detail.
I have never seen a nurse more able to focus on what really matters when it comes to her patients."
- Really?
- Stop quoting me to me.
Okay.
Is that Helen's chart?
Yeah.
She's resting now.
I'm just trying to stay close.
God, I thought we helped her.
She looked a lot better when she left here last time.
- Remember the picture you took?
- Oh, yeah.
- Wow, look at that.
- I know.
- Can you send that to me?
- Of course.
I can stay here tonight.
I know you have Kevin's wedding.
Oh, God, I still have to buy shoes.
You don't have shoes?
Go!
I'll be here just in case she wakes up.
- (Vibrates)
- Great, thank you.
Knock-knock.
Do you look even better than usual?
I hope so.
I've got a segment today.
There's lots of mascara.
Oh, my God, you know what we should do tonight?
- I just can't stop thinking about it.
- What?
What should we do?
- Something we haven't done before?
- Yep, yep.
We should have dinner with your moms.
(Laughs)
What I want to do is way more fun.
Dude, moms love me.
(Groans) Carrie...
I'm not introducing you to my moms until I know this is definitely something real.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize that you were fucking a pretend vagina every night.
They're my moms.
- It's a big step.
- I'm ready for that.
(Chuckles)
Wow, okay.
Do they even know I exist?
Yeah, of course they do.
They know all about you.
Oh, God.
(Sighs)
Hey.
- Hey.
- Can you put this in the back room?
I don't feel like answering any questions about Kevin's wedding.
Yeah, can I take a look?
Sure.
Wow.
Jesus, that's some O'Hara shit.
Yeah, I have to keep the tag on so I can return it afterwards.
No, don't do that.
You deserve nice things.
Or something, I don't know.
Pretend I know what I'm talking about and keep it.
(Laughs) Okay.
You've done a lot of good lately, Jackie.
You can tell Akalitus.
She's implying I had something to do with Carrie's DEA number bullshit.
Mm, well, makes sense.
I'm not saying she's right.
I'm saying history's history, right?
History.
Fuck you.
Her heart rate is really irregular.
- Has she been out the whole time?
- In and out.
For someone who wants to be dead, she's still pretty alive.
I heard that.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay.
Who are all these people?
These are all the women who work here in the ER.
Sisters.
Okay, um, I do know that this is about, like, standing here and being present for a minute, but, um... yeah, I need to say something.
We're not saying anything.
It's not that kind of a thing.
I hate nuns.
- And, um...
- (Laughs) nuns hate me.
They ruined, like, 80% of my childhood.
But, Helen, I don't hate you.
(Sighs) I wish you peace.
Don't call me Helen.
Helen is my religious name.
What's... what's your real name?
My real name is Nancy.
What?
My name is Nancy.
Nancy Wood.
Fucking God damn you.
All you nuns are always fucking out to get me, no matter what I do.
I have a lot of sex and I'm not a bad person.
- You are a fucking bad person.
- Let's just move it along.
Can you press the little button?
(Exhales)
Heh.
- Hello.
- Jackie, I'm sorry.
I can't say I would've ever suspected a nun.
- Former nun.
- Clearly, but I'm still sorry.
No, nothing to be sorry about.
We're just doing our jobs, right?
(Capsule clatters)
(Snorting)
(Snorting)
(Sighs)
(Chuckles)
(Sighs)
- Hi there.
- Hey.
I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be a bitch, but I've been here for a really long time.
Oh, my God, you have.
Hey, Zoey.
Sorry, the lab was backed up.
Sorry, blood work just came back elevated.
Luckily, Dr. Roman anticipated that.
We have her orders.
We'll get you started on some insulin and get you outta here.
- Helen's sleeping?
- Oh, you mean Nancy?
That was crazy.
Carrie was crazy.
Yeah, how about Akalitus?
That woman is never speechless.
What the fuck?
What just happened?
What did you do?
What did you give her?
I gave her the insulin Dr. Roman prescribed.
Dr. Roman ordered eight units, not 800.
Uh...
Ah. (Sniffs)
No, don't touch that.
Move.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
You passed out there for a minute.
I did?
Yeah, we needed to offset your insulin levels with some glucose.
- How are you feeling now?
- Um, better, thanks.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
I know that was stressful.
Luckily, I was with the most competent nurse on the floor.
Yeah, I've never seen you do that before.
You've seen me make mistakes.
Was it something else?
Yeah, is this... do you need to go to a meeting?
Do...
I go to meetings every day, Zoey.
Kevin is getting married tonight, so if you notice anything different about today, that's what it is, okay?
Okay.
You should get going 'cause showing up late to your ex-husband's wedding is probably a bad idea.
Yeah. (Chuckles)
Thank you again for the letter.
Yeah, don't mention it.
I'm Dr. Carrie Roman.
We see disasters strike every day here at the emergency department of All Saints, but what happens when a real natural disaster strikes our coast?
We'll tell you what you need, what you don't need, what is really important, and what isn't.
Thor, as one of our most reliable nurses, can you tell me, does Reuben follow your lead when it comes to disaster preparedness?
Reuben is very prepared and safety oriented.
My boyfriend, Dr. Fitch Cooper, told me that married couples who take the time to make sure they have supplies for a few days of survival are not only more likely to stay safe, they're also less likely to get divorced.
Now, oh, here are some easy supplies to have on hand that might save your life.
- (Elevator whirring) - (Chattering)
(Piano music playing)
(Heels echoing)
(Music playing)
Hi, sweetie.
You're doing great.
Just keep going.
- Come with me.
- I'll be right here, honey.
You just keep going.
Will you walk with me?
Everyone else has a partner.
I know, but, honey, you're special.
That's why you get to go up there by yourself.
Please.
Please, Mommy.
Okay, let's go.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry, she was... okay.

This music sucks.
Thanks for coming with me.
Yeah, I think it was kind of weird for my dad, me going with you, but whatever.
This whole night is weird.
Oh, my God.
I know that guy.
- Tommy:
What guy?
- The guy with the beard.
Seriously, I think he sold my friend drugs at a party.
Awesome.
So, is he a friend of your stepmom?
I don't know.
What the fuck?
(Song fades)
(Rings)
What's up, G?
How's the wedding?
(Laughs)
Hey, calm down.
Where are you?
Grace, find a place where I can hear what you're saying, okay?
Guess what?
We're having dinner with my moms tonight.
- How was your segment?
- Don't be mad.
I'm not mad.
I can't skulk around and be a secret couple.
I just wanna be comfortable and move fast.
- Like the gays.
- Okay...
I think they can appreciate that.
- So, what do we do?
- We do this.
I'm chief, I'm 40.
We're dating.
- Fuck.
- Fuck!
I gotta go change my shirt.
My mom hates this one.
Ahem.
It was just a minute ago if you want to call time of death.
(Sighs) You okay?
Yeah, I just...
I need to put this whole Nancy Wood thing behind me.
Where are her personal effects?
One cross... a pack of cigarettes... one ID.
(Voice echoing) Look, I know you cared about her, but I need this.
This nun is an asshole.
You can do whatever you want with the rest of her stuff, but I'm taking this to Akalitus.
It's going to the DEA.
(Bag rustling)
(Music playing)
You look unreal.
Really.
- Also, I have coke.
- Oh, no, I am good.
Believe me.
It's your big night, lady.
Anything you want, you just let me know.
Oh, you are the perfect date for this wedding.
Aw, I know.
I am definitely too old for this tradition, but I sort of love everybody handing me cash.
- (Laughs)
- You are...
- new.
- Yeah, man.
I'm Gabe.
- Hey, Gabe.
- This is a rad wedding.
Oh, I didn't get you a present, but I did bring this.
- Oh, there you go.
- (Laughs)
So, are you guys having a good time?
We are, yeah.
You look beautiful.
- Oh, thank you, Jackie.
- (Laughing)
This must be so fucking weird for you.
You were married to that guy and now you're at his wedding.
Hi, Grace.
Where have you been?
Uh, here.
Gracie, this is my friend Gabe.
What's up, Gracie?
Hi, yeah, we've met.
- We're meeting right now.
- Where's Tommy?
He's been trying to get someone to serve him a beer for, like, an hour.
He can't drink, honey.
Nobody's gonna serve him.
Why don't you get him a drink?
You're cool.
I am cool, but I don't get drinks for underage kids.
Really, that's weird because you sold my friend drugs.
What?
I was at a party in Bushwick.
You know that loft with all the graffiti?
- Dude, that could be anywhere.
- He sells drugs, right?
You brought a drug dealer to Dad's wedding?
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's not, like, my title.
Come over here.
You sell drugs to kids?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Oh, come on.
- No, no, you got to go.
- Jackie, just relax.
- No, that's my daughter.
- She's 15.
- She doesn't look 15, seriously.
You go to one of these parties, and we all look the same age.
You'd love it.
No, no, that's a kid.
That's what a kid looks like, you asshole.
Come on, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Listen, I grew up here, okay?
15 isn't 15 anymore.
Now, come on, we just need to have a little fun.
- Get your fucking hands off me.
- (Glasses shatter)
Oh.
Don't touch the suit, dude.
Hey.
Hey.
I think you need to leave.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, man.
Happy wedding.
I think you need to leave, too.
Jackie, I want you to leave.
Now.
(Quiet chattering)
(Knocks)
What can I do for you, Zoey?
We need to talk about Jackie.
Previously on Nurse Jackie-
Nancy Wood.

Gloria, how big of an asshole do you think I am?
I'll let you know when I find Nancy Wood.
What's wrong?
You look like somethings wrong.
- Can I help you?
- No.
Don't worry about me.
Please.
It might be the last thing I do.
I need you to rest.
I need to show you how to use this so you're not in pain, okay?
Oh, good.
- So there's nobody I can call?
- Nah.
There used to be people.
When I was pan of the order...
I had 65 sisters.
Now there's just you.
Well, I'm here all day, okay?
You've done so much for me.
I wish there was a way I could repay you.
Angel.
"Her empathy is matched only by her attention to detail.
I have never seen a nurse more able to focus... on what really matters when it comes to her patients."
- Really?
- Stop quoting me to me.
Okay.
Is that Helen's chart?
Yeah.
She's resting now.
I'm just trying to stay close.
God, I thought we helped her.
She looked a lot better when she left here last time.
- Remember the picture you took?
- Oh, yeah.
- Wow, look at that.
- I know.
- Can you send that to me?
- Of course.
I can stay here tonight.
I know you have Kevin's wedding.
Oh, God, I still have to buy shoes.
You don't have shoes?
Go!
I'll be here just in case she wakes up.
Great, thank you.
Knock-knock.
Do you look even better than usual?
I hope so.
I've got a segment today.
So lots of mascara.
Oh, my God, you know what we should do tonight?
- I just can't stop thinking about it.
- What?
What should we do?
- Something we haven't done before?
- Yep, yep.
We should, um- We should have dinner with your moms.
What I want to do is way more fun.
Dude, moms love me.
Carrie...
I'm not introducing you to my moms... until I know this is definitely something real.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize that you were fucking... a pretend vagina every night.
They're my moms.
- lt's a big step.
- I'm ready for that.
Wow, okay.
Uh, do they even know I exist?
Yeah, of course they do.
They know all about you.
Oh, God.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Can you put this in the back room?
I don't feel like answering any questions about Kevin's wedding.
Yeah, can I, uh, take a look?
Sure.
Wow.
Jesus, that's some O'Hara shit.
Yeah, I have to keep the tag on so I can return it afterwards.
No, don't do that.
You deserve nice things.
Or something.
I don't know.
Pretend I know what I'm talking about and keep it.
Okay.
You've done a lot of good lately, Jackie.
You can tell Akalitus.
She's implying I had something to do... with Carrie's D.E.A. number bullshit.
Hmm.
Well, makes sense.
I'm not saying she's right.
I'm saying history's history, right?
History.
Fuck you.
Her heart rate is really irregular.
- Has she been out the whole time?
- In and out.
For someone who wants to be dead, she's still pretty alive.
I heard that.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay.
Who are all these people?
These are all the women who work here in the E.R.
Sisters.
Okay, um, I do know that this is about, like... standing here and being present for a minute... but, um... yeah, I need to say something.
We're not saying anything.
It's not that kind of a thing.
I hate nuns.
And, um-
Nuns hate me.
They
- They ruined, like, 80% of my childhood.
But, Helen, I don't hate you.
I wish you peace.
Don't call me Helen.
Helen is my religious name.
What's
- What's your real name?
My real name is Nancy.
What?
My name is Nancy.
Nancy Wood.
Fucking goddamn you.
All you nuns are always fucking out to get me, no matter what I do.
I have a lot of sex, and I'm not a bad person.
- You are a fucking bad person.
- Let's just move it along.
Can you press the little button?
Heh.
- Hello.
- Jackie, I'm sorry.
I can't say I would've ever suspected a nun.
- Former nun.
- Clearly, but I'm still sorry.
No, nothing to be sorry about.
We're just doing our jobs, right?
- Hi there.
- Hey.
I'm sorry.
L'm not trying to be a bitch, but I've been here for a long time.
Oh, my God, you have.
Hey, Zoey.
Sorry, the lab was backed up.
Sorry, blood work just came back elevated.
Luckily, Dr. Roman anticipated that.
We have her orders.
We'll get you started... on some insulin and get you outta here.
- Helen's sleeping?
- Oh, you mean Nancy?
That was crazy.
Carrie was crazy.
Yeah, how about Akalitus?
That woman is never speechless.
- What the fuck?
What happened?
- What did you do?
What did you give her?
Thought I gave her the insulin Dr. Roman prescribed.
Dr. Roman ordered eight units, not 800.
Oh.
Ah.
No, don't touch that.
Move.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
Shit.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
You passed out there for a minute.
I did?
Yeah, we needed to offset your insulin levels with some glucose.
- How are you feeling now?
- Um, better, thanks.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
I know that was stressful.
Luckily, I was with the most competent nurse on the floor.
Yeah, I've never seen you do that before.
You've seen me make mistakes.
What, is it something else?
Yeah, is this- do you need to go to a meeting?
Do- I go to meetings every day, Zoey.
Kevin is getting married tonight... so if you notice anything different about today, that's what it is, okay'?
Okay.
You should get going 'cause showing up late... to your ex-husband's wedding is probably a bad idea.
Yeah.
Thank you again for the letter.
Yeah, don't mention it.
I'm Dr. Carrie Roman.
We see disasters strike every day... here at the emergency department of All Saints... but what happens when a real natural disaster strikes our coast?
We'll tell you what you need, what you don't need... what is really important, and what isn't.
Thor, as one of our most reliable nurses... can you tell me, does Reuben follow your lead... when it comes to disaster preparedness?
Reuben is very prepared and safety oriented.
My boyfriend, um, Dr. Fitch Cooper... told me that married couples who take the time... to make sure they have supplies... for a few days of survival... are not only more likely to stay safe... they're also less likely to get divorced.
Now
- Oh, here are some easy supplies to have on hand... that might save your life.
Hi, sweetie.
You're doing great.
Just keep going.
- Come with me.
- I'll be right here, honey.
You just keep going.
Will you walk with me?
Everyone else has a partner.
I know.
But, honey, you're special.
- That's why you get to go up there by yourself.
- Please.

- What guy?
- The guy with the beard.
Seriously, I think he sold my friend drugs at a party.
- Awesome.
So is he a friend of your stepmom?
- I don't know.
What the fuck?
What's up, G?
How's the wedding?
Hey, calm down.
Where are you?
Grace, find a place where I can hear what you're saying, okay?
Guess what.
We're having dinner with my moms tonight.
- How was your segment?
- Don't be mad.
I'm not mad.
I can't skulk around and be a secret couple.
I just wanna be comfortable and move fast.
- Like the gays.
- Okay.
I think they can appreciate that.
- So, what do we do?
- We do this.
I'm chief, I'm 40.
We're dating.
Fuck.
I gotta go change my shirt.
My mom hates this one.
It was just a minute ago, if you want to call time of death.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I just-
I need to put this whole Nancy Wood thing behind me.
Where are her personal effects?
One cross... one pack of cigarettes... one I.D.
Look, I know you cared about her, but I need this.
This nun is an asshole.
You can do whatever you want with the rest of her stuff... but I'm taking this to Akalitus.
It's going to the D.E.A.
- Also, I have coke.
- Oh, no, I am good.
Believe me.
It's your big night, lady.
Anything you want, let me know.
- Oh, you are the perfect date for this wedding.
- Aw, I know.
I am definitely too old for this tradition... but I sort of love everybody handing me cash.
You are... new.
Yeah, man.
I'm Gabe.
- Hey, Gabe.
- This is a rad wedding.
Oh, I, uh
- I didn't get you a present... but I did bring this.
Oh, there you go.
So, are you guys having a good time?
We are, yeah.
You look beautiful.
Oh, thank you, Jackie.
This must be so fucking weird for you.
You were married to that guy and now you're at his wedding.
Hi, Grace.
Where have you been?
Uh, here.
Gracie, this is my friend Gabe.
- What's up, Gracie?
- Hi, yeah, we've met.
- We're meeting right now.
- Where's Tommy?
He's been trying to get someone to serve him a beer for, like, an hour.
He can't drink, honey.
Nobody's gonna serve him.
Why don't you get him a drink?
You're cool.
I am cool, but I don't get drinks for underage kids.
Really, that's weird because you sold my friend drugs.
- What?
- I was at a party in Bushwick.
You know that loft with all the graffiti?
- Dude, that could be anywhere.
- He sells drugs, right?
You brought a drug dealer to Dads wedding?
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's not, like, my title.
You sell drugs to kids?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Oh, come on.
- No, no.
You gotta go.
- Jackie, just relax.
- No, that's my daughter.
- She's 15.
- She doesn't look 15, seriously.
You go to these parties, and we all look the same age.
You'd love it.
No, no, that's a kid.
That's what a kid looks like, you asshole.
Come on, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Listen, I grew up here, okay?
Fifteen isn't 15 anymore.
Now, come on, we just need to have a little fun.
Get your fucking hands off me.
Oh.
Are you okay?
- Don't touch the suit, dude.
- Hey.
Hey.
- I think you need to leave.
- Yeah.
Yeah, sure, man.
Happy wedding.
I think you need to leave too.
Jackie, I want you to leave.
Now.
What can I do for you, Zoey?
We need to talk about Jackie.
[ Jackie ] Previously on Nurse Jackie-
[ Gloria ] Nancy Wood.
Does that name ring a bell?
That's the patient who stole Carrie's D.E.A. number.
WASQ wants me... to do medical segments from the hospital.
I get a prescription for pain medication from Coop and you administer it.
- It says here you got a prescription yesterday.
- Yes.
Well, then it seems a little surprising... that your urine analysis came back clean.
Should I go back to school and get a master's degree?
I think it's a great idea, Zoey.
Good, because I wanted to ask... if you'd write me a recommendation.
[ Snorts, Sighs ]
You look great.
I'm having dinner with my ex-husband and his new fiancée.
Want me to come with, make him jealous?
We can't have sex in your office.
I don't want to have sex in your office.
It's, like- lt's more than that.
- Jackie Peyton, these are my boys.
- Hey, Mrs. Peyton.
Your boys cannot be at my house.
Wow.
You're gonna choose the drugs over us.

I want you out of my house.

And I will absolutely lei you know if I change my mind, okay?
Great.
Thanks so much for your time.
Okay.
Given the destruction from Hurricane Penny in Florida... it's important to remain prepared... if disaster strikes our coastline again.
Establish a family phone tree.
That way everyone can check in with someone in an unaffected area.

Yes, they will.
Dr. Roman, this is Anna, type 1 diabetic.
Hey, my blood sugar's really out of whack and I couldn't regulate it.
Uh, you're smart to come in.
Let's run a panel, and if her levels are elevated...
I want eight units of regular insulin intravenously.
Hey, I need Jackie.
Oh, yeah.
She's fine, go ahead.
- One, two, three.
- What've we got?
Multiple lacerations on the forehead and extremities.
Female, 50, she was hit by a cab.
Oh, Jesus, Helen.
Shit, there's bruising on the chest wall.
- Let's get a 12-lead E.K.G. and a blood panel.
- Got it.
The cab didn't hit me.
I stepped in front of him.
I don't want that poor guy getting arrested.
- Okay.
- What the hell is all this?
Uh, we need to find out if you've injured your heart and lungs.
- Let's hope so.
- Why don't we sedate her so she stops talking?
- What is your problem?
- She's been in here before.
- Yes, she has.
-I don't like saving people who don't want to live.
You look awful.
Yeah, Helen's back.
Sounds like she might get what she wants after all.
Yeah, she has a cardiac contusion.
With her history, she's probably not gonna make it.
L'm very sorry.
Well, we're gonna keep her comfortable.
It's rough everywhere today.
Three people got fired after those drug screenings came back.
They found Nancy Wood?
They found two radiologists who were smoking weed... and a security guard with a coke problem.
And I've got the D.E.A. on my ass... because of my prescription for your pills.
Gloria, if it helps you, I will pee in a cup right now.
And your test will come up positive... because I've been the one handing you pills every day, so... my hands are neatly tied, aren't they?

- I didn't get you a present... but I did bring this.
- Oh, there you go.
- [ Laughs ]
So, are you guys having a good time?
We are, yeah.
You look beautiful.
- Oh, thank you, Jackie.
- [ Laughing ]
This must be so fucking weird for you.
You were married to that guy and now you're at his wedding.
Hi, Grace.
Where have you been?
Uh, here.
Gracie, this is my friend Gabe.
- What's up, Gracie?
- Hi, yeah, we've met.
- We're meeting right now.
- Where's Tommy?
He's been trying to get someone to serve him a beer for, like, an hour.
He can't drink, honey.
Nobody's gonna serve him.
Why don't you get him a drink?
You're cool.
I am cool, but I don't get drinks for underage kids.
Really, that's weird because you sold my friend drugs.
- What?
- I was at a party in Bushwick.
You know that loft with all the graffiti?
- Dude, that could be anywhere.
- He sells drugs, right?
You brought a drug dealer to Dads wedding?
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's not, like, my title.
[ Muttering ]
You sell drugs to kids?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Oh, come on.
- No, no.
You gotta go.
- Jackie, just relax.
- No, that's my daughter.
- She's 15.
- She doesn't look 15, seriously.
You go to these parties, and we all look the same age.
You'd love it.
No, no, that's a kid.
That's what a kid looks like, you asshole.
Come on, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Listen, I grew up here, okay?
Fifteen isn't 15 anymore.
Now, come on, we just need to have a little fun.
- Get your fucking hands off me.
- [ Glasses Shatter ]
Oh.
- [ Crowd Murmurs ] - [ Woman ]Are you okay?
- Don't touch the suit, dude.
- Hey.
[ Kevin ] Hey.
- I think you need to leave.
- Yeah.
Yeah, sure, man.
Happy wedding.
- [ Sighs ] - [ Scoffs ]
I think you need to leave too.
Jackie, I want you to leave.
Now.
[ Quiet Chattering ]
What can I do for you, Zoey?
We need to talk about Jackie.

Meredith:
On an operating table, a person is at his most vulnerable...
naked, exposed.
I do not need another sister.
- Get out.
- I mean, she's a lying liar.
I would know if my mother were pregnant when I was 5.
My mother was not pregnant when I was 5.
- Get out.
- She's, like, psycho, like a stalker.
I'm being stalked.
Alex, this is criminal.
I mean, you...
- what's your problem?
- Get out!
I'm naked here!
Okay, so what?
I've seen it before!
No big deal!
I'm in crisis!
Okay, fine.
It's... your junk is spectacular.
Jo is a very lucky girl.
Can we get back to me now?
Why are you making that face?
Mer, I realize that I said I would take over as your person.
Maybe that means I have to buy your tampons and act like your husband's hair is special and crap.
But I have a very important presentation to make to the board today to get a job, which I need because I got fired by Dr. Butthole!
I have been practicing all night.
I am sleep-deprived.
I need to shower... alone... and focus!
- You didn't even hear what I said!
- No.
And I don't care.
The new cardio chief thinks she's my biological sister.
She what?
Wait.
What?
!
That's insane.
Thank you.
He's in the shower, and she's in the bathroom with him while he's in the shower.
So, go in there with them.
[Chuckling] No!
I am not going in there.
You're the girlfriend.
No.
Yeah, I am, but I'm not.
They're this little team together.
They are war buddies, and I don't fit.
And then they look at me...
well, she looks at me... like I'm just the stupid, naked girl in Alex's bed.
So go be the stupid, naked girl in Alex's shower.
I am a doctor.
I am a surgeon.
I deserve respect.
You're a girl in her pajamas with her ear to the door of a bathroom.
How much respect can anyone give you right now?
She stole my Alex.
You know what?
I miss Cristina Yang.
When Cristina Yang was here, nobody stole my Alex.
Oh, my God.
You're scared of Meredith Grey.
- [Gasps] No, I'm not.
Are you?
- No.
Hey.
Hi, Dr. Grey.
Tell Alex I'll be downstairs.
And if anybody asks you, I am sick.

Callie:
Okay, I'm only here to give a speech on residual limb health, and that is it.
That is it.
Uh, yeah, I got to pull back, okay?
We have a kid.
Arizona is starting a fellowship.
We're trying to have another kid.
I am stretched out far too thin.
I completely understand.
I said no already.
I know that.
You're just gonna meet a couple guys.
Come on.
[Indistinct conversations]
[Sighs] Navy seals, green berets, army rangers.
Wounded warriors from the most badass specialized ops forces in the U.S. military.
But... [Sighs] you're too busy to help our nation's heroes, so...
I do not like you.
[Chuckles]
Then I directed the RFA needle to where the blood supply entered the abnormal parabiotic tissue mass.
To interrupt the blood flow to the abnormal fetus.
Yes.
Then I removed excess amniotic fluid.
Nice.
And then she delivered full-term?
She did... months after I completed the operation that I'm telling you about.
Why are you not taking notes?
Oh.
Sorry.
I thought we were just, you know, talking.
[Chuckles] And I thought you were my fellow.
I am... completely.
[Chuckling] No, I'm so excited to be your fellow.
I just need a little...
little time to get up to speed, you know, like four... three... three weeks.
Yeah, 'cause I have a lot of cases on my...
Dr. Robbins, for the purposes of this fellowship, we are not peers.
And four weeks is 10% of the average gestational age.
In that amount of time, a fetus's lungs become a fully functioning organ.
Everything in utero happens at hyper speed.
And the sooner you get up to that speed, the better.
Get a notepad.
Avery, um, I've got a backlog of some cases.
Amy's doing a great job, but there's some stuff I got to get on top of.
So, you need help?
I need you to reschedule this meeting for tonight.
No.
Oh, are we rescheduling the meeting?
Oh, thank God, because Callie and I have an appointment tonight, and apparently, I've already started my fellowship.
We are not rescheduling the meeting.
- Tomorrow work for you?
- No, tomorrow's bad.
Um, Thursday?
Listen to me speak, all right?
We are voting on a new member of the board.
It's happening tonight.
Understood?
Amelia:
Derek!
Derek, why is there suddenly an order for carbamazepine in Eric Schneider's chart?
He needed a good anti-convulsant.
And I had already written him one for valproic acid.
You can't go around writing orders on my patients.
I'm doing my job.
No, you are doing my job.
I am chief of neurosurgery.
If you have a problem with that, you should take it up with the board.
Until then, I will call you when I need you.
[Elevator bell dings]
What happened to the two diverting loop ileostomies
I had today?
You're welcome.
No, I-I-I rearranged your cases so you had the easiest day possible.
You are going up against Karev, so I figured you'd want plenty of time to practice your board presentation.
I don't need to practice.
I need my schedule back the way it was.
You sure, though?
Karev's pretty tight with some board members.
So am I.
Well, Meredith Grey was in the bathroom with Karev this morning.
- Well, not that tight.
- That's what I'm saying.
Look, Edwards... [Sighs]
I am going to walk in there and tell the truth.
I deserve this.
And if any one of them has the misguided impression that there is any choice at all in this matter,
I will set that person on the righteous path before he or she can reveal him- or herself as a moron.
[Cellphone chimes, vibrates]
Oh.
Pileup on I-5.
Trauma coming in.
Why are they paging me?
Isn't Grey on the pit today?
She's sick.
If my mother were pregnant, I would have known.
Adoption agency made a mistake?
And randomly put the name "Ellis Grey" on a birth certificate?
I don't think so.
Pierce has got to want something.
Maybe she thinks there's money to inherit.
[Scoffs] The only thing you inherit in this family is Alzheimer's.
[Chuckles] Whoa.
Dark.
Good one, though, huh?
Yeah.
She's not my sister.
You know who you should ask about this?
The guy who was banging your mom back then.
I'm not asking Richard Webber.
All I'm saying is, he's got skin in the game.
Disgusting.
He's the only living person who would know if it's true.
Richard Webber is like a second father to me, and if he knew that I had a sister, he would tell me!

S11E03 Got to Be Real
Okay, we need to get this man on his back in less than 60 seconds.
Got to work faster.
One more inch to the right, he'd be D.O.A.
How you want to proceed?
Ultrasound's negative for fluid around the heart, so I would do a laparotomy.
Yeah?
[Coughing] [Monitors beeping rapidly]
His airway is compromised.
He needs a chest tube and intubation now.
Yeah, we're almost done here, okay?
- It'll be safer on his back.
- No, there's no time.
I'll have to go in nasally. 7-0 E.T. Tube?
Charlie, I hate to tell you this, but your day is actually about to get a little worse.
Hold the work!
Hold on, Charlie.
Hold on.
All right.
- Almost there.
- Go ahead.
[Charlie groaning]
- Okay, push 100 please.
- Pushing.
- Well done, doctor.
- Sorry?
I said it's good.
Uh, okay.
He's clear.
On his back on my count.
One... two... and three.
You want to give me a robot leg, like the Terminator?
[Chuckles] Robotic, more like the six-million-dollar man.
Uh, actually, it costs a little more than that.
But the project is fully funded, all expenses paid.
The leg will be free.
A free six-million-dollar robot leg?
[Chuckles] Listen.
I've been through three prosthetic legs.
Each one hurt more than the last.
Why is this so...
Well, the leg is entirely painless.
[Chuckles] Free, pain-free robot leg?
Sounds made up.
[Chuckles] It was made up... by Dr. Torres.
It is cutting-edge technology.
Dr. Torres is a genius.
You'll be amazed at this... [chuckling] Okay, let's just slow down for a minute.
We still have to run a number of tests to make sure you're even a candidate for the study.
[Clears throat]
But, again, the program is fully funded.
Unbelievable.
Major Hunt was right.
He's been going on and on about you.
[Chuckles] Yeah, I bet.
[Sighs]
I told him how busy I am.
He knows.
He knows my plate is full.
He just doesn't care.
I am an attending with an entire service of my own.
Herman and I have shared dozens of patients before.
Oh, and now he's just bringing this guy to my lab, right?
Like I'm gonna say no to a guy who gave up his leg for our country.
She has me reviewing journals and doing skills labs.
I have a case report that's due by 4:00.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I have a neuroblastoma to remove at 4:00.
Wait.
Is this your way of telling me that you're canceling our meeting with the surrogacy agency tonight?
What?
No!
W... no, I will...
I will figure that out.
- Okay.
- I just...
[Sighs] Say something to help me.
You own a hospital.
You are a raising a beautiful girl.
You save babies.
You're gonna save more, right?
You can do this, too.
If anyone can, you can.
[Cellphone rings] Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
Um, listen, I will meet you at the agency with a smile on my face.
And we will get ourselves a new baby.
[Chuckles] Yeah.
A.B.C.'S intact.
I need to assess his GCS.
If you'd be quiet, he's trying to talk now.
Sir, can you tell me your name?
What's your name?
- Steve.
- Forget your helmet today, Steve?
Aah.
It hurts.
I'm giving you something for the pain.
You might start to feel sleepy now.
It's a depressed skull fracture.
It is pretty deep.
We're gonna need a C.T.
And because of the position, probably an angio.
I can make that decision if you'll give me room to look.
Amy, I don't think he's gonna make it, and it's gonna get ugly, so let me do it.
Ah.
Because only you can save him now.
Screw you.
I've got him.
Maybe you can both take him...
like a team, or a family.
I have him.
Kepner, you'll assist.
Let's take him up to C.T.
The African outreach program has given 34 kids excellent outcomes and a chance they never would have had.
And it gave me something, too.
Starting that program gave me a sense of ownership and a... and a level of passion that I didn't know I could have.
I have this passion for this hospital.
I look forward to...
Mer.
Huh?
Yeah, it's great.
You're gonna vote on this.
I don't want to blow this.
And it's Bailey.
Bailey did deliver my baby and save my life.
What have you ever done?
Why aren't you at your own house, drinking and having bitch baby tears about your fake sister with your husband?
Derek doesn't know.
He doesn't know?
I can't talk to him right now.
Oh, come on.
He gave up the job in D.C.
He's staying, and you're still mad?
- You won.
- No.
I never asked him to stay.
This wasn't a compromise.
I didn't win.
He forfeited, so we both lost.
So you're not talking to him?
He's walking around like he's a martyr, waiting for me to be grateful.
I am not grateful.
My career is just as important as his!
I'm the sun.
I'm the sun.
And he can go suck it!
I'm the sun.
All right.
We're done.
Hey!
You can sit here and get drunk and then vomit and cry, and I can never get any prep for my presentation done, or we can do something about this.
You want to do something about this?
Jeff:
It's so light.
[Chuckles]
It's a 100% titanium body d sensors.
But before we can get you in a leg like this, we need your muscles and nerves to interface with the sensors.
So, this electromyogram will show spikes when your muscles contract and then go flat when they rest, okay?
All right.
Go ahead and flex for me, Jeff.
When this is done, I get to keep it?
Well, it's all funded, including follow-up, so...
Yes. [Chuckles]
Sorry.
I-I know how that sounds.
It's just, all I wanted was to be a ranger, you know?
I still dream about it all the time... pack on my back, running, my team.
Then I wake up and get out of bed.
I try to stand, and I forget about it.
So, you know, when you say "free robot leg,"
I think I'm still dreaming of running with the guys.
- Jeff, are you still flexing?
- Yeah.
- Take a picture of it?
- Yeah.
My mom is gonna freak.
Jeff, flex harder for me.
What?
I should be seeing readings.
What... what's going on?
Uh, w-we're just having trouble with the E.M.G.
No, no. [Chuckles] It's not the E.M.G.
- Jeff, I'm...
- Dr. Torres, can talk to you for a moment?
Excuse us, Jeff.
That was inappropriate.
Inappropriate?
You were about to reject him from the study.
Yes.
You saw those readings.
Look, the way his amputation was performed, there's no way this will work.
Okay, it's a crappy amputation, Owen.
Probably because it was done in less-than-ideal circumstances.
- He is a soldier, Callie.
- I know that, okay?
I feel bad about that, all right?
I care about that.
I really do.
You know who doesn't care?
You know who doesn't give a damn about his service?
The robot leg.
All the robot cares about is that the nerves in his leg aren't communicating with his muscles, which means they can't communicate with the sensors in the prosthesis, which means the robot leg won't work.
Then you can find a way to help him.
Just... just figure it out.
I'm sorry.
Are you not listening to me, Owen?
Are you deliberately being obtuse?
I just told you his nerves...
Just fix it.
Just get back in there...
- I just told you I can't!
- Fix it!
That is an order!
[Chuckling] Oh, an order?
- Who... who are you...
General Patton?
- I'm your chief of surgery.
On the surgical floor, you e my chief.
In my lab, funded by the money that I procured, I am in charge!
- Are we clear?
!
- No, you don't get these guys' hopes up and then leave them with nothing!
No, no, no.
No, I didn't do that, Owen.
You did that.
You're the one out there running your mouth at the rehab center about "free, pain-free six-million-dollar man robot legs!"
I'm about to go in there and crush his dreams because of you!
[Sighs]
Richard:
We're gonna pull on my count.
We ready?
One...
Two...
Three.
Easy.
Easy.
[Monitors beeping]
Okay, Kelly clamp.
- Bailey:
Apply pressure.
- Stephanie:
Got it.
Richard:
More suction.
I need to see or feel.
- Okay.
- Whoa.
That's got to be the fastest splenectomy I've ever seen.
Yeah, this isn't my first rodeo.
I'm hope I'm that fast someday.
You will be.
In about 4,000 rodeos.

You can write me up all you want for insubordination, but I stand by the fact that I do not take orders regarding my own lab.
And Hunt can kiss my...
I'm not asking you to take orders in your own lab.
What I'm asking is maybe that you not have a screaming match in the middle of the hallways of the hospital, because when members of the board cause a scene,
I have to stop practicing medicine, which I love doing, and become a hall monitor, which I don't really love doing.
I got to come down here and lecture you about responsibility and honor and crap I really don't want to be lecturing you about.
You know, I'm down to three procedures a day, okay?
If I'm lucky.
Not even long procedures.
I'm sucking fat, lifting boobs, butts.
Butt implants are huge.
[Sighs] I just want a good, intense, smart surgery.
You know, like, uh, the ones where your feet hurt, when your feet hurt because you've been on them for hours.
Or your mind hurts because you've had to improvise and paint... surgeries of joy.
But no, I can't have those, 'cause I run the board.
Hmm.
Grey calls in sick.
Your wife tries to give up peds surgery on me.
And boy Shepherd's in a pissing match with girl Shepherd, which they won't admit.
And Yang screws us with Bailey versus Karev.
And I think Richard has the hots for the new cardio God,
Maggie or whatever?
Which is gross, 'cause she is 12.
So, now you and Hunt are running around screaming at each other?
I don't get to be a surgeon.
I'm a hall monitor.
I will stop screaming in the hallways.
[Sighs]
All right, what's wrong?
Hunt's got this bug up his butt about a candidate for my robotic limb project and as much as he want it to happened those nerves are not communicate with those muscles.
And there is nothing I can do about it.
I can.
Targeted muscle reinnervation.
I create an alternate traffic route for the nerve signals.
It's like, um, if there's construction on the highway, you pick a side street, right?
I can dissect a nerve at its current location...
- Uh-huh...
- And rewire it wherever you need it.
Sh.
Connection established.
[Chuckles]
You are wasted as a hall monitor.
I know!
[Laughs]
Well...
I am done here.
Lung crisis averted.
Okay.
Partial gastrectomy and splenectomy done.
We can start the diaphragm repair.
This was, I have to say, the most fun I have had since I got here.
Well, you've done some very good work.
Me?
You... that was amazing.
What was that... a-a 15-second splenectomy?
Well, 20.
18.

Well, it was inspiring.
I'm glad I was here.

Dr. Robbins, in fetal surgery, every patient you treat will come encased in a mother... a mother whose heightened state of concern is a biological and evolutionary necessity.
If you lack the basic skills to...
No, I don't.
I don't.
No.
No.
Huh-unh. [Chuckles]
Moms are kind of like my thing.
I'm great with moms.
I actually teach other people how to be great with moms.
Yeah, no, you can ask anyone.

So I just thought...
I just thought...
Maybe to beat back that darkness,
I would...
I would do some good.
I'd just... do something good.
I'd go be with those guys who'd remind me...
[Sighs] I just need something to be good.
That's why I dragged you to that rehab center.
That's why I, um...
[Clears throat, sniffles]
Wanted you to help.
That's why I pushed too hard, and t-that's it.
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore, okay?
So just... just say that we're okay, okay?
Okay.
- Great.
- Owen?
For God's sakes, Callie.
No, I just...
I was just gonna ask if you wanted to...
I was just gonna ask if you wanted to watch Jeff's surgery.
Jackson's doing a little targeted muscle reinnervation.
He's moving the nerves to where they can talk to the robot sensors.
[Chuckle]
Want to watch?
How's our motorcycle guy?
My motorcycle guy?
I fixed him, like a boss.
Like your boss, actually.
Amy, you're an excellent surgeon.
You have nothing to prove.
Oh, I know I don't.
But if you try and fight me over the leadership of this department, you will lose.
My resume will kick your resume's ass.
I am better than you.
Oh, my God, Derek.
- There is no limit to your narcissist...
- I have been playing this game longer than you at a much higher level.
That is all there is to it.
[Chuckles] Bite me.
[Sighs deeply]
Where did she go?
Dr. Shepherd?
- I'm Dr. Shepherd.
- Yeah, I-I know.
Ms. Dr. Shepherd.
- Her post-op C.T.S are back.
- Let me see them.
I...shouldn't.
Kepner, I am Dr. Shepherd.
Uh...
So, we repaired the subdural bleed, but...
That is a big aneurysm.
Yeah.
It's grown.
It's way bigger than it was before.
- Okay, book an O.R. and scrub in.
- Okay.
I'll let her know.
No, with me, Kepner.
You're gonna scrub in with me.
- [Chuckling] It's her patient.
- Well, it just got too big for her.
Tell her or don't tell her.
Just prep an O.R. and scrub in.
Okay.
So, now what are you gonna do?
Go talk to her?
Well, I called Richard, and he's coming over.
Is that okay?
Yeah, sure.
It's just, you know...
We've got this board meeting thing, and I don't want to rush you, but I got to go get ready, and you got to be at this meeting, too.
Alex, you're prepared.
Your speech is great.
- Why are you so...
- Because I want this, Mer.
You know?
I don't just need a job.
Yang thought I could do something bigger, and for the first time, I feel like I can, too.
You know, I-I feel like I should really...
[Sighs] Like I have something to offer.
And I'm scared to death, and I don't want it to go like crap, all right?
[Knock on door]
Take all the time you need.
[Footsteps depart]
Thank you.
When did you know?
I found out the night I met Maggie Pierce.
You didn't know?
Ellis didn't tell you?
Believe me, don't you think...
When Pierce asked about your mother,
I felt like I was being hit by a car.
And when she asked about you...
I...
When was that?
The night of the mass casualty... the mall explosion.
That was a week ago.
So, you knew I had a sister and you had a daughter, and you didn't tell me?
- You didn't tell her.
- I tried.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Don't you think I want to?
I tried.
I tried again today.
Well, when are you planning on doing it?
I would have liked to do it 30 years ago!
I would like to have been a father!
To know my child!
To have a say!
But your mother stole that chance from me.
Gown and glove me.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you!
Derek:
Suction.
Amy, you don't have to scrub in.
I want to be sterile when I come over there and stick that bovie in your eye.
- Kepner, move!
You're on my list.
- You have put me in an awful position.
Amy, he never had a good prognosis.
I went endovascularly to fix the aneurysm,
- but he starting re-bleeding.
- I can see that.
Fibrin glue.
Now, why is that suction not working?
Okay, can somebody change the canister?
Man:
Got it.
[Monitors beeping rapidly] Amy...
I see it.
100 of Mannitol, 125 of Solu-Medrol.
- He's gonna herniate.
- He may not have time to herniate!
He's in florid D.I.C. He's not clotting anymore.
Knox, check his pupils.
Dr. Knox:
Fixed and dilated.
There's no gag reflex.
[Instruments clatter]
He's probably already brain-dead.
[Beeping continues]
The next thing I heard, she had moved you to Boston.
She never said a thing to me about being pregnant.
I had no choice in the matter.
I...
She knew, and... and she left.
I'm sorry.
It's just...
We had an amazing day today.
And she's someone I'd very much like to know.
So, she came here looking for answers about her biological mother.
You are her answer.
You have to tell her.
Don't make her wait.
I mean, Ellis made the decision for you.
Don't do that to Pierce.
[Monitor beeping]
So, you're re-routing the deep peroneal with the biceps femoris?
Exactly.
You know, if you made this process part of the initial amputation, you could cut out the second surgery altogether.
Huh.
Yeah.
Add... what...
2, 3 minutes to the initial surgery?
That could make a world of difference.
That's a great idea, actually.
Thanks.
Avery, did I mention that Hunt and I are starting a special project with veterans?
- We are?
- We are.
We are taking a chunk of my research money and focusing it on prosthetics for vets... free, pain-free, right?
Right.
Right.
That sounds great.
That is good for the hospital.
Good work, guys.
You want in?
I mean, unless you're too busy with butt implants, hall monitoring.
Yeah, well, I guess you would benefit from having a good plastics guy who knows nerves.
Ew.
Ew.
That was so weak.
Did you see him trying to pretend he already had friends on the playground?
Yeah, don't pretend that you have friends on the playground.
Aw.
He tried to be cool.
Don't try to be cool.
It's sad.
Don't try to be cool.
Shut up.
[Laughs]
[Siren walls]
Adding on this reinnervation, it revolutionizes the whole thing.
I mean, the potential for control these patients can have is... is... [laughs] It's incredible.
I mean, I could change the way the world does amputations.
Sounds like you really want to do this.
I-I do.
[Both laugh] I do!
And I know it'll take so much time, and... and we'll be stretched so, so thin.
- But I really think that...
- So, wait.
So, are you saying that maybe we should wait on this baby?
What?
No.
No, no.
Why would you say that?
No.
Because you just said it was gonna be too much to juggle.
And you're supposed to say, "it's not a problem.
"You can do it, Callie.
We can do it all."
You're... you're supposed to support me the way that I've been supporting you ever since you decided you needed to start this fellowship.
But what if we can't?
I mean, what if we can't do anything and everything?
Are you saying you don't want to...
Are you saying you don't want a baby?
'Cause, then, w-what are we doing here?
Why... why are we meeting with this lady who's gonna help us find someone to help us make a baby if you don't want a baby?
Don't put words in my mouth.
This was my idea.
I...
Yeah, but y-you don't want to carry it, and then I couldn't, and you still didn't want to carry it, and then we find this, and then you find something else to do.
Oh, my God.
It's so obvious.
I can't believe it.
Say it.
Just say the words.
You don't want a baby.
Hi.
35-year-old male admitted status post-ejection from a motorcycle without a helmet.
Head C.T. revealed... [sighs]
What?
I'll do the op note if you want.
You gonna steal this part, too?
Stealing?
No, I'm just trying to help.
This guy was a lost cause.
Whether he was or wasn't, he was my responsibility, and I didn't need your help, and I don't need any more of your bullying.
Bullying?
I am trying to be nice.
Look, I get it!
You were king of all neurosurgeons, right hand to the president.
And now you can't have that, so you need to be king of the hospital and kick around the peons.
You of all people should understand that this was the future of neuroscience.
I mean, this is what we would've dreamt of in med school if we'd thought it was even possible that it could be done.
Then you shouldn't have given it up.
But the least you can do is stop stomping around here punishing people for a choice you made.
I didn't make a choice.
Meredith made a choice and backed me into a corner.
And because I love my kids and I love my wife and I want to do what's best for her...
I do.
I want to give her everything.
But something like this will not come again.
This is it.
This is as high as I go.
I have never taken a step back in my career ever.
I've never felt like this before, and I feel like she forced me.
Okay, well, I know the feeling, because it is happening to me right now.
I'm...
I'm not trying to...
No, I know that you're not trying to, but you are, Derek!
You are doing it to me.
And Meredith... you say that you want her to have everything, but not if it interferes with you having your everything.
And it is not fair, and I am saying no, too, because you have to live with the choices you make.
I am trying to.
I am trying.
[Sniffles]
I know.
We're all trying.
[Sniffles]
It's just, no one wants to give up...
Or give in.
And no one should.
Right?
Hey.
Uh, time for the board meeting.
Mm.
Okay.
[Sighs] How's our masterpiece doing?
- Good.
He's good.
- Great.
You coming?
Yeah, no, I'm just gonna be a minute.
I'm, um...
Just reviewing his chart.
Want to make sure everything's perfect since they are gonna be teaching this in med schools.
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles] I know, right?
It's crazy.
Yeah.
Let's go.
I'll make sure that she gets there.
Uh, a-all right, fine.
Don't be late.
Um, a-and actually, the three of us, we should, you know, meet... get together, talk about timelines, protocol.
Yeah, I'll fill you in on the funding stuff, and we'll figure out a subject pipeline.
Okay.
You okay?
[Sniffles]
[Voice breaking] Yeah.
I just, um...
[Whimpers]
I need something to be good, too.
[Sobs]
[Sobs]
Okay. [Clears throat]
Ugh.
All right.
How sobby do I look?
[Chuckles] 1 to 10.
Mm... 6.
Uggggh. [Chuckles]
Okay. [Laughs]
So, how'd it go today?
Did Meredith help you with your speech?
Uh, not really.
If this doesn't work out, I hear radioshack's hiring.
[Chuckles] She must have helped some.
I mean, you guys were at the house together all day.
Yeah, well, she's got a lot of stuff going on.
Do I have pit stains?
What kind of stuff?
Oh, nothing.
Don't worry about it.
You sure I look okay?
Yeah.
You look great.
Dr. Karev.
Dr. Bailey.
I'll tell them you're on your way.
Pierce?
Hey!
Dr. Webber!
Did you check in on our impalement patient?
He is doing great!
I need to tell you something.
I should have told you sooner.
Okay.
Ellis Grey and I knew each other... very well.
- We had a relationship...
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Stop talking.
It's funny, but that is the first thing I thought when we first spoke and you told me that you'd known my mother.
I thought, "what if it's him?"
[Chuckling] But then you never said anything.
And then days went by, and you still never said anything, so I thought it couldn't possibly be true, because what kind of person would do something like that... would let me sit there and talk like an idiot
and never speak up?
No one decent.
No one honest.
A coward.
The only reason that you would do something like that... is if you'd known about me all along
- and never wanted me, either.
- No.
No, that's not true.
That's not...
Why should I believe you?
Why should I believe a word you say to me?
!
Well, this must've been a nightmare for you, me showing up here like this.
Don't worry... it has been worse for me.
Good night, Dr. Webber.
Meredith:
Surgeons are bred to be invulnerable.
It's very hard to lay ourselves bare.
- Hey.
How are you feeling?
- Hey.
Uh, not great.
Weird day.
You don't have a fever.
You still sick?
No, I-I wasn't sick.
- I-I'm...
I am a little drunk, though.
- You're drunk?
- Yes.
I was at Alex's...
- Okay, Meredith, you got to help me.
I-I-I-I'm trying to understand.
Okay, listen, this crazy thing is happening...
You said you had to stay here to make the most of your career.
Just listen to me.
Wait...
so, I gave up the brain mapping initiative so you can play hooky and get drunk with your friends?
This is why we're staying in Seattle?
Because we know exactly how deep some injuries can go.
♪...is a waiting game ♪
But vulnerability isn't the opposite of strength.
It's a necessary part.
♪ What if it only gets colder?
♪
We have to force ourselves to open up... to expose ourselves... to offer up everything we have... ♪ What if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage?
♪
And just pray that it's good enough.
I'm sure you did fine.
Sure are taking a long time.
Alex?
♪...is a waiting game ♪
♪ What if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage?
♪
[Sighs]
Otherwise... we'll never succeed.
Congratulations.
I...
Wait...
Karev.
Bailey.
There she is.
Hey.
Congratulations.
On an operating table, a person is at his most vulnerable...
naked, exposed.
I do not need another sister.
- Get out.
- I mean, she's a lying liar.
I would know if my mother were pregnant when I was 5.
My mother was not pregnant when I was 5.
- Get out.
- She's, like, psycho, like a stalker.
I'm being stalked.
Alex, this is criminal.
I mean, you...
- what's your problem?
- Get out!
I'm naked here!
Okay, so what?
I've seen it before!
No big deal!
I'm in crisis!
Okay, fine.
It's... your junk is spectacular.
Jo is a very lucky girl.
Can we get back to me now?
Why are you making that face?
Mer, I realize that I said I would take over as your person.
Maybe that means I have to buy your tampons and act like your husband's hair is special and crap.
But I have a very important presentation to make to the board today to get a job, which I need because I got fired by Dr. Butthole!
I have been practicing all night.
I am sleep-deprived.
I need to shower... alone... and focus!
- You didn't even hear what I said!
- No.
And I don't care.
The new cardio chief thinks she's my biological sister.
She what?
Wait.
What?
!
That's insane.
Thank you.
He's in the shower, and she's in the bathroom with him while he's in the shower.
So, go in there with them.
No!
I am not going in there.
You're the girlfriend.
No.
Yeah, I am, but I'm not.
They're this little team together.
They are war buddies, and I don't fit.
And then they look at me...
well, she looks at me... like I'm just the stupid, naked girl in Alex's bed.
So go be the stupid, naked girl in Alex's shower.
I am a doctor.
I am a surgeon.
I deserve respect.
You're a girl in her pajamas with her ear to the door of a bathroom.
How much respect can anyone give you right now?
She stole my Alex.
You know what?
I miss Cristina Yang.
When Cristina Yang was here, nobody stole my Alex.
Oh, my God.
You're scared of Meredith Grey.
- No, I'm not.
Are you?
- No.
Hey.
Hi, Dr. Grey.
Tell Alex I'll be downstairs.
And if anybody asks you, I am sick.
Skin is not a very tough armor.
It's soft, easily broken.
Okay, I'm only here to give a speech on residual limb health, and that is it.
That is it.
Uh, yeah, I got to pull back, okay?
We have a kid.
Arizona is starting a fellowship.
We're trying to have another kid.
I am stretched out far too thin.
I completely understand.
I said no already.
I know that.
You're just gonna meet a couple guys.
Come on.
Navy seals, green berets, army rangers.
Wounded warriors from the most badass specialized ops forces in the U.S. military.
But... you're too busy to help our nation's heroes, so...
I do not like you.
Then I directed the RFA needle to where the blood supply entered the abnormal parabiotic tissue mass.
To interrupt the blood flow to the abnormal fetus.
Yes.
Then I removed excess amniotic fluid.
Nice.
And then she delivered full-term?
She did... months after I completed the operation that I'm telling you about.
Why are you not taking notes?
Oh.
Sorry.
I thought we were just, you know, talking.
And I thought you were my fellow.
I am... completely.
No, I'm so excited to be your fellow.
I just need a little...
little time to get up to speed, you know, like four... three... three weeks.
Yeah, 'cause I have a lot of cases on my...
Dr. Robbins, for the purposes of this fellowship, we are not peers.
And four weeks is 10% of the average gestational age.
In that amount of time, a fetus's lungs become a fully functioning organ.
Everything in utero happens at hyper speed.
And the sooner you get up to that speed, the better.
Get a notepad.
Avery, um, I've got a backlog of some cases.
Amy's doing a great job, but there's some stuff I got to get on top of.
So, you need help?
I need you to reschedule this meeting for tonight.
No.
Oh, are we rescheduling the meeting?
Oh, thank God, because Callie and I have an appointment tonight, and apparently, I've already started my fellowship.
We are not rescheduling the meeting.
- Tomorrow work for you?
- No, tomorrow's bad.
Um, Thursday?
Listen to me speak, all right?
We are voting on a new member of the board.
It's happening tonight.
Understood?
Derek!
Derek, why is there suddenly an order for carbamazepine in Eric Schneider's chart?
He needed a good anti-convulsant.
And I had already written him one for valproic acid.
You can't go around writing orders on my patients.
I'm doing my job.
No, you are doing my job.
I am chief of neurosurgery.
If you have a problem with that, you should take it up with the board.
Until then, I will call you when I need you.
What happened to the two diverting loop ileostomies
I had today?
You're welcome.
No, I-I-I rearranged your cases so you had the easiest day possible.
You are going up against Karev, so I figured you'd want plenty of time to practice your board presentation.
I don't need to practice.
I need my schedule back the way it was.
You sure, though?
Karev's pretty tight with some board members.
So am I.
Well, Meredith Grey was in the bathroom with Karev this morning.
- Well, not that tight.
- That's what I'm saying.
Look, Edwards...
I am going to walk in there and tell the truth.
I deserve this.
And if any one of them has the misguided impression that there is any choice at all in this matter,
I will set that person on the righteous path before he or she can reveal him- or herself as a moron.
Oh.
Pileup on I-5.
Trauma coming in.
Why are they paging me?
Isn't Grey on the pit today?
She's sick.
If my mother were pregnant, I would have known.
Adoption agency made a mistake?
And randomly put the name "Ellis Grey" on a birth certificate?
I don't think so.
Pierce has got to want something.
Maybe she thinks there's money to inherit.
The only thing you inherit in this family is Alzheimer's.
Whoa.
Dark.
Good one, though, huh?
Yeah.
She's not my sister.
You know who you should ask about this?
The guy who was banging your mom back then.
I'm not asking Richard Webber.
All I'm saying is, he's got skin in the game.
Disgusting.
He's the only living person who would know if it's true.
Richard Webber is like a second father to me, and if he knew that I had a sister, he would tell me!
Paged to the E.R.?
Yes.
You?
Mm-hmm.
Sounds big.
Mm-hmm.
I told her last night.
Oh.
How'd it go?
Could have gone better.
What the hell is this?
What's going on?
37-year-old male rear-ended a lumber truck.
Anyone who is not treating this patient, please move out of the way.
Hey, hey, hey!
You heard the woman!
This is not a spectacle for your amusement.
Holy...
- Cool!
- Edwards!
I'm sorry.
Get a close-up!
S11E03 Got to Be Real
Okay, we need to get this man on his back in less than 60 seconds.
Got to work faster.
One more inch to the right, he'd be D.O.A.
How you want to proceed?
Ultrasound's negative for fluid around the heart, so I would do a laparotomy.
Yeah?
His airway is compromised.
He needs a chest tube and intubation now.
Yeah, we're almost done here, okay?
- It'll be safer on his back.
- No, there's no time.
I'll have to go in nasally. 7-0 E.T. tube?
Charlie, I hate to tell you this, but your day is actually about to get a little worse.
Hold the work!
Hold on, Charlie.
Hold on.
All right.
- Almost there.
- Go ahead.
- Okay, push 100 please.
- Pushing.
- Well done, Doctor.
- Sorry?
I said it's good.
Uh, okay.
He's clear.
On his back on my count.
One... two... and three.
You want to give me a robot leg, like the Terminator?
Robotic, more like the six-million-dollar man.
Uh, actually, it costs a little more than that.
But the project is fully funded, all expenses paid.
The leg will be free.
A free six-million-dollar robot leg?
Listen.
I've been through three prosthetic legs.
Each one hurt more than the last.
Why is this so...
Well, the leg is entirely painless.
Free, pain-free robot leg?
Sounds made up.
It was made up... by Dr. Torres.
It is cutting-edge technology.
Dr. Torres is a genius.
You'll be amazed at this...
Okay, let's just slow down for a minute.
We still have to run a number of tests to make sure you're even a candidate for the study.
But, again, the program is fully funded.
Unbelievable.
Major Hunt was right.
He's been going on and on about you.
Yeah, I bet.
I told him how busy I am.
He knows.
He knows my plate is full.
He just doesn't care.
I am an attending with an entire service of my own.
Herman and I have shared dozens of patients before.
Oh, and now he's just bringing this guy to my lab, right?
Like I'm gonna say no to a guy who gave up his leg for our country.
She has me reviewing journals and doing skills labs.
I have a case report that's due by 4:00.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I have a neuroblastoma to remove at 4:00.
Wait.
Is this your way of telling me that you're canceling our meeting with the surrogacy agency tonight?
What?
No!
W... no, I will...
I will figure that out.
- Okay.
- I just...
Say something to help me.
You own a hospital.
You are a raising a beautiful girl.
You save babies.
You're gonna save more, right?
You can do this, too.
If anyone can, you can.
Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
Um, listen, I will meet you at the agency with a smile on my face.
And we will get ourselves a new baby.
Yeah.
A.B.C.'S intact.
I need to assess his GCS.
If you'd be quiet, he's trying to talk now.
Sir, can you tell me your name?
What's your name?
- Steve.
- Forget your helmet today, Steve?
Aah.
It hurts.
I'm giving you something for the pain.
You might start to feel sleepy now.
It's a depressed skull fracture.
It is pretty deep.
We're gonna need a C.T.
And because of the position, probably an angio.
I can make that decision if you'll give me room to look.
Amy, I don't think he's gonna make it, and it's gonna get ugly, so let me do it.
Ah.
Because only you can save him now.
Screw you.
I've got him.
Maybe you can both take him...
like a team, or a family.
I have him.
Kepner, you'll assist.
Let's take him up to C.T.
The African outreach program has given 34 kids excellent outcomes and a chance they never would have had.
And it gave me something, too.
Starting that program gave me a sense of ownership and a... and a level of passion that I didn't know I could have.
I have this passion for this hospital.
I look forward to...
Mer.
Huh?
Yeah, it's great.
You're gonna vote on this.
I don't want to blow this.
And it's Bailey.
Bailey did deliver my baby and save my life.
What have you ever done?
Why aren't you at your own house, drinking and having bitch baby tears about your fake sister with your husband?
Derek doesn't know.
He doesn't know?
I can't talk to him right now.
Oh, come on.
He gave up the job in D.C.
He's staying, and you're still mad?
- You won.
- No.
I never asked him to stay.
This wasn't a compromise.
I didn't win.
He forfeited, so we both lost.
So you're not talking to him?
He's walking around like he's a martyr, waiting for me to be grateful.
I am not grateful.
My career is just as important as his!
I'm the sun.
I'm the sun.
And he can go suck it!
I'm the sun.
All right.
We're done.
Hey!
You can sit here and get drunk and then vomit and cry, and I can never get any prep for my presentation done, or we can do something about this.
You want to do something about this?
It's so light.
It's a 100% titanium body and thirteen sensors.
But before we can get you in a leg like this, we need your muscles and nerves to interface with the sensors.
So, this electromyogram will show spikes when your muscles contract and then go flat when they rest, okay?
All right.
Go ahead and flex for me, Jeff.
When this is done, I get to keep it?
Well, it's all funded, including follow-up, so...
Yes.
Sorry.
I-I know how that sounds.
It's just, all I wanted was to be a ranger, you know?
I still dream about it all the time... pack on my back, running, my team.
Then I wake up and get out of bed.
I try to stand, and I forget about it.
So, you know, when you say "free robot leg,"
I think I'm still dreaming of running with the guys.
- Jeff, are you still flexing?
- Yeah.
- Take a picture of it?
- Yeah.
My mom is gonna freak.
Jeff, flex harder for me.
What?
I should be seeing readings.
What... what's going on?
Uh, w-we're just having trouble with the E.M.G.
No, no.
It's not the E.M.G.
- Jeff, I'm...
- Dr. Torres, can talk to you for a moment?
Excuse us, Jeff.
That was inappropriate.
Inappropriate?
You were about to reject him from the study.
Yes.
You saw those readings.
Look, the way his amputation was performed, there's no way this will work.
Okay, it's a crappy amputation, Owen.
Probably because it was done in less-than-ideal circumstances.
- He is a soldier, Callie.
- I know that, okay?
I feel bad about that, all right?
I care about that.
I really do.
You know who doesn't care?
You know who doesn't give a damn about his service?
The robot leg.
All the robot cares about is that the nerves in his leg aren't communicating with his muscles, which means they can't communicate with the sensors in the prosthesis, which means the robot leg won't work.
Then you can find a way to help him.
Just... just figure it out.
I'm sorry.
Are you not listening to me, Owen?
Are you deliberately being obtuse?
I just told you his nerves...
Just fix it.
Just get back in there...
- I just told you I can't!
- Fix it!
That is an order!
Oh, an order?
- Who... who are you...
General Patton?
- I'm your chief of surgery.
On the surgical floor, you e my chief.
In my lab, funded by the money that I procured, I am in charge!
- Are we clear?
!
- No, you don't get these guys' hopes up and then leave them with nothing!
No, no, no.
No, I didn't do that, Owen.
You did that.
You're the one out there running your mouth at the rehab center about "free, pain-free six-million-dollar man robot legs!"
I'm about to go in there and crush his dreams because of you!
We're gonna pull on my count.
We ready?
One...
Two...
Three.
Easy.
Easy.
Okay, Kelly clamp.
- Apply pressure.
- Got it.
More suction.
I need to see or feel.
- Okay.
- Whoa.
That's got to be the fastest splenectomy I've ever seen.
Yeah, this isn't my first rodeo.
I'm hope I'm that fast someday.
You will be.
In about 4,000 rodeos.
So, I hear you and Hunt had a little episode in the hallway.
He told on me.
You can write me up all you want for insubordination, but I stand by the fact that I do not take orders regarding my own lab.
And Hunt can kiss my...
I'm not asking you to take orders in your own lab.
What I'm asking is maybe that you not have a screaming match in the middle of the hallways of the hospital, because when members of the board cause a scene,
I have to stop practicing medicine, which I love doing, and become a hall monitor, which I don't really love doing.
I got to come down here and lecture you about responsibility and honor and crap I really don't want to be lecturing you about.
You know, I'm down to three procedures a day, okay?
If I'm lucky.
Not even long procedures.
I'm sucking fat, lifting boobs, butts.
Butt implants are huge.
I just want a good, intense, smart surgery.
You know, like, uh, the ones where your feet hurt, when your feet hurt because you've been on them for hours.
Or your mind hurts because you've had to improvise and paint... surgeries of joy.
But no, I can't have those, 'cause I run the board.
Hmm.
Grey calls in sick.
Your wife tries to give up peds surgery on me.
And boy Shepherd's in a pissing match with girl Shepherd, which they won't admit.
And Yang screws us with Bailey versus Karev.
And I think Richard has the hots for the new cardio God,
Maggie or whatever?
Which is gross, 'cause she is 12.
So, now you and Hunt are running around screaming at each other?
I don't get to be a surgeon.
I'm a hall monitor.
I will stop screaming in the hallways.
All right, what's wrong?
Hunt's got this bug up his butt about a candidate for my robotic limb project and as much as he want it to happened those nerves are not communicate with those muscles.
And there is nothing I can do about it.
I can.
Targeted muscle reinnervation.
I create an alternate traffic route for the nerve signals.
It's like, um, if there's construction on the highway, you pick a side street, right?
I can dissect a nerve at its current location...
- Uh-huh...
- And rewire it wherever you need it.
Sh.
Connection established.
You are wasted as a hall monitor.
I know!
Well...
I am done here.
Lung crisis averted.
Okay.
Partial gastrectomy and splenectomy done.
We can start the diaphragm repair.
This was, I have to say, the most fun I have had since I got here.
Well, you've done some very good work.
Me?
You... that was amazing.
What was that... a-a 15-second splenectomy?
Well, 20.
18.
I might have stolen a peek at the clock.
Well, it was inspiring.
I'm glad I was here.
Thank you all.
I will check on him in post-op.
The bowels seem to be intact, but we're gonna run it again just to be sure.
- Bailey, you have this?
- Indeed, we do.
I need your username and password.
This is illegal.
We're just logging into the hospital system.
To get Maggie Pierce's personnel file to get her date of birth, which is illegal.
Yeah, so is pretending to be someone you're not.
Now, put in your password.
Once we figure out when she was born, there's got to be something we can use to prove that your mom wasn't pregnant at the time... you know, photos or a video or something.
You can call Pierce's bluff.
You're a very different person than Cristina.
Cristina and I would just be dancing by now.
Yeah.
I know.
Here we go.
Look at that.
Pierce's birthday...
November 22, 1983.
So, basically, your mom would have been knocked around, uh... spring of '83.
What was going on in the spring of '83?
What?
That's when she tried to kill herself.
Right so, that's done.
Maybe you want to practice your speech on me.
Or maybe I want to focus on making sure Mr. Hays is stable post-op.
- But Karev...
- Okay, Edwards, I am afraid of snakes.
I'm afraid of large spiders.
And while it might not be rational,
I am occasional afraid there might be a shark
- waiting for me in a public swimming pool.
- Why would be there a shark waiting for you?
I said it wasn't rational.
I am afraid of those things.
What I am not afraid of is Alex Karev.
You should be afraid of everyone else.
Say more.
Alex Karev is the closest thing Meredith Grey has to a brother.
He lives in her old house.
He started a program that brought a daughter into her life.
Robbins is Karev's mentor.
Torres is married to Robbins.
So whoo!
Team Karev.
Jackson Avery... friend of Alex Karev.
We used to double-date.
Speaking of which, Avery has a history of making wrong choices.
Oh.
Hey, Dr. Herman.
Sorry I don't have that case report in to you yet.
I've got this neuroblastoma on this baby, and the mom got really overreactive, and so I-I had to reassure her.
Dr. Robbins, in fetal surgery, every patient you treat will come encased in a mother... a mother whose heightened state of concern is a biological and evolutionary necessity.
If you lack the basic skills to...
No, I don't.
I don't.
No.
No.
Huh-unh.
Moms are kind of like my thing.
I'm great with moms.
I actually teach other people how to be great with moms.
Yeah, no, you can ask anyone.
I need your start paperwork.
Right.
I just need to get caught up on that.
- I am great with moms!
- I know!
It was right after that she moved us to Boston.
I mean, I was 5.
All my memories of Boston are so hazy.
Do you remember your mom getting suddenly fat, then suddenly not fat?
Alex, that whole time was just a blur.
Everything that happened after she tried to kill herself was just a blur for me.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Let's just keep working on your speech.
I'm not working on my speech.
I'm going through the emergency room admittance for Seattle Grace of June of 1983.
What?
How?
We computerized this like two years ago.
How you on the board and I am not?
Wait right there.
There it is.
Well, don't click on it, because I'm not...
I'm not sure I'm ready to see this.
Are you ever ready for this stuff?
Patient admitted with wrist laceras and loss of blood.
Scroll on, scroll on.
- Beta-HCG came back positive.
- She was pregnant.
Look in the notes.
"Advised patient of pregnancy.
Patient was unaware of pregnancy when admitted."
She's my sister.
I owe you an apology.
Were you going to give me one, or is this just a heads-up?
I'm sorry, okay?
- We're okay?
- No!
N... come back here!
Come back and say a bunch of crap to make me understand why you were yelling at me and giving me orders and generally being a big old ass.
No, we're not okay.
I need something to be... good.
To...
I need something to feel right.
Okay, I'm not depressed.
I'm not... my heart is not broken.
I'm not grieving.
She's not dead.
She's out there.
She's living out her dreams.
She's living out her dreams and I know...
I know she's happy, and that makes me feel proud for her.
But there is this other feeling that doesn't completely feel fair or right or good.
She goes on, day in and day out, happy, without me.
But every morning, I wake up, and there's this pit, this... feeling here that...
Maybe my dreams are over maybe I had my dreams and they're over now.
And I'm gonna be this single guy.
No wife, no kids, no family.
She was my family.
Hmm.
And now she's someplace else, and I let her go, and...
It's good that I did.
I mean, it's better... for her.
But for me...
So I need something to be good.
I need a reason to get up every morning, to not crawl back to that cave that I was in before I met her.
I mean, you know she saved me?
You were there.
You remember how I was.
I was...
I was... dark.
That war made me dark.
And that darkness... it is still in me.
She just lit it up.
So I just thought...
I just thought...
Maybe to beat back that darkness,
I would...
I would do some good.
I'd just... do something good.
I'd go be with those guys who'd remind me...
I just need something to be good.
That's why I dragged you to that rehab center.
That's why I, um...
Wanted you to help.
That's why I pushed too hard, and t-that's it.
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore, okay?
So just... just say that we're okay, okay?
Okay.
- Great.
- Owen?
For God's sakes, Callie.
No, I just...
I was just gonna ask if you wanted to...
I was just gonna ask if you wanted to watch Jeff's surgery.
Jackson's doing a little targeted muscle reinnervation.
He's moving the nerves to where they can talk to the robot sensors.
Want to watch?
How's our motorcycle guy?
My motorcycle guy?
I fixed him, like a boss.
Like your boss, actually.
Amy, you're an excellent surgeon.
You have nothing to prove.
Oh, I know I don't.
But if you try and fight me over the leadership of this department, you will lose.
My resume will kick your resume's ass.
I am better than you.
Oh, my God, Derek.
- There is no limit to your narcissist...
- I have been playing this game longer than you at a much higher level.
That is all there is to it.
Bite me.
Where did she go?
Dr. Shepherd?
- I'm Dr. Shepherd.
- Yeah, I-I know.
Ms. Dr. Shepherd.
- Her post-op C.T.s are back.
- Let me see them.
I...shouldn't.
Kepner, I am Dr. Shepherd.
Uh...
So, we repaired the subdural bleed, but...
That is a big aneurysm.
Yeah.
It's grown.
It's way bigger than it was before.
- Okay, book an O.R. and scrub in.
- Okay.
I'll let her know.
No, with me, Kepner.
You're gonna scrub in with me.
- It's her patient.
- Well, it just got too big for her.
Tell her or don't tell her.
Just prep an O.R. and scrub in.
Okay.
So, now what are you gonna do?
Go talk to her?
Well, I called Richard, and he's coming over.
Is that okay?
Yeah, sure.
It's just, you know...
We've got this board meeting thing, and I don't want to rush you, but I got to go get ready, and you got to be at this meeting, too.
Alex, you're prepared.
Your speech is great.
- Why are you so...
- Because I want this, Mer.
You know?
I don't just need a job.
Yang thought I could do something bigger, and for the first time, I feel like I can, too.
You know, I-I feel like I should really...
Like I have something to offer.
And I'm scared to death, and I don't want it to go like crap, all right?
Take all the time you need.
Thank you.
When did you know?
I found out the night I met Maggie Pierce.
You didn't know?
Ellis didn't tell you?
Believe me, don't you think...
When Pierce asked about your mother,
I felt like I was being hit by a car.
And when she asked about you...
I...
When was that?
The night of the mass casualty... the mall explosion.
That was a week ago.
So, you knew I had a sister and you had a daughter, and you didn't tell me?
- You didn't tell her.
- I tried.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Don't you think I want to?
I tried.
I tried again today.
Well, when are you planning on doing it?
I would have liked to do it 30 years ago!
I would like to have been a father!
To know my child!
To have a say!
But your mother stole that chance from me.
Gown and glove me.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you!
Suction.
Amy, you don't have to scrub in.
I want to be sterile when I come over there and stick that bovie in your eye.
- Kepner, move!
You're on my list.
- You have put me in an awful position.
Amy, he never had a good prognosis.
I went endovascularly to fix the aneurysm,
- but he starting re-bleeding.
- I can see that.
Fibrin glue.
Now, why is that suction not working?
Okay, can somebody change the canister?
Got it.
Amy...
I see it.
100 of Mannitol, 125 of Solu-Medrol.
- He's gonna herniate.
- He may not have time to herniate!
He's in florid D.I.C. He's not clotting anymore.
Knox, check his pupils.
Fixed and dilated.
There's no gag reflex.
He's probably already brain-dead.
The next thing I heard, she had moved you to Boston.
She never said a thing to me about being pregnant.
I had no choice in the matter.
I...
She knew, and... and she left.
I'm sorry.
It's just...
We had an amazing day today.
And she's someone I'd very much like to know.
So, she came here looking for answers about her biological mother.
You are her answer.
You have to tell her.
Don't make her wait.
I mean, Ellis made the decision for you.
Don't do that to Pierce.
So, you're re-routing the deep peroneal with the biceps femoris?
Exactly.
You know, if you made this process part of the initial amputation, you could cut out the second surgery altogether.
Huh.
Yeah.
Add... what...
2, 3 minutes to the initial surgery?
That could make a world of difference.
That's a great idea, actually.
Thanks.
Avery, did I mention that Hunt and I are starting a special project with veterans?
- We are?
- We are.
We are taking a chunk of my research money and focusing it on prosthetics for vets... free, pain-free, right?
Right.
Right.
That sounds great.
That is good for the hospital.
Good work, guys.
You want in?
I mean, unless you're too busy with butt implants, hall monitoring.
Yeah, well, I guess you would benefit from having a good plastics guy who knows nerves.
Ew.
Ew.
That was so weak.
Did you see him trying to pretend he already had friends on the playground?
Yeah, don't pretend that you have friends on the playground.
Aw.
He tried to be cool.
Don't try to be cool.
It's sad.
Don't try to be cool.
Shut up.
Adding on this reinnervation, it revolutionizes the whole thing.
I mean, the potential for control these patients can have is... is...
It's incredible.
I mean, I could change the way the world does amputations.
Sounds like you really want to do this.
I-I do.
I do!
And I know it'll take so much time, and... and we'll be stretched so, so thin.
- But I really think that...
- So, wait.
So, are you saying that maybe we should wait on this baby?
What?
No.
No, no.
Why would you say that?
No.
Because you just said it was gonna be too much to juggle.
And you're supposed to say, "it's not a problem.
"You can do it, Callie.
We can do it all."
You're... you're supposed to support me the way that I've been supporting you ever since you decided you needed to start this fellowship.
But what if we can't?
I mean, what if we can't do anything and everything?
Are you saying you don't want to...
Are you saying you don't want a baby?
'Cause, then, w-what are we doing here?
Why... why are we meeting with this lady who's gonna help us find someone to help us make a baby if you don't want a baby?
Don't put words in my mouth.
This was my idea.
I...
Yeah, but y-you don't want to carry it, and then I couldn't, and you still didn't want to carry it, and then we find this, and then you find something else to do.
Oh, my God.
It's so obvious.
I can't believe it.
Say it.
Just say the words.
You don't want a baby.
Hi.
35-year-old male admitted status post-ejection from a motorcycle without a helmet.
Head C.T. revealed...
What?
I'll do the op note if you want.
You gonna steal this part, too?
Stealing?
No, I'm just trying to help.
This guy was a lost cause.
Whether he was or wasn't, he was my responsibility, and I didn't need your help, and I don't need any more of your bullying.
Bullying?
I am trying to be nice.
Look, I get it!
You were king of all neurosurgeons, right hand to the president.
And now you can't have that, so you need to be king of the hospital and kick around the peons.
You of all people should understand that this was the future of neuroscience.
I mean, this is what we would've dreamt of in med school if we'd thought it was even possible that it could be done.
Then you shouldn't have given it up.
But the least you can do is stop stomping around here punishing people for a choice you made.
I didn't make a choice.
Meredith made a choice and backed me into a corner.
And because I love my kids and I love my wife and I want to do what's best for her...
I do.
I want to give her everything.
But something like this will not come again.
This is it.
This is as high as I go.
I have never taken a step back in my career ever.
I've never felt like this before, and I feel like she forced me.
Okay, well, I know the feeling, because it is happening to me right now.
I'm...
I'm not trying to...
No, I know that you're not trying to, but you are, Derek!
You are doing it to me.
And Meredith... you say that you want her to have everything, but not if it interferes with you having your everything.
And it is not fair, and I am saying no, too, because you have to live with the choices you make.
I am trying to.
I am trying.
I know.
We're all trying.
It's just, no one wants to give up...
Or give in.
And no one should.
Right?
Hey.
Uh, time for the board meeting.
Mm.
Okay.
How's our masterpiece doing?
- Good.
He's good.
- Great.
You coming?
Yeah, no, I'm just gonna be a minute.
I'm, um...
Just reviewing his chart.
Want to make sure everything's perfect since they are gonna be teaching this in med schools.
I know, right?
It's crazy.
Yeah.
Let's go.
I'll make sure that she gets there.
Uh, a-all right, fine.
Don't be late.
Um, a-and actually, the three of us, we should, you know, meet... get together, talk about timelines, protocol.
Yeah, I'll fill you in on the funding stuff, and we'll figure out a subject pipeline.
Okay.
You okay?
Yeah.
I just, um...
I need something to be good, too.
Okay.
Ugh.
All right.
How sobby do I look?
1 to 10.
Mm... 6.
Uggggh.
Okay.
So, how'd it go today?
Did Meredith help you with your speech?
Uh, not really.
If this doesn't work out, I hear radioshack's hiring.
She must have helped some.
I mean, you guys were at the house together all day.
Yeah, well, she's got a lot of stuff going on.
Do I have pit stains?
What kind of stuff?
Oh, nothing.
Don't worry about it.
You sure I look okay?
Yeah.
You look great.
Dr. Karev.
Dr. Bailey.
I'll tell them you're on your way.
Pierce?
Hey!
Dr. Webber!
Did you check in on our impalement patient?
He is doing great!
I need to tell you something.
I should have told you sooner.
Okay.
Ellis Grey and I knew each other... very well.
- We had a relationship...
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Stop talking.
It's funny, but that is the first thing I thought when we first spoke and you told me that you'd known my mother.
I thought, "what if it's him?"
But then you never said anything.
And then days went by, and you still never said anything, so I thought it couldn't possibly be true, because what kind of person would do something like that... would let me sit there and talk like an idiot
and never speak up?
No one decent.
No one honest.
A coward.
The only reason that you would do something like that... is if you'd known about me all along
- and never wanted me, either.
- No.
No, that's not true.
That's not...
Why should I believe you?
Why should I believe a word you say to me?
!
Well, this must've been a nightmare for you, me showing up here like this.
Don't worry... it has been worse for me.
Good night, Dr. Webber.
Surgeons are bred to be invulnerable.
It's very hard to lay ourselves bare.
- Hey.
How are you feeling?
- Hey.
Uh, not great.
Weird day.
You don't have a fever.
You still sick?
No, I-I wasn't sick.
- I-I'm...
I am a little drunk, though.
- You're drunk?
- Yes.
I was at Alex's...
- Okay, Meredith, you got to help me.
I-I-I-I'm trying to understand.
Okay, listen, this crazy thing is happening...
You said you had to stay here to make the most of your career.
Just listen to me.
Wait...
so, I gave up the brain mapping initiative so you can play hooky and get drunk with your friends?
This is why we're staying in Seattle?
Because we know exactly how deep some injuries can go.
But vulnerability isn't the opposite of strength.
It's a necessary part.
We have to force ourselves to open up... to expose ourselves... to offer up everything we have...
And just pray that it's good enough.
I'm sure you did fine.
Sure are taking a long time.
Alex?
Otherwise... we'll never succeed.
Congratulations.
I...
Wait...
Karev.
Bailey.
There she is.
Hey.
Congratulations.
¶ I don't want to talk about it ¶
Meredith:
On an operating table, a person is at his most vulnerable -- naked, exposed.
I do not need another sister.
Get out.
I mean, she's a lying liar.
I would know if my mother were pregnant when I was 5.
My mother was not pregnant when I was 5.
Get out.
She's, like, psycho, like a stalker.
I'm being stalked.
Alex, this is criminal.
I mean, you -- what's your problem?
Get out!
I'm naked here!
Okay, so what?
I've seen it before!
No big deal!
I'm in crisis!
Okay, fine.
It's -- your junk is spectacular.
Jo is a very lucky girl.
Can we get back to me now?
Why are you making that face?
Mer, I realize that I said I would take over as your person.
Maybe that means I have to buy your tampons and act like your husband's hair is special and crap.
But I have a very important presentation to make to the board today to get a job, which I need because I got fired by Dr. butthole!
I have been practicing all night.
I am sleep-deprived.
I need to shower -- alone -- and focus!
You didn't even hear what I said!
No.
And I don't care.
The new cardio chief thinks she's my biological sister.
She what?
Wait.
What?
!
That's insane.
Thank you.
He's in the shower, and she's in the bathroom with him while he's in the shower.
So, go in there with them.
[ Chuckling ] No!
I am not going in there.
You're the girlfriend.
No.
Yeah, I am, but I'm not.
They're this little team together.
They are war buddies, and I don't fit.
And then they look at me -- well, she looks at me -- like I'm just the stupid, naked girl in Alex's bed.
So go be the stupid, naked girl in Alex's shower.
I am a doctor.
I am a surgeon.
I deserve respect.
You're a girl in her pajamas with her ear to the door of a bathroom.
How much respect can anyone give you right now?
She stole my Alex.
You know what?
I miss Cristina Yang.
When Cristina Yang was here, nobody stole my Alex.
Oh, my God.
You're scared of Meredith Grey.
[ Gasps ] No, I'm not.
Are you?
No.
Hey.
Hi, Dr. Grey.
Tell Alex I'll be downstairs.
And if anybody asks you, I am sick.
¶ I've tried to make the best of things ¶ skin is not a very tough armor.
It's soft, easily broken.
Callie:
Okay, I'm only here to give a speech on residual limb health, and that is it.
That is it.
Uh, yeah, I got to pull back, okay?
We have a kid.
Arizona is starting a fellowship.
We're trying to have another kid.
I am stretched out far too thin.
I completely understand.
I said no already.
I know that.
You're just gonna meet a couple guys.
Come on.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
[ Sighs ] Navy seals, green berets, army rangers.
Wounded warriors from the most badass specialized ops forces in the U.S. military.
But... [ sighs ]
You're too busy to help our nation's heroes, so...
I do not like you.
[ Chuckles ]
Then I directed the rfa needle to where the blood supply entered the abnormal parabiotic tissue mass.
To interrupt the blood flow to the abnormal fetus.
Yes.
Then I removed excess amniotic fluid.
Nice.
And then she delivered full-term?
She did -- months after I completed the operation that I'm telling you about.
Why are you not taking notes?
Oh.
Sorry.
I thought we were just, you know, talking.
[ Chuckles ] And I thought you were my fellow.
I am -- completely.
[ Chuckling ] No, I'm so excited to be your fellow.
I just need a little -- little time to get up to speed, you know, like four three -- three weeks.
Yeah, 'cause I have a lot of cases on my --
Dr. Robbins, for the purposes of this fellowship, we are not peers.
And four weeks is 10% of the average gestational age.
In that amount of time, a fetus's lungs become a fully functioning organ.
Everything in utero happens at hyper speed.
And the sooner you get up to that speed, the better.
Get a notepad.
Avery, um, I've got a backlog of some cases.
Amy's doing a great job, but there's some stuff I got to get on top of.
So, you need help?
I need you to reschedule this meeting for tonight.
No.
Oh, are we rescheduling the meeting?
Oh, thank God, because Callie and I have an appointment tonight, and apparently, I've already started my fellowship.
We are not rescheduling the meeting.
Tomorrow work for you?
No, tomorrow's bad.
Um, Thursday?
Listen to me speak, all right?
We are voting on a new member of the board.
It's happening tonight.
Understood?
Amelia:
Derek!
Derek, why is there suddenly an order for carbamazepine in Eric Schneider's chart?
He needed a good anti-convulsant.
And I had already written him one for valproic acid.
You can't go around writing orders on my patients.
I'm doing my job.
No, you are doing my job.
I am chief of neurosurgery.
If you have a problem with that, you should take it up with the board.
Until then, I will call you when I need you.
[ Elevator bell dings ]
What happened to the two diverting loop ileostomies
I had today?
You're welcome.
No, I-I-I rearranged your cases so you had the easiest day possible.
You are going up against Karev, so I figured you'd want plenty of time to practice your board presentation.
I don't need to practice.
I need my schedule back the way it was.
You sure, though?
Karev's pretty tight with some board members.
So am I.
Well, Meredith Grey was in the bathroom with Karev this morning.
Well, not that tight.
That's what I'm saying.
Look, Edwards... [ sighs ]
I am going to walk in there and tell the truth.
I deserve this.
And if any one of them has the misguided impression that there is any choice at all in this matter,
I will set that person on the righteous path before he or she can reveal him-or herself as a moron.
[ Cellphone chimes, vibrates ]
Oh.
Pileup on I-5.
Trauma coming in.
Why are they paging me?
Isn't Grey on the pit today?
She's sick.
If my mother were pregnant, I would have known.
Adoption agency made a mistake?
And randomly put the name "Ellis Grey"
on a birth certificate?
I don't think so.
Pierce has got to want something.
Maybe she thinks there's money to inherit.
[ Scoffs ] The only thing you inherit in this family is Alzheimer's.
[ Chuckles ] Whoa.
Dark.
Good one, though, huh?
Yeah.
She's not my sister.
You know who you should ask about this?
The guy who was banging your mom back then.
I'm not asking Richard Webber.
All I'm saying is, he's got skin in the game.
Disgusting.
He's the only living person who would know if it's true.
Richard Webber is like a second father to me, and if he knew that I had a sister, he would tell me!
[ Elevator bell dings ]
[ Elevator doors close ]
[ Clears throat ]
Paged to the E.R.?
Yes.
You?
Mm-hmm.
[ Exhales deeply ]
Sounds big.
Mm-hmm.
I told her last night.
Oh.
How'd it go?
Could have gone better.
[ Elevator bell dings ]
[ Indistinct shouting ]
What the hell is this?
What's going on?
37-year-old male rear-ended a lumber truck.
April:
Anyone who is not treating this patient, please move out of the way.
Bailey:
Hey, hey, hey!
You heard the woman!
This is not a spectacle for your amusement.
Maggie:
Holy -- cool!
Edwards!
I'm sorry.
[ Siren wailing in distance ]
[ Camera shutters clicking ]
Man:
Get a close-up!
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
Okay, we need to get this man on his back in less than 60 seconds.
Got to work faster.
One more inch to the right, he'd be d.O.A.
How you want to proceed?
Ultrasound's negative for fluid around the heart, so I would do a laparotomy.
Yeah?
[ Coughing ] [ Monitors beeping rapidly ]
His airway is compromised.
He needs a chest tube and intubation now.
Yeah, we're almost done here, okay?
It'll be safer on his back.
No, there's no time.
I'll have to go in nasally.
7-0 e.T. Tube?
Charlie, I hate to tell you this, but your day is actually about to get a little worse.
Hold the work!
Hold on, Charlie.
Hold on.
All right.
Almost there.
Okay.
[ Charlie groaning ]
Okay, push 100 of propofol, please.
[ Saw whirring ]
[ Beeping stops ]
Well done, doctor.
Sorry?
I said very good!
[ Whirring stops ]
Uh, okay.
He's clear.
On his back on my count.
One... two... and three.
You want to give me a robot leg, like the Terminator?
[ Chuckles ] Robotic, more like the six-million-dollar man.
Uh, actually, it costs a little more than that.
But the project is fully funded, all expenses paid.
The leg will be free.
A free six-million-dollar robot leg?
[ Chuckles ] Listen.
I've been through three prosthetic legs.
Each one hurt more than the last.
Why is this so -- well, the leg is entirely painless.
[ Chuckles ] Free, pain-free robot leg?
Sounds made up.
[ Chuckles ] It was made up -- by Dr. Torres.
It is cutting-edge technology.
Dr. Torres is a genius.
You'll be amazed at this -- [ chuckling ] Okay, let's just slow down for a minute.
We still have to run a number of tests to make sure you're even a candidate for the study.
[ Clears throat ]
But, again, the program is fully funded.
Unbelievable.
Major hunt was right.
He's been going on and on about you.
[ Chuckles ] Yeah, I bet.
[ Sighs ]
I told him how busy I am.
He knows.
He knows my plate is full.
He just doesn't care.
I am an attending with an entire service of my own.
Herman and I have shared dozens of patients before.
Oh, and now he's just bringing this guy to my lab, right?
Like I'm gonna say no to a guy who gave up his leg for our country.
She has me reviewing journals and doing skills labs.
I have a case report that's due by 4:00.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I have a neuroblastoma to remove at 4:00.
Wait.
Is this your way of telling me that you're canceling our meeting with the surrogacy agency tonight?
What?
No!
W-- no, I will -- I will figure that out.
Okay.
I just...
[ Sighs ] Say something to help me.
You own a hospital.
You are a raising a beautiful girl.
You save babies.
You're gonna save more, right?
You can do this, too.
If anyone can, you can.
[ Cellphone rings ] Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
Um, listen, I will meet you at the agency with a smile on my face.
And we will get ourselves a new baby.
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.
A.B.C.'S intact.
I need to assess his gcs.
If you'd be quiet, he's trying to talk now.
Sir, can you tell me your name?
What's your name?
Steve.
Forget your helmet today, Steve?
Aah.
It hurts.
I'm giving you something for the pain.
You might start to feel sleepy now.
It's a depressed skull fracture.
It is pretty deep.
We're gonna need a C.T.
And because of the position, probably an angio.
I can make that decision if you'll give me room to look.
Amy, I don't think he's gonna make it, and it's gonna get ugly, so let me do it.
Ah.
Because only you can save him now.
Screw you.
I've got him.
Maybe you can both take him -- like a team, or a family.
I have him.
Kepner, you'll assist.
Let's take him up to C.T.
The African outreach program has given 34 kids excellent outcomes and a chance they never would have had.
And it gave me something, too.
Starting that program gave me a sense of ownership and a -- and a level of passion that I didn't know I could have.
I have this passion for this hospital.
I look forward to -- mer.
Huh?
Yeah, it's great.
You're gonna vote on this.
I don't want to blow this.
And it's Bailey.
Bailey did deliver my baby and save my life.
What have you ever done?
Why aren't you at your own house, drinking and having bitch baby tears about your fake sister with your husband?
Derek doesn't know.
He doesn't know?
I can't talk to him right now.
Oh, come on.
He gave up the job in D.C.
He's staying, and you're still mad?
You won.
No.
I never asked him to stay.
This wasn't a compromise.
I didn't win.
He forfeited, so we both lost.
So you're not talking to him?
He's walking around like he's a martyr, waiting for me to be grateful.
I am not grateful.
My career is just as important as his!
I'm the sun.
I'm the sun.
And he can go suck it!
I'm the sun.
All right.
We're done.
Hey!
You can sit here and get drunk and then vomit and cry, and I can never get any prep for my presentation done, or we can do something about this.
You want to do something about this?
Jeff:
It's so light.
[ Chuckles ]
It's a 100% titanium body and 13 sensors.
But before we can get you in a leg like this, we need your muscles and nerves to interface with the sensors.
So, this electromyogram will show spikes when your muscles contract and then go flat when they rest, okay?
All right.
Go ahead and flex for me, Jeff.
When this is done, I get to keep it?
Well, it's all funded, including follow-up, so...
Yes. [ Chuckles ]
Sorry.
I-I know how that sounds.
It's just, all I wanted was to be a ranger, you know?
I still dream about it all the time -- pack on my back, running, my team.
Then I wake up and get out of bed.
I try to stand, and I forget about it.
So, you know, when you say "free robot leg,"
I think I'm still dreaming of running with the guys.
Jeff, are you still flexing?
Yeah.
Can I take a picture of it?
Yeah.
My mom is gonna freak.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
Jeff, flex harder for me.
What?
I should be seeing readings.
What -- what's going on?
Uh, w-we're just having trouble with the e.M.G.
No, no. [ Chuckles ] It's not the e.M.G.
Jeff, I'm -
- Dr. Torres, can I talk to you for a moment?
Excuse us, Jeff.
That was inappropriate.
Inappropriate?
You were about to reject him from the study.
Yes.
You saw those readings.
Look, the way his amputation was performed, there's no way this will work.
Okay, it's a crappy amputation, Owen.
Probably because it was done in less-than-ideal circumstances.
He is a soldier, Callie.
I know that, okay?
I feel bad about that, all right?
I care about that.
I really do.
You know who doesn't care?
You know who doesn't give a damn about his service?
The robot leg.
All the robot cares about is that the nerves in his leg aren't communicating with his muscles, which means they can't communicate with the sensors in the prosthesis, which means the robot leg won't work.
Then you can find a way to help him.
Just -- just figure it out.
I'm sorry.
Are you not listening to me, Owen?
Are you deliberately being obtuse?
I just told you his nerves -- just fix it.
Just get back in there --
I just told you I can't!
Fix it!
That is an order!
[ Chuckling ] Oh, an order?
Who -- who are you -- general patton?
I'm your chief of surgery.
On the surgical floor, you are my chief.
In my lab, funded by the money that I procured, I am in charge!
Are we clear?
!
No, you don't get these guys' hopes up and then leave them with nothing!
No, no, no.
No, I didn't do that, Owen.
You did that.
You're the one out there running your mouth at the rehab center about "free, pain-free six-million-dollar man robot legs!"
I'm about to go in there and crush his dreams because of you!
[ Sighs ]
Richard:
We're gonna pull on my count.
We ready?
One...
Two...
Three.
Easy.
Easy.
[ Monitors beeping ]
Okay, Kelly clamp.
Bailey:
Apply pressure.
Stephanie:
Got it.
Richard:
More suction.
I need to see or feel.
Okay.
Whoa.
That's got to be the fastest splenectomy I've ever seen.
Yeah, this isn't my first rodeo.
I'm hope I'm that fast someday.
You will be.
In about 4,000 rodeos.
[ Chuckles ]
¶ Okay, so, you just ¶
¶ go around breaking hearts just to see... ¶ so, I hear you and hunt had a little episode in the hallway.
[ Scoffs ] He told on me.
You can write me up all you want for insubordination, but I stand by the fact that I do not take orders regarding my own lab.
And hunt can kiss my --
I'm not asking you to take orders in your own lab.
What I'm asking is maybe that you not have a screaming match in the middle of the hallways of the hospital, because when members of the board cause a scene,
I have to stop practicing medicine, which I love doing, and become a hall monitor, which I don't really love doing.
I got to come down here and lecture you about responsibility and honor and crap I really don't want to be lecturing you about.
You know, I'm down to three procedures a day, okay?
If I'm lucky.
Not even long procedures.
I'm sucking fat, lifting boobs, butts.
Butt implants are huge.
[ Sighs ] I just want a good, intense, smart surgery.
You know, like, uh, the ones where your feet hurt, when your feet hurt because you've been on them for hours.
Or your mind hurts because you've had to improvise and paint -- surgeries of joy.
But no, I can't have those, 'cause I run the board.
Hmm.
Grey calls in sick.
Your wife tries to give up peds surgery on me.
And boy Shepherd's in a pissing match with girl Shepherd, which they won't admit.
And Yang screws us with Bailey versus Karev.
And I think Richard has the hots for the new cardio God,
Maggie or whatever?
Which is gross, 'cause she is 12.
So, now you and hunt are running around screaming at each other?
I don't get to be a surgeon.
I'm a hall monitor.
I will stop screaming in the hallways.
[ Tool clatters ]
[ Sighs ]
All right, what's wrong?
Hunt's got this bug up his butt about a candidate for my robotic limb project, and... as much as he wants it to happen, those nerves are not communicating with those muscles, and there's -- there's nothing I can do about it.
I can.
Targeted muscle reinnervation.
I create an alternate traffic route for the nerve signals.
It's like, um, if there's construction on the highway, you pick a side street, right?
I can dissect a nerve at its current location...
Uh-huh... and rewire it wherever you need it.
Connection established.
[ Chuckles ]
You are wasted as a hall monitor.
I know!
[ Laughs ]
Well...
I am done here.
Lung crisis averted.
Okay.
Partial gastrectomy and splenectomy done.
We can start the diaphragm repair.
This was, I have to say, the most fun I have had since I got here.
Well, you've done some very good work.
Me?
You -- that was amazing.
What was that -- a-a 15-second splenectomy?
Well, 20.
18.
I might have stolen a peek at the clock.
Well, it was inspiring.
I'm glad I was here.
Thank you all.
I will check on him in post-op.
Bailey:
The bowels seem to be intact, but we're gonna run it again just to be sure.
Bailey, you have this?
Indeed, we do.
¶ We'll never, never, never, never know ¶
¶ we'll never know, we'll never know, no good ¶
¶ we'll never know, know ¶
¶ we'll never know, we'll never know, no good ¶
¶ we will never know ¶
I need your username and password.
This is illegal.
We're just logging into the hospital system.
To get Maggie Pierce's personnel file to get her date of birth, which is illegal.
Yeah, so is pretending to be someone you're not.
Now, put in your password.
Once we figure out when she was born, there's got to be something we can use to prove that your mom wasn't pregnant at the time -- you know, photos or a video or something.
You can call Pierce's bluff.
You're a very different person than Cristina.
Cristina and I would just be dancing by now.
Yeah.
I know.
Here we go.
Look at that.
Pierce's birthday -- November 22, 1983.
So, basically, your mom would have been knocked up around, uh... spring of '83.
What was going on in the spring of '83?
What?
That's when she tried to kill herself.
So, that's done.
Maybe you want to practice your speech on me.
Or maybe I want to focus on making sure Mr. hays is stable post-op.
But Karev -- okay, Edwards, I am afraid of snakes.
I'm afraid of large spiders.
And while it might not be rational,
I am occasionally afraid there might be a shark waiting for me in a public swimming pool.
Why would there be a shark waiting for you -
- I said it wasn't rational.
I am afraid of those things.
What I am not afraid of is Alex Karev.
You shouldn't be.
You should be afraid of everyone else.
Say more.
Alex Karev is the closest thing Meredith Grey has to a brother.
He lives in her old house.
He started a program that brought a daughter into her life.
Robbins is Karev's mentor.
Torres is married to Robbins.
So whoo!
Team Karev.
Jackson Avery -- friend of Alex Karev.
We used to double-date.
Speaking of which, Avery has a history of making wrong choices.
[ Sighs ]
Oh.
Hey, Dr. Herman.
Sorry I don't have that case report in to you yet.
I've got this neuroblastoma on this baby, and the mom got really overreactive, and so I-I had to reassure her.
Dr. Robbins, in fetal surgery, every patient you treat will come encased in a mother -- a mother whose heightened state of concern is a biological and evolutionary necessity.
If you lack the basic skills to -- no, I don't.
I don't.
No.
No.
Huh-unh. [ Chuckles ]
Moms are kind of like my thing.
I'm great with moms.
I actually teach other people how to be great with moms.
Yeah, no, you can ask anyone.
I need your start paperwork.
Right.
I just need to get caught up on that.
[ Sighs ]
I am great with moms!
I know!
It was right after that she moved us to Boston.
I mean, I was 5.
All my memories of Boston are so hazy.
Do you remember your mom getting suddenly fat, then suddenly not fat?
Alex, that whole time was just a blur.
Everything that happened after she tried to kill herself was just a blur for me.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Let's just keep working on your speech.
I'm not working on my speech.
I'm going through the emergency-room admits for Seattle grace in June of 1983.
What?
How?
We computerized this like two years ago.
How are you on the board and I'm not?
Wait.
Right there.
There it is.
Well, don't click on it, because I'm not --
I'm not sure I'm ready to see this.
Are you ever ready for this stuff?
"Patient admitted with wrist lacerations and loss of blood."
Scroll down.
Scroll down.
Beta-hcg came back positive.
She was pregnant.
Look in the notes.
"Advised patient of pregnancy.
Patient was unaware of pregnancy when admitted."
She's my sister.
I owe you an apology. [ Sighs ]
Were you going to give me one, or is this just a heads-up?
[ Scoffs ]
I'm sorry, okay?
We're okay?
No!
N-- come back here!
Come back and say a bunch of crap to make me understand why you were yelling at me and giving me orders and generally being a big old ass.
No, we're not okay.
¶ What if I said I would break your heart?
¶
I need something to be...
Good.
To...
I need something to feel right.
Okay, I'm not depressed.
I'm not -- my heart is not broken.
I'm not grieving.
She's not dead.
She's out there.
[ Sighs ] She's living out her dreams, and I know -- I know she's happy, and that makes me feel proud for her.
[ Sighs ]
But there is this other feeling that doesn't completely feel fair or right or good.
She goes on, day in and day out, happy, without me.
But every morning, I wake up, and there's this pit, this...
[ Sighs ] Feeling here that...
Maybe my dreams are over.
Maybe -- maybe I had my dreams and they're over now.
And I'm gonna be this single guy.
No wife, no kids, no family.
She was my family.
Hmm.
And now she's someplace else, and I let her go, and...
It's good that I did.
I mean, it's better -- for her.
But for me...
So I need something to be good.
I need a reason to get up every morning, to not crawl back into that cave that I was in before I met her.
I mean, you know she saved me?
You were there.
You remember how I was.
I was -
- I was...
Dark.
That war made me dark.
[ Sighs ]
And that darkness -- it is still in me.
She just lit it up.
So I just thought -- I just thought...
Maybe to beat back that darkness,
I would -- I would do some good.
I'd just... do something good.
I'd go be with those guys who'd remind me...
[ Sighs ] I just need something to be good.
That's why I dragged you to that rehab center.
That's why I, um...
[ Clears throat, sniffles ] ...wanted you to help.
That's why I pushed too hard, and t-that's it.
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore, okay?
So just -- just say that we're okay, okay?
Okay.
Great.
Owen?
For God's sakes, Callie.
No, I just -
- I was just gonna ask if you wanted to --
I was just gonna ask if you wanted to watch Jeff's surgery.
Jackson's doing a little targeted muscle reinnervation.
He's moving the nerves to where they can talk to the robot sensors.
[ Chuckles ]
Want to watch?
How's our motorcycle guy?
My motorcycle guy?
I fixed him, like a boss.
Like your boss, actually.
Amy, you're an excellent surgeon.
You have nothing to prove.
Oh, I know I don't.
But if you try and fight me over the leadership of this department, you will lose.
My résumé will kick your résumé's ass.
I am better than you.
Oh, my God, Derek.
There is no limit to your narcissist-- I have been playing this game longer than you at a much higher level.
That is all there is to it.
[ Chuckles ] Bite me.
[ Sighs deeply ]
Where did she go?
Dr. Shepherd?
I'm Dr. Shepherd.
Yeah, I-I know.
Ms. Dr. Shepherd.
Her post-op c.T.S are back.
Let me see them.
I...
Shouldn't.
Kepner, I am Dr. Shepherd.
Uh... so, we repaired the subdural bleed, but -- that is a big aneurysm.
Yeah.
It's grown.
It's way bigger than it was before.
Okay, book an O.R. and scrub in.
Okay.
I'll let her know.
No, with me, Kepner.
You're gonna scrub in with me.
[ Chuckling ] It's her patient.
Well, it just got too big for her.
Tell her or don't tell her.
Just prep an O.R. and scrub in.
Okay.
So, now what are you gonna do?
Go talk to her?
Well, I called Richard, and he's coming over.
Is that okay?
Yeah, sure.
It's just, you know...
We've got this board meeting thing, and I don't want to rush you, but I got to go get ready, and you got to be at this meeting, too.
Alex, you're prepared.
Your speech is great.
Why are you so -- because I want this, mer.
You know?
I don't just need a job.
Yang thought I could do something bigger, and for the first time, I feel like I can, too.
You know, I-I feel like I should really...
[ Sighs ] Like I have something to offer.
And I'm scared to death, and I don't want it to go like crap, all right?
[ Knock on door ]
Take all the time you need.
[ Footsteps depart ]
Thank you.
When did you know?
I found out the night I met Maggie Pierce.
You didn't know?
Ellis didn't tell you?
Believe me, don't you think...
When Pierce asked about your mother,
I felt like I was being hit by a car.
And when she asked about you...
I...
When was that?
The night of the mass casualty -- the mall explosion.
That was a week ago.
So, you knew I had a sister and you had a daughter, and you didn't tell me?
You didn't tell her.
I tried.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Don't you think I want to?
I tried.
I tried again today.
Well, when are you planning on doing it?
I would have liked to do it 30 years ago!
I would like to have been a father!
To know my child!
To have a say!
But your mother stole that chance from me.
Gown and glove me.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you!
Derek:
Suction.
Amy, you don't have to scrub in.
I want to be sterile when I come over there and stick that bovie in your eye.
Kepner, move!
You're on my list.
You have put me in an awful position.
Amy, he never had a good prognosis.
I went endovascularly to fix the aneurysm, but he starting re-bleeding.
I can see that.
Fibrin glue.
Now, why is that suction not working?
Okay, can somebody change the canister?
Man:
Got it.
[ Monitors beeping rapidly ] Amy...
I see it.
100 of mannitol, 125 of solu-medrol.
He's gonna herniate.
He may not have time to herniate!
He's in florid d.I.C. He's not clotting anymore.
Knox, check his pupils.
Dr. knox:
Fixed and dilated.
There's no gag reflex.
[ Instruments clatter ]
He's probably already brain-dead.
[ Beeping continues ]
The next thing I heard, she had moved you to Boston.
She never said a thing to me about being pregnant.
I had no choice in the matter.
I -- she knew, and -- and she left.
I'm sorry.
It's just...
We had an amazing day today.
And she's someone I'd very much like to know.
So, she came here looking for answers about her biological mother.
You are her answer.
You have to tell her.
Don't make her wait.
I mean, Ellis made the decision for you.
Don't do that to Pierce.
[ Monitor beeping ]
So, you're re-routing the deep peroneal with the biceps femoris?
Exactly.
You know, if you made this process part of the initial amputation, you could cut out the second surgery altogether.
Huh.
Yeah.
Add -- what -- 2, 3 minutes to the initial surgery?
That could make a world of difference.
That's a great idea, actually.
Thanks.
Avery, did I mention that hunt and I are starting a special project with veterans?
We are?
We are.
We are taking a chunk of my research money and focusing it on prosthetics for vets -- free, pain-free, right?
Right.
Right.
That sounds great.
That is good for the hospital.
Good work, guys.
You want in?
I mean, unless you're too busy with butt implants, hall monitoring.
Yeah, well, I guess you would benefit from having a good plastics guy who knows nerves.
Ew.
Ew.
That was so weak.
Did you see him trying to pretend he already had friends on the playground?
Yeah, don't pretend that you have friends on the playground.
Aw.
He tried to be cool.
Don't try to be cool.
It's sad.
Don't try to be cool.
Shut up.
[ Laughs ]
[ Siren walls ]
Adding on this reinnervation, it revolutionizes the whole thing.
I mean, the potential for control these patients can have is -- is -- [ laughs ] It's incredible.
I mean, I could change the way the world does amputations.
Sounds like you really want to do this.
I-I do.
[ Both laugh ] I do!
And I know it'll take so much time, and -- and we'll be stretched so, so thin.
But I really think that -- so, wait.
So, are you saying that maybe we should wait on this baby?
What?
No.
No, no.
Why would you say that?
No.
Because you just said it was gonna be too much to juggle.
And you're supposed to say, "it's not a problem.
"You can do it, Callie.
We can do it all."
You're -- you're supposed to support me the way that I've been supporting you ever since you decided you needed to start this fellowship.
But what if we can't?
I mean, what if we can't do anything and everything?
Are you saying you don't want to...
Are you saying you don't want a baby?
'Cause, then, w-what are we doing here?
Why -- why are we meeting with this lady who's gonna help us find someone to help us make a baby if you don't want a baby?
Don't put words in my mouth.
This was my idea.
I -- yeah, but y-you don't want to carry it, and then I couldn't, and you still didn't want to carry it, and then we find this, and then you find something else to do.
Oh, my God.
It's so obvious.
I can't believe it.
Say it.
Just say the words.
You don't want a baby.
Hi.
35-year-old male admitted status post-ejection from a motorcycle without a helmet.
Head C.T. revealed -- [ sighs ]
What?
I'll do the op note if you want.
You gonna steal this part, too?
Stealing?
No, I'm just trying to help.
This guy was a lost cause.
Whether he was or wasn't, he was my responsibility, and I didn't need your help, and I don't need any more of your bullying.
Bullying?
I am trying to be nice.
Look, I get it!
You were king of all neurosurgeons, right hand to the president.
And now you can't have that, so you need to be king of the hospital and kick around the peons.
You of all people should understand that this was the future of neuroscience.
I mean, this is what we would've dreamt of in med school if we'd thought it was even possible that it could be done.
Then you shouldn't have given it up.
But the least you can do is stop stomping around here punishing people for a choice you made.
I didn't make a choice.
Meredith made a choice and backed me into a corner.
And because I love my kids and I love my wife and I want to do what's best for her --
I do.
I want to give her everything.
But something like this will not come again.
This is it.
This is as high as I go.
I have never taken a step back in my career ever.
I've never felt like this before, and I feel like she forced me.
Okay, well, I know the feeling, because it is happening to me right now.
I'm -
- I'm not trying to -- no, I know that you're not trying to, but you are, Derek!
You are doing it to me.
And Meredith -- you say that you want her to have everything, but not if it interferes with you having your everything.
And it is not fair, and I am saying no, too, because you have to live with the choices you make.
I am trying to.
I am trying.
[ Sniffles ]
I know.
We're all trying.
[ Sniffles ]
It's just, no one wants to give up...
Or give in.
And no one should.
Right?
[ Monitor beeping ]
Hey.
Uh, time for the board meeting.
Mm.
Okay.
[ Sighs ] How's our masterpiece doing?
Good.
He's good.
Great.
You coming?
Yeah, no, I'm just gonna be a minute.
I'm, um...
Just reviewing his chart.
Want to make sure everything's perfect since they are gonna be teaching this in med schools.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Chuckles ] I know, right?
It's crazy.
Yeah.
Let's go.
I'll make sure that she gets there.
Uh, a-all right, fine.
Don't be late.
Um, a-and actually, the three of us, we should, you know, meet -- get together, talk about timelines, protocol.
Yeah, I'll fill you in on the funding stuff, and we'll figure out a subject pipeline.
Okay.
You okay?
[ Sniffles ]
[ Voice breaking ] Yeah.
I just, um...
[ Whimpers ]
I need something to be good, too.
[ Sobs ]
[ Sobs ]
Okay. [ Clears throat ]
Ugh.
All right.
How sobby do I look?
[ Chuckles ] 1 to 10.
Mm... 6.
Uggggh. [ Chuckles ]
Okay. [ Laughs ]
So, how'd it go today?
Did Meredith help you with your speech?
Uh, not really.
If this doesn't work out, I hear radioshack's hiring.
[ Chuckles ] She must have helped some.
I mean, you guys were at the house together all day.
Yeah, well, she's got a lot of stuff going on.
Do I have pit stains?
What kind of stuff?
Oh, nothing.
Don't worry about it.
You sure I look okay?
Yeah.
You look great.
Dr. Karev.
Dr. Bailey.
I'll tell them you're on your way.
Pierce?
Hey!
Dr. Webber!
Did you check in on our impalement patient?
He is doing great!
I need to tell you something.
I should have told you sooner.
Okay.
Ellis Grey and I knew each other -- very well.
We had a relationship -- oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Stop talking.
It's funny, but that is the first thing I thought when we first spoke and you told me that you'd known my mother.
I thought, "what if it's him?"
[ Chuckling ] But then you never said anything.
And then days went by, and you still never said anything, so I thought it couldn't possibly be true, because what kind of person would do something like that -- would let me sit there and talk like an idiot
and never speak up?
No one decent.
No one honest.
A coward.
The only reason that you would do something like that...
Is if you'd known about me all along and never wanted me, either.
No.
No, that's not true.
That's not -- why should I believe you?
Why should I believe a word you say to me?
!
Well, this must've been a nightmare for you, me showing up here like this.
Don't worry -- it has been worse for me.
Good night, Dr. Webber.
Meredith:
Surgeons are bred to be invulnerable.
It's very hard to lay ourselves bare.
Hey.
How are you feeling?
Hey.
Uh, not great.
Weird day.
You don't have a fever.
You still sick?
No, I-I wasn't sick.
I-I'm -
- I am a little drunk, though.
You're drunk?
Yes.
I was at Alex's -- okay, Meredith, you got to help me.
I-I-I-I'm trying to understand.
Okay, listen, this crazy thing is happening -- you said you had to stay here to make the most of your career.
Just listen to me.
Wait -- so, I gave up the brain mapping initiative so you can play hooky and get drunk with your friends?
This is why we're staying in Seattle?
Because we know exactly how deep some injuries can go.
¶ ...is a waiting game ¶
but vulnerability isn't the opposite of strength.
It's a necessary part.
¶ What if it only gets colder?
¶ we have to force ourselves to open up to expose ourselves to offer up everything we have... ¶ What if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage?
¶ ...and just pray that it's good enough.
I'm sure you did fine.
Sure are taking a long time.
Alex?
¶ ...is a waiting game ¶
¶ what if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage?
¶ [ sighs ]
Otherwise...
We'll never succeed.
¶ I don't want to say your love is a waiting game ¶ congratulations.
I -- wait.
Karev?
Bailey?
Wha-- hey!
There she is.
Hey.
Congratulations.
Bailey:
Oh, my...
Meredith:
On an operating table, a person is at his most vulnerable...
naked, exposed.
I do not need another sister.
- Get out.
- I mean, she's a lying liar.
I would know if my mother were pregnant when I was 5.
My mother was not pregnant when I was 5.
- Get out.
- She's, like, psycho, like a stalker.
I'm being stalked.
Alex, this is criminal.
I mean, you...
- what's your problem?
- Get out!
I'm naked here!
Okay, so what?
I've seen it before!
No big deal!
I'm in crisis!
Okay, fine.
It's... your junk is spectacular.
Jo is a very lucky girl.
Can we get back to me now?
Why are you making that face?
Mer, I realize that I said I would take over as your person.
Maybe that means I have to buy your tampons and act like your husband's hair is special and crap.
But I have a very important presentation to make to the board today to get a job, which I need because I got fired by Dr. Butthole!
I have been practicing all night.
I am sleep-deprived.
I need to shower... alone... and focus!
- You didn't even hear what I said!
- No.
And I don't care.
The new cardio chief thinks she's my biological sister.
She what?
Wait.
What?
!
That's insane.
Thank you.
He's in the shower, and she's in the bathroom with him while he's in the shower.
So, go in there with them.
[Chuckling] No!
I am not going in there.
You're the girlfriend.
No.
Yeah, I am, but I'm not.
They're this little team together.
They are war buddies, and I don't fit.
And then they look at me...
well, she looks at me... like I'm just the stupid, naked girl in Alex's bed.
So go be the stupid, naked girl in Alex's shower.
I am a doctor.
I am a surgeon.
I deserve respect.
You're a girl in her pajamas with her ear to the door of a bathroom.
How much respect can anyone give you right now?
She stole my Alex.
You know what?
I miss Cristina Yang.
When Cristina Yang was here, nobody stole my Alex.
Oh, my God.
You're scared of Meredith Grey.
- [Gasps] No, I'm not.
Are you?
- No.
Hey.
Hi, Dr. Grey.
Tell Alex I'll be downstairs.
And if anybody asks you, I am sick.
♪ I've tried to make the best of things ♪
Skin is not a very tough armor.
It's soft, easily broken.
Callie:
Okay, I'm only here to give a speech on residual limb health, and that is it.
That is it.
Uh, yeah, I got to pull back, okay?
We have a kid.
Arizona is starting a fellowship.
We're trying to have another kid.
I am stretched out far too thin.
I completely understand.
I said no already.
I know that.
You're just gonna meet a couple guys.
Come on.
[Indistinct conversations]
[Sighs] Navy seals, green berets, army rangers.
Wounded warriors from the most badass specialized ops forces in the U.S. military.
But... [Sighs] you're too busy to help our nation's heroes, so...
I do not like you.
[Chuckles]
Then I directed the RFA needle to where the blood supply entered the abnormal parabiotic tissue mass.
To interrupt the blood flow to the abnormal fetus.
Yes.
Then I removed excess amniotic fluid.
Nice.
And then she delivered full-term?
She did... months after I completed the operation that I'm telling you about.
Why are you not taking notes?
Oh.
Sorry.
I thought we were just, you know, talking.
[Chuckles] And I thought you were my fellow.
I am... completely.
[Chuckling] No, I'm so excited to be your fellow.
I just need a little...
little time to get up to speed, you know, like four... three... three weeks.
Yeah, 'cause I have a lot of cases on my...
Dr. Robbins, for the purposes of this fellowship, we are not peers.
And four weeks is 10% of the average gestational age.
In that amount of time, a fetus's lungs become a fully functioning organ.
Everything in utero happens at hyper speed.
And the sooner you get up to that speed, the better.
Get a notepad.
Avery, um, I've got a backlog of some cases.
Amy's doing a great job, but there's some stuff I got to get on top of.
So, you need help?
I need you to reschedule this meeting for tonight.
No.
Oh, are we rescheduling the meeting?
Oh, thank God, because Callie and I have an appointment tonight, and apparently, I've already started my fellowship.
We are not rescheduling the meeting.
- Tomorrow work for you?
- No, tomorrow's bad.
Um, Thursday?
Listen to me speak, all right?
We are voting on a new member of the board.
It's happening tonight.
Understood?
Amelia:
Derek!
Derek, why is there suddenly an order for carbamazepine in Eric Schneider's chart?
He needed a good anti-convulsant.
And I had already written him one for valproic acid.
You can't go around writing orders on my patients.
I'm doing my job.
No, you are doing my job.
I am chief of neurosurgery.
If you have a problem with that, you should take it up with the board.
Until then, I will call you when I need you.
[Elevator bell dings]
What happened to the two diverting loop ileostomies
I had today?
You're welcome.
No, I-I-I rearranged your cases so you had the easiest day possible.
You are going up against Karev, so I figured you'd want plenty of time to practice your board presentation.
I don't need to practice.
I need my schedule back the way it was.
You sure, though?
Karev's pretty tight with some board members.
So am I.
Well, Meredith Grey was in the bathroom with Karev this morning.
- Well, not that tight.
- That's what I'm saying.
Look, Edwards... [Sighs]
I am going to walk in there and tell the truth.
I deserve this.
And if any one of them has the misguided impression that there is any choice at all in this matter,
I will set that person on the righteous path before he or she can reveal him- or herself as a moron.
[Cellphone chimes, vibrates]
Oh.
Pileup on I-5.
Trauma coming in.
Why are they paging me?
Isn't Grey on the pit today?
She's sick.
If my mother were pregnant, I would have known.
Adoption agency made a mistake?
And randomly put the name "Ellis Grey" on a birth certificate?
I don't think so.
Pierce has got to want something.
Maybe she thinks there's money to inherit.
[Scoffs] The only thing you inherit in this family is Alzheimer's.
[Chuckles] Whoa.
Dark.
Good one, though, huh?
Yeah.
She's not my sister.
You know who you should ask about this?
The guy who was banging your mom back then.
I'm not asking Richard Webber.
All I'm saying is, he's got skin in the game.
Disgusting.
He's the only living person who would know if it's true.
Richard Webber is like a second father to me, and if he knew that I had a sister, he would tell me!
[Elevator bell dings]
[Elevator doors close]
[Clears throat]
Paged to the E.R.?
Yes.
You?
Mm-hmm.
Sounds big.
Mm-hmm.
I told her last night.
Oh.
How'd it go?
Could have gone better.
[Elevator bell dings]
[Indistinct shouting]
What the hell is this?
What's going on?
37-year-old male rear-ended a lumber truck.
April:
Anyone who is not treating this patient, please move out of the way.
Bailey:
Hey, hey, hey!
You heard the woman!
This is not a spectacle for your amusement.
Maggie:
Holy...
- Cool!
- Edwards!
I'm sorry.
[Siren wailing in distance]
[Camera shutters clicking]
Man:
Get a close-up!
[Camera shutter clicks]
S11E03 Got to Be Real
Okay, we need to get this man on his back in less than 60 seconds.
Got to work faster.
One more inch to the right, he'd be D.O.A.
How you want to proceed?
Ultrasound's negative for fluid around the heart, so I would do a laparotomy.
Yeah?
[Coughing] [Monitors beeping rapidly]
His airway is compromised.
He needs a chest tube and intubation now.
Yeah, we're almost done here, okay?
- It'll be safer on his back.
- No, there's no time.
I'll have to go in nasally. 7-0 E.T. Tube?
Charlie, I hate to tell you this, but your day is actually about to get a little worse.
Hold the work!
Hold on, Charlie.
Hold on.
All right.
- Almost there.
- Go ahead.
[Charlie groaning]
- Okay, push 100 please.
- Pushing.
- Well done, doctor.
- Sorry?
I said it's good.
Uh, okay.
He's clear.
On his back on my count.
One... two... and three.
You want to give me a robot leg, like the Terminator?
[Chuckles] Robotic, more like the six-million-dollar man.
Uh, actually, it costs a little more than that.
But the project is fully funded, all expenses paid.
The leg will be free.
A free six-million-dollar robot leg?
[Chuckles] Listen.
I've been through three prosthetic legs.
Each one hurt more than the last.
Why is this so...
Well, the leg is entirely painless.
[Chuckles] Free, pain-free robot leg?
Sounds made up.
[Chuckles] It was made up... by Dr. Torres.
It is cutting-edge technology.
Dr. Torres is a genius.
You'll be amazed at this... [chuckling] Okay, let's just slow down for a minute.
We still have to run a number of tests to make sure you're even a candidate for the study.
[Clears throat]
But, again, the program is fully funded.
Unbelievable.
Major Hunt was right.
He's been going on and on about you.
[Chuckles] Yeah, I bet.
[Sighs]
I told him how busy I am.
He knows.
He knows my plate is full.
He just doesn't care.
I am an attending with an entire service of my own.
Herman and I have shared dozens of patients before.
Oh, and now he's just bringing this guy to my lab, right?
Like I'm gonna say no to a guy who gave up his leg for our country.
She has me reviewing journals and doing skills labs.
I have a case report that's due by 4:00.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I have a neuroblastoma to remove at 4:00.
Wait.
Is this your way of telling me that you're canceling our meeting with the surrogacy agency tonight?
What?
No!
W... no, I will...
I will figure that out.
- Okay.
- I just...
[Sighs] Say something to help me.
You own a hospital.
You are a raising a beautiful girl.
You save babies.
You're gonna save more, right?
You can do this, too.
If anyone can, you can.
[Cellphone rings] Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
Um, listen, I will meet you at the agency with a smile on my face.
And we will get ourselves a new baby.
[Chuckles] Yeah.
A.B.C.'S intact.
I need to assess his GCS.
If you'd be quiet, he's trying to talk now.
Sir, can you tell me your name?
What's your name?
- Steve.
- Forget your helmet today, Steve?
Aah.
It hurts.
I'm giving you something for the pain.
You might start to feel sleepy now.
It's a depressed skull fracture.
It is pretty deep.
We're gonna need a C.T.
And because of the position, probably an angio.
I can make that decision if you'll give me room to look.
Amy, I don't think he's gonna make it, and it's gonna get ugly, so let me do it.
Ah.
Because only you can save him now.
Screw you.
I've got him.
Maybe you can both take him...
like a team, or a family.
I have him.
Kepner, you'll assist.
Let's take him up to C.T.
The African outreach program has given 34 kids excellent outcomes and a chance they never would have had.
And it gave me something, too.
Starting that program gave me a sense of ownership and a... and a level of passion that I didn't know I could have.
I have this passion for this hospital.
I look forward to...
Mer.
Huh?
Yeah, it's great.
You're gonna vote on this.
I don't want to blow this.
And it's Bailey.
Bailey did deliver my baby and save my life.
What have you ever done?
Why aren't you at your own house, drinking and having bitch baby tears about your fake sister with your husband?
Derek doesn't know.
He doesn't know?
I can't talk to him right now.
Oh, come on.
He gave up the job in D.C.
He's staying, and you're still mad?
- You won.
- No.
I never asked him to stay.
This wasn't a compromise.
I didn't win.
He forfeited, so we both lost.
So you're not talking to him?
He's walking around like he's a martyr, waiting for me to be grateful.
I am not grateful.
My career is just as important as his!
I'm the sun.
I'm the sun.
And he can go suck it!
I'm the sun.
All right.
We're done.
Hey!
You can sit here and get drunk and then vomit and cry, and I can never get any prep for my presentation done, or we can do something about this.
You want to do something about this?
Jeff:
It's so light.
[Chuckles]
It's a 100% titanium body d sensors.
But before we can get you in a leg like this, we need your muscles and nerves to interface with the sensors.
So, this electromyogram will show spikes when your muscles contract and then go flat when they rest, okay?
All right.
Go ahead and flex for me, Jeff.
When this is done, I get to keep it?
Well, it's all funded, including follow-up, so...
Yes. [Chuckles]
Sorry.
I-I know how that sounds.
It's just, all I wanted was to be a ranger, you know?
I still dream about it all the time... pack on my back, running, my team.
Then I wake up and get out of bed.
I try to stand, and I forget about it.
So, you know, when you say "free robot leg,"
I think I'm still dreaming of running with the guys.
- Jeff, are you still flexing?
- Yeah.
- Take a picture of it?
- Yeah.
My mom is gonna freak.
Jeff, flex harder for me.
What?
I should be seeing readings.
What... what's going on?
Uh, w-we're just having trouble with the E.M.G.
No, no. [Chuckles] It's not the E.M.G.
- Jeff, I'm...
- Dr. Torres, can talk to you for a moment?
Excuse us, Jeff.
That was inappropriate.
Inappropriate?
You were about to reject him from the study.
Yes.
You saw those readings.
Look, the way his amputation was performed, there's no way this will work.
Okay, it's a crappy amputation, Owen.
Probably because it was done in less-than-ideal circumstances.
- He is a soldier, Callie.
- I know that, okay?
I feel bad about that, all right?
I care about that.
I really do.
You know who doesn't care?
You know who doesn't give a damn about his service?
The robot leg.
All the robot cares about is that the nerves in his leg aren't communicating with his muscles, which means they can't communicate with the sensors in the prosthesis, which means the robot leg won't work.
Then you can find a way to help him.
Just... just figure it out.
I'm sorry.
Are you not listening to me, Owen?
Are you deliberately being obtuse?
I just told you his nerves...
Just fix it.
Just get back in there...
- I just told you I can't!
- Fix it!
That is an order!
[Chuckling] Oh, an order?
- Who... who are you...
General Patton?
- I'm your chief of surgery.
On the surgical floor, you e my chief.
In my lab, funded by the money that I procured, I am in charge!
- Are we clear?
!
- No, you don't get these guys' hopes up and then leave them with nothing!
No, no, no.
No, I didn't do that, Owen.
You did that.
You're the one out there running your mouth at the rehab center about "free, pain-free six-million-dollar man robot legs!"
I'm about to go in there and crush his dreams because of you!
[Sighs]
Richard:
We're gonna pull on my count.
We ready?
One...
Two...
Three.
Easy.
Easy.
[Monitors beeping]
Okay, Kelly clamp.
- Bailey:
Apply pressure.
- Stephanie:
Got it.
Richard:
More suction.
I need to see or feel.
- Okay.
- Whoa.
That's got to be the fastest splenectomy I've ever seen.
Yeah, this isn't my first rodeo.
I'm hope I'm that fast someday.
You will be.
In about 4,000 rodeos.
[Chuckles]
♪ Okay, so, you just ♪
♪ Go around breaking hearts just to see... ♪
So, I hear you and Hunt had a little episode in the hallway.
[Scoffs] He told on me.
You can write me up all you want for insubordination, but I stand by the fact that I do not take orders regarding my own lab.
And Hunt can kiss my...
I'm not asking you to take orders in your own lab.
What I'm asking is maybe that you not have a screaming match in the middle of the hallways of the hospital, because when members of the board cause a scene,
I have to stop practicing medicine, which I love doing, and become a hall monitor, which I don't really love doing.
I got to come down here and lecture you about responsibility and honor and crap I really don't want to be lecturing you about.
You know, I'm down to three procedures a day, okay?
If I'm lucky.
Not even long procedures.
I'm sucking fat, lifting boobs, butts.
Butt implants are huge.
[Sighs] I just want a good, intense, smart surgery.
You know, like, uh, the ones where your feet hurt, when your feet hurt because you've been on them for hours.
Or your mind hurts because you've had to improvise and paint... surgeries of joy.
But no, I can't have those, 'cause I run the board.
Hmm.
Grey calls in sick.
Your wife tries to give up peds surgery on me.
And boy Shepherd's in a pissing match with girl Shepherd, which they won't admit.
And Yang screws us with Bailey versus Karev.
And I think Richard has the hots for the new cardio God,
Maggie or whatever?
Which is gross, 'cause she is 12.
So, now you and Hunt are running around screaming at each other?
I don't get to be a surgeon.
I'm a hall monitor.
I will stop screaming in the hallways.
[Sighs]
All right, what's wrong?
Hunt's got this bug up his butt about a candidate for my robotic limb project and as much as he want it to happened those nerves are not communicate with those muscles.
And there is nothing I can do about it.
I can.
Targeted muscle reinnervation.
I create an alternate traffic route for the nerve signals.
It's like, um, if there's construction on the highway, you pick a side street, right?
I can dissect a nerve at its current location...
- Uh-huh...
- And rewire it wherever you need it.
Sh.
Connection established.
[Chuckles]
You are wasted as a hall monitor.
I know!
[Laughs]
Well...
I am done here.
Lung crisis averted.
Okay.
Partial gastrectomy and splenectomy done.
We can start the diaphragm repair.
This was, I have to say, the most fun I have had since I got here.
Well, you've done some very good work.
Me?
You... that was amazing.
What was that... a-a 15-second splenectomy?
Well, 20.
18.
I might have stolen a peek at the clock.
Well, it was inspiring.
I'm glad I was here.
Thank you all.
I will check on him in post-op.
Bailey:
The bowels seem to be intact, but we're gonna run it again just to be sure.
- Bailey, you have this?
- Indeed, we do.

I need your username and password.
This is illegal.
We're just logging into the hospital system.
To get Maggie Pierce's personnel file to get her date of birth, which is illegal.
Yeah, so is pretending to be someone you're not.
Now, put in your password.
Once we figure out when she was born, there's got to be something we can use to prove that your mom wasn't pregnant at the time... you know, photos or a video or something.
You can call Pierce's bluff.
You're a very different person than Cristina.
Cristina and I would just be dancing by now.
Yeah.
I know.
Here we go.
Look at that.
Pierce's birthday...
November 22, 1983.
So, basically, your mom would have been knocked around, uh... spring of '83.
What was going on in the spring of '83?
What?
That's when she tried to kill herself.
Right so, that's done.
Maybe you want to practice your speech on me.
Or maybe I want to focus on making sure Mr. Hays is stable post-op.
- But Karev...
- Okay, Edwards, I am afraid of snakes.
I'm afraid of large spiders.
And while it might not be rational,
I am occasional afraid there might be a shark
- waiting for me in a public swimming pool.
- Why would be there a shark waiting for you?
I said it wasn't rational.
I am afraid of those things.
What I am not afraid of is Alex Karev.
You should be afraid of everyone else.
Say more.
Alex Karev is the closest thing Meredith Grey has to a brother.
He lives in her old house.
He started a program that brought a daughter into her life.
Robbins is Karev's mentor.
Torres is married to Robbins.
So whoo!
Team Karev.
Jackson Avery... friend of Alex Karev.
We used to double-date.
Speaking of which, Avery has a history of making wrong choices.
[Sighs]
Oh.
Hey, Dr. Herman.
Sorry I don't have that case report in to you yet.
I've got this neuroblastoma on this baby, and the mom got really overreactive, and so I-I had to reassure her.
Dr. Robbins, in fetal surgery, every patient you treat will come encased in a mother... a mother whose heightened state of concern is a biological and evolutionary necessity.
If you lack the basic skills to...
No, I don't.
I don't.
No.
No.
Huh-unh. [Chuckles]
Moms are kind of like my thing.
I'm great with moms.
I actually teach other people how to be great with moms.
Yeah, no, you can ask anyone.
I need your start paperwork.
Right.
I just need to get caught up on that.
[Sighs]
- I am great with moms!
- I know!
It was right after that she moved us to Boston.
I mean, I was 5.
All my memories of Boston are so hazy.
Do you remember your mom getting suddenly fat, then suddenly not fat?
Alex, that whole time was just a blur.
Everything that happened after she tried to kill herself was just a blur for me.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Let's just keep working on your speech.
I'm not working on my speech.
I'm going through the emergency room admittance for Seattle Grace of June of 1983.
What?
How?
We computerized this like two years ago.
How you on the board and I am not?
Wait right there.
There it is.
Well, don't click on it, because I'm not...
I'm not sure I'm ready to see this.
Are you ever ready for this stuff?
Patient admitted with wrist laceras and loss of blood.
Scroll on, scroll on.
- Beta-HCG came back positive.
- She was pregnant.
Look in the notes.
"Advised patient of pregnancy.
Patient was unaware of pregnancy when admitted."
She's my sister.
I owe you an apology. [Sighs]
Were you going to give me one, or is this just a heads-up?
[Scoffs]
I'm sorry, okay?
- We're okay?
- No!
N... come back here!
Come back and say a bunch of crap to make me understand why you were yelling at me and giving me orders and generally being a big old ass.
No, we're not okay.
♪ What if I said I would break your heart?
♪
I need something to be... good.
To...
I need something to feel right.
Okay, I'm not depressed.
I'm not... my heart is not broken.
I'm not grieving.
She's not dead.
She's out there.
[Sighs] She's living out her dreams.
She's living out her dreams and I know...
I know she's happy, and that makes me feel proud for her.
But there is this other feeling that doesn't completely feel fair or right or good.
She goes on, day in and day out, happy, without me.
But every morning, I wake up, and there's this pit, this...
[Sighs] feeling here that...
Maybe my dreams are over maybe I had my dreams and they're over now.
And I'm gonna be this single guy.
No wife, no kids, no family.
She was my family.
Hmm.
And now she's someplace else, and I let her go, and...
It's good that I did.
I mean, it's better... for her.
But for me...
So I need something to be good.
I need a reason to get up every morning, to not crawl back to that cave that I was in before I met her.
I mean, you know she saved me?
You were there.
You remember how I was.
I was...
I was... dark.
That war made me dark.
[Sighs]
And that darkness... it is still in me.
She just lit it up.
So I just thought...
I just thought...
Maybe to beat back that darkness,
I would...
I would do some good.
I'd just... do something good.
I'd go be with those guys who'd remind me...
[Sighs] I just need something to be good.
That's why I dragged you to that rehab center.
That's why I, um...
[Clears throat, sniffles]
Wanted you to help.
That's why I pushed too hard, and t-that's it.
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore, okay?
So just... just say that we're okay, okay?
Okay.
- Great.
- Owen?
For God's sakes, Callie.
No, I just...
I was just gonna ask if you wanted to...
I was just gonna ask if you wanted to watch Jeff's surgery.
Jackson's doing a little targeted muscle reinnervation.
He's moving the nerves to where they can talk to the robot sensors.
[Chuckle]
Want to watch?
How's our motorcycle guy?
My motorcycle guy?
I fixed him, like a boss.
Like your boss, actually.
Amy, you're an excellent surgeon.
You have nothing to prove.
Oh, I know I don't.
But if you try and fight me over the leadership of this department, you will lose.
My resume will kick your resume's ass.
I am better than you.
Oh, my God, Derek.
- There is no limit to your narcissist...
- I have been playing this game longer than you at a much higher level.
That is all there is to it.
[Chuckles] Bite me.
[Sighs deeply]
Where did she go?
Dr. Shepherd?
- I'm Dr. Shepherd.
- Yeah, I-I know.
Ms. Dr. Shepherd.
- Her post-op C.T.S are back.
- Let me see them.
I...shouldn't.
Kepner, I am Dr. Shepherd.
Uh...
So, we repaired the subdural bleed, but...
That is a big aneurysm.
Yeah.
It's grown.
It's way bigger than it was before.
- Okay, book an O.R. and scrub in.
- Okay.
I'll let her know.
No, with me, Kepner.
You're gonna scrub in with me.
- [Chuckling] It's her patient.
- Well, it just got too big for her.
Tell her or don't tell her.
Just prep an O.R. and scrub in.
Okay.
So, now what are you gonna do?
Go talk to her?
Well, I called Richard, and he's coming over.
Is that okay?
Yeah, sure.
It's just, you know...
We've got this board meeting thing, and I don't want to rush you, but I got to go get ready, and you got to be at this meeting, too.
Alex, you're prepared.
Your speech is great.
- Why are you so...
- Because I want this, Mer.
You know?
I don't just need a job.
Yang thought I could do something bigger, and for the first time, I feel like I can, too.
You know, I-I feel like I should really...
[Sighs] Like I have something to offer.
And I'm scared to death, and I don't want it to go like crap, all right?
[Knock on door]
Take all the time you need.
[Footsteps depart]
Thank you.
When did you know?
I found out the night I met Maggie Pierce.
You didn't know?
Ellis didn't tell you?
Believe me, don't you think...
When Pierce asked about your mother,
I felt like I was being hit by a car.
And when she asked about you...
I...
When was that?
The night of the mass casualty... the mall explosion.
That was a week ago.
So, you knew I had a sister and you had a daughter, and you didn't tell me?
- You didn't tell her.
- I tried.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Don't you think I want to?
I tried.
I tried again today.
Well, when are you planning on doing it?
I would have liked to do it 30 years ago!
I would like to have been a father!
To know my child!
To have a say!
But your mother stole that chance from me.
Gown and glove me.
I don't believe you.
I don't believe you!
Derek:
Suction.
Amy, you don't have to scrub in.
I want to be sterile when I come over there and stick that bovie in your eye.
- Kepner, move!
You're on my list.
- You have put me in an awful position.
Amy, he never had a good prognosis.
I went endovascularly to fix the aneurysm,
- but he starting re-bleeding.
- I can see that.
Fibrin glue.
Now, why is that suction not working?
Okay, can somebody change the canister?
Man:
Got it.
[Monitors beeping rapidly] Amy...
I see it.
100 of Mannitol, 125 of Solu-Medrol.
- He's gonna herniate.
- He may not have time to herniate!
He's in florid D.I.C. He's not clotting anymore.
Knox, check his pupils.
Dr. Knox:
Fixed and dilated.
There's no gag reflex.
[Instruments clatter]
He's probably already brain-dead.
[Beeping continues]
The next thing I heard, she had moved you to Boston.
She never said a thing to me about being pregnant.
I had no choice in the matter.
I...
She knew, and... and she left.
I'm sorry.
It's just...
We had an amazing day today.
And she's someone I'd very much like to know.
So, she came here looking for answers about her biological mother.
You are her answer.
You have to tell her.
Don't make her wait.
I mean, Ellis made the decision for you.
Don't do that to Pierce.
[Monitor beeping]
So, you're re-routing the deep peroneal with the biceps femoris?
Exactly.
You know, if you made this process part of the initial amputation, you could cut out the second surgery altogether.
Huh.
Yeah.
Add... what...
2, 3 minutes to the initial surgery?
That could make a world of difference.
That's a great idea, actually.
Thanks.
Avery, did I mention that Hunt and I are starting a special project with veterans?
- We are?
- We are.
We are taking a chunk of my research money and focusing it on prosthetics for vets... free, pain-free, right?
Right.
Right.
That sounds great.
That is good for the hospital.
Good work, guys.
You want in?
I mean, unless you're too busy with butt implants, hall monitoring.
Yeah, well, I guess you would benefit from having a good plastics guy who knows nerves.
Ew.
Ew.
That was so weak.
Did you see him trying to pretend he already had friends on the playground?
Yeah, don't pretend that you have friends on the playground.
Aw.
He tried to be cool.
Don't try to be cool.
It's sad.
Don't try to be cool.
Shut up.
[Laughs]
[Siren walls]
Adding on this reinnervation, it revolutionizes the whole thing.
I mean, the potential for control these patients can have is... is... [laughs] It's incredible.
I mean, I could change the way the world does amputations.
Sounds like you really want to do this.
I-I do.
[Both laugh] I do!
And I know it'll take so much time, and... and we'll be stretched so, so thin.
- But I really think that...
- So, wait.
So, are you saying that maybe we should wait on this baby?
What?
No.
No, no.
Why would you say that?
No.
Because you just said it was gonna be too much to juggle.
And you're supposed to say, "it's not a problem.
"You can do it, Callie.
We can do it all."
You're... you're supposed to support me the way that I've been supporting you ever since you decided you needed to start this fellowship.
But what if we can't?
I mean, what if we can't do anything and everything?
Are you saying you don't want to...
Are you saying you don't want a baby?
'Cause, then, w-what are we doing here?
Why... why are we meeting with this lady who's gonna help us find someone to help us make a baby if you don't want a baby?
Don't put words in my mouth.
This was my idea.
I...
Yeah, but y-you don't want to carry it, and then I couldn't, and you still didn't want to carry it, and then we find this, and then you find something else to do.
Oh, my God.
It's so obvious.
I can't believe it.
Say it.
Just say the words.
You don't want a baby.
Hi.
35-year-old male admitted status post-ejection from a motorcycle without a helmet.
Head C.T. revealed... [sighs]
What?
I'll do the op note if you want.
You gonna steal this part, too?
Stealing?
No, I'm just trying to help.
This guy was a lost cause.
Whether he was or wasn't, he was my responsibility, and I didn't need your help, and I don't need any more of your bullying.
Bullying?
I am trying to be nice.
Look, I get it!
You were king of all neurosurgeons, right hand to the president.
And now you can't have that, so you need to be king of the hospital and kick around the peons.
You of all people should understand that this was the future of neuroscience.
I mean, this is what we would've dreamt of in med school if we'd thought it was even possible that it could be done.
Then you shouldn't have given it up.
But the least you can do is stop stomping around here punishing people for a choice you made.
I didn't make a choice.
Meredith made a choice and backed me into a corner.
And because I love my kids and I love my wife and I want to do what's best for her...
I do.
I want to give her everything.
But something like this will not come again.
This is it.
This is as high as I go.
I have never taken a step back in my career ever.
I've never felt like this before, and I feel like she forced me.
Okay, well, I know the feeling, because it is happening to me right now.
I'm...
I'm not trying to...
No, I know that you're not trying to, but you are, Derek!
You are doing it to me.
And Meredith... you say that you want her to have everything, but not if it interferes with you having your everything.
And it is not fair, and I am saying no, too, because you have to live with the choices you make.
I am trying to.
I am trying.
[Sniffles]
I know.
We're all trying.
[Sniffles]
It's just, no one wants to give up...
Or give in.
And no one should.
Right?
Hey.
Uh, time for the board meeting.
Mm.
Okay.
[Sighs] How's our masterpiece doing?
- Good.
He's good.
- Great.
You coming?
Yeah, no, I'm just gonna be a minute.
I'm, um...
Just reviewing his chart.
Want to make sure everything's perfect since they are gonna be teaching this in med schools.
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles] I know, right?
It's crazy.
Yeah.
Let's go.
I'll make sure that she gets there.
Uh, a-all right, fine.
Don't be late.
Um, a-and actually, the three of us, we should, you know, meet... get together, talk about timelines, protocol.
Yeah, I'll fill you in on the funding stuff, and we'll figure out a subject pipeline.
Okay.
You okay?
[Sniffles]
[Voice breaking] Yeah.
I just, um...
[Whimpers]
I need something to be good, too.
[Sobs]
[Sobs]
Okay. [Clears throat]
Ugh.
All right.
How sobby do I look?
[Chuckles] 1 to 10.
Mm... 6.
Uggggh. [Chuckles]
Okay. [Laughs]
So, how'd it go today?
Did Meredith help you with your speech?
Uh, not really.
If this doesn't work out, I hear radioshack's hiring.
[Chuckles] She must have helped some.
I mean, you guys were at the house together all day.
Yeah, well, she's got a lot of stuff going on.
Do I have pit stains?
What kind of stuff?
Oh, nothing.
Don't worry about it.
You sure I look okay?
Yeah.
You look great.
Dr. Karev.
Dr. Bailey.
I'll tell them you're on your way.
Pierce?
Hey!
Dr. Webber!
Did you check in on our impalement patient?
He is doing great!
I need to tell you something.
I should have told you sooner.
Okay.
Ellis Grey and I knew each other... very well.
- We had a relationship...
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Stop talking.
It's funny, but that is the first thing I thought when we first spoke and you told me that you'd known my mother.
I thought, "what if it's him?"
[Chuckling] But then you never said anything.
And then days went by, and you still never said anything, so I thought it couldn't possibly be true, because what kind of person would do something like that... would let me sit there and talk like an idiot
and never speak up?
No one decent.
No one honest.
A coward.
The only reason that you would do something like that... is if you'd known about me all along
- and never wanted me, either.
- No.
No, that's not true.
That's not...
Why should I believe you?
Why should I believe a word you say to me?
!
Well, this must've been a nightmare for you, me showing up here like this.
Don't worry... it has been worse for me.
Good night, Dr. Webber.
Meredith:
Surgeons are bred to be invulnerable.
It's very hard to lay ourselves bare.
- Hey.
How are you feeling?
- Hey.
Uh, not great.
Weird day.
You don't have a fever.
You still sick?
No, I-I wasn't sick.
- I-I'm...
I am a little drunk, though.
- You're drunk?
- Yes.
I was at Alex's...
- Okay, Meredith, you got to help me.
I-I-I-I'm trying to understand.
Okay, listen, this crazy thing is happening...
You said you had to stay here to make the most of your career.
Just listen to me.
Wait...
so, I gave up the brain mapping initiative so you can play hooky and get drunk with your friends?
This is why we're staying in Seattle?
Because we know exactly how deep some injuries can go.

The authorities have begun hunting them down.

- (barking)
- Dad, don't do it!
- Lili, get behind me!
No!
Dad, stop it!
Enough!
All of you!

WHITE GOD
Hagen, give it back, it's not yours!
- Hup!
Good boy.
Lili!
Come on, Lili, I'll be late.
- How long is the flight?
- More than a day.
- Where will you land?
- In Sydney.
- And from there?
- By car.
Don't rip it.
Suitable for consumption.
- Professor, please accept this.
- It's not necessary.
For your daughter.
I'm not a professor anymore.
- Next week then.
- Yes, well...
You're at the sea for three months?
Ocean.
In Australia it's the ocean.
How far is the university?
- 200 meters.
- You're so lucky.
You'll be fine with Dad too.
Do you have her passport?
Thanks.
Finally!
Is it him?
- I'll be right back.
- Fine.
Wait, let me.
Will you be home for the concert?
How?
- Take good care of them.
- Them?
She brought her dog too.
I won't have any dog.
Where should I put him?
- The professor will babysit it.
- You mean Hans?
He'll be at the conference too.
Tripping up the ladder, are we?
- Don't do this to me.
- Don't start.
Come on, darling, time to go.
Obey your father, OK?
Three months is nothing.
Take care.
No kiss?
I brought this for you.
- What is it?
- A bubble-maker.
Thanks, but I'm not a kid anymore.
- What's that on your neck?
- An access card.
Can I have it?
Are you chewing gum?
No.
Okay.
Spit it out.
Twenty.
Key button. 1965.
What's this mutt doing here?
Hagen...
- You want to keep it here?
- For a while.
How long exactly?
It can't stay here.
They've posted the ruling.
Mutts have to be reported.
They're making a list now.
- I didn't know.
- Read the order.
- Mutts have to be reported.
- I'll do just that.
Thank you.
Dirty Pis-
You'll get some.
Good boy.
Lili, leave that dog alone already.
In here at least.
Why do you have the pass?
- Where should I put it?
- Why didn't you put it back?
- Where?
- You have to ask.
Give it to me.
Lili, this belongs here, OK?
- Lili, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
Lili, here you'll eat what I cook.
The dog eats dog food.
- So dig in.
- I told you I'm not hungry.
Fine, then go to bed.
Take the dog.
Come on, put your nightgown on.
Turn around then.
Which bed do you want, Lili?
- The same one as Hagen.
- Hagen?
Hagen's not sleeping in this room.
- Why?
- He's a dog, and I'm not sleeping with dogs.
Come on.
Out!
We're leaving now.
Come on, out, let's go, out.
Stay!
When will he stop?
He's not used to being alone.
I can't sleep.
- Where are you off to?
- I have to pee.
Don't go to him.
He'll stop.
Please stay here.
I'm sorry.
Sleep well.
What's up, Hagen?
What's the rush?
Good morning.
- We've received a report.
- What report?
Canine control.
About the dog.
Pardon me?
Someone reported being bitten by your dog.
I don't own a dog.
What's that then?
It's an elephant, can't you see?
Sir, this is a mixed-breed street dog.
It's not a Hungarian breed.
You have to pay a tax.
Would you like to pay now or by postal order?
I'll never own a dog.
The dog belongs to my ex-wife.
I'm not paying anyone for it.
My ex-wife doesn't live with me, so neither do her dog and its fleas!
It's a street mixed-breed.
- It's subject to a fee.
- What if I don't pay?
The dog can go to an animal shelter.
- Today.
- Yes.
So the dog won't be here next time.
It won't be here.
The dog isn't registered.
- What?
- Nothing.
- Did you sleep well?
- Uh-huh.
Get dressed.
I'll shower and then drop you off.
Hagen, come here!
We're out of here.
Come on.
Lie down!
Sit!
Sit!
Lie down!
Sit!
Sit!
Sit!
Stay!
Stay!
Lie down!
Sit!
Sit!
Sit!
Stay!
Stay!
I'll never do that to you.
Hey, relax!
Don't eat me.
Come on, Hagen.
Hagen, relax!
You have to stay put in here.
Don't be scared.
I'll be here.
Good dog.
Hello everyone.
Let's start, OK?
A bit faster, OK?
- I bet he'll bark.
- He won't.
- Wanna bet?
- He won't.
What if he does?
- He won't.
- OK, your problem.
Misi!
Misi!
Why are you rushing?
Slop!
David, practice in the sectionals, not here.
Quit laughing!
What's so funny?
From number 36 again.
Stop!
Whose dog is this?
Whose dog is this?
Whose dog is this?
- Whose dog is this?
- Mine.
Get it out of here.
At once!
Hagen, come on, we're leaving.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Racz!
You stay here!
If you leave now, don't come back!
You hear?
Racz!
Come back!
You're out for good!
What are you staring at?
Hagen, don't lick me.
I'm not in the mood.
Great.
Just what I needed.
What do you think you're doing?
I've been looking for you for ages.
- I almost called the police.
- What's your problem now?
You've lost your mind!
Get in, now!
You disappear because of a fucking dog!
Get in!
Who do you think you are?
You took that beast to school?
You wanted to take it to a shelter, and I won't take him there.
And I'm not paying your mother for it.
He's not going to a shelter.
That dog is not setting foot in the flat again.
- What if I hadn't found you?
- So what?
You think you're the Queen of England?
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm not the Queen of England!
Shut up!
I don't want to take him to a shelter!
You've got no other choice, kid.
Don't you get that I'm not taking him there?
Let's find a good home for him.
Nobody wants a stinking mutt.
That's what shelters are for.
But I don't want to take him there, don't you get it?
!
I can't believe you won't pay so they don't kill him.
You want me to throw it out?
Put it out on the street here?
Is that what you want?
Let's hear it, kid!
You want that?
You really want that?
Rather.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
You wanted it!
Should I take it to a shelter?
- Not the shelter!
- Then back you go!
Hagen, stay here!
I'll come back!
Hagen, stay here.
I'll come back.
Hagen!
Stop!
You hear?
Dad, you're such a jerk!
Let me out.
Are you deaf?
Shut up!
He'll get knocked down!
Let me out!
Get moving, you idiot!
Hagen!
Hagen!
- Dad, let me out!
- Shut up!
Let me out now, I mean it.
Lili, what are you doing?
- I'm hungry.
- Show me your hand!
Raw meat, like a dog?
What do you care what I eat?
You want to be sick?
- What if I do?
- Why do you want to be sick?
'Cause you're a jerk.
Haul ass to bed, Lili!
I'll come back for him anyway.
- Is this OK?
- I'd like half.
I'll wrap it, OK?
Goddamn you all!
Get the hell out of here!
C'mere you fleabag and I'll gut you!
Doggy!
Where are you, little monster?
I'll gobble you up!
Fuck you, bastards!
Get the catch poles.
We'll push 'em all back.
OK.
Push them inside.
Two over there.
Up there!
Have you seen a big dog?
- That way!
- Thanks!
There it is!
Come on!
Hey, this one's got a collar.
I'll bet you can't read its name.
- It doesn't hate us.
- What?
Look, it's licking my hand.
It doesn't hate us.
It doesn't get what we're doing.
It'll find out.
Motherfucker!
Two more!
Here?
Shit!
You'll work for me.
We're both hungry dogs, fuck yeah!
Fuck yeah!
Just you wait!
I'll show you who your master is.
Don't make a scene.
- Lili, apologize and sit down.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sure Lili can explain why she had that animal.
We didn't want to keep him at home.
Why not?
Because we don't need a dog like that.
Why don't you need a mutt?
- 'Cause he bit my dad.
- What?
Because he bit my dad.
Mm-hmm.
And so you took it to a shelter?
- No, he ran away.
- I can't hear you?
- No, because he ran away.
- Uh-huh.
So it's not coming here anymore.
- What do you think?
- Don't be fresh, young lady.
Answer me.
It's not coming here anymore?
No.
Will you take me back?
If you behave.
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.
I don't hold grudges.
- What's wrong now?
- Nothing.
- Is everything OK?
- Mmmmm.
Lili can come to Tannhéiuser as well.
If she wants.
- You want to?
- Mm-hmm.
From 147.
Attention!
Hagen!
Hagen!
Hagen!
Hagen!
Hagen!
Hagen!
Hagen!
What's she doing here?
Look who came to brown-nose?
- Little suction cup.
- No shit...
Let's go inside.
You didn't go to Tannhéiuser either?
No, I was just around.
- Did you find your mutt?
- Mixed-breed!
- Can I help you find it?
- Leave her alone.
I'm cold.
Let's go inside.
Let me smoke this.
- Where did you go?
- Mexikoi Road.
- Did you post many?
- Yeah.
Can I have a drag?
You don't even smoke.
- I do now.
- No, you don't!
Dry yourself.
Look at the stars.
If they don't fall, you'll survive.
Thanks.
- You know what's in Tannhéiuser?
- What?
I mean, what Tannhéiuser is about?
Something about love, I think.
Don't get addicted to smoking!
See ya!
Told you not to come here anymore.
Hey!
Don't come here no more.
What're you doing here?
Look at this big strong dog.
He can knock anyone out.
He's yours for Ft 8,000.
There's no money in it no more.
No money, my ass!
I'll give you a plate of food for him, OK?
- 6,000.
- I said, a plate of food.
- 4,000.
- I'll give you a plate of food.
- And 2,000.
- 2,000, and a plate of food.
Okay, fine!
Get him a plate of food and bring me the chain.
Here's 2,000.
Don't come here no more.
Don't come no more!
I don't care about your stinking mutts!
Good.
Take this fucker out back.
I've had these shitty dogs for three weeks now.
That little white one has a nipped ear.
It's a fighter.
I think it's worth buying.
Don't judge by the cover.
Let me see.
Or this black dog.
Romani kids brought him in.
Paid 100,000 for him.
Dumbass shit all over the room.
I had to give it pills.
His shit is nice and hard now.
No?
Don't you eat it now, you dumb fuck.
I paid 300,000 for the brown one.
I wouldn't sell it for half a million.
This one.
I'm taking him.
What?
Lost your mind in jail?
It's a fucking lapdog.
I told you I'm taking him.
How much?
You see the skin on its neck?
It's fucking thin.
Mind your own business.
How much?
150.
I'll give you the blackie for 200.
I told you I want this one.
Fine by me.
Here.
There's another ten.
Come on now.
Come.
You've still got a heart.
Sleep.
Sleep.
There.
That's it.
Bon appetit!
It's good.
Eat, go on.
You like it, huh?
From now on this is what you eat.
That's it.
CHALLENGE
NEXT FIGHT...
To my great disappointment, many of you did not grace us with your presence at the concert hall.
I assume that you are already familiar with the work.
So I'm sure you can all give me a summary of Tannhéiuser.
Peter?
Schiller, wipe that grin!
Beatrix?
- Beatrix.
- Trixi.
Wipe off your lipstick.
Trumpet players cannot wear lipstick.
So, what is Tannhéiuser about?
Lili.
- Who cares?
- Pardon me?
You want to teach us to tell lies or play the trumpet?
Tannhéiuser is about love, but you wouldn't understand, because you're heartless.
Cut it out!
Get the fuck out of here, all of you!
Get out!
Lili, you stay.
Go on!
Draw it out, drawn out...
Yes, again.
That's beautiful!
Play that at my funeral.
Continue.
I knew you had it in you.
You're gonna do it.
Hello?
!
Hello?
- You can't come in here.
- Is this the dog pound?
- It's not adoption day.
- May I see if my dog's here?
- Why, where is it?
- I don't know.
It's where you put it, probably.
He disappeared.
- Disappeared?
- Yes.
Okay, come here!
Don't you lie to me, kid.
I'm not.
My dad threw him out.
And you helped, right?
What kind of dog?
This is him.
Can I see if he's here?
I can't see without my glasses.
Is it a Labrador, or a Shar Pei.
- No, mixed breed.
- Oh, of course, not purebred.
Well, you threw him out in the garbage, obviously.
- When did he disappear?
- Weeks ago.
Then you've got no dog.
If it's out for weeks, there's no hope.
Either it's lost, or got hit by a car,
- or ended up in the Danube.
- Or you put them down!
No, people spread lies.
We don't put them down here.
You kill them!
That's my bike!
- What are you doing here?
- I've got a match.
- Go take a nap.
- I've got the stake.
- Where'd you get it?
- Blowing fags like you in jail.
- Fuck you!
- Go on, tell him I'm here.
I'll ask.
Let's go, Max!
Come on out.
Hi.
I told you not to do it.
He's dead meat!
Hi.
1,000 Euros!
Man, you hit the jackpot?
!
All there?
Come with me!
You could have brought a tougher dog.
You've never touched a dog, only cash.
This isn't even a dog.
It won't stand the heat.
Come on!
Yeah!
Harder!
That's enough!
Pull them apart!
Just the neck!
The neck!
Stop!
It's over.
Enough!
Victory!
We did it!
You see?
I'm back.
Give me my money.
We did it, Maxi!
- How much for the dog?
- He's not for sale.
- There's always a price.
- Uh-huh, sure.
Not for you.
You fucked me over.
When I was dirty, you shunned me, but now you don't?
It's not you.
It's the dog I want.
- He's gonna work for us.
- I'll find another location.
I won't let you.
- Hey, turn it back on!
- Relax, relax!
You fucking with me?
Maxi!
- Max!
- Calm down!
Stop shouting!
What have you done with him?
He's my dog!
- Shut the fuck up!
- Maxi!
Fuck me!
Look, the gypo's barking!
What's going on?
Shut up!
Quiet, gypo!
- Where are you going, Lili?
- What are you doing here?
Nothing.
I'm going to a party.
Will you take me?
- What?
- Will you take me?
I need to do something first.
- How much?
- One.
Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
- My father's an asshole.
- That sucks.
- Will you take me?
- I'll take you home.
- Am I embarrassing you?
- It's not that.
- Then take me.
- Hide this.
- What's this?
- You'll bring that in.
You okay?
- Mmmmm.
- Hug me!
I won't bite.
Give me your hand, we are a couple now.
Raise your hands.
- You can go.
- Thanks.
Hello!
- Wanna dance?
- Let's go!
Lili, you coming?
- Don't you want this?
- Hold onto it.
You smell nice.
What is it?
- Ed Hardy.
- What?
Ed Hardy.
Can I have my sweater?
- Hi.
- Hey.
- What do you have there?
- Nothing.
Empty your pockets!
- I don't have anything.
- Show me!
Come with me!
Your ID card, please.
Thank you.
Good morning.
That's him.
Good morning.
Is she your daughter?
Yes, she is.
Luckily, the drug test was negative.
You can take her.
Take better care of her.
- Congratulations, young lady.
- What?
Let's shake hands.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's hard to lose someone you love.
Things don't work out the way we imagined.
You're not a kid anymore.
We'll go to the shelter for a new dog.
I don't want a dog.
What do you mean?
Let's just go home.
- How long was I asleep?
- You can sleep more.
What are we gonna do today?
- Laundry.
- And then?
Whatever you like.
- Hangover?
- Just thirsty.
- Aren't you working today?
- Yes.
- So then?
- Who'll take care of you?
Don't worry about me.
I'm not leaving you here.
- Why?
- 'Cause you'll run away.
Why?
Beats me.
Go.
I'll be fine.
- You won't disappear?
- No.
- Promise?
- Yes.
Bye!
Black, brown, big.
Mixed.
Mutt.
Bitch.
What's that on his leg?
- Come show me.
- Show her.
That wound is pretty nasty.
No one will take it.
It's a goner.
Put it separate.
That didn't hurt.
See?
That's all it is.
You won't have any enemies where you're going.
No one will hurt you anymore.
It's no lie.
I mean it.
Bring the bag.
Last one?
Yes.
The rest is routine.
- Well, see ya!
- Bye!
You look lovely.
- Are you nervous?
- A little.
- Why?
- Because I'll mess up.
You won't mess up.
You'll be the best at the concert.
Please come in!
Take your pick.
There are white ones.
- What is it?
- It bit me!
- What?
!
- It bit me!
It bit you?
Have you gone mad?
It's over.
This is the end.
Back off!
You can't do that, you hear?
Let go, fuck, it's mine!
Fuck you!
What's going on?
Fuck!
Sit down, please!
Keep away from the doors!
Nobody panic!
Calm down!
Call the police!
Who has a phone?
Calm yourselves!
Sit down!
Lili!
Don't leave!
Sit back down!
Lili!
You can't go out.
They're rabid!
I think they came because of me.
- Don't go out.
- Hagen is with them.
- It's dangerous.
- So?
Don't do this.
Fuck!
Come in here.
Not down there!
They went that way!
- Wild beasts!
- You're the beast!
Don't go out!
The city is locked down.
Everything's blocked.
You can get out here!
- Hurry, they're off!
- Can you see Hagen?
No.
Take my bike.
Lili.
Sorry about last time.
Forget it.
What is it, Max?
What is it, Max?
Come back to me?
You champ.
What are you waiting for?
Come here.
Come here, you hear?
Max.
What do you want?
What is it?
Come here!
Come here, Max.
Come here.
Why don't you move?
Did you see anything?
Did you see what happened?
Get in, we'll take you home.
Police Secure the location.
What're you standing there for?
Cat got your tongue?
Nothing to be scared of.
A few beasts that got loose.
We'll hunt them down by morning.
- Get in the car.
- Will they be killed?
Sure.
Get in, OK?
Watch your head.
The dogs were seen near the Central Market.
Patrol 2 to Base.
We're all tied up at the station.
We must stay here.
Over.
No. 11 reporting.
We've got a suspect in custody.
Base copy.
The dogs were seen near the Central Market.
Hagen!
Hagen!
- Dad!
- Good God, Lili, where are you?
Dad, there's blood everywhere.
Where are you?
I'll pick you up.
- They didn't want the meat!
- What?
They'll be killed by morning.
I have to find Hagen.
There is a curfew.
Tell me where you are!
I have to find Hagen.
Where are you?
Lili, answer, don't hang up!
I have to go.
The city's biggest animal shelter has become a battlefield.
A few hours ago, hundreds of dogs broke out of their cages, killing several of the shelter's employees.
According to eyewitnesses, the most alarming sight was how the dogs acted not like animals, but like a well-organized army.
The authorities have begun hunting them down.
They ask everyone to stay at home.
The dogs are very dangerous.
Max!
Max!
Max!
Stop!
Come back!
Stop!
No, don't go!
Come back!
No.
Professor.
Professor.
Are you sleeping?
Professor!
Ready!
Other side!
Go, go!
Get down!
Fuck!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Lili!
Finally, Lili!
Where the hell were you?
I was looking for Hagen.
You're in danger too!
- It's all a mess!
- Lili, get inside now!
At the front!
I'll open the door!
Come on, hurry!
Goddammit!
Wake up!
Help me!
I must get into the slaughter hall.
My card is not working.
- They've gone wild.
- Who?
The dogs are here.
Get going!
Get up!
Hagen!
Hagen, what have you done?
What is it?
Hagen.
Hagen, look.
Good dog.
Fetch!
Why are you staring like that?
Fetch the stick!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Help me!
Come on!
Dad!
Hagen, what are you doing?
Relax!
Dad!
Hagen, it's me.
It's me, Hagen!
Hagen!
Scram!
- Dad, don't do it!
- Lili, get behind me!
No!
Dad, stop it!
Enough!
All of you!
Shall I call the police?
Give them a little more time.
"Everything terrible is something that needs our love." R. M. Rilke
White God
Hagen, let it go.
It isn't yours.
Good dog!
Lili!
Lili, hurry up.
I'm running out of time.
- How long will the flight take?
- A day.
- Where will the plane land?
- In Sydney.
- And then what?
- We'll travel by car.
Do not tear it up.
Fit for consumption.
Professor, take this.
- It's not necessary.
- For your daughter.
I'm no longer a professor.
- See you next week.
- Alright.
- Will you stay by the sea for 3 months?
- The ocean.
Australia is near the ocean.
- Is it far from university?
- 200 meters.
- How fortunate!
- It'll be alright with dad.
You got her passport?
- Here.
- Thanks.
Finally!
Is that him?
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.
I got it.
- Will you be back for the concert?
- how would that be possible?
- Take care of them.
- Them?
She brought her dog.
- I don't want a dog.
- What was I supposed to do?
- The professor can take care of him.
- You mean Hans?
He's going to the conference as well.
Are you climbing the ladder?
- Don't do this to me.
- Not again.
Come here, sweetie.
I have to go.
Listen to your dad, okay?
Those three months will be over in no time.
Take care of yourself.
Don't I get a kiss?
- I got something for you.
- What is it?
To blow bubbles.
Thanks, but I'm no longer a child.
- What's that around your neck?
- An access card.
Can I have it?
Are you chewing gum?
Spit it out.
Twenty.
Punch in the code, 1965.
- What's that stray dog doing here?
- Hagen.
- Do you want to keep him here?
- Yes, for now.
For how long?
He can't stay here.
There are rules.
Stray dogs have to be reported...
-... and registered.
- I did not know.
- Read the rules.
He'll have to be reported.
- I'll take care of it.
Thanks.
Dirty pig!
This is yours.
Good dog!
Lili, leave the dog alone.
In here at least.
- What will you do with that?
- What should I do with it?
- Why don't you put it where it belongs?
- Where is that?
You need to ask.
Give it to me.
Lili, it belongs here.
Okay?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
You have to eat whatever's available.
The dog will eat the dog's food.
Now go and eat.
I told you I'm not hungry.
Fine, then go to bed.
Take the dog away.
- Put on your pajamas.
- Turn around.
Okay.
- Which bed do you want, Lili?
- The same one Hagen has.
Hagen will not sleep in this room.
- Why not?
- Because he's a dog.
I won't sleep next to a dog.
Get out!
Get out.
Get out and stay there.
Lay down!
When will he quit?
He's not used to sleeping alone.
I can't sleep.
- Where are you going?
- I need to pee.
Don't pay any attention to him.
He'll quit eventually .
Stay here, please.
I'm sorry.
Good night.
Me too, I love you.
What is it, Hagen?
Why are you in such a rush?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- We have received a call.
- A call?
Dog control.
It's about the dog.
Excuse me?
- Your dog has bitten someone.
- I don't have a dog.
What's that then?
It's an elephant.
Can't you see?
It's a stray dog, mixed race, not a Hungarian race.
You'll have to pay.
- Cash or check?
- I never had a dog.
This dog belongs to my ex-wife.
I'm not gonna pay anything.
My ex does not live here.
And neither does her dog or his fleas.
There's a special tax for bastards.
- And what if I don't pay?
- You'll need to take him to a dog shelter.
- Today.
- Yes.
Next time he will be gone.
- No problem.
- He's not registered.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.
Get dressed.
I'll take a shower and then I'll take him away.
Hagen, come.
Come here.
Let's go.
Come.
Get down.
Sit..
Sit.
Down.
Sit.
Sit..
Stay..
Stay.
Down.
Sit..
Sit..
Sit..
Stay.
I would never do that to you.
Hey, calm down.
Don't eat me.
Come.
Come, Hagen.
Be quiet.
You'll have to stay here.
Don't be afraid.
I will be over there.
Good dog!
Hello everybody.
Can we start?
- A bit faster.
- I bet he'll start barking.
- No way.
- Wanna bet?
- He won't bark.
- And what if he will?
- He won't bark.
- It's your problem.
Misi.
Misi!
Why are you going faster?
Stop!
David, go practice at home, not here.
Stop laughing!
What's so funny?
We'll continue with 36.
Stop.
Stop it!
Whose dog is this?
Whose dog is this?
Well?
Whose dog is this?
He's mine.
Get him out of here.
Now!
- Hagen, let's go.
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Racz!
You stay here!
If you leave, don't bother coming back!
Do you hear me?
Racz!
Come back!
You're suspended!
What are you looking at!
Don't lick me.
I'm not in the mood.
Great.
Just what we needed.
What are you doing?
I've been looking for hours.
I almost called the police.
- What's the problem?
- Are you out of your mind?
- Come on, get in.
- Come on.
You're running away because of the damn dog!
Come on!
Who do you think you are?
You took this animal to school?
- I don't want him taken to a shelter.
- I'm not gonna pay for him.
- He's not going to a shelter.
- This dog will not enter the apartment anymore.
- You almost slept on the streets 'cause of him.
- So what?
Do you think you're the Queen of England?
- Who do you think you are?
- Not the Queen of England.
Shut up!
- He's not going to the shelter.
- You have no choice, missy.
Don't you get it, I'll never do that!
Find him a home.
Noone wants a smelly stray dog.
That's what the shelter's for.
He won't go to a shelter.
Get it?
I can't understand why you won't pay.
- They'll kill him.
- What do you want?
Do you want me to throw him out?
Here, out on the streets?
Is that what you want?
Well?
Is that what you want?
Really?
I'd prefer that.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm doing what you wished for!
- Do you want me to take him to a shelter?
- No!
- Come here!
- Hagen, stay!
I'll be back!
Hagen!
Hagen, stay!
I'll be back!
Stop!
Do you hear me?
Dad, you're an asshole.
I want to get out.
- Are you deaf?
- Shut up!
He'll get hit!
I want to get out!
Get on the sidewalk, you idiot!
- I want to get out!
- Shut up!
I want to get out!
Seriously.
Lili, what are you doing ?
- I'm hungry.
- Show me.
Raw meat, like a dog?
- Why do you care about what I eat?
- Do you want to get ill?
- So what?
- Why do you want to get ill?
'Cause you're a jerk.
- Go to bed!
- I'm gonna look for him.
- Will that be alright?
- Yeah, half.
Fine.
Do you want me to wrap it up?
Damn it!
Get out, all of you!
Get here, you flea-bag, I'll cut you in half.
C'mon doggy..
Where are you, stray dog?
I will eat you!
Damn dogs!
Get the catchers.
We're gonna catch them all.
Okay, get them.
There are two of 'em up there.
Have you seen a big dog?
- That way.
- Thanks.
There he is!
Come.
Get over here.
He has a leash.
His name should be on it.
- He's not hostile.
- What?
He's licking my hand.
He's not hostile.
- He doesn't understand what we're doing.
- He'll find out soon enough.
Damn it!
Two others.
Here?
You'll be working for me.
We're alll hungry dogs, damn it.
Shit.
Watch this.
I'll show you who's boss.
Don't make a scene.
- Lili, apologize and sit down.
- My apologies.
No doubt Lili can explain why she brought the animal.
I took him because he couldn't stay at home.
Why not?
We don't want a dog like that.
And why don't you want a dog like that?
- He bit my dad.
- What?
He bit my dad.
Did you take him to the shelter?
- No, he ran off.
- I can't hear you.
He ran off.
- So we won't see him again.
- Do you think so?
Stop with the attitude, girl.
Answer me.
- Will he come back?
- No.
- Can I come back?
- If you behave.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
It's not a problem.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Are you okay?
- Can Lili watch Tannhäuser?
- If she wants to.
Do you want to?
Let's continue with 147.
Attention!
Hagen!
What is she doing here?
Look who's there.
- Little bitch.
- Damn it...
Let's go inside.
- Did you not go to Tannhäuser either?
- No, I've been driving around.
- Did you find your bastard?
- Mixed race.
- Do you want me to help looking?
- Leave her alone.
- It's cold.
Will you come with me?
- Let me finish this cigarette.
- Where have you been?
- Everywhere.
- Have you taped a lot of them?
- Yeah.
- Can I have a hit?
- You don't smoke.
- Yes I do.
- No, you don't.
Dry your hair.
Look at the stars.
If they don't fall, you'll get over it.
Thanks.
- Tannhäuser, what is it?
- What?
Tannhäuser, what is it about?
About love, I guess.
Don't get addicted to nicotine.
See you.
- I don't want to see you anymore.
- Salaam-Alaikum.
Get out.
What are you doing here?
Do you see this big, bad dog?
He can knock the world out.
It's yours for 8000 forint.
- It's worthless.
- Worthless?
My ass!
I'll give you a plate of food, okay?
- 6000.
- A plate of food, I said.
- 4000.
- A plate of food, I said.
- 2000.
- 2000 and a plate of food.
Deal.
Hand him a plate of food and bring the chain.
And don't show your face in here again.
Get it?
- I don't want anything to do with you.
- Alright.
Okay.
Take this dog to the back.
These dirty stray dogs have been here for three weeks.
The tiny white one has a ripped ear.
He's a fighter.
He's worth it.
I don't care about looks.
I wanna see for myself.
Or the black one.
he was brought in by some Roma kids.
I paid 100.000.
The bastard crapped all over the place.
His arse was on fire.
I gave him pills.
And he turned them into hard turds.
He doesn't eat, the fool.
I paid 300.000 for the brown one.
I want at least 500.000.
- I want this one.
- What?
Did you go nuts in jail or what?
It's a lap dog.
I want him.
How much?
Can you see the skin around the neck?
It's looking good.
Don't bother.
How much?
- 150.
I'll sell the tiny black one for 200.
- I want this one.
No problem.
And ten more.
Come.
Come here.
You still have faith.
Go to sleep.
Yes, that's right.
Eat.
That's right.
Eat.
Tastes good, huh?
It's your new food.
It's okay.
Challenger.
Next fight.
I am disappointed to find out, that few of you have bothered to show up.
I assume you already know the opera.
You can undoubtedly tell me what Tannhäuser is about.
Peter?
Schiller, wipe that smirk off your face.
Beatrix?
Trixie.
Take off that lipstick.
A trumpeter can't have that.
So what is Tannhäuser about?
Lili?
- Who cares.
- Excuse me?
Are you teaching us to lie or to make music?
Tannhäuser is about love.
You wouldn't know 'cause you have no heart.
Stop it!
Get out, all of you.
Ga.
Lili, you stay.
Go on.
Stretch.
Again.
Great.
You can play on my funeral.
I knew you could do it.
You're gonna do it.
Hello?
- You're not allowed to enter.
- Is this the shelter?
- It's not the day of adoption.
- Can I see if my dog is in there?
- Why?
Where is he?
- I don't know.
- He'll be there where you left him.
- He's missing.
- Missing?
- Yes.
Alright, get over here.
- Don't lie to me.
- My dad threw him out.
And surely you assisted him?
So what story is it?
Here.
Can I see if he's here?
I can't see properly without my glasses.
- Is it a Labrador or a Sharpei?
- It's a mixed race.
Ah, of course.
Not a proper breed.
Obviously you took him out with the garbage.
- When did he go missing?
- A couple of weeks ago.
So you have no dog anymore.
If that is correct, then there is no hope.
He is gone, hit by a car, or he got drowned in the Danube.
- Or you killed him.
- No, people tell lies.
- We do not kill them here.
- You killed him.
That's my bike!
- What are you doing here?
- I have a fighter.
- Get out.
- I got the dough.
- Where'd you come up with that?
- I sucked cocks, just like you.
- Piss off.
- Tell him I'm here.
- I'll ask.
- Come on, Max.
Come here.
Hi.
I told you not to do it.
He's dead.
Hi.
1000 Euros.
Did you win the lottery?
It's all there.
Follow me.
Come on.
- You couldn't get a bigger dog?
- You know nothing of dogs.
This one's a winner.
- That's not a dog.
- No way he'll survive.
Get him!
Harder!
Enough.
Separate 'em.
get his neck!
Stop!
It's over.
Enough!
I won!
We made it!
Did you see that?
I'm back.
Give me my money.
We pulled it off, Maxi!
- How much for the dog?
- He's not for sale.
- Everything has a price.
- Yeah, of course.
Just not for you.
You screwed me.
And now you want something from me?
I don't want you.
I want the dog.
- He'll work for us.
- I'll go somewhere else.
I will not allow that.
- Turn on the lights!
- Calm down!
Do you take me for a fool?
Maxi!
Calm down, stop yelling.
What did you do with my dog?
- Shut up.
- Maxi!
Hear the gypsy bark!
Where did you take him?
- What did you do?
- Shut up!
- Where are you going?
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.
I'm going to a party.
- Can I come with you?
- What?
- Can I come with you?
I need to do something first.
- How much?
- One.
- What happened?
- My dad's an asshole.
- Too bad.
- Can I come with you?
- I'll take you home.
- Am I embarrassing you?
- It's not that.
- Then take me with you.
- Keep this with you.
- What is it?
Your entrance ticket.
Okay?
Hold me tight.
I won't bite.
Let's go.
Give me your hand.
We're a couple.
Raise your arms.
- You can go.
- Thanks.
- Hey!
- Hello.
Hi!
- Wanna dance?
- Let's go.
Lili, will you come with us?
Don't you want to have this?
Just hold on to that for a little longer.
- You smell nice.
What is it?
- Ed Hardy.
- What?
- Ed Hardy.
Can I have my sweater?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What do you have there?
- Nothing.
Empty your pockets!
- I got nothing.
- Come on.
Follow me.
Can I see your ID?
Thank you.
Good morning.
There he is.
Good morning.
Is this your daughter?
Yes, she's my daughter.
- The drug test was negative.
- You can take her home.
From now on, keep an eye on her.
- Congratulations, little girl.
- What?
Let's shake hands.
This is just marvelous.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's hard to lose someone you love.
Sometimes things don't go as planned.
You're no longer a kid.
- We'll go to the shelter and get another dog.
- I don't want a dog.
Why not?
Let's go home.
- How long did I sleep?
- There's plenty of time to sleep.
- What are we gonna do today?
- Laundry.
And then?
Whatever you like.
- Are you hung over?
- No, I'm just thirsty.
- Shouldn't you be working today?
- Yes I should.
- Well?
- Who will look after you?
Don't worry about me.
- I don't want to leave you alone.
- Why not?
- Because you'll have to look after yourself.
- Why not?
Don't ask me that.
Go.
I'll be fine.
- You won't run away?
- No.
- Promised?
- Yes.
See you soon.
Black, brown, big ones...
All of them bastards, mongrels.
Bitch!
What's wrong with his paw?
- Show me.
- Show her.
A nasty wound.
Nobody will take him.
He can't stay.
Put him aside.
It won't hurt.
See?
It's been taken care of.
There won't be any enemies where you're going.
Nobody will hurt you anymore.
That's no lie.
It is the truth.
Get the bag.
Was this the last one?
Yes, the others are as usual.
- See you later.
- See you.
Youn look wonderful.
- Are you nervous?
- A little.
- Why?
- 'Cause I'll mess up.
No, you'll be the best.
- Come in.
- Choose the one you'd like to have.
There are white ones as well.
- What happened?
- He bit me.
- He bit you?
- Yes.
Are you insane?
You can't bite.
It's over.
You're done with.
Get back!
Get back!
This is not allowed!
You hear me?
Drop that!
It's mine!
Go away!
Sit down, please.
Stay away from the doors!
Don't panic!
Stay quiet!
Call the police.
Who has a phone?
Stay quiet!
Sit down!
Don't go!
Sit down!
You can't go there.
They're mad.
- They're here because of me.
- Stay here.
- Hagen's there as well.
- It's dangerous.
- So what?
- Don't go.
Damn it!
Come here.
Come in.
Don't go down there!
They went down there!
- Wild beasts!
- You're the beast.
Don't go outside!
The city is on lock down!
Everything is closed!
You can go this way.
Quickly, they are here.
- Can you see Hagen?
- No.
Take my bike.
I'm sorry about the other day.
Forget it.
What is it, Max?
What is it?
Why are you back?
You're a champ.
Max, what are you waiting for?
Come here.
Come here.
Do you hear me?
Max, what is it you want?
What's the problem?
Get over here.
Come.
Here.
Why are you not moving?
Did you see anything?
Do you know what happened?
Come here.
We'll take you home.
We're gonna lock the place down.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your tongue?
Don't be afraid.
They're escaped animals.
We'll catch them in the morning.
Come on, let's go.
- Are you going to kill them?
- Of course.
Let's go.
Watch your head.
The dogs were spotted in the marketplace.
Patrol 2 to Base.
We're stuck at the station.
Over.
This is 11 responding.
We have a suspect.
Over.
Base, affirmative.
The dogs were spotted in the marketplace.
Hagen!
- Daddy.
- Finally!
Where are you?
- There's blood everywhere.
- Where are you?
- They haven't come for the meat.
- What?
They will all be killed in the morning.
- I'm going to look for Hagen.
- There's a curfew.
- Tell me where you are!
- I need to find Hagen.
Where are you?
Answer me.
Don't hang up!
- Lili, answer me!
- I have to go.
The biggest shelter in the city has turned into a battlefield.
Hundreds of dogs escaped and killed employees.
The most frightening thing was, the dogs didn't behave like animals they operated like an army instead.
The authorities have started the hunt and request everyone to stay inside.
The dogs are very dangerous.
Max!
Come back!
Stop!
Come back!
Don't go!
Come back!
No!
Professor...
Professor?
Are you asleep?
Professor...
Get ready!
The other side.
Quickly!
Lie down!
Damn it!
Dad.
Dad.
Finally!
Where were you?
I was looking for Hagen.
You're in danger!
- It's a chaos.
- Get inside.
Use the front door.
I'll open the door.
Quickly!
My god!
Wake up.
I have to go to the slaughterhouse.
My card won't let me pass.
Give me yours.
- Okay.
- They've gone insane.
- Who?
- The dogs are here.
Come on, get up.
Hagen.
What have you done?
What's going on?
Look.
Good dog!
Catch!
Why are you looking at me like that?
Fetch the stick!
Quickly.
Open up!
Open up!
Help!
Open up!
Daddy!
Hagen, what are you doing?
Be calm.
Daddy!
Hagen, it's me.
I'ts me, Hagen.
- Go away!
- Stop it, dad!
- Get behind me!
- Stop it!
That's enough!
Stop it!
Shall I call the police?
Hang on.
No animals were abused or harmed during training and recordings.
The strictest American guidelines have been met.
All violence is simulated.
WHITE GOD
Hagen, give it back, it's not yours!
Hup!
Good boy.
Lili!
Come on, Lili, I'll be late.
- How long is the flight?
- More than a day.
- Where will you land?
- In Sydney.
- And from there?
- By car.
Don't rip it.
Suitable for consumption.
- Professor, please accept this.
- It's not necessary.
For your daughter.
I'm not a professor anymore.
- Next week then.
- Yes, well...
You're at the sea for three months?
Ocean.
In Australia it's the ocean.
How far is the university?
- 200 meters.
- You're so lucky.
You'll be fine with Dad too.
Do you have her passport?
Thanks.
Finally!
Is it him?
- I'll be right back.
- Fine.
Wait, let me.
Will you be home for the concert?
How?
- Take good care of them.
- Them?
She brought her dog too.
I won't have any dog.
Where should I put him?
- The professor will babysit it.
- You mean Hans?
He'll be at the conference too.
Tripping up the ladder, are we?
- Don't do this to me.
- Don't start.
Come on, darling, time to go.
Obey your father, OK?
Three months is nothing.
Take care.
No kiss?
I brought this for you.
- What is it?
- A bubble-maker.
Thanks, but I'm not a kid anymore.
- What's that on your neck?
- An access card.
Can I have it?
Are you chewing gum?
No.
Okay.
Spit it out.
Twenty.
Key button. 1965.
What's this mutt doing here?
Hagen...
- You want to keep it here?
- For a while.
How long exactly?
It can't stay here.
They've posted the ruling.
Mutts have to be reported.
They're making a list now.
- I didn't know.
- Read the order.
- Mutts have to be reported.
- I'll do just that.
Thank you.
Dirty pig.
You'll get some.
Good boy.
Lili, leave that dog alone already.
In here at least.
Why do you have the pass?
- Where should I put it?
- Why didn't you put it back?
- Where?
- You have to ask.
Give it to me.
Lili, this belongs here, OK?
- Lili, what are you doing?
- Nothing.
Lili, here you'll eat what I cook.
The dog eats dog food.
- So dig in.
- I told you I'm not hungry.
Fine, then go to bed.
Take the dog.
Come on, put your nightgown on.
Turn around then.
Which bed do you want, Lili?
- The same one as Hagen.
- Hagen?
Hagen's not sleeping in this room.
- Why?
- He's a dog, and I'm not sleeping with dogs.
Come on.
Out!
We're leaving now.
Come on, out, let's go, out.
Stay!
Stay!
When will he stop?
He's not used to being alone.
I can't sleep.
- Where are you off to?
- I have to pee.
Don't go to him.
He'll stop.
Please stay here.
I'm sorry.
Sleep well.
What's up, Hagen?
What's the rush?
Good morning.
- We've received a report.
- What report?
Canine control.
About the dog.
Pardon me?
Someone reported being bitten by your dog.
I don't own a dog.
What's that then?
It's an elephant, can't you see?
Sir, this is a mixed-breed street dog.
It's not a Hungarian breed.
You have to pay a tax.
Would you like to pay now or by postal order?
I'll never own a dog.
The dog belongs to my ex-wife.
I'm not paying anyone for it.
My ex-wife doesn't live with me, so neither do her dog and its fleas!
It's a street mixed-breed.
- It's subject to a fee.
- What if I don't pay?
The dog can go to an animal shelter.
- Today.
- Yes.
So the dog won't be here next time.
It won't be here.
The dog isn't registered.
- What?
- Nothing.
- Did you sleep well?
- Uh-huh.
Get dressed.
I'll shower and then drop you off.
Hagen, come here!
We're out of here.
Come on.
Lie down!
Sit!
Sit!
Lie down!
Sit!
Sit!
Sit!
Stay!
Stay!
Lie down!
Sit!
Sit!
Sit!
Stay!
Stay!
I'll never do that to you.
Hey, relax!
Don't eat me.
Come on, Hagen.
Hagen, relax!
You have to stay put in here.
Don't be scared.
I'll be here.
Good dog.
Hello everyone.
Let's start, OK?
A bit faster, OK?
- I bet he'll bark.
- He won't.
- Wanna bet?
- He won't.
What if he does?
- He won't.
- OK, your problem.
Misi!
Misi!
Why are you rushing?
Stop!
David, practice in the sectionals, not here.
Quit laughing!
What's so funny?
From number 36 again.
Stop!
Whose dog is this?
Whose dog is this?
Whose dog is this?
- Whose dog is this?
- Mine.
Get it out of here.
At once!
Hagen, come on, we're leaving.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Racz!
You stay here!
If you leave now, don't come back!
You hear?
Racz!
Come back!
You're out for good!
What are you staring at?
Hagen, don't lick me.
I'm not in the mood.
Great.
Just what I needed.
What do you think you're doing?
I've been looking for you for ages.
- I almost called the police.
- What's your problem now?
You've lost your mind!
Get in, now!
You disappear because of a fucking dog!
Get in!
Who do you think you are?
You took that beast to school?
You wanted to take it to a shelter, and I won't take him there.
And I'm not paying your mother for it.
He's not going to a shelter.
That dog is not setting foot in the flat again.
- What if I hadn't found you?
- So what?
You think you're the Queen of England?
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm not the Queen of England!
Shut up!
I don't want to take him to a shelter!
You've got no other choice, kid.
Don't you get that I'm not taking him there?
Let's find a good home for him.
Nobody wants a stinking mutt.
That's what shelters are for.
But I don't want to take him there, don't you get it?
!
I can't believe you won't pay so they don't kill him.
You want me to throw it out?
Put it out on the street here?
Is that what you want?
Let's hear it, kid!
You want that?
You really want that?
Rather.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
You wanted it!
Should I take it to a shelter?
- Not the shelter!
- Then back you go!
Hagen, stay here!
I'll come back!
Hagen, stay here.
I'll come back.
Hagen!
Stop!
You hear?
Dad, you're such a jerk!
Let me out.
Are you deaf?
Shut up!
He'll get knocked down!
Let me out!
Get moving, you idiot!
Hagen!
Hagen!
- Dad, let me out!
- Shut up!
Let me out now, I mean it.
Lili, what are you doing?
- I'm hungry.
- Show me your hand!
Raw meat, like a dog?
What do you care what I eat?
You want to be sick?
- What if I do?
- Why do you want to be sick?
'Cause you're a jerk.
Haul ass to bed, Lili!
I'll come back for him anyway.
- Is this OK?
- I'd like half.
I'll wrap it, OK?
Goddamn you all!
Get the hell out of here!
C'mere you fleabag and I'll gut you!
Doggy!
Where are you, little monster?
I'll gobble you up!
Fuck you, bastards!
Get the catch poles.
We'll push 'em all back.
OK.
Push them inside.
Two over there.
Up there!
Have you seen a big dog?
- That way!
- Thanks!
There it is!
Come on!
Hey, this one's got a collar.
I'll bet you can't read its name.
- It doesn't hate us.
- What?
Look, it's licking my hand.
It doesn't hate us.
It doesn't get what we're doing.
It'll find out.
Motherfucker!
Two more!
Here?
Shit!
You'll work for me.
We're both hungry dogs, fuck yeah!
Fuck yeah!
Just you wait!
I'll show you who your master is.
Don't make a scene.
- Lili, apologize and sit down.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sure Lili can explain why she had that animal.
We didn't want to keep him at home.
Why not?
Because we don't need a dog like that.
Why don't you need a mutt?
- 'Cause he bit my dad.
- What?
Because he bit my dad.
Mm-hmm.
And so you took it to a shelter?
- No, he ran away.
- I can't hear you?
- No, because he ran away.
- Uh-huh.
So it's not coming here anymore.
- What do you think?
- Don't be fresh, young lady.
Answer me.
It's not coming here anymore?
No.
Will you take me back?
If you behave.
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.
I don't hold grudges.
- What's wrong now?
- Nothing.
- Is everything OK?
- Mm-hmm.
Lili can come to Tannhäuser as well.
If she wants.
- You want to?
- Mm-hmm.
From 147.
Attention!
Hagen!
Hagen!
Hagen!
Hagen!
Hagen!
Hagen!
Hagen!
What's she doing here?
Look who came to brown-nose?
- Little suction cup.
- No shit...
Let's go inside.
You didn't go to Tannhäuser either?
No, I was just around.
- Did you find your mutt?
- Mixed-breed!
- Can I help you find it?
- Leave her alone.
I'm cold.
Let's go inside.
Let me smoke this.
- Where did you go?
- Mexikói Road.
- Did you post many?
- Yeah.
Can I have a drag?
You don't even smoke.
- I do now.
- No, you don't!
Dry yourself.
Look at the stars.
If they don't fall, you'll survive.
Thanks.
- You know what's in Tannhäuser?
- What?
I mean, what Tannhäuser is about?
Something about love, I think.
Don't get addicted to smoking!
See ya!
Told you not to come here anymore.
Hey!
Don't come here no more.
What're you doing here?
Look at this big strong dog.
He can knock anyone out.
He's yours for Ft 8,000.
There's no money in it no more.
No money, my ass!
I'll give you a plate of food for him, OK?
- 6,000.
- I said, a plate of food.
- 4,000.
- I'll give you a plate of food.
- And 2,000.
- 2,000, and a plate of food.
Okay, fine!
Get him a plate of food and bring me the chain.
Here's 2,000.
Don't come here no more.
Don't come no more!
I don't care about your stinking mutts!
Good.
Take this fucker out back.
I've had these shitty dogs for three weeks now.
That little white one has a nipped ear.
It's a fighter.
I think it's worth buying.
Don't judge by the cover.
Let me see.
Or this black dog.
Romani kids brought him in.
Paid 100,000 for him.
Dumbass shit all over the room.
I had to give it pills.
His shit is nice and hard now.
No?
Don't you eat it now, you dumb fuck.
I paid 300,000 for the brown one.
I wouldn't sell it for half a million.
This one.
I'm taking him.
What?
Lost your mind in jail?
It's a fucking lapdog.
I told you I'm taking him.
How much?
You see the skin on its neck?
It's fucking thin.
Mind your own business.
How much?
150.
I'll give you the blackie for 200.
I told you I want this one.
Fine by me.
Here.
There's another ten.
Come on now.
Come.
You've still got a heart.
Sleep.
Sleep.
There.
That's it.
Bon appetit!
It's good.
Eat, go on.
You like it, huh?
From now on this is what you eat.
That's it.
CHALLENGE
NEXT FIGHT...
To my great disappointment, many of you did not grace us with your presence at the concert hall.
I assume that you are already familiar with the work.
So I'm sure you can all give me a summary of Tannhäuser.
Peter?
Schiller, wipe that grin!
Beatrix?
- Beatrix.
- Trixi.
Wipe off your lipstick.
Trumpet players cannot wear lipstick.
So, what is Tannhäuser about?
Lili.
- Who cares?
- Pardon me?
You want to teach us to tell lies or play the trumpet?
Tannhäuser is about love, but you wouldn't understand, because you're heartless.
Cut it out!
Get the fuck out of here, all of you!
Get out!
Lili, you stay.
Go on!
Draw it out, drawn out...
Yes, again.
That's beautiful!
Play that at my funeral.
Continue.
I knew you had it in you.
You're gonna do it.
Hello?
!
Hello?
- You can't come in here.
- Is this the dog pound?
- It's not adoption day.
- May I see if my dog's here?
- Why, where is it?
- I don't know.
It's where you put it, probably.
He disappeared.
- Disappeared?
- Yes.
Okay, come here!
Don't you lie to me, kid.
I'm not.
My dad threw him out.
And you helped, right?
What kind of dog?
This is him.
Can I see if he's here?
I can't see without my glasses.
Is it a Labrador, or a Shar Pei
- No, mixed breed.
- Oh, of course, not purebred.
Well, you threw him out in the garbage, obviously.
- When did he disappear?
- Weeks ago.
Then you've got no dog.
If it's out for weeks, there's no hope.
Either it's lost, or got hit by a car,
- or ended up in the Danube.
- Or you put them down!
No, people spread lies.
We don't put them down here.
You kill them!
That's my bike!
- What are you doing here?
- I've got a match.
- Go take a nap.
- I've got the stake
- Where'd you get it?
- Blowing fags like you in jail.
- Fuck you!
- Go on, tell him I'm here.
I'll ask.
Let's go, Max!
Come on out.
Hi.
I told you not to do it.
He's dead meat!
Hi.
1,000 Euros!
Man, you hit the jackpot?
!
All there?
Come with me!
You could have brought a tougher dog.
You've never touched a dog, only cash.
This isn't even a dog.
It won't stand the heat.
Come on!
Yeah!
Harder!
That's enough!
Pull them apart!
Just the neck!
The neck!
Stop!
It's over.
Enough!
Victory!
We did it!
You see?
I'm back.
Give me my money.
We did it, Maxi!
- How much for the dog?
- He's not for sale.
- There's always a price.
- Uh-huh, sure.
Not for you.
You fucked me over.
When I was dirty, you shunned me, but now you don't?
It's not you.
It's the dog I want.
- He's gonna work for us.
- I'll find another location.
I won't let you.
- Hey, turn it back on!
- Relax, relax!
You fucking with me?
Maxi!
- Max!
- Calm down!
Stop shouting!
What have you done with him?
He's my dog!
- Shut the fuck up!
- Maxi!
Fuck me!
Look, the gypo's barking!
What's going on?
Shut up!
Quiet, gypo!
- Where are you going, Lili?
- What are you doing here?
Nothing.
I'm going to a party.
Will you take me?
- What?
- Will you take me?
I need to do something first.
- How much?
- One.
Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
- My father's an asshole.
- That sucks.
- Will you take me?
- I'll take you home.
- Am I embarrassing you?
- It's not that.
- Then take me.
- Hide this.
- What's this?
- You'll bring that in.
You okay?
- Mm-hmm.
- Hug me!
I won't bite.
Give me your hand, we are a couple now.
Raise your hands.
- You can go.
- Thanks.
Hello!
- Wanna dance?
- Let's go!
Lili, you coming?
- Don't you want this?
- Hold onto it.
You smell nice.
What is it?
- Ed Hardy.
- What?
Ed Hardy.
Can I have my sweater?
- Hi.
- Hey.
- What do you have there?
- Nothing.
Empty your pockets!
- I don't have anything.
- Show me!
Come with me!
Your ID card, please.
Thank you.
Good morning.
That's him.
Good morning.
Is she your daughter?
Yes, she is.
Luckily, the drug test was negative.
You can take her.
Take better care of her.
- Congratulations, young lady.
- What?
Let's shake hands.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's hard to lose someone you love.
Things don't work out the way we imagined.
You're not a kid anymore.
We'll go to the shelter for a new dog.
I don't want a dog.
What do you mean?
Let's just go home.
- How long was I asleep?
- You can sleep more.
What are we gonna do today?
- Laundry.
- And then?
Whatever you like.
- Hangover?
- Just thirsty.
- Aren't you working today?
- Yes.
- So then?
- Who'll take care of you?
Don't worry about me.
I'm not leaving you here.
- Why?
- 'Cause you'll run away.
Why?
Beats me.
Go.
I'll be fine.
- You won't disappear?
- No.
- Promise?
- Yes.
Bye!
Black, brown, big.
Mixed.
Mutt.
Bitch.
What's that on his leg?
- Come show me.
- Show her.
That wound is pretty nasty.
No one will take it.
It's a goner.
Put it separate.
That didn't hurt.
See?
That's all it is.
You won't have any enemies where you're going.
No one will hurt you anymore.
It's no lie.
I mean it.
Bring the bag.
Last one?
Yes.
The rest is routine.
- Well, see ya!
- Bye!
You look lovely.
- Are you nervous?
- A little.
- Why?
- Because I'll mess up.
You won't mess up.
You'll be the best at the concert.
Please come in!
Take your pick.
There are white ones.
- What is it?
- It bit me!
- What?
!
- It bit me!
It bit you?
Have you gone mad?
It's over.
This is the end.
Back off!
You can't do that, you hear?
Let go, fuck, it's mine!
Fuck you!
What's going on?
Fuck!
Sit down, please!
Keep away from the doors!
Nobody panic!
Calm down!
Call the police!
Who has a phone?
Calm yourselves!
Sit down!
Lili!
Don't leave!
Sit back down!
Lili!
You can't go out.
They're rabid!
I think they came because of me.
- Don't go out.
- Hagen is with them.
- It's dangerous.
- So?
Don't do this.
Fuck!
Come in here.
Not down there!
They went that way!
- Wild beasts!
- You're the beast!
Don't go out!
The city is locked down.
Everything's blocked.
You can get out here!
- Hurry, they're off!
- Can you see Hagen?
No.
Take my bike.

Sorry about last time.

What're you standing there for?

Nothing to be scared of.
A few beasts that got loose.

They'll be killed by morning.
I have to find Hagen.
There is a curfew.
Tell me where you are!
I have to find Hagen.
Where are you?
Lili, answer, don't hang up!
I have to go.
The city's biggest animal shelter has become a battlefield.
A few hours ago, hundreds of dogs broke out of their cages, killing several of the shelter's employees.
According to eyewitnesses, the most alarming sight was how the dogs acted not like animals, but like a well-organized army.
The authorities have begun hunting them down.
They ask everyone to stay at home.
The dogs are very dangerous.

Give it to me.
Lili, this belongs here, OK?

Lili, here you'll eat what I cook.
The dog eats dog food.

Sir, this is a mixed-breed street dog.
It's not a Hungarian breed.
You have to pay a tax.

I'll never own a dog.
The dog belongs to my ex-wife.
I'm not paying anyone for it.
My ex-wife doesn't live with me, so neither do her dog and its fleas!

- Don't go out.
- Hagen is with them.
- It's dangerous.
- So?
Don't do this.
Fuck!
Come in here.
Not down there!
They went that way!
- Wild beasts!
- You're the beast!
Don't go out!
The city is locked down.
Man:
Everything's blocked.
You can get out here!
- Hurry, they're off!
- Lili:
Can you see Hagen?
Boy:
No.
Take my bike.
Lili.
Sorry about last time.
Forget it.

The city's biggest animal shelter has become a battlefield.
A few hours ago, hundreds of dogs broke out of their cages, killing several of the shelter's employees.
According to eyewitnesses, the most alarming sight was how the dogs acted not like animals, but like a well-organized army.
The authorities have begun hunting them down.
They ask everyone to stay at home.
The dogs are very dangerous.

"Everything terrible is something that needs our love." R. M. Rilke
White God
Hagen, let it go.
It isn't yours.
Good dog!
Lili!
Lili, hurry up.
I'm running out of time.
- How long will the flight take?
- A day.
- Where will the plane land?
- In Sydney.
- And then what?
- We'll travel by car.
Do not tear it up.
Fit for consumption.
Professor, take this.
- It's not necessary.
- For your daughter.
I'm no longer a professor.
- See you next week.
- Alright.
- Will you stay by the sea for 3 months?
- The ocean.
Australia is near the ocean.
- Is it far from university?
- 200 meters.
- How fortunate!
- It'll be alright with dad.
You got her passport?
- Here.
- Thanks.
Finally!
Is that him?
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.
I got it.
- Will you be back for the concert?
- how would that be possible?
- Take care of them.
- Them?
She brought her dog.
- I don't want a dog.
- What was I supposed to do?
- The professor can take care of him.
- You mean Hans?
He's going to the conference as well.
Are you climbing the ladder?
- Don't do this to me.
- Not again.
Come here, sweetie.
I have to go.
Listen to your dad, okay?
Those three months will be over in no time.
Take care of yourself.
Don't I get a kiss?
- I got something for you.
- What is it?
To blow bubbles.
Thanks, but I'm no longer a child.
- What's that around your neck?
- An access card.
Can I have it?
Are you chewing gum?
Spit it out.
Twenty.
Punch in the code, 1965.
- What's that stray dog doing here?
- Hagen.
- Do you want to keep him here?
- Yes, for now.
For how long?
He can't stay here.
There are rules.
Stray dogs have to be reported...
-... and registered.
- I did not know.
- Read the rules.
He'll have to be reported.
- I'll take care of it.
Thanks.
Dirty pig!
This is yours.
Good dog!
Lili, leave the dog alone.
In here at least.
- What will you do with that?
- What should I do with it?
- Why don't you put it where it belongs?
- Where is that?
You need to ask.
Give it to me.
Lili, it belongs here.
Okay?
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
You have to eat whatever's available.
The dog will eat the dog's food.
Now go and eat.
I told you I'm not hungry.
Fine, then go to bed.
Take the dog away.
- Put on your pajamas.
- Turn around.
Okay.
- Which bed do you want, Lili?
- The same one Hagen has.
Hagen will not sleep in this room.
- Why not?
- Because he's a dog.
I won't sleep next to a dog.
Get out!
Get out.
Get out and stay there.
Lay down!
When will he quit?
He's not used to sleeping alone.
I can't sleep.
- Where are you going?
- I need to pee.
Don't pay any attention to him.
He'll quit eventually .
Stay here, please.
I'm sorry.
Good night.
Me too, I love you.
What is it, Hagen?
Why are you in such a rush?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- We have received a call.
- A call?
Dog control.
It's about the dog.
Excuse me?
- Your dog has bitten someone.
- I don't have a dog.
What's that then?
It's an elephant.
Can't you see?
It's a stray dog, mixed race, not a Hungarian race.
You'll have to pay.
- Cash or check?
- I never had a dog.
This dog belongs to my ex-wife.
I'm not gonna pay anything.
My ex does not live here.
And neither does her dog or his fleas.
There's a special tax for bastards.
- And what if I don't pay?
- You'll need to take him to a dog shelter.
- Today.
- Yes.
Next time he will be gone.
- No problem.
- He's not registered.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.
Get dressed.
I'll take a shower and then I'll take him away.
Hagen, come.
Come here.
Let's go.
Come.
Get down.
Sit..
Sit.
Down.
Sit.
Sit..
Stay..
Stay.
Down.
Sit..
Sit..
Sit..
Stay.
I would never do that to you.
Hey, calm down.
Don't eat me.
Come.
Come, Hagen.
Be quiet.
You'll have to stay here.
Don't be afraid.
I will be over there.
Good dog!
Hello everybody.
Can we start?
- A bit faster.
- I bet he'll start barking.
- No way.
- Wanna bet?
- He won't bark.
- And what if he will?
- He won't bark.
- It's your problem.
Misi.
Misi!
Why are you going faster?
Stop!
David, go practice at home, not here.
Stop laughing!
What's so funny?
We'll continue with 36.
Stop.
Stop it!
Whose dog is this?
Whose dog is this?
Well?
Whose dog is this?
He's mine.
Get him out of here.
Now!
- Hagen, let's go.
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
Racz!
You stay here!
If you leave, don't bother coming back!
Do you hear me?
Racz!
Come back!
You're suspended!
What are you looking at!
Don't lick me.
I'm not in the mood.
Great.
Just what we needed.
What are you doing?
I've been looking for hours.
I almost called the police.
- What's the problem?
- Are you out of your mind?
- Come on, get in.
- Come on.
You're running away because of the damn dog!
Come on!
Who do you think you are?
You took this animal to school?
- I don't want him taken to a shelter.
- I'm not gonna pay for him.
- He's not going to a shelter.
- This dog will not enter the apartment anymore.
- You almost slept on the streets 'cause of him.
- So what?
Do you think you're the Queen of England?
- Who do you think you are?
- Not the Queen of England.
Shut up!
- He's not going to the shelter.
- You have no choice, missy.
Don't you get it, I'll never do that!
Find him a home.
Noone wants a smelly stray dog.
That's what the shelter's for.
He won't go to a shelter.
Get it?
I can't understand why you won't pay.
- They'll kill him.
- What do you want?
Do you want me to throw him out?
Here, out on the streets?
Is that what you want?
Well?
Is that what you want?
Really?
I'd prefer that.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm doing what you wished for!
- Do you want me to take him to a shelter?
- No!
- Come here!
- Hagen, stay!
I'll be back!
Hagen!
Hagen, stay!
I'll be back!
Stop!
Do you hear me?
Dad, you're an asshole.
I want to get out.
- Are you deaf?
- Shut up!
He'll get hit!
I want to get out!
Get on the sidewalk, you idiot!
- I want to get out!
- Shut up!
I want to get out!
Seriously.
Lili, what are you doing ?
- I'm hungry.
- Show me.
Raw meat, like a dog?
- Why do you care about what I eat?
- Do you want to get ill?
- So what?
- Why do you want to get ill?
'Cause you're a jerk.
- Go to bed!
- I'm gonna look for him.
- Will that be alright?
- Yeah, half.
Fine.
Do you want me to wrap it up?
Damn it!
Get out, all of you!
Get here, you flea-bag, I'll cut you in half.
C'mon doggy..
Where are you, stray dog?
I will eat you!
Damn dogs!
Get the catchers.
We're gonna catch them all.
Okay, get them.
There are two of 'em up there.
Have you seen a big dog?
- That way.
- Thanks.
There he is!
Come.
Get over here.
He has a leash.
His name should be on it.
- He's not hostile.
- What?
He's licking my hand.
He's not hostile.
- He doesn't understand what we're doing.
- He'll find out soon enough.
Damn it!
Two others.
Here?
You'll be working for me.
We're alll hungry dogs, damn it.
Shit.
Watch this.
I'll show you who's boss.
Don't make a scene.
- Lili, apologize and sit down.
- My apologies.
No doubt Lili can explain why she brought the animal.
I took him because he couldn't stay at home.
Why not?
We don't want a dog like that.
And why don't you want a dog like that?
- He bit my dad.
- What?
He bit my dad.
Did you take him to the shelter?
- No, he ran off.
- I can't hear you.
He ran off.
- So we won't see him again.
- Do you think so?
Stop with the attitude, girl.
Answer me.
- Will he come back?
- No.
- Can I come back?
- If you behave.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
It's not a problem.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
Are you okay?
- Can Lili watch Tannhäuser?
- If she wants to.
Do you want to?
Let's continue with 147.
Attention!
Hagen!
What is she doing here?
Look who's there.
- Little bitch.
- Damn it...
Let's go inside.
- Did you not go to Tannhäuser either?
- No, I've been driving around.
- Did you find your bastard?
- Mixed race.
- Do you want me to help looking?
- Leave her alone.
- It's cold.
Will you come with me?
- Let me finish this cigarette.
- Where have you been?
- Everywhere.
- Have you taped a lot of them?
- Yeah.
- Can I have a hit?
- You don't smoke.
- Yes I do.
- No, you don't.
Dry your hair.
Look at the stars.
If they don't fall, you'll get over it.
Thanks.
- Tannhäuser, what is it?
- What?
Tannhäuser, what is it about?
About love, I guess.
Don't get addicted to nicotine.
See you.
- I don't want to see you anymore.
- Salaam-Alaikum.
Get out.
What are you doing here?
Do you see this big, bad dog?
He can knock the world out.
It's yours for 8000 forint.
- It's worthless.
- Worthless?
My ass!
I'll give you a plate of food, okay?
- 6000.
- A plate of food, I said.
- 4000.
- A plate of food, I said.
- 2000.
- 2000 and a plate of food.
Deal.
Hand him a plate of food and bring the chain.
And don't show your face in here again.
Get it?
- I don't want anything to do with you.
- Alright.
Okay.
Take this dog to the back.
These dirty stray dogs have been here for three weeks.
The tiny white one has a ripped ear.
He's a fighter.
He's worth it.
I don't care about looks.
I wanna see for myself.
Or the black one.
he was brought in by some Roma kids.
I paid 100.000.
The bastard crapped all over the place.
His arse was on fire.
I gave him pills.
And he turned them into hard turds.
He doesn't eat, the fool.
I paid 300.000 for the brown one.
I want at least 500.000.
- I want this one.
- What?
Did you go nuts in jail or what?
It's a lap dog.
I want him.
How much?
Can you see the skin around the neck?
It's looking good.
Don't bother.
How much?
- 150.
I'll sell the tiny black one for 200.
- I want this one.
No problem.
And ten more.
Come.
Come here.
You still have faith.
Go to sleep.
Yes, that's right.
Eat.
That's right.
Eat.
Tastes good, huh?
It's your new food.
It's okay.
Challenger.
Next fight.
I am disappointed to find out, that few of you have bothered to show up.
I assume you already know the opera.
You can undoubtedly tell me what Tannhäuser is about.
Peter?
Schiller, wipe that smirk off your face.
Beatrix?
Trixie.
Take off that lipstick.
A trumpeter can't have that.
So what is Tannhäuser about?
Lili?
- Who cares.
- Excuse me?
Are you teaching us to lie or to make music?
Tannhäuser is about love.
You wouldn't know 'cause you have no heart.
Stop it!
Get out, all of you.
Go.
Lili, you stay.
Go on.
Stretch.
Again.
Great.
You can play on my funeral.
I knew you could do it.
You're gonna do it.
Hello?
- You're not allowed to enter.
- Is this the shelter?
- It's not the day of adoption.
- Can I see if my dog is in there?
- Why?
Where is he?
- I don't know.
- He'll be there where you left him.
- He's missing.
- Missing?
- Yes.
Alright, get over here.
- Don't lie to me.
- My dad threw him out.
And surely you assisted him?
So what story is it?
Here.
Can I see if he's here?
I can't see properly without my glasses.
- Is it a Labrador or a Sharpei?
- It's a mixed race.
Ah, of course.
Not a proper breed.
Obviously you took him out with the garbage.
- When did he go missing?
- A couple of weeks ago.
So you have no dog anymore.
If that is correct, then there is no hope.
He is gone, hit by a car, or he got drowned in the Danube.
- Or you killed him.
- No, people tell lies.
- We do not kill them here.
- You killed him.
That's my bike!
- What are you doing here?
- I have a fighter.
- Get out.
- I got the dough.
- Where'd you come up with that?
- I sucked cocks, just like you.
- Piss off.
- Tell him I'm here.
- I'll ask.
- Come on, Max.
Come here.
Hi.
I told you not to do it.
He's dead.
Hi.
1000 Euros.
Did you win the lottery?
It's all there.
Follow me.
Come on.
- You couldn't get a bigger dog?
- You know nothing of dogs.
This one's a winner.
- That's not a dog.
- No way he'll survive.
Get him!
Harder!
Enough.
Separate 'em.
get his neck!
Stop!
It's over.
Enough!
I won!
We made it!
Did you see that?
I'm back.
Give me my money.
We pulled it off, Maxi!
- How much for the dog?
- He's not for sale.
- Everything has a price.
- Yeah, of course.
Just not for you.
You screwed me.
And now you want something from me?
I don't want you.
I want the dog.
- He'll work for us.
- I'll go somewhere else.
I will not allow that.
- Turn on the lights!
- Calm down!
Do you take me for a fool?
Maxi!
Calm down, stop yelling.
What did you do with my dog?
- Shut up.
- Maxi!
Hear the gypsy bark!
Where did you take him?
- What did you do?
- Shut up!
- Where are you going?
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.
I'm going to a party.
- Can I come with you?
- What?
- Can I come with you?
I need to do something first.
- How much?
- One.
- What happened?
- My dad's an asshole.
- Too bad.
- Can I come with you?
- I'll take you home.
- Am I embarrassing you?
- It's not that.
- Then take me with you.
- Keep this with you.
- What is it?
Your entrance ticket.
Okay?
Hold me tight.
I won't bite.
Let's go.
Give me your hand.
We're a couple.
Raise your arms.
- You can go.
- Thanks.
- Hey!
- Hello.
Hi!
- Wanna dance?
- Let's go.
Lili, will you come with us?
Don't you want to have this?
Just hold on to that for a little longer.
- You smell nice.
What is it?
- Ed Hardy.
- What?
- Ed Hardy.
Can I have my sweater?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What do you have there?
- Nothing.
Empty your pockets!
- I got nothing.
- Come on.
Follow me.
Can I see your ID?
Thank you.
Good morning.
There he is.
Good morning.
Is this your daughter?
Yes, she's my daughter.
- The drug test was negative.
- You can take her home.
From now on, keep an eye on her.
- Congratulations, little girl.
- What?
Let's shake hands.
This is just marvelous.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It's hard to lose someone you love.
Sometimes things don't go as planned.
You're no longer a kid.
- We'll go to the shelter and get another dog.
- I don't want a dog.
Why not?
Let's go home.
- How long did I sleep?
- There's plenty of time to sleep.
- What are we gonna do today?
- Laundry.
And then?
Whatever you like.
- Are you hung over?
- No, I'm just thirsty.
- Shouldn't you be working today?
- Yes I should.
- Well?
- Who will look after you?
Don't worry about me.
- I don't want to leave you alone.
- Why not?
- Because you'll have to look after yourself.
- Why not?
Don't ask me that.
Go.
I'll be fine.
- You won't run away?
- No.
- Promised?
- Yes.
See you soon.
Black, brown, big ones...
All of them bastards, mongrels.
Bitch!
What's wrong with his paw?
- Show me.
- Show her.
A nasty wound.
Nobody will take him.
He can't stay.
Put him aside.
It won't hurt.
See?
It's been taken care of.
There won't be any enemies where you're going.
Nobody will hurt you anymore.
That's no lie.
It is the truth.
Get the bag.
Was this the last one?
Yes, the others are as usual.
- See you later.
- See you.
Youn look wonderful.
- Are you nervous?
- A little.
- Why?
- 'Cause I'll mess up.
No, you'll be the best.
- Come in.
- Choose the one you'd like to have.
There are white ones as well.
- What happened?
- He bit me.
- He bit you?
- Yes.
Are you insane?
You can't bite.
It's over.
You're done with.
Get back!
Get back!
This is not allowed!
You hear me?
Drop that!
It's mine!
Go away!
Sit down, please.
Stay away from the doors!
Don't panic!
Stay quiet!
Call the police.
Who has a phone?
Stay quiet!
Sit down!
Don't go!
Sit down!
You can't go there.
They're mad.
- They're here because of me.
- Stay here.
- Hagen's there as well.
- It's dangerous.
- So what?
- Don't go.
Damn it!
Come here.
Come in.
Don't go down there!
They went down there!
- Wild beasts!
- You're the beast.
Don't go outside!
The city is on lock down!
Everything is closed!
You can go this way.
Quickly, they are here.
- Can you see Hagen?
- No.
Take my bike.
I'm sorry about the other day.
Forget it.
What is it, Max?
What is it?
Why are you back?
You're a champ.
Max, what are you waiting for?
Come here.
Come here.
Do you hear me?
Max, what is it you want?
What's the problem?
Get over here.
Come.
Here.
Why are you not moving?
Did you see anything?
Do you know what happened?
Come here.
We'll take you home.
We're gonna lock the place down.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your tongue?
Don't be afraid.
They're escaped animals.
We'll catch them in the morning.
Come on, let's go.
- Are you going to kill them?
- Of course.
Let's go.
Watch your head.
The dogs were spotted in the marketplace.

Over.
Base, affirmative.
The dogs were spotted in the marketplace.
Hagen!
- Daddy.
- Finally!
Where are you?
- There's blood everywhere.
- Where are you?
- They haven't come for the meat.
- What?
They will all be killed in the morning.
- I'm going to look for Hagen.
- There's a curfew.
- Tell me where you are!
- I need to find Hagen.
Where are you?
Answer me.
Don't hang up!
- Lili, answer me!
- I have to go.
The biggest shelter in the city has turned into a battlefield.
Hundreds of dogs escaped and killed employees.
The most frightening thing was, the dogs didn't behave like animals they operated like an army instead.
The authorities have started the hunt and request everyone to stay inside.
The dogs are very dangerous.
Max!
Come back!
Stop!
Come back!
Don't go!
Come back!
No!
Professor...
Professor?
Are you asleep?
Professor...
Get ready!
The other side.
Quickly!
Lie down!
Damn it!
Dad.
Dad.
Finally!
Where were you?
I was looking for Hagen.
You're in danger!
- It's a chaos.
- Get inside.
Use the front door.
I'll open the door.
Quickly!
My god!
Wake up.
I have to go to the slaughterhouse.
My card won't let me pass.
Give me yours.
- Okay.
- They've gone insane.
- Who?
- The dogs are here.
Come on, get up.
Hagen.
What have you done?
What's going on?
Look.
Good dog!
Catch!
Why are you looking at me like that?
Fetch the stick!
Quickly.
Open up!
Open up!
Help!
Open up!
Daddy!
Hagen, what are you doing?
Be calm.
Daddy!
Hagen, it's me.
I'ts me, Hagen.
- Go away!
- Stop it, dad!
- Get behind me!
- Stop it!
That's enough!
Stop it!
Shall I call the police?
Hang on.
No animals were abused or harmed during training and recordings.
The strictest American guidelines have been met.
All violence is simulated.
Previously on Revolution...
Have you ever been to Spring City, Oklahoma?
It has to be important, or he wouldn't have said it.
Aaron, I just want you to know how sorry I am.
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to her.
I am not going back to being some lame housewife, Tom.
There is a life that you promised me, and I have sacrificed a hell of a lot to get it.
Just so you know, once we get what we want,
I am going to take a knife, and I am going to gut that Chief of Staff husband of yours.
You took my son to Mexico?
- Afternoon, folks.
- You're Connor?
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm your dad.
You are a Monroe.
You should be leading the Republic.
You and me... together, we can take it back.
I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
- Mr. Nunez wants to meet you.
- Let me guess... we're gonna get ourselves killed saving Monroe?
Aren't you glad you came?
What the hell is going on?
Why here?
What does any of this mean?
Aaron?
Grace?
Grace, what are you doing here?
I live here, Aaron...
Alone... ever since the tower.
I've been trying to forget about all that, to tell you the truth.
Now, you want to tell me what you're doing here?
I think I was sent here to find you.
Find me.
This day just keeps getting weirder.
Come on.
She walked in late yesterday.
Said it took her more than a week to get here, then dropped like a stone from heatstroke.
Priscilla.
Aaron?
You know her?
She was my wife.
You're making a mistake.
You still trying to sell that?
You and me are gonna be kings of the world, huh?
Could've been...
If you didn't have your head crammed so firmly up your ass.
Abrelo!
d Born to be wild d
d Born to be... d
What'd he do?
Didn't do his job.
I can't believe we have to rescue that son of a bitch.
I know.
I know.
Wow.
Your boss has really nice taste.
It's like Donald Trump threw up on Scarface.

Sebastian Monroe...
It really is you standing here in my house.
It's an honor to meet you.
Yeah?
I can imagine the thrill.
So it's incredible.
Connor here is your blood.
That's right.
You know, I always knew he was special somehow.
I knew it from the first time I saw him.
Took him off the street, gave him a home... my home.
I practically raised him, and now look at him.
He's my right hand.
That's touching, really.
So, uh... what are you gonna do with me?
What do you think, Connor?
What should we do with your dear old dad?
I say... we sell him to the highest bidder.
Texas, Mexico... someone's gonna pay a lot for his sorry ass.

What are they building?
And why so fast?
I don't know?
It's in the middle of nowhere.
It's all fenced in.
Options start at prison...
Only get worse from there.
Oh, no.
No.
No.
What?
That's Lloyd Welliver.
He's a friend of mine... a good friend.
- We got to go get him.
- Whoa.
That's an armed camp.
There are two of us.
How do you think we're gonna get in?
Oh, place that in the other room.
Thank you.
Ma'am?
Congratulations on you and your husband's new position as Chief of Staff... compliments of Commander Allenford.
Please convey my thanks to the Commander.
Here.
Thank you.
I was wondering if you had a chance to talk to your husband yet about my desire to join his security detail.
Well, it's just my first day, but when the time is right,
- I'll...
- Time is right for what?
Oh, n... nothing, dear.
Just a social invitation from Commander Allenford.
Mm.
Wait till you see the gift that we... well, you... received from the President.
- Oh?
- It's a quill pen that once belonged to John Adams.
Hey, you got to take a look at this.
Not now.
Now.
Where the hell did you get this?
Out of Allenford's room.
Look.
Reeducation programs, same kind I was in... they're opening more.
Scranton, Pennsylvania,
Willoughby, Texas, Clearwater, Florida, everywhere.
Guess who's behind it.
My new stepdad, Doyle...
he runs the whole thing.
What the hell do you want me to do about it?
Something, anything.
After what that program did to me... pretty much the guy who screwed me is screwing mom.
Watch your mouth.
You're just gonna let this stand?

Hey.
Uh... ?
Donde esta el... bano?
Hey.
Are you... really here?
I could ask you the same thing.
It's hard to know what's real.
My father... said I had to come.
Your dead father?
I don't believe this.
- I'm going crazy.
- No.
That's not what I mean.
I mean... it's happening to you, too, of all people.
What?
I've been seeing things... people who aren't there... fireflies...
You've seen the fireflies?
I was sure...
I was losing my mind... that I was...
Look at me.
You're not crazy.
Aaron, none of this makes... any sense.
Not yet.
Out by the pool, I swear I saw empanadas.
You'll have to make do.
We only need to keep you alive a couple of days... till we find a buyer for you.
Look, I know I am... completely screwed, okay?
But I got to warn you.
Warn me?
What, I should be scared of you?
Not me.
This guy Nunez...
I've seen a thousand psychos like him.
You should get as far away from him as you can.
When my aunt and uncle died, I was alone, starving.
Nobody cared.
Nobody even looked at me... except for him.
He treated me like I was his son.
He's not your blood.
Yeah, he's nice to you, 'cause that keeps you on the hook.
The minute you screw up, you're gonna be strung up and whipped to death too.
Yeah?
Well, I'm not gonna screw up.
Let's get out of here.
You got to go, Miles.
What?
What are you doing?
Look, if I get away, it's on the kid, all right?
Nunez is gonna hurt him, maybe even kill him.
Right.
What do you think's gonna happen to you?
He's my son, Miles.
I'm not leaving.
Hey!
Hey!
Andale!
Vamonos!
Go!
You're a hero, kid.
I was trying to escape.
You caught me.
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?
You're a dick.
Who would have thought?
Between the two of us, you're the crazy one?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
Lloyd's a friend.
Okay.
And we'll get him back when Miles and the others get here.
It might be too late by then.
You're right.
It might be.
But getting yourself captured or killed isn't gonna help anybody.
That's not gonna happen.
The place is crawling with troops, grandpa.
You're not a soldier.
You're...
I'm old?
Not too old to smack a little respect into you.
Look, I understand the patriots, all that.
You feel like it's your fault.
You want to make it right.
I see where mom gets it from.
And you know how that's always worked out for her.
Un Tequila, por favor.
What was I supposed to do?
He's my son.
Oh, shut up.
You've been his dad for five minutes.
Now all of a sudden, you're cliff Huxtable?
You wouldn't do the same for Charlie?
Look...
I saw the kid in trouble.
I couldn't leave him, all right?
I don't know.
Maybe this gives him a step up with his boss, something... what do I have to give him, huh?
What have I got to give him, Miles?
I got nothing.
So I gave him me.
Yeah.
Well, you gave him me too.
I cannot believe the first selfless act of your entire life is the one that screws me too.
Thank you.
Shh.
Lower your voice.
What if someone hears?
Julia, your husband's responsible for putting your son through a world of hurt.
And I hate him for it, but we have got to stick to the plan.
All you have to do was get me into his office, into his files, and I will find what I need there.
- To blackmail him?
- To get the promotion that you've been dangling in front of me.
What if he finds out?
You could ruin everything.
Well... then you tell me.
What is the plan... for you to stay nestled in that soft feather bed of his?
Everything that I am doing
I am doing to protect you.
Well, from where I'm sitting... maybe you like the power he's giving you.
Maybe you like what else he's giving you too.
Tom...
If you go anywhere near his office...
I'm not sure... that I can protect you.
Can't... or won't?
I'm gonna go get a drink.
Don't go easy.
Do we want to sell him or bury him?
Okay, look, I've told her everything I know, but we've still got a lot of questions.
Like why you're both here.
It's 'cause the nano told you to come, am I right?
How do you know that?
I was always afraid that maybe one day they could wake up.
How'd they wake up?
What's the brain, besides a cloud of neurons all talking to each other?
You get enough of 'em together...
You cross into consciousness.
There are more nanites than there are neurons in a brain... in a million brains.
So, if they learn to network...
That's a big-ass brain.
But it still doesn't explain why us.
It's the code you wrote, Aaron...
The one we stole.
We didn't just use it for the tower.
We put it in the nano too.
You what?
Me, Rachel, Warren... we built its body.
But you gave it its mind.
And let me guess.
You had some help.
Yeah, it was my thesis, but, yeah, Priscilla helped.
So that's why you.
Like anybody, damn thing just wants to know who its parents are.
Our friend Peter... he helped too.
I wonder why he wasn't called too.
This is just... this is a lot to take in.
You think that's a lot?
Try wrapping your head around this.
This thing is everywhere.
And apparently, it's got a mind of its own.
Yeah.
Aaron, how is that any different from God?
Oh, hell.
Lloyd.
Who are you?
- Just hold on.
- Step out slow.
I work here.
I'm on the night shift.
Yeah, well, you're coming with me.
How... how did you know I was here?
Because you're exactly like mom.
Neither of you listen.
Come on, drop him.
Freeze!
Stop right there!
It's you.
You found this in the main kitchen under the butcher's block.
You went downstairs.
You let them out.
You never saw me.
Why are you doing this?
He did it for me.
So it turns out a thesis project from M.I.T.
makes you mother of the world's first A.I.
Welcome to the SyFy channel.
Maybe you were better off thinking you were crazy.
No.
That was much worse.
I felt like... like I lost my grip... my sanity.
And I was scared.
My husband couldn't handle it.
He took the kids and left.
What about you?
I thought I was going crazy too.
I had someone too.
She didn't leave.
She stood by me through all of it.
She stood by me, and she died for it.
What do we do now?
I told you I do not know who had access to the...
I just moved in, damn it.
Victor, what... what happened?
Someone broke into my office.
They went through all my files, through everything.
Any idea who?
Don't worry, okay?
I'll get us more security.
Whoever did this... we'll find him.
Come here.
So your kid did this to you.
Yeah.
I guess I should've hugged him more.
What are you doing here?
Move.
Keys.
Where'd you get keys?
Your son.
Stop!
It's enough.
Put it down now.
Just let him go.
He slipped that bitch a key.
Actually thought he could get away with it.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.
Loyalty doesn't need to think.
Don't... don't... don't hurt him, all right?
I have to hurt him now because of you, 'cause he tried to take you from me, and you, I own.
I thought you said he was like a son to you.
Yes.
He has broken my heart.
I took care of you.
And you have chosen him over me.
Let's just talk about this.
Sorry, kid.
But you know better than anyone that I can't have people thinking I'm weak.
Well, I'll tell you... you know who obsesses about weakness?
Weak people.
Adios, Connor.
- Well, he's pretty good, huh?
- Shut up and focus.
Come on.
Come on, let's go!
Let's go.
That was pretty stupid back there, sticking your neck out like that...
I just, uh...
- I just wanted to s...
- Go to hell.
Take it easy, all right?
My back.
Helping you was the worst mistake of my life.
I lost everything I had 'cause of you.
You're welcome.
- You think you can get it back?
- What?
Everything you pissed away... your army, your Republic.
One, I can do whatever the hell I want.
That's the way it's always been.
Two...
We're gonna get it back... you and me, together.
Good.
But you better be telling the truth.
Okay, first we got to mop up some of these red, white, and blue cockroaches, but you stick with me.
We're just getting started.
Are you lost, ma'am?
A word, Captain.
What were you thinking, Tom?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't give me that poker face.
Evening.
You broke into his office.
This poker face is my face.
And I don't know what you're talking about.
It wasn't you.
But then who was...
What did you do, boy?
Did you break into Doyle's office?
The two of you... you're scheming.
You're tearing into each other and everybody else.
You don't even care that the world is burning down around you.
Yeah...
I dug into his office.
I had to.
They're gonna know it's you, Jason.
Oh, my God.
You know what else I also found out?
The reprogramming is just the beginning.
Dad, it's so much worse.
They're gonna start wiping people out.
We have to think, Jason.
We have to get you out of here.
No, you're not listening to me.
- Jason.
- You're a damn fool.
Jason Neville.
- Come with us, son.
- Why?
What is this about?
Do you want me to start asking you questions?
Ed...
Please, just let her go.
Bring 'em with me.
If you're gonna kill us, just kill us.
You'll need these.
What's happening?
They have typhus.
We had one case three days ago...
Lloyd Welliver.
Now we have four.
So... we're just trying to get ready as fast as we can.
So that's what you're building out here.
This is a quarantine camp.
This is an outbreak.
Look, I know we have our differences.
But we have one thing in common... this town.
And if we don't work together... we're gonna lose it.
Previously on Revolution...

Yeah, it was my thesis, but, yeah, Priscilla helped.
So that's why you.
Like anybody, damn thing just wants to know who its parents are.
Our friend Peter... he helped too.
I wonder why he wasn't called too.
This is just... this is a lot to take in.
You think that's a lot?
Try wrapping your head around this.
This thing is everywhere.
And apparently, it's got a mind of its own.
Yeah.
Aaron, how is that any different from God?
Oh, hell.
Lloyd.
Who are you?
- Just hold on.
- Step out slow.
I work here.
I'm on the night shift.
Yeah, well, you're coming with me.
How... how did you know I was here?
Because you're exactly like mom.
Neither of you listen.
Come on, drop him.
Freeze!
Stop right there!
It's you.
You found this in the main kitchen under the butcher's block.
You went downstairs.
You let them out.
You never saw me.
Why are you doing this?
He did it for me.
So it turns out a thesis project from M.I.T.
makes you mother of the world's first A.I.
Welcome to the SyFy channel.
Maybe you were better off thinking you were crazy.
No.
That was much worse.
I felt like... like I lost my grip... my sanity.
And I was scared.
My husband couldn't handle it.
He took the kids and left.
What about you?
I thought I was going crazy too.
I had someone too.
She didn't leave.
She stood by me through all of it.
She stood by me, and she died for it.
What do we do now?
I told you I do not know who had access to the...
I just moved in, damn it.
Victor, what... what happened?
Someone broke into my office.
They went through all my files, through everything.
Any idea who?
Don't worry, okay?
I'll get us more security.
Whoever did this... we'll find him.
Come here.
So your kid did this to you.
Yeah.
I guess I should've hugged him more.
What are you doing here?
Move.
Keys.
Where'd you get keys?
Your son.
Stop!
It's enough.
Put it down now.
Just let him go.
He slipped that bitch a key.
Actually thought he could get away with it.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.
Loyalty doesn't need to think.
Don't... don't... don't hurt him, all right?
I have to hurt him now because of you, 'cause he tried to take you from me, and you, I own.
I thought you said he was like a son to you.
Yes.
He has broken my heart.
I took care of you.
And you have chosen him over me.
Let's just talk about this.
Sorry, kid.
But you know better than anyone that I can't have people thinking I'm weak.
Well, I'll tell you... you know who obsesses about weakness?
Weak people.
Adios, Connor.
- Well, he's pretty good, huh?
- Shut up and focus.
Come on.
Come on, let's go!
Let's go.
That was pretty stupid back there, sticking your neck out like that...
I just, uh...
- I just wanted to s...
- Go to hell.
Take it easy, all right?
My back.
Helping you was the worst mistake of my life.
I lost everything I had 'cause of you.
You're welcome.
- You think you can get it back?
- What?
Everything you pissed away... your army, your Republic.
One, I can do whatever the hell I want.
That's the way it's always been.
Two...
We're gonna get it back... you and me, together.
Good.
But you better be telling the truth.
Okay, first we got to mop up some of these red, white, and blue cockroaches, but you stick with me.
We're just getting started.
Are you lost, ma'am?
A word, Captain.
What were you thinking, Tom?

But then who was...
What did you do, boy?
Did you break into Doyle's office?
The two of you... you're scheming.
You're tearing into each other and everybody else.
You don't even care that the world is burning down around you.
Yeah...
I dug into his office.
I had to.
They're gonna know it's you, Jason.
Oh, my God.
You know what else I also found out?
The reprogramming is just the beginning.
Dad, it's so much worse.
They're gonna start wiping people out.
We have to think, Jason.
We have to get you out of here.
No, you're not listening to me.

- You're a damn fool.
Jason Neville.

They have typhus.
We had one case three days ago...
Lloyd Welliver.
Now we have four.

This is a quarantine camp.
This is an outbreak.

But we have one thing in common... this town.
And if we don't work together... we're gonna lose it.
Have you ever been to Spring City, Oklahoma?
It has to be important, or he wouldn't have said it.
Aaron, I just want you to know how sorry I am.
Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to her.
I am not going back to being some lame housewife, Tom.

You're a hero, kid.
I was trying to escape.
You caught me.
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?
[Shouting in Spanish]
You're a dick.
Who would have thought?
Between the two of us, you're the crazy one?
Maybe you didn't hear me.
Lloyd's a friend.
Okay.
And we'll get him back when Miles and the others get here.
It might be too late by then.
You're right.
It might be.
But getting yourself captured or killed isn't gonna help anybody.
That's not gonna happen.
The place is crawling with troops, grandpa.
You're not a soldier.
You're...
I'm old?
Not too old to smack a little respect into you.
Look, I understand the patriots, all that.
You feel like it's your fault.
You want to make it right.
I see where mom gets it from.
And you know how that's always worked out for her.

Oh, shut up.
You've been his dad for five minutes.
Now all of a sudden, you're cliff Huxtable?
You wouldn't do the same for Charlie?
Look...
I saw the kid in trouble.
I couldn't leave him, all right?
I don't know.
Maybe this gives him a step up with his boss, something... what do I have to give him, huh?
What have I got to give him, Miles?
I got nothing.
So I gave him me.
Yeah.
Well, you gave him me too.
I cannot believe the first selfless act of your entire life is the one that screws me too.
Thank you.
Shh.
Lower your voice.
What if someone hears?
Julia, your husband's responsible for putting your son through a world of hurt.
And I hate him for it, but we have got to stick to the plan.
All you have to do was get me into his office, into his files, and I will find what I need there.
- To blackmail him?
- To get the promotion that you've been dangling in front of me.
What if he finds out?
You could ruin everything.
Well... then you tell me.
What is the plan... for you to stay nestled in that soft feather bed of his?
Everything that I am doing
I am doing to protect you.
Well, from where I'm sitting... maybe you like the power he's giving you.
Maybe you like what else he's giving you too.

How do you know that?
I was always afraid that maybe one day they could wake up.

You had some help.
Yeah, it was my thesis, but, yeah, Priscilla helped.

No.

My husband couldn't handle it.
He took the kids and left.

I am not going back to being some lame housewife, Tom.
There is a life that you promised me, and I have sacrificed a hell of a lot to get it.

I am going to take a knife, and I am going to gut that chief of staff husband of yours.
You took my son to Mexico?

You are a Monroe.
You should be leading the republic.

Connor here is your blood.

You know, I always knew he was special somehow.
I knew it from the first time I saw him.
Took him off the street, gave him a home-- my home.
I practically raised him, and now look at him.
He's my right hand.
That's touching, really.
So, uh...
What are you gonna do with me?
What do you think, Connor?
What should we do with your dear old dad?
I say... we sell him to the highest bidder.
Texas, Mexico... someone's gonna pay a lot for his sorry ass.

Congratulations on you and your husband's new position as chief of staff--
Compliments of Commander Allenford.
Please convey my thanks to the commander.
Here.
Thank you.
I was wondering if you had a chance to talk to your husband yet about my desire to join his security detail.
Well, it's just my first day, but when the time is right, I'll-- -
Time is right for what?
Oh, n-nothing, dear.
Just a social invitation from Commander Allenford.
Wait till you see the gift that we-- well, you-- received from the president.
It's a quill pen that once belonged to John Adams.
Hey, you got to take a look at this.
Not now.
Now.
Where the hell did you get this?
Out of Allenford's room.
Look.
Reeducation programs, same kind I was in-- they're opening more.
Scranton, Pennsylvania,
Willoughby, Texas,
Clearwater, Florida, everywhere.
Guess who's behind it.
My new stepdad, Doyle-- he runs the whole thing.
What the hell do you want me to do about it?
Something, anything.
After what that program did to me... pretty much the guy who screwed me is screwing mom.
Watch your mouth.
You're just gonna let this stand?
Are you... really here?
I could ask you the same thing.
It's hard to know what's real.
My father... said I had to come.
Your dead father?
I don't believe this.
- I'm going crazy.
- No.
That's not what I mean.
I mean... it's happening to you, too, of all people.
What?

You've seen the fireflies?

Look at me.
You're not crazy.
Aaron, none of this makes... any sense.
Not yet.
Out by the pool, I swear I saw empanadas.
You'll have to make do.
We only need to keep you alive a couple of days...
Till we find a buyer for you.
Look, I know I am... completely screwed, okay?
But I got to warn you.
Warn me?
What, I should be scared of you?
Not me.
This guy Nunez--
I've seen a thousand psychos like him.
You should get as far away from him as you can.
When my aunt and uncle died,
I was alone, starving.
Nobody cared.
Nobody even looked at me...
Except for him.
He treated me like I was his son.
He's not your blood.
Yeah, he's nice to you, 'cause that keeps you on the hook.
The minute you screw up, you're gonna be strung up and whipped to death too.
Yeah?
Well, I'm not gonna screw up.
Let's get out of here.
You got to go, Miles.
What?
What are you doing?
Look, if I get away, it's on the kid, all right?
Nunez is gonna hurt him, maybe even kill him.
Right.
What do you think's gonna happen to you?
He's my son, Miles.
I'm not leaving.

This town.
And if we don't work together...
We're gonna lose it.
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Do you need assistance?
Are you in danger?
Castle, what if it rains?
On our wedding day?
That's supposed to be good luck.
But we'll find a venue that has an indoor area, just in case.
Even if we find the perfect place,
- it's not gonna be available until at least October.
- October!
Harvest season.
Perfect.
Perfect, except if you want my dad to walk me down the aisle.
He's gonna be in Europe on the research project.
Oh.
Fine.
We'll have a winter wedding.
Didn't we say we wanted to do it outside?
Right.
Yeah, frostbite isn't very festive.
How about we get hitched, spring of next year?
And what if I wanna get married sooner?
Who could blame you?
You two are so adorable.
Oh, you know what?
Maybe we could find a venue for this summer.
You want to have a wedding in the middle of a New York summer?
No.
You're right.
Oh!
I know!
September!
It's not too hot.
It's not too cold.
It's right in the goldilocks zone.
- It's perfect.
- It is, except I'll be out of town every weekend on my book signing tour.
So unless we get married on a Monday,
September's gonna be tough.
A little unsolicited advice.
Do you give another kind?
In life, there is no such thing as a perfect time for anything.
I'm sorry, that's advice how?
Don't wait!
Hell, just go down to city hall right now.
You love each other.
Stop talking about it.
Just do it.
- We'll find a date.
It's gonna be fine.
- Let's keep... yeah, looking.
Okay.
Beckett.
I don't know, Castle.
Maybe we're being too ambitious.
Maybe we should consider the spring of next year.
I thought you didn't wanna wait that long.
Nah, I just...
I wanna be flexible.
You already are flexible.
You see what I... did there.
What's so funny?
Well, actually, did you know Beckett can lift her...
- No, nothing.
Hello.
Nothing.
- I'll tell you later.
- No.
- No.
Well, our victim is a Ted Rollins.
He was shot twice in the chest.
He was 20 years old, lived alone, and worked part-time at a secondhand record store.
So how's a 20-year-old who sells used records for a living own a place like this?
This is one of the many things that don't add up here.
Like why he's soaking wet?
The killer left Ted Rollins' body in the shower.
When the officers arrived, the water was still going.
And who called them in?
That's a good question.
At 11:50, uniforms responded to a 9-1-1 call made from the victim's cell phone.
But the time of death is between 8:00 and 11:00.
So there's no way Ted could've placed that call.
So the killer shot him and then called 9-1-1.
Except our victim was not shot in this apartment.
How do we know that?
Because he has exit wounds in his back, but there are no bullets in the bathroom or anywhere else in the apartment.
Plus lividity indicates the body was moved.
Okay, so then the killer put him in the shower to wash off the trace evidence from the original crime scene.
And it almost worked except for this.
The grease here with the tiny red specks?
Water didn't get that out.
It's on his knees and his elbows.
I'm thinking he fell when he got shot and landed in that stuff.
Okay, let's get this material to C.S.U.
- See if they can tell us where he was killed.
- I don't get it.
Why would the killer risk moving the body back here from the crime scene?
Sounds like a case of
"Weekend at Bernie's" gone wrong.
No.
No, wait.
That would have to mean there's such a thing as a "Weekend at Bernie's" gone right.
Wait a minute.
These two shoelaces are tied differently.
That is odd.
This is even more odd.
What are you doing?
Looks like Ted's got a secret compartment.
And what's a secret compartment... without a secret?
A laptop.
The key to our mystery and the identity of our killer may lie within that device.
Well, if it does, I can't get to it.
Honestly, I've never seen anything like this before.
So what are we looking at here?
A very high-level encryption program.
What, and you can't crack it?
Come on, genius bar.
I thought you were the best.
I am.
It's just whoever designed this is... better.
- But give me some time.
Let me see what I can do.
- All right.
Anyone else wondering what a record store clerk is doing with this kind of technology?
Espo, did you contact next of kin?
Yeah, Ted's father and little brother.
They're on their way down.
I just talked to Ted yesterday.
How could he be gone?
Mr. Rollins, when you spoke with your son, did he seem worried or scared about anything?
He said everything was fine.
Maybe you could help us with something else.
We found a laptop in one of the floorboards of Ted's place with a highly sophisticated encryption system.
Either one of you know what it was doing there?
What is it?
Ted was a... computer whiz.
More like a genius.
But it got him into trouble.
When Ted was in high school, he got into identity theft... hijacking credit cards, bank accounts, stuff like that.
Yeah, he'd call it "pulling a Robin Hood."
'Cause he would steal from the rich and give to the poor.
The poor being Ted?
He was just a kid.
So how much did he end up stealing?
- $1.4 million.
- Whoa.
But the judge made him give it back.
Part of Ted's plea deal was that he was barred from using any devices connecting him to the Internet.
So he shouldn't have had that laptop.
Is there anything to indicate that he went back to committing identity theft?
I was laid off, and...
Ted helped me with Grant's tuition.
I knew he was up to something.
I just didn't wanna believe he was hacking again.
Okay, so, let's just say he went back to stealing identities.
Does that explain why he was killed?
Yeah, people get pissed about getting their identities stolen, but normally, they report it to the police.
Well, maybe he stole from the kind of people that don't report to the police.
Hey!
Look who's back from paternity leave.
So how's Sarah Grace?
Oh!
Man.
I tell you, she is just... my perfect little angel.
- Oh, she's so cute.
Wow.
- Yeah.
Is it me or... or does she...
look a lot like Esposito?
Yeah, she does.
- Wow.
- Really, Beckett?
I expected that from Jackass but not from you.
Anyway, so I got that C.S.U. report back.
Looks like Ted might've been killed in an auto body shop.
Did he even own a car?
No, but they identified that sludge on Ted's clothes.
It's hydraulic fluid mixed with red paint flecks.
Now the paint is urethane-based with high levels of a volatile organic compound, so it's most likely from a car painted prior to the 1990s.
Okay, canvass the auto shops near Ted's place.
Maybe he was seen at one of them.
- Yeah.
- Hey!
Beckett, we got something.
Now, Ted's laptop is like Fort Knox on steroids.
But Tory found some unscrambled artifacts in the registry to a service set identifier.
I don't know what that means either, but she got really excited about it.
And here's why.
Yesterday at 7:19 P.M. Ted connected to a dedicated server of a private computer network.
I traced the network.
It belongs to...
Universal Banking Solutions.
They're based in Chicago but have satellite offices all over the world, including Manhattan, which is where Ted connected.
Now according to the web site, "Universal Banking Solutions"
"handles strategic and tactical procurements"
"for international clients."
And what does that mean?
I...
I don't...
I was just reading the screen there.
Okay, so what did Ted do when he connected to the server?
It's impossible to tell.
He could've sent an e-mail or accessed the web site.
Or he hacked it.
That, too.
Whatever he did, it was the last time this laptop was used before he died.
Okay, so, who runs the Manhattan office?
Anderson Cross.
All right, let's see if Mr. Cross knows what Ted was up to.
I don't know, Castle.
Maybe your mom's right.
I think elopement's a great idea.
There's no planning, no lists.
All we do is we just get married.
Beckett, I promise you, there is a perfect date for our perfect wedding, and we will find it.
- Trust me.
- I do.
Oh, wedding humor.
Nice.
We need to speak with Anderson Cross.
Let me see if he's available.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
Castle.
Richard, something is about to happen.
But you cannot react.
I'm sorry.
Who is this?
Lives are at stake.
Don't react.
Sorry, Mr. Cross isn't picking up.
Oh.
Here he is.
Mr. Cross, these people are here to see you.
Hello there.
I'm Anderson Cross.
Hi.
I'm detective Kate Beckett.
N.Y.P.D.
Detective Beckett, so nice to meet you.
And, this is Richard Castle.
Sorry.
I didn't get the name.
Richard.
Richard Castle.
So why don't we go on into the conference room where we can talk?
Yes.
Dad?
Not a word.
Castle 6x12
- Deep Cover Original air date January 13, 2014
So, I don't mean to rush us, but I do have an appointment in a few minutes.
Actually, this won't take very long, Mr. Cross.
Um, do you know a man named Ted Rollins?
No, I...
I don't believe I do.
Why?
He was murdered last night.
Oh.
Okay.
I'm not sure what that has to do with me.
Well, we believe that he tried to access your network yesterday evening around 7:19.
Do you have any idea why he would do that?
Well, as a matter of fact, I just got a report from my I.T. people saying that someone tried to hack into our system around about that time.
And what exactly does your company do?
Well, we basically handle, multi-million dollar currency transactions for banks, international businesses, foreign countries and the like.
Maybe Ted was trying to...
tap in and steal from one of those transactions.
Well, if he did... he was quite unsuccessful.
Has anyone tried to hack into your company's network before?
Oh, yes.
But we have quite a robust firewall system.
It's never been breached.
Um, well, would you mind giving me copies of your incursion reports along with the ones from last night?
Of course.
I'll send them right over to you.
Okay, thank you.
Thanks for your time.
I'm sorry, Mr. Cross, have we ever met before?
I don't believe we have.
Really?
Because you just seem so familiar.
Really?
I have one of those faces.
Um, Lanie's got something for us.
We should go.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Not at all.
My pleasure.
Okay, so I may know why one of Ted's shoes was tied differently.
The killer was looking for something.
In his shoes?
Yep.
At the time of his death,
Ted had a coin in his right sock.
Due to rigor mortis, an impression remained, including these faint markings.
You see that?
Yeah.
Wow.
Hey, Castle.
You with us?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Let me get this straight.
So, after Ted was shot, the killer took off the shoe and the sock, grabbed the coin and then put the shoe and sock back on?
Must've been a valuable coin.
Actually, it wasn't.
I did some enhancement.
And based on the coin's diameter and the markings, we've identified it as an Iranian rial, worth less than a penny.
Wow, an Iranian rial?
Castle?
No... theories on international intrigue or covert espionage?
We really don't have the information to speculate at this point.
Okay.
Were you able to narrow down where Ted was killed?
No, but I did check his stomach contents.
And I can tell you this...
approximately 15 minutes before his death, Ted ate clams and funnel cake.
Can you believe that?
Lanie, you slice open dead people for a living and you're grossed out by that?
Even I have my limits.
Okay, fine, clams and funnel cake.
That sounds like he had amusement park food.
Right, and the hydraulic fluid and red paint on Ted's clothes?
He was at an amusement park, and I can tell you which one.
How?
Well, as a connoisseur of carny food, there's only one amusement park that has both fried clams and funnel cake, and that park is...
- Coney Island.
- Coney Island.
Okay, you two creep me out
When you do that shared brain thing.
I...
Hey, I...
I forgot I had to...
drop by my publisher's.
We gotta look at the... galleys.
There's another...
for the Derrick Storm... novels.
There's the galley, and...
Great.
Thanks.
Hey, Beckett!
The head of Coney Island's maintenance staff said that the only place there would be hydraulic fluid and paint is the repair facility under the roller coaster.
Okay, let's have park security check it out for us.
They have.
And they found blood.
Well, this is definitely where Ted was killed.
Why here?
What was he up to?
Yo, funnel cake vendor remembered seeing Ted.
Said he got his food and walked in this direction.
Was he with anyone?
- Not that he saw.
- Killer must've followed him.
Or maybe they came here to meet.
Yeah, why wouldn't the killer leave the body here?
Why would he drag it all the way back to Manhattan to the victim's own apartment?
To throw us off his trail.
Or maybe the killer didn't want us to find the crime scene because there's something here that ties him to the murder.
Do they have security cameras here?
Just that one covering the south entrance.
Okay, let's talk to park security.
Get them to give us the surveillance footage.
Oh.
There you go.
- God bless you, man.
- Yeah.
Sit behind me.
Never thought I'd see you again.
Ted Rollins.
Your victim.
What have you learned?
What have I le...
I'm sorry, until a year ago, I had no idea who you were, and now you come out of the blue and the only thing you have to say is,
"what have you learned?"
How about a, "hello, son.
How you been?"
You're getting emotional.
Now is not the time.
Really?
'Cause it's been about 40 years.
So when would be a good time?
With what I do?
Never.
Or did you forget what happened in Paris?
No.
How could I forget?
Then stop acting like you did.
You know what I do.
You know who I am.
I let my guard down, people die.
People like Ted?
So who was he really?
Who killed him?
You need to tell me what you know.
You don't trust me.
Trust kills faster than bullets.
Look, there's a storm coming.
And if I don't stop it, a lot more people are gonna die.
Just tell me what you know.
Um... he was shot at Coney Island under the roller coaster.
There was a coin in his sock.
An Iranian rial.
Do you have the coin?
No, the killer took it.
Why would he do that?
What does that mean?
It means I gotta go.
If there's any update, text me.
Say you need to meet, and I'll be back here within 30 minutes.
Don't tell anyone about this, about me.
Not even your fiancée.
How'd you know we were engaged?
Well, I may not be good at it, but I am still your father.
Now keep your mouth shut.
And let's try not to get us both killed.
What's wrong?
You don't like the artwork for your graphic novel?
Oh, no, no, it's great.
It's good, it's, um...
So we were right about Coney Island?
Yes.
One mystery solved.
Only it's led us to a few new ones.
Like what was Ted doing there in the first place?
- Yeah.
It's weird.
- It's more than weird.
Something bigger's going on here, don't you think?
Hey, guys.
Come check this out.
This is surveillance from that security camera at the entrance of the roller coaster repair yard.
Ted enters alone at 8:47 P.M.
Did anyone enter prior to that?
No.
But about 15 minutes later at 9:04 P.M., someone does.
Wait.
Zoom in and freeze it.
That's Anderson Cross.
Oh, my God.
He's our killer.
This whole time it was Anderson Cross.
So Ted must've hacked into his system, and he decided to take matters into his own hands.
But that doesn't seem likely.
I mean, he really doesn't seem the type.
Castle, what are you talking about?
He lied to us.
He told us he didn't know Ted, and there he is at the crime scene.
We don't actually see him commit murder.
There's a number of entrances to that area, but there's only one camera.
It just... may not be what it seems.
So, what?
He just happened to be there two hours after Ted hacked his company?
I'm... just saying that Anderson Cross is the killer?
It's just the obvious choice.
Well, that's usually what happens when all the evidence points to a suspect.
We have to get him down here.
Pull up everything you can on his company.
- This makes no sense.
- What?
It's gone.
The site disappeared.
Actually, not just the site.
Every trace of the company.
Find Anderson Cross now.
Who the hell is this guy?
He's obviously not a banker.
I know why he looks familiar.
- Where you going?
- To check something.
Pick up, pick up.
Leave a message.
- Hey, Castle.
- Jeez!
Damn, bro.
Why you so jumpy?
I'm... dude, I'm not.
I'm just...
Well, you will be once you hear what we've found.
Come on.
So, this guy, Anderson Cross, is like a villain in one of your books.
His office was cleared out like he knew we were coming.
- There wasn't a trace of him?
- Nothin'.
Even his receptionist.
She was hired from a temp agency.
Just started working yesterday.
She doesn't know jack.
Neither did the building manager.
He said that Cross rented the place from him last month, paid for a year's lease with a cashier's check.
So it's totally untraceable.
Yeah, whoever this guy is, he's in a different league.
And we've crossed paths before.
What do you mean?
Check this out.
Remember this guy?
Alexis's kidnapping last year.
Damn, that's right.
witnesses kept seeing him pop up at locations associated with her abduction.
And at each one of those locations, there was a dead body.
So I sent the video surveillance to a friend of mine in the A.G.'s office, and he got a hit.
Now he couldn't get into details, but he did say that this guy is a former C.I.A. operative.
Wait a minute.
Former?
Yeah, he, he was disowned for an unauthorized assassination.
He was sentenced to life, broke out, killed three guards in the process.
This guy's wanted by our government.
Now my friend said that the rumor is, he's working as a hit man.
And if we get eyes on him, the A.G.'s office wants us to call them so they can send in a strike team.
Why would a guy like this wanna kill Ted Rollins?
More than that, how are we gonna find a former spy?
He's spent a lifetime covering his tracks.
Yeah, but Ted hasn't.
And somehow they're connected.
So, we should see if Hansel left any breadcrumbs towards our suspect.
We need to retrace every one of Ted's footsteps.
Our killer knew him well enough to know where he lived.
- I mean, they had to have had previous contact.
- Okay.
Castle, did you ever see this man in Paris?
Not that I can remember.
Why don't you, um, text me those sketches?
I'll have, Alexis come over.
See if she recognizes him.
Do you want me to come along?
No.
No, no.
That's...
I'll call you.
You okay?
Yeah.
So I'm coming up with a whole bunch of nothing.
You?
Check it out.
It's a printout of Ted's metrocard.
Look how he got to Coney Island yesterday.
He swiped his card at the 33rd and Park Avenue South station.
Probably took the 6 to the N train.
So?
So look at his swipes for the past two weeks.
He kept going back and forth to that subway stop at 33rd and Park.
Exactly.
And he didn't work, live, or know anyone in that area.
- All right.
Let's get up there and see what he was doing.
- All right.
Oh!
Richard, you're home early.
Care for a glass of liquefied heaven?
Good for your hair, good for your te...
Richard, what is it?
Of course, I believed him, because he's my father.
Well, especially after Paris.
I mean, why wouldn't you?
But he used me... to stay ahead of the investigation, to know when to make a run for it.
If he's innocent, why didn't he show up at the park?
Richard, look... the only thing we really know about him is that we don't know him.
Me?
I had one night with him.
You?
A day in Paris.
Lean on the people you trust.
Call Katherine.
Tell her what's going on.
I'll get that.
And what if he's telling the truth?
What if he isn't?
Hello, Martha.
It's been a while?
What the hell are you doing here?
Sorry to miss our meeting, but, I was a little busy getting shot.
Oh, my God!
Come in.
You look good.
Yeah, well, you've looked better.
Oh!
Sorry.
Okay, I boiled everything just like you said.
But I have to warn you, my only other experience with surgery involved a board game and a guy whose nose lit up when I made a mistake.
Did you bring the booze?
Yeah.
No, right here.
You want something to dull the pain?
No, I want you to steady your nerves.
Take a swig.
Good idea.
Okay.
Okay, now, make an incision through the wound about an inch long.
Here you go.
Okay.
About an inch.
- Okay.
- Oh.
All right, now here comes the fun part.
Carefully, and I do mean carefully, pull the slug out.
But do me a favor.
Try not to make my nose light up?
Right.
Okay.
I think I have it.
I got it.
- Oh!
- I don't got it.
Sorry.
Careful, Richard.
Now that you know how not to do it, let's try the other way.
Yeah, right.
- Okay, let me just get you here.
- Thank you.
Okay.
I think I have it.
All right...
I think I...
- I have it.
- Bravo!
Real good.
- There we go.
- Oh, we go.
Martha, hand me the needle and thread.
Okay, here it is.
And there we go.
All right, you've stitched yourself up before, I take it?
At least this time I got a needle.
So, you wanna tell us how you got shot?
Not particularly.
What about the three guards you murdered while escaping from prison...
you wanna tell us about them?
Don't believe everything you read.
So you didn't kill 'em?
I work outside the system, which means I need an effective cover.
Hired assassin, wanted by Uncle Sam... opens a lot of doors.
Castle?
Crap.
Hey, so I thought I'd see if Alexis remembers anything more about the man from the sketches.
Yeah, about the man in the sketches, um... something you should know about him.
What?
He's your future father-in-law.
Nice to see you again, Kate.
Katherine,
I wanna say this isn't what it looks like, but it is.
- I was gonna tell you.
I swear.
- When?
After you patched him up?
Sent him on his merry way?
He's wanted by the government.
You are harboring a fugitive.
That's just his cover.
And you know that, how?
Because he told you?
Because of Paris.
And because he's my father.
He is not your father.
He made that choice a long time ago.
This man is my suspect.
Now you know what I have to do, right?
Boy, she is a spitfire, this one.
I'm glad we're on the same side.
Who says we're on the same side?
I'm sorry.
He wouldn't stay put.
- Richard, I need your laptop.
Now.
- Right.
No.
The only thing that you are getting is a ride to my precinct in handcuffs.
You're not gonna arrest me.
Really?
Why?
Because you want answers.
And if you take me in, you're not gonna get any.
The feds will swoop in.
You won't have anything, and I'll have lost valuable time.
You want Ted's killer?
So do I.
There's a hell of a lot more at stake here than murder.
Then you're gonna have to tell me what it is.
There was a massive breach at the C.I.A.
Someone hacked the files containing the identities of our deep cover operatives.
Do you know who?
No.
But it was an inside job at the highest level.
That's why they called me.
Because I'm outside.
My orders were to find the mole and recover the files.
What does any of this have to do with Ted?
Ted was one of my best guys.
I recruited him to help me find Gemini.
Gemini?
Code name for the mole.
He was planning on selling the D.C.O. lists.
But we couldn't find him.
If these files get out, the consequences will be very real.
Then yesterday we had a breakthrough.
Ted identified the buyer and he signaled me to meet so he could tell me who it was.
But...
But Gemini got there first.
He killed Ted.
Leaving me S.O.L., until you told me about the Iranian rial.
- You... you told him about the rial?
- I...
Ted left that as a fail-safe message... about the buyer.
Right, it's old school spycraft.
But Gemini knows all the old tricks, so he took that coin to throw you off his scent.
Yeah, once I found out the Iranians were involved,
I traced Ted's trail back to an apartment on East 38th street across from the Iranian mission.
Only Gemini got there ahead of me.
And he ambushed you?
From a rooftop across the way.
Soon as I opened the door, all hell broke loose.
But...
I'm good at hell.
I made my way back to the car, but he was right on my tail.
I had to drive into the East River just to get away from him.
Look, this is an incredible story, and I can see where Castle gets his talent, but it doesn't mean that any of what you said is true.
You don't believe me?
Mnh-mnh.
Turn on the news.
A high-speed car chase rocked the neighborhood of Murray Hill just hours ago.
According to multiple reports, the pursuit began with gunshots at an apartment on East 38th street where two unidentified men were involved in a gun battle.
That doesn't prove anything.
Beckett.
So, whatever our boy Ted was into, it's all some crazy-ass spy stuff.
What makes you say that?
Well, you heard about that car chase in Murray Hill?
Well, we're at the epicenter.
It's a shot-up apartment at 38th and 3rd.
It's where it all started.
According to the super,
Ted Rollins rented this place two weeks ago.
By the looks of the equipment, he was hacking.
- Hacking who?
- I don't know.
He's got a pretty sophisticated wi-fi sniffer here.
So, must've been intercepting Internet traffic from someone.
The Iranian mission across the street.
What exactly did Ted intercept?
I don't know.
Someone stole the hard drive.
Can I borrow your laptop now?
These are communications to and from the Iranian mission.
Yep.
That's incredibly illegal.
Yep.
Okay, here.
Ted flagged this one.
It's an anonymous e-mail from Izad Larjani.
He's part of Vevak...
Iran's C.I.A.
"F.C. payment received.
Central Library reading room."
"Tomorrow 5:00 P.M. Network name:
Kingfish."
This was sent yesterday.
Which means it's going down today.
He's sending the D.C.O. list over a secured wi-fi connection in... roughly 30 minutes.
Central Library's a perfect location...
It's public.
There's lots of people on laptops.
Gemini never has to meet with his buyer face to face.
Wi-fi signals max out at about 200 feet indoors.
He and the buyer will have to be in the building at the same time.
Given everything that's happened, why would he still go through with the exchange?
"F.C." means "final communication."
All links have been severed.
If Gemini pulls out, he has no way to tell his buyer.
He will do anything in his power to make the transfer.
I gotta go.
I gotta stop this.
Well, are you crazy?
!
We just pulled a bullet out of you.
Can't you call someone?
This mission does not exist.
I don't exist.
There's no one to call.
Don't you have back-up?
I am the back-up.
- You're in no condition...
- You don't understand!
This list cannot get out into the open.
Then we'll go.
Castle's right.
You are in no condition.
And if we stop him, then we all get what we want.
Let's run this just so we know we're all on the same page.
Richard, what do you do?
As soon as the Kingfish network goes online, I log in,
I download the list.
- You don't just log in.
You gotta be first.
- Right.
Why does he have to be first?
Because it locks out the Iranians from downloading the list.
Right.
And while Castle's downloading,
I'll track the signal using the wi-fi analyzer on my phone.
You could find a spy on your phone?
Mother, there's an app for everything now.
Now, Kate, remember, if you don't have a tactical advantage, just get eyes on him.
He's C.I.A.
If you can describe him, I can find him.
Okay.
It's almost 5:00.
We should go.
Richard, this means a lot, kid.
Thanks.
- Martha, I'm gonna need you...
- I know.
- He's not going anywhere.
- Okay.
If anything happens to them...
He's a smart kid.
And she's good at what she does.
No, they'll be fine.
I promise.
Forgive me, but your promises don't mean very much.
Gemini could be any one of these people.
Right.
Scanning for wi-fi signals.
I don't see Kingfish.
Maybe we're too late.
You still play?
No, not so much anymore.
A shame.
You were good.
That was hell of a night.
Hell of a night.
You remember the song you played?
"My funny Valentine."
It was a long time ago.
Oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh.
You need to lie down.
- All right, I am calling an ambulance for you.
- No, no, no.
No, it's just... my blood sugar's low.
You got any juice?
Yes.
5:04.
We blew it.
Did we?
Or did we just get played?
Look, Castle, I know he's your father.
What if there's an ulterior motive to all of this?
Kingfish is online.
Go.
All right.
Okay.
"T," hashtag, less than, "I."
- Uppercase "L."
- Oh.
Capital "L."
We gotta get online before the buyer.
Come on.
I'm in.
Downloading the file at slowest speed possible.
That gives you less than three minutes.
Okay, you stay here.
You tell me how much time I have.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
- I can hear you.
- Signal's getting stronger.
You've got 2 minutes, 40 seconds left.
Oh, no.
- You've got under two minutes.
- Okay, Castle,
I'm at the stairs and the signal's gotten weak again.
Did I pass him?
Wait a minute.
Wait.
We are demonstrating two-dimensional thinking here.
Like Khan in "Star Trek II:
Wrath of Khan."
Khan didn't realize that the Enterprise was below him.
Right.
So if we are the Enterprise, that means Gemini is...
- Is above us.
- Exactly.
Oh.
Oh, this is so not the time, mother.
A minute 15 left.
Castle, I'm in the book stacks.
I'm close.
All right, less than a minute.
Be careful.
Mom!
Do you see him?
Is he there?
Beckett.
Oh, no.
What?
Castle.
He set up some kind of a relay system.
Gemini could be anywhere.
What?
!
- Hang on.
Something is wrong.
- What?
Well, the download is complete.
But this is... this is not a C.I.A. list.
This is... this is a phone book.
- Richard Castle.
Wow.
- Castle...
I'm so sorry to bother you, sir, but I'm, like, your number one fan.
Can I get an autograph?
Actually, this is really not a good time.
What are you talking about?
Castle?
Castle, are you there?
That was you at the park, wasn't it?
Dressed as a homeless guy?
You're Gemini.
Let's go.
Nice and quiet.
Man who sent you... who is he?
Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
I saw you in the park with him.
Is he C.I.A.?
The phone book.
You knew not to send the real list because you were trying to draw him into the open.
That's right.
Looks like he was smart enough to send someone expendable.
All right, mystery writer.
Tell me a story.
Who's your handler?
What's his name?
Where is he?
Why should I tell you?
You're just gonna kill me anyway.
Yeah.
But I can slow, or I can kill you fast.
It's up to you.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah.
You all right?
Me?
You... you're the one who was shot.
Wasn't the first time.
- I'll go call an ambulance.
- Don't bother.
No!
No, no, wait.
Wha... why would you do that?
That was the mission.
That's what I do.
H... how did you even find me?
Your left coat pocket.
Wha... what is this?
Some kind of G.P.S. locator?
How did you...
The hug.
You slipped this on me.
I needed to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, to use me as bait.
Well, after the shoot-out at the apartment,
I knew I was blown.
But I still had to recover this list.
So, to keep the upper hand, you let Beckett and me walk into a trap.
We could've been killed.
I would never let anything happen to you two.
The way you never let anything happen to Ted?
There are reasons I have to do what I do, Richard.
One day you'll understand.
Now get Beckett.
Let her know we have her killer.
Castle, what happened?
- Come on.
Gemini's down here.
- Okay.
No.
No, no, no, no.
He was here.
He was here just a minute ago.
Of course he took the body.
Yeah.
But left Gemini's weapon.
That gun was a ballistics match to the one that killed Ted.
It's registered to...
Tony Blaine.
We searched his place.
Found clothes that tested positive for Ted's blood.
- Blaine's definitely our killer.
- But who is he?
He's a researcher at a government think tank.
Yeah, but what a researcher at a government think tank is doing involved in all this, we have no idea.
Yeah, we may never know.
Well, hold on.
We've got a B.O.L.O. out on him and we're monitoring his credit cards.
- We'll find him.
- And when we do, maybe he can tell us who this Anderson Cross is.
Yeah, maybe.
All right, great job, guys.
Thanks.
Well, it looks like the C.I.A. wrapped all this up in a neat package.
Yeah, with a bow courtesy of my father.
At least Ted's killer was brought to justice, you know, in a... in a way.
But Blaine killed Ted but left his body at Coney Island.
It was my father that moved the body.
Now he could've put it anywhere, but he took it to Ted's apartment.
Do you know why?
To bring him into our jurisdiction.
He wanted us to catch the case so he could work me for information.
Well, maybe he was just looking for a reason to see you again, and this was his way.
I keep making the mistake of thinking he's family.
But he's not.
You are.
September.
What?
We're getting married in September.
It won't be too hot.
It won't be too cold.
It's in the goldilocks zone.
It's perfect.
Wait, wait, Castle.
What about your book tour?
Screw it.
September.
Okay.
Hello, mother.
How are you?
Well, that was fun.
What a day.
You know, for years I wondered if your father was the one who got away.
Well, now, I finally know.
He was never worth your time.
Oh, yes, he was.
First time I met him, he gave me the greatest gift of my life... you.
And now after all these years, he's given me another one.
Closure.
So... what about you, kiddo?
How are you?
I don't know.
Think we'll ever see him again?
I wish I knew.

9-1-1.
What's your emergency?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Do you need assistance?
Are you in danger?
Castle, what if it rains?
- On our wedding day?
- Mm-hmm.
That's supposed to be good luck.
But we'll find a venue that has an indoor area, just in case.
Even if we find the perfect place,
- it's not gonna be available until at least October.
- October!
Harvest season.
Perfect.
Perfect, except if you want my dad to walk me down the aisle.
He's gonna be in Europe on the research project.
Oh.
Fine.
We'll have a winter wedding.
Didn't we say we wanted to do it outside?
- Right.
Yeah, frostbite isn't very festive.
- Hmm.
How about we get hitched, uh, spring of next year?
And what if I wanna get married sooner?
Hmm?
Who could blame you?
Mm.
You two are so adorable.
Oh, you know what?
Maybe we could find a venue for this summer.
You want to have a wedding in the middle of a New York summer?
No.
You're right.
Oh!
I know!
September!
It's not too hot.
It's not too cold.
It's right in the goldilocks zone.
- It's perfect.
- It is, except I'll be out of town every weekend on my book signing tour.
So unless we get married on a Monday,
September's gonna be tough.
A little unsolicited advice.
Do you give another kind?
In life, there is no such thing as a perfect time for anything.
I'm sorry, that's advice how?
Don't wait!
Hell, just go down to city hall right now.
You love each other.
Stop talking about it.
Just do it.
- We'll find a date.
It's gonna be fine.
- Let's keep... yeah, looking.
Okay.
Beckett.
I don't know, Castle.
Maybe we're being too ambitious.
Maybe we should consider the spring of next year.
I thought you didn't wanna wait that long.
Nah, I just...
I wanna be flexible.
You already are flexible.
You see what I... did there.
What's so funny?
Well, actually, did you know Beckett can lift her...
- No, nothing.
Hello.
Nothing.
- I'll tell you later.
- No.
- No.
Well, our victim is a Ted Rollins.
He was shot twice in the chest.
He was 20 years old, lived alone, and worked part-time at a secondhand record store.
So how's a 20-year-old who sells used records for a living own a place like this?
This is one of the many things that don't add up here.
Like why he's soaking wet?
The killer left Ted Rollins' body in the shower.
When the officers arrived, the water was still going.
And who called them in?
That's a good question.
At 11:50, uniforms responded to a 9-1-1 call made from the victim's cell phone.
But the time of death is between 8:00 and 11:00.
So there's no way Ted could've placed that call.
So the killer shot him and then called 9-1-1.
Except our victim was not shot in this apartment.
How do we know that?
Because he has exit wounds in his back, but there are no bullets in the bathroom or anywhere else in the apartment.
Plus lividity indicates the body was moved.
Okay, so then the killer put him in the shower to wash off the trace evidence from the original crime scene.
And it almost worked except for this.
The grease here with the tiny red specks?
Water didn't get that out.
It's on his knees and his elbows.
I'm thinking he fell when he got shot and landed in that stuff.
Okay, let's get this material to C.S.U.
- See if they can tell us where he was killed.
- I don't get it.
Why would the killer risk moving the body back here from the crime scene?
Sounds like a case of
"Weekend at Bernie's" gone wrong.
No.
No, wait.
That would have to mean there's such a thing as a "Weekend at Bernie's" gone right.
Wait a minute.
These two shoelaces are tied differently.
That is odd.
This is even more odd.
What are you doing?
Looks like Ted's got a secret compartment.
And what's a secret compartment... without a secret?
A laptop.
The key to our mystery and the identity of our killer may lie within that device.
Well, if it does, I can't get to it.
Honestly, I've never seen anything like this before.
So what are we looking at here?
A very high-level encryption program.
What, and you can't crack it?
Come on, genius bar.
I thought you were the best.
I am.
It's just whoever designed this is... better.
- But give me some time.
Let me see what I can do.
- All right.
Anyone else wondering what a record store clerk is doing with this kind of technology?
Espo, did you contact next of kin?
Yeah, Ted's father and little brother.
They're on their way down.
I just talked to Ted yesterday.
How could he be gone?
Mr. Rollins, when you spoke with your son, did he seem worried or scared about anything?
He said everything was fine.
Maybe you could help us with something else.
We found a laptop in one of the floorboards of Ted's place with a highly sophisticated encryption system.
Either one of you know what it was doing there?
What is it?
Ted was a... computer whiz.
More like a genius.
But it got him into trouble.
When Ted was in high school, he got into identity theft... hijacking credit cards, bank accounts, stuff like that.
Yeah, he'd call it "pulling a Robin Hood."
'Cause he would steal from the rich and give to the poor.
The poor being Ted?
He was just a kid.
So how much did he end up stealing?
- $1.4 million.
- Whoa.
But the judge made him give it back.
Part of Ted's plea deal was that he was barred from using any devices connecting him to the Internet.
So he shouldn't have had that laptop.
Is there anything to indicate that he went back to committing identity theft?
I was laid off, and...
Ted helped me with Grant's tuition.
I knew he was up to something.
I just didn't wanna believe he was hacking again.
Okay, so, let's just say he went back to stealing identities.
Does that explain why he was killed?
Yeah, people get pissed about getting their identities stolen, but normally, they report it to the police.
Well, maybe he stole from the kind of people that don't report to the police.
Hey!
Look who's back from paternity leave.
So how's Sarah Grace?
Oh!
Man.
I tell you, she is just... my perfect little angel.
- Oh, she's so cute.
Wow.
- Yeah.
Is it me or... or does she...
look a lot like Esposito?
Yeah, she does.
- Wow.
- Really, Beckett?
I expected that from Jackass but not from you.
Anyway, so I got that C.S.U. report back.
Looks like Ted might've been killed in an auto body shop.
Did he even own a car?
No, but they identified that sludge on Ted's clothes.
It's hydraulic fluid mixed with red paint flecks.
Now the paint is urethane-based with high levels of a volatile organic compound, so it's most likely from a car painted prior to the 1990s.
Okay, canvass the auto shops near Ted's place.
Maybe he was seen at one of them.
- Yeah.
- Hey!
Beckett, we got something.
Now, Ted's laptop is like Fort Knox on steroids.
But Tory found some unscrambled artifacts in the registry to a service set identifier.
I don't know what that means either, but she got really excited about it.
And here's why.
Yesterday at 7:19 P.M. Ted connected to a dedicated server of a private computer network.
I traced the network.
It belongs to...
Universal Banking Solutions.
They're based in Chicago but have satellite offices all over the world, including Manhattan, which is where Ted connected.
Now according to the web site, "Universal Banking Solutions"
"handles strategic and tactical procurements"
"for international clients."
And what does that mean?
I...
I don't...
I was just reading the screen there.
Okay, so what did Ted do when he connected to the server?
It's impossible to tell.
He could've sent an e-mail or accessed the web site.
Or he hacked it.
That, too.
Whatever he did, it was the last time this laptop was used before he died.
Okay, so, who runs the Manhattan office?
Anderson Cross.
All right, let's see if Mr. Cross knows what Ted was up to.
I don't know, Castle.
Maybe your mom's right.
I think elopement's a great idea.
There's no planning, no lists.
All we do is we just get married.
Beckett, I promise you, there is a perfect date for our perfect wedding, and we will find it.
- Trust me.
- I do.
- Oh, wedding humor.
Nice.
- Mm-hmm.
We need to speak with Anderson Cross.
Let me see if he's available.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
Castle.
Richard, something is about to happen.
But you cannot react.
I'm sorry.
Who is this?
Lives are at stake.
Don't react.
Sorry, Mr. Cross isn't picking up.
Oh.
Here he is.
Mr. Cross, these people are here to see you.
Hello there.
I'm Anderson Cross.
Hi.
I'm detective Kate Beckett.
N.Y.P.D.
Detective Beckett, so nice to meet you.
And, uh, this is Richard Castle.
Sorry.
I didn't get the name.
Richard.
Richard Castle.
So why don't we go on into the conference room where we can talk?
Yes.
Dad?
Not a word.
Castle 6x12
- Deep Cover Original air date January 13, 2014
So, I don't mean to rush us, but I do have an appointment in a few minutes.
Actually, this won't take very long, Mr. Cross.
Um, do you know a man named Ted Rollins?
No, I...
I don't believe I do.
Why?
He was murdered last night.
Oh.
Okay.
I'm not sure what that has to do with me.
Well, we believe that he tried to access your network yesterday evening around 7:19.
Do you have any idea why he would do that?
Well, as a matter of fact, I just got a report from my I.T. people saying that someone tried to hack into our system around about that time.
And what exactly does your company do?
Well, we basically handle, uh, multi-million dollar currency transactions for banks, international businesses, uh, foreign countries and the like.
Maybe Ted was trying to, uh...
tap in and steal from one of those transactions.
Well, if he did... he was quite unsuccessful.
Has anyone tried to hack into your company's network before?
Oh, yes.
But we have quite a robust firewall system.
It's never been breached.
Um, well, would you mind giving me copies of your incursion reports along with the ones from last night?
Of course.
I'll send them right over to you.
Okay, thank you.
Thanks for your time.
I'm sorry, Mr. Cross, uh, have we ever met before?
I don't believe we have.
Really?
Because you just seem so familiar.
Really?
- Uh-huh.
- I have one of those faces.
Huh?
Um, Lanie's got something for us.
We should go.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Not at all.
My pleasure.
Okay, so I may know why one of Ted's shoes was tied differently.
The killer was looking for something.
In his shoes?
Yep.
At the time of his death,
Ted had a coin in his right sock.
Due to rigor mortis, an impression remained, including these faint markings.
You see that?
Yeah.
Wow.
Hey, Castle.
You with us?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Uh...
let me get this straight.
So, after Ted was shot, the killer took off the shoe and the sock, grabbed the coin and then put the shoe and sock back on?
Must've been a valuable coin.
Actually, it wasn't.
I did some enhancement.
And based on the coin's diameter and the markings, we've identified it as an Iranian rial, worth less than a penny.
Wow, an Iranian rial, huh?
Castle?
No... theories on international intrigue or covert espionage?
We really don't have the information to speculate at this point.
Okay.
Were you able to narrow down where Ted was killed?
No, but I did check his stomach contents.
And I can tell you this...
approximately 15 minutes before his death, Ted ate clams and funnel cake.
Can you believe that?
Ugh.
Lanie, you slice open dead people for a living and you're grossed out by that?
Even I have my limits.
Okay, fine, uh, clams and funnel cake.
That sounds like he had amusement park food.
Right, and the hydraulic fluid and red paint on Ted's clothes?
He was at an amusement park, and I can tell you which one.
How?
Well, as a connoisseur of carny food, there's only one amusement park that has both fried clams and funnel cake, and that park is...
- Coney Island.
- Coney Island.
Okay, you two creep me out
When you do that shared brain thing.
Uh, I...
Hey, I...
I forgot I had to...
drop by my publisher's.
We gotta look at the... galleys.
There's another... uh, for the Derrick Storm... novels.
There's the galley, and, uh...
Great.
Thanks.
Hey, Beckett!
The head of Coney Island's maintenance staff said that the only place there would be hydraulic fluid and paint is the repair facility under the roller coaster.
Okay, let's have park security check it out for us.
They have.
And they found blood.
Well, this is definitely where Ted was killed.
Why here?
What was he up to?
Yo, funnel cake vendor remembered seeing Ted.
Said he got his food and walked in this direction.
Was he with anyone?
- Not that he saw.
- Killer must've followed him.
Or maybe they came here to meet.
Yeah, why wouldn't the killer leave the body here?
Why would he drag it all the way back to Manhattan to the victim's own apartment?
To throw us off his trail.
Or maybe the killer didn't want us to find the crime scene because there's something here that ties him to the murder.
Do they have security cameras here?
Just that one covering the south entrance.
Okay, let's talk to park security.
Get them to give us the surveillance footage.
Oh.
There you go.
- God bless you, man.
- Yeah.
Sit behind me.
Never thought I'd see you again.
Ted Rollins.
Your victim.
What have you learned?
What have I le...
I'm sorry, until a year ago, I had no idea who you were, and now you come out of the blue and the only thing you have to say is,
"what have you learned?"
How about a, "hello, son.
How you been?"
You're getting emotional.
Now is not the time.
Really?
'Cause it's been about 40 years.
So when would be a good time?
With what I do?
Never.
Or did you forget what happened in Paris?
No.
How could I forget?
Then stop acting like you did.
You know what I do.
You know who I am.
I let my guard down, people die.
People like Ted?
So who was he really?
Who killed him?
You need to tell me what you know.
You don't trust me.
Trust kills faster than bullets.
Look, there's a storm coming.
And if I don't stop it, a lot more people are gonna die.
Just tell me what you know.
Um... he was shot at Coney Island under the roller coaster.
There was a coin in his sock.
An Iranian rial.
Do you have the coin?
No, the killer took it.
Why would he do that?
What does that mean?
It means I gotta go.
If there's any update, text me.
Say you need to meet, and I'll be back here within 30 minutes.
Don't tell anyone about this, about me.
Not even your fiancée.
How'd you know we were engaged?
Well, I may not be good at it, but I am still your father.
Now keep your mouth shut.
And let's try not to get us both killed.
What's wrong?
You don't like the artwork for your graphic novel?
Oh, no, no, it's great.
It's good, it's, um...
So we were right about Coney Island, huh?
Yes.
One mystery solved.
Only it's led us to a few new ones.
Like what was Ted doing there in the first place?
- Yeah.
It's weird.
- It's more than weird.
Something bigger's going on here, don't you think?
Hey, guys.
Come check this out.
This is surveillance from that security camera at the entrance of the roller coaster repair yard.
Ted enters alone at 8:47 P.M.
Did anyone enter prior to that?
No.
But about 15 minutes later at 9:04 P.M., someone does.
Wait.
Zoom in and freeze it.
That's Anderson Cross.
Oh, my God.
He's our killer.
This whole time it was Anderson Cross.
So Ted must've hacked into his system, and he decided to take matters into his own hands.
But that doesn't seem likely.
I mean, he really doesn't seem the type.
Castle, what are you talking about?
He lied to us.
He told us he didn't know Ted, and there he is at the crime scene.
We don't actually see him commit murder.
There's a number of entrances to that area, but there's only one camera.
It just... may not be what it seems.
So, what?
He just happened to be there two hours after Ted hacked his company?
I'm... just saying that Anderson Cross is the killer?
It's just the obvious choice.
Well, that's usually what happens when all the evidence points to a suspect.
We have to get him down here.
Pull up everything you can on his company.
- This makes no sense.
- What?
It's gone.
The site disappeared.
Actually, not just the site.
Every trace of the company.
Find Anderson Cross now.
Who the hell is this guy?
He's obviously not a banker.
I know why he looks familiar.
- Where you going?
- To check something.
Pick up, pick up.
Leave a message.
- Hey, Castle.
- Jeez!
Damn, bro.
Why you so jumpy?
I'm... dude, I'm not.
I'm just...
Well, you will be once you hear what we've found.
Come on.
So, this guy, Anderson Cross, is like a villain in one of your books.
His office was cleared out like he knew we were coming.
- There wasn't a trace of him?
- Nothin'.
Even his receptionist.
She was hired from a temp agency.
Just started working yesterday.
She doesn't know jack.
Neither did the building manager.
He said that Cross rented the place from him last month, paid for a year's lease with a cashier's check.
So it's totally untraceable.
Yeah, whoever this guy is, he's in a different league.
And we've crossed paths before.
What do you mean?
Check this out.
Remember this guy?
Alexis's kidnapping last year.
Damn, that's right.
Uh... witnesses kept seeing him pop up at locations associated with her abduction.
And at each one of those locations, there was a dead body.
So I sent the video surveillance to a friend of mine in the A.G.'s office, and he got a hit.
Now he couldn't get into details, but he did say that this guy is a former C.I.A. operative.
Wait a minute.
Former?
Yeah, he, uh, he was disowned for an unauthorized assassination.
He was sentenced to life, broke out, killed three guards in the process.
This guy's wanted by our government.
Now my friend said that the rumor is, he's working as a hit man.
And if we get eyes on him, the A.G.'s office wants us to call them so they can send in a strike team.
Why would a guy like this wanna kill Ted Rollins?
More than that, how are we gonna find a former spy?
He's spent a lifetime covering his tracks.
Yeah, but Ted hasn't.
And somehow they're connected.
So, we should see if Hansel left any breadcrumbs towards our suspect.
We need to retrace every one of Ted's footsteps.
Our killer knew him well enough to know where he lived.
- I mean, they had to have had previous contact.
- Okay.
Castle, did you ever see this man in Paris?
Not that I can remember.
Why don't you, um, text me those sketches?
I'll have, uh, Alexis come over.
See if she recognizes him.
Do you want me to come along?
Uh, no.
No, no.
That's...
I'll call you.
You okay?
Yeah.
So I'm coming up with a whole bunch of nothing.
You?
Check it out.
It's a printout of Ted's metrocard.
Look how he got to Coney Island yesterday.
He swiped his card at the 33rd and Park Avenue South station.
Probably took the 6 to the N train.
So?
So look at his swipes for the past two weeks.
He kept going back and forth to that subway stop at 33rd and Park.
Exactly.
And he didn't work, live, or know anyone in that area.
- All right.
Let's get up there and see what he was doing.
- All right.
Oh!
Richard, you're home early.
Care for a glass of liquefied heaven?
Good for your hair, good for your te...
Richard, what is it?
Of course, I believed him, because he's my father.
Well, especially after Paris.
I mean, why wouldn't you?
But he used me... to stay ahead of the investigation, to know when to make a run for it.
If he's innocent, why didn't he show up at the park?
Richard, look... the only thing we really know about him is that we don't know him.
Me?
I had one night with him.
You?
A day in Paris.
Lean on the people you trust.
Call Katherine.
Tell her what's going on.
I'll get that.
And what if he's telling the truth?
What if he isn't?
Hello, Martha.
It's been a while, huh?
What the hell are you doing here?
Sorry to miss our meeting, but, uh, I was a little busy getting shot.
Oh, my God!
Come in.
You look good.
Yeah, well, you've looked better.
Oh!
Sorry.
Okay, I boiled everything just like you said.
But I have to warn you, my only other experience with surgery involved a board game and a guy whose nose lit up when I made a mistake.
Did you bring the booze?
Yeah.
No, right here.
You want something to dull the pain?
No, I want you to steady your nerves.
Take a swig.
Good idea.
Okay.
Okay, now, make an incision through the wound about an inch long.
Here you go.
Okay.
About an inch.
- Okay.
- Oh.
All right, now here comes the fun part.
Carefully, and I do mean carefully, pull the slug out.
But do me a favor.
Try not to make my nose light up, huh?
Right.
Okay.
I think I have it.
I got it.
- Oh!
- I don't got it.
Sorry.
Careful, Richard.
Now that you know how not to do it, let's try the other way.
Yeah, right.
- Okay, let me just get you here.
- Thank you.
Okay.
I think I have it.
All right...
I think I...
- I have it.
- Bravo!
Real good.
- There we go.
- Oh, we go.
Martha, hand me the needle and thread.
Uh... okay, here it is.
And there we go.
All right, you've stitched yourself up before, I take it?
At least this time I got a needle.
Ah.
So, you wanna tell us how you got shot?
Not particularly.
What about the three guards you murdered while escaping from prison...
you wanna tell us about them?
Don't believe everything you read.
So you didn't kill 'em?
I work outside the system, which means I need an effective cover.
Hired assassin, wanted by Uncle Sam... opens a lot of doors.
Castle?
Crap.
Hey, so I thought I'd see if Alexis remembers anything more about the man from the sketches.
Yeah, about the man in the sketches, um... something you should know about him.
What?
He's your future father-in-law.
Nice to see you again, Kate.
Katherine,
I wanna say this isn't what it looks like, but it is.
- I was gonna tell you.
I swear.
- When?
After you patched him up?
Sent him on his merry way?
He's wanted by the government.
You are harboring a fugitive.
That's just his cover.
And you know that, how?
Because he told you?
Because of Paris.
And because he's my father.
He is not your father.
He made that choice a long time ago.
This man is my suspect.
Now you know what I have to do, right?
Boy, she is a spitfire, this one.
I'm glad we're on the same side.
Who says we're on the same side?
I'm sorry.
He wouldn't stay put.
- Richard, I need your laptop.
Now.
- Right.
No.
The only thing that you are getting is a ride to my precinct in handcuffs.
You're not gonna arrest me.
Really?
Why?
Because you want answers.
And if you take me in, you're not gonna get any.
The feds will swoop in.
You won't have anything, and I'll have lost valuable time.
You want Ted's killer?
So do I.
There's a hell of a lot more at stake here than murder.
Then you're gonna have to tell me what it is.
There was a massive breach at the C.I.A.
Someone hacked the files containing the identities of our deep cover operatives.
Do you know who?
No.
But it was an inside job at the highest level.
That's why they called me.
Because I'm outside.
My orders were to find the mole and recover the files.
What does any of this have to do with Ted?
Ted was one of my best guys.
I recruited him to help me find Gemini.
Gemini?
Code name for the mole.
He was planning on selling the D.C.O. lists.
But we couldn't find him.
If these files get out, the consequences will be very real.
Then yesterday we had a breakthrough.
Ted identified the buyer and he signaled me to meet so he could tell me who it was.
But, uh...
But Gemini got there first.
He killed Ted.
Leaving me S.O.L., until you told me about the Iranian rial.
- You... you told him about the rial?
- I...
Ted left that as a fail-safe message... about the buyer.
Right, it's old school spycraft.
But Gemini knows all the old tricks, so he took that coin to throw you off his scent.
Yeah, once I found out the Iranians were involved,
I traced Ted's trail back to an apartment on East 38th street across from the Iranian mission.
Only Gemini got there ahead of me.
And he ambushed you?
From a rooftop across the way.
Soon as I opened the door, all hell broke loose.
But...
I'm good at hell.
I made my way back to the car, but he was right on my tail.
I had to drive into the East River just to get away from him.
Look, this is an incredible story, and I can see where Castle gets his talent, but it doesn't mean that any of what you said is true.
You don't believe me?
Mnh-mnh.
Turn on the news.
A high-speed car chase rocked the neighborhood of Murray Hill just hours ago.
According to multiple reports, the pursuit began with gunshots at an apartment on East 38th street where two unidentified men were involved in a gun battle.
That doesn't prove anything.
Beckett.
So, whatever our boy Ted was into, it's all some crazy-ass spy stuff.
What makes you say that?
Well, you heard about that car chase in Murray Hill?
Well, we're at the epicenter.
It's a shot-up apartment at 38th and 3rd.
It's where it all started.
According to the super,
Ted Rollins rented this place two weeks ago.
By the looks of the equipment, he was hacking.
- Hacking who?
- I don't know.
He's got a pretty sophisticated wi-fi sniffer here.
So, must've been intercepting Internet traffic from someone.
The Iranian mission across the street.
What exactly did Ted intercept?
I don't know.
Someone stole the hard drive.
Can I borrow your laptop now?
These are communications to and from the Iranian mission.
Yep.
That's incredibly illegal.
Yep.
Okay, here.
Ted flagged this one.
It's an anonymous e-mail from Izad Larjani.
He's part of Vevak...
Iran's C.I.A.
"F.C. payment received.
Central Library reading room."
- "Tomorrow 5:00 P.M.
- Kingfish."
This was sent yesterday.
Which means it's going down today.
He's sending the D.C.O. list over a secured wi-fi connection in... roughly 30 minutes.
Central Library's a perfect location...
It's public.
Uh, there's lots of people on laptops.
Gemini never has to meet with his buyer face to face.
Wi-fi signals max out at about 200 feet indoors.
He and the buyer will have to be in the building at the same time.
Given everything that's happened, why would he still go through with the exchange?
"F.C." means "final communication."
All links have been severed.
If Gemini pulls out, he has no way to tell his buyer.
He will do anything in his power to make the transfer.
I gotta go.
I gotta stop this.
Well, are you crazy?
!
We just pulled a bullet out of you.
Can't you call someone?
This mission does not exist.
I don't exist.
There's no one to call.
Don't you have back-up?
I am the back-up.
- You're in no condition...
- You don't understand!
This list cannot get out into the open.
Then we'll go.
Castle's right.
You are in no condition.
And if we stop him, then we all get what we want.
Let's run this just so we know we're all on the same page.
Richard, what do you do?
As soon as the Kingfish network goes online, I log in,
I download the list.
- You don't just log in.
You gotta be first.
- Right.
Why does he have to be first?
Because it locks out the Iranians from downloading the list.
Right.
And while Castle's downloading,
I'll track the signal using the wi-fi analyzer on my phone.
You could find a spy on your phone?
Mother, there's an app for everything now.
Now, Kate, remember, if you don't have a tactical advantage, just get eyes on him.
He's C.I.A.
If you can describe him, I can find him.
Okay.
It's almost 5:00.
We should go.
Richard, this means a lot, kid.
Thanks.
- Martha, I'm gonna need you...
- I know.
- He's not going anywhere.
- Okay.
If anything happens to them...
He's a smart kid.
And she's good at what she does.
No, they'll be fine.
I promise.
Forgive me, but your promises don't mean very much.
Gemini could be any one of these people.
Right.
Scanning for wi-fi signals.
I don't see Kingfish.
Maybe we're too late.
You still play?
No, not so much anymore.
A shame.
You were good.
Hmm.
That was hell of a night.
Hell of a night.
You remember the song you played?
"My funny Valentine."
It was a long time ago.
Oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh.
You need to lie down.
- All right, I am calling an ambulance for you.
- No, no, no.
No, it's just... my blood sugar's low.
You got any juice?
Uh, yes.
5:04.
We blew it.
Did we?
Or did we just get played?
Look, Castle, I know he's your father.
What if there's an ulterior motive to all of this?
Kingfish is online.
Go.
All right.
Okay.
"T," hashtag, less than, "l."
- Uppercase "L."
- Oh.
Capital "L."
We gotta get online before the buyer.
Come on.
I'm in.
Downloading the file at slowest speed possible.
That gives you less than three minutes.
Okay, you stay here.
You tell me how much time I have.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
- I can hear you.
- Signal's getting stronger.
You've got 2 minutes, 40 seconds left.
Oh, no.
- You've got under two minutes.
- Okay, Castle,
I'm at the stairs and the signal's gotten weak again.
Did I pass him?
Wait a minute.
Wait.
We are demonstrating two-dimensional thinking here.
Like Khan in "Star Trek II:
Wrath of Khan."
Khan didn't realize that the Enterprise was below him.
Right.
So if we are the Enterprise, that means Gemini is...
- Is above us.
- Exactly.
Oh.
Oh, this is so not the time, mother.
A minute 15 left.
Castle, I'm in the book stacks.
I'm close.
All right, less than a minute.
Be careful.
Mom!
Do you see him?
Is he there?
Beckett.
Oh, no.
What?
Castle.
He set up some kind of a relay system.
Gemini could be anywhere.
What?
!
- Hang on.
Something is wrong.
- What?
Well, the download is complete.
But this is... this is not a C.I.A. list.
This is... this is a phone book.
- Richard Castle.
Wow.
- Castle...
I'm so sorry to bother you, sir, but I'm, like, your number one fan.
Can I get an autograph?
Actually, this is really not a good time.
What are you talking about?
Castle?
Castle, are you there?
That was you at the park, wasn't it?
Dressed as a homeless guy?
You're Gemini.
Let's go.
Nice and quiet.
Man who sent you... who is he?
Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
I saw you in the park with him.
Is he C.I.A.?
The phone book.
You knew not to send the real list because you were trying to draw him into the open.
That's right.
Looks like he was smart enough to send someone expendable.
All right, mystery writer.
Tell me a story.
Who's your handler?
What's his name?
Where is he?
Why should I tell you?
You're just gonna kill me anyway.
Yeah.
But I can slow, or I can kill you fast.
It's up to you.
Aah!
Aah!
Uhh!
Aah.
You all right?
Me?
You... you're the one who was shot.
Wasn't the first time.
- I'll go call an ambulance.
- Don't bother.
No!
No, no, wait.
Wha... why would you do that?
That was the mission.
That's what I do.
H... how did you even find me?
Your left coat pocket.
Wha... what is this?
Some kind of G.P.S. locator?
How did you...
The hug.
You slipped this on me.
I needed to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, to use me as bait.
Well, after the shoot-out at the apartment,
I knew I was blown.
But I still had to recover this list.
So, to keep the upper hand, you let Beckett and me walk into a trap.
We could've been killed.
I would never let anything happen to you two.
The way you never let anything happen to Ted?
There are reasons I have to do what I do, Richard.
- One day you'll understand.
- Hmm?
Now get Beckett.
Let her know we have her killer.
Castle, what happened?
- Come on.
Gemini's down here.
- Okay.
No.
No, no, no, no.
He was here.
He was here just a minute ago.
Of course he took the body.
Yeah.
But left Gemini's weapon.
That gun was a ballistics match to the one that killed Ted.
It's registered to...
Tony Blaine.
We searched his place.
Found clothes that tested positive for Ted's blood.
- Blaine's definitely our killer.
- But who is he?
He's a researcher at a government think tank.
Yeah, but what a researcher at a government think tank is doing involved in all this, we have no idea.
Yeah, we may never know.
Well, hold on.
We've got a B.O.L.O. out on him and we're monitoring his credit cards.
- We'll find him.
- And when we do, maybe he can tell us who this Anderson Cross is.
Yeah, maybe.
All right, great job, guys.
Thanks.
Well, it looks like the C.I.A. wrapped all this up in a neat package.
Yeah, with a bow courtesy of my father.
At least Ted's killer was brought to justice, you know, in a... in a way.
But Blaine killed Ted but left his body at Coney Island.
It was my father that moved the body.
Now he could've put it anywhere, but he took it to Ted's apartment.
Do you know why?
To bring him into our jurisdiction.
He wanted us to catch the case so he could work me for information.
Well, maybe he was just looking for a reason to see you again, and this was his way.
I keep making the mistake of thinking he's family.
But he's not.
You are.
September.
What?
We're getting married in September.
It won't be too hot.
It won't be too cold.
It's in the goldilocks zone.
It's perfect.
Wait, wait, Castle.
What about your book tour?
Screw it.
September.
Okay.
Hello, mother.
How are you?
Well, that was fun.
What a day.
You know, for years I wondered if your father was the one who got away.
Well, now, I finally know.
He was never worth your time.
Oh, yes, he was.
First time I met him, he gave me the greatest gift of my life... you.
And now after all these years, he's given me another one.
Closure.
So... what about you, kiddo?
How are you?
I don't know.
Think we'll ever see him again?
I wish I knew.
(Thunder rumbling)
(Beeping)
(Line ringing)
(Man) 9-1-1.
What's your emergency?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Do you need assistance?
Are you in danger?
(Beckett) Castle, what if it rains?
- On our wedding day?
- Mm-hmm.
That's supposed to be good luck.
But we'll find a venue that has an indoor area, just in case.
Even if we find the perfect place,
- it's not gonna be available until at least October.
- October!
Harvest season.
Perfect.
Perfect, except if you want my dad to walk me down the aisle.
He's gonna be in Europe on the research project.
Oh.
Fine.
We'll have a winter wedding.
Didn't we say we wanted to do it outside?
- Right.
Yeah, frostbite isn't very festive.
- Hmm.
How about we get hitched, uh, spring of next year?
And what if I wanna get married sooner?
Hmm?
Who could blame you?
Mm.
(Kisses)
You two are so adorable.
Oh, you know what?
Maybe we could find a venue for this summer.
You want to have a wedding in the middle of a New York summer?
No.
You're right.
Oh!
I know!
September!
It's not too hot.
It's not too cold.
It's right in the goldilocks zone.
- It's perfect.
- It is, except I'll be out of town every weekend on my book signing tour.
So unless we get married on a Monday,
September's gonna be tough.
(Clears throat) A little unsolicited advice.
Do you give another kind?
(Sighs) In life, there is no such thing as a perfect time for anything.
I'm sorry, that's advice how?
(Huffs) Don't wait!
Hell, just go down to city hall right now.
You love each other.
Stop talking about it.
Just do it.
(Exhales sharply)
- We'll find a date.
It's gonna be fine.
- Let's keep... yeah, looking.
Okay.
(Cell phone rings and beeps)
Beckett.
I don't know, Castle.
Maybe we're being too ambitious.
Maybe we should consider the spring of next year.
I thought you didn't wanna wait that long.
Nah, I just...
I wanna be flexible.
You already are flexible.
(Laughing) You see what I... did there.
(Chuckles)
What's so funny?
Well, actually, did you know Beckett can lift her...
- No, nothing.
Hello.
Nothing.
- I'll tell you later.
- No.
- No.
Well, our victim is a Ted Rollins.
He was shot twice in the chest.
He was 20 years old, lived alone, and worked part-time at a secondhand record store.
So how's a 20-year-old who sells used records for a living own a place like this?
This is one of the many things that don't add up here.
Like why he's soaking wet?
The killer left Ted Rollins' body in the shower.
When the officers arrived, the water was still going.
And who called them in?
That's a good question.
At 11:50, uniforms responded to a 9-1-1 call made from the victim's cell phone.
But the time of death is between 8:00 and 11:00.
So there's no way Ted could've placed that call.
So the killer shot him and then called 9-1-1.
Except our victim was not shot in this apartment.
How do we know that?
Because he has exit wounds in his back, but there are no bullets in the bathroom or anywhere else in the apartment.
Plus lividity indicates the body was moved.
Okay, so then the killer put him in the shower to wash off the trace evidence from the original crime scene.
And it almost worked except for this.
(Camera shutter clicks)
The grease here with the tiny red specks?
Water didn't get that out.
It's on his knees and his elbows.
I'm thinking he fell when he got shot and landed in that stuff.
Okay, let's get this material to C.S.U.
- See if they can tell us where he was killed.
- I don't get it.
Why would the killer risk moving the body back here from the crime scene?
Sounds like a case of
"Weekend at Bernie's" gone wrong.
No.
No, wait.
That would have to mean there's such a thing as a "Weekend at Bernie's" gone right.
Wait a minute.
These two shoelaces are tied differently.
That is odd.
(Floorboards creaking)
This is even more odd.
(Camera shutter clicks)
What are you doing?
(Groans)
Looks like Ted's got a secret compartment.
And what's a secret compartment... without a secret?
A laptop.
The key to our mystery and the identity of our killer may lie within that device.
(Tory) Well, if it does, I can't get to it.
Honestly, I've never seen anything like this before. (Beeps)
So what are we looking at here?
A very high-level encryption program.
What, and you can't crack it?
Come on, genius bar.
I thought you were the best.
I am.
It's just whoever designed this is... better.
- But give me some time.
Let me see what I can do.
- All right.
Anyone else wondering what a record store clerk is doing with this kind of technology?
Espo, did you contact next of kin?
Yeah, Ted's father and little brother.
They're on their way down.
I just talked to Ted yesterday.
How could he be gone?
Mr. Rollins, when you spoke with your son, did he seem worried or scared about anything?
He said everything was fine.
Maybe you could help us with something else.
We found a laptop in one of the floorboards of Ted's place with a highly sophisticated encryption system.
Either one of you know what it was doing there?
What is it?
Ted was a... computer whiz.
More like a genius.
But it got him into trouble.
When Ted was in high school, he got into identity theft... hijacking credit cards, bank accounts, stuff like that.
Yeah, he'd call it "pulling a Robin Hood."
'Cause he would steal from the rich and give to the poor.
The poor being Ted?
He was just a kid.
So how much did he end up stealing?
- $1.4 million.
- Whoa.
But the judge made him give it back.
Part of Ted's plea deal was that he was barred from using any devices connecting him to the Internet.
So he shouldn't have had that laptop.
Is there anything to indicate that he went back to committing identity theft?
I was laid off, and...
Ted helped me with Grant's tuition.
I knew he was up to something.
I just didn't wanna believe he was hacking again.
Okay, so, let's just say he went back to stealing identities.
Does that explain why he was killed?
Yeah, people get pissed about getting their identities stolen, but normally, they report it to the police.
Well, maybe he stole from the kind of people that don't report to the police.
Hey!
Look who's back from paternity leave.
(Chuckles)
So how's Sarah Grace?
Oh!
Man.
I tell you, she is just... (Cell phone chimes) my perfect little angel.
- Oh, she's so cute.
Wow.
- Yeah.
Is it me or... or does she...
look a lot like Esposito?
Yeah, she does.
(Whispers)
- Wow.
- Really, Beckett?
I expected that from Jackass but not from you.
Anyway, so I got that C.S.U. report back.
Looks like Ted might've been killed in an auto body shop.
Did he even own a car?
No, but they identified that sludge on Ted's clothes.
It's hydraulic fluid mixed with red paint flecks.
Now the paint is urethane-based with high levels of a volatile organic compound, so it's most likely from a car painted prior to the 1990s.
Okay, canvass the auto shops near Ted's place.
Maybe he was seen at one of them.
- Yeah.
- Hey!
Beckett, we got something.
(Typing) Now, Ted's laptop is like Fort Knox on steroids.
But Tory found some unscrambled artifacts in the registry to a service set identifier.
I don't know what that means either, but she got really excited about it.
And here's why.
(Beep) Yesterday at 7:19 P.M. Ted connected to a dedicated server of a private computer network.
I traced the network.
It belongs to...
(Typing)
Universal Banking Solutions.
They're based in Chicago but have satellite offices all over the world, including Manhattan, which is where Ted connected.
Now according to the web site, "Universal Banking Solutions"
"handles strategic and tactical procurements"
"for international clients."
And what does that mean?
I...
I don't...
I was just reading the screen there.
Okay, so what did Ted do when he connected to the server?
It's impossible to tell.
He could've sent an e-mail or accessed the web site.
Or he hacked it.
That, too.
Whatever he did, it was the last time this laptop was used before he died.
Okay, so, who runs the Manhattan office?
(Beep) Anderson Cross.
All right, let's see if Mr. Cross knows what Ted was up to.
I don't know, Castle.
Maybe your mom's right.
I think elopement's a great idea.
There's no planning, no lists.
All we do is we just get married.
Beckett, I promise you, there is a perfect date for our perfect wedding, and we will find it.
- Trust me.
- I do.
- Oh, wedding humor.
Nice.
- Mm-hmm.
We need to speak with Anderson Cross.
Let me see if he's available.
(Cell phone ringing)
- Excuse me.
(Whispers)
- Yeah.
(Beep) Castle.
(Man) Richard, something is about to happen.
But you cannot react.
I'm sorry.
Who is this?
Lives are at stake.
Don't react.
(Beep, line disconnects)
Sorry, Mr. Cross isn't picking up.
Oh.
Here he is.
Mr. Cross, these people are here to see you.
Hello there.
I'm Anderson Cross.
Hi.
I'm detective Kate Beckett.
N.Y.P.D.
Detective Beckett, so nice to meet you.
And, uh, this is Richard Castle.
Sorry.
I didn't get the name.
Richard.
Richard Castle.
So why don't we go on into the conference room where we can talk?
Yes.
(Whispers) Dad?
Not a word.
Castle 6x12
- Deep Cover Original air date January 13, 2014
So, I don't mean to rush us, but I do have an appointment in a few minutes.
Actually, this won't take very long, Mr. Cross.
Um, do you know a man named Ted Rollins?
No, I...
I don't believe I do.
Why?
He was murdered last night.
Oh.
Okay.
I'm not sure what that has to do with me.
Well, we believe that he tried to access your network yesterday evening around 7:19.
Do you have any idea why he would do that?
Well, as a matter of fact, I just got a report from my I.T. people saying that someone tried to hack into our system around about that time.
And what exactly does your company do?
Well, we basically handle, uh, multi-million dollar currency transactions for banks, international businesses, uh, foreign countries and the like.
Maybe Ted was trying to, uh...
tap in and steal from one of those transactions.
Well, if he did... (Chuckles) he was quite unsuccessful.
Has anyone tried to hack into your company's network before?
Oh, yes.
But we have quite a robust firewall system.
It's never been breached.
Um, well, would you mind giving me copies of your incursion reports along with the ones from last night?
Of course.
I'll send them right over to you. (Cell phone chimes and vibrates)
Okay, thank you.
Thanks for your time.
(Inhales deeply) I'm sorry, Mr. Cross, uh, have we ever met before?
I don't believe we have.
Really?
Because you just seem so familiar.
Really?
- Uh-huh.
- I have one of those faces.
Huh?
Um, Lanie's got something for us.
We should go.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Not at all.
My pleasure.
(Mouths words)
Okay, so I may know why one of Ted's shoes was tied differently.
The killer was looking for something.
In his shoes?
Yep.
At the time of his death,
Ted had a coin in his right sock.
Due to rigor mortis, an impression remained, including these faint markings.
You see that?
Yeah.
Wow.
Hey, Castle.
You with us?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Uh...
let me get this straight.
So, after Ted was shot, the killer took off the shoe and the sock, grabbed the coin and then put the shoe and sock back on?
Must've been a valuable coin.
Actually, it wasn't.
I did some enhancement.
(Beeps) And based on the coin's diameter and the markings, we've identified it as an Iranian rial, worth less than a penny.
Wow, an Iranian rial, huh?
Castle?
No... theories on international intrigue or covert espionage?
We really don't have the information to speculate at this point.
Okay.
Were you able to narrow down where Ted was killed?
No, but I did check his stomach contents.
And I can tell you this...
approximately 15 minutes before his death, Ted ate clams and funnel cake.
Can you believe that?
Ugh.
Lanie, you slice open dead people for a living and you're grossed out by that?
Even I have my limits.
Okay, fine, uh, clams and funnel cake.
That sounds like he had amusement park food.
Right, and the hydraulic fluid and red paint on Ted's clothes?
He was at an amusement park, and I can tell you which one.
How?
Well, as a connoisseur of carny food, there's only one amusement park that has both fried clams and funnel cake, and that park is...
- Coney Island.
- Coney Island.
Okay, you two creep me out (Cell phone chimes and vibrates)
When you do that shared brain thing.
Uh, I...
Hey, I...
I forgot I had to...
drop by my publisher's.
We gotta look at the... galleys.
There's another... uh, for the Derrick Storm... novels.
There's the galley, and, uh...
(Speaks indistinctly)
Great.
Thanks.
Hey, Beckett!
(Receiver thuds)
The head of Coney Island's maintenance staff said that the only place there would be hydraulic fluid and paint is the repair facility under the roller coaster.
Okay, let's have park security check it out for us.
They have.
And they found blood.
(Screaming)
(Track rattling)
(Police radio chatter)
(Camera shutter clicks)
Well, this is definitely where Ted was killed.
Why here?
What was he up to?
(Mouth full) Yo, funnel cake vendor remembered seeing Ted.
Said he got his food and walked in this direction.
Was he with anyone?
- Not that he saw.
- Killer must've followed him.
Or maybe they came here to meet.
Yeah, why wouldn't the killer leave the body here?
Why would he drag it all the way back to Manhattan to the victim's own apartment?
To throw us off his trail.
Or maybe the killer didn't want us to find the crime scene because there's something here that ties him to the murder.
Do they have security cameras here?
Just that one covering the south entrance.
Okay, let's talk to park security.
Get them to give us the surveillance footage.
(Track rattling)
(Children shouting playfully)
Oh.
There you go.
(Coins clink)
- God bless you, man.
- Yeah.
(Bird chirping)
Sit behind me.
Never thought I'd see you again.
Ted Rollins.
Your victim.
What have you learned?
What have I le...
I'm sorry, until a year ago, I had no idea who you were, and now you come out of the blue and the only thing you have to say is,
"what have you learned?"
How about a, "hello, son.
How you been?"
You're getting emotional.
Now is not the time.
Really?
'Cause it's been about 40 years.
So when would be a good time?
With what I do?
Never.
Or did you forget what happened in Paris?
No.
How could I forget?
Then stop acting like you did.
You know what I do.
You know who I am.
I let my guard down, people die.
People like Ted?
So who was he really?
Who killed him?
You need to tell me what you know.
You don't trust me.
Trust kills faster than bullets.
Look, there's a storm coming.
And if I don't stop it, a lot more people are gonna die.
Just tell me what you know.
Um... he was shot at Coney Island under the roller coaster.
There was a coin in his sock.
An Iranian rial.
Do you have the coin?
No, the killer took it.
Why would he do that?
What does that mean?
It means I gotta go.
If there's any update, text me.
Say you need to meet, and I'll be back here within 30 minutes.
Don't tell anyone about this, about me.
Not even your fiancée.
(Paper rustles)
How'd you know we were engaged?
Well, I may not be good at it, but I am still your father.
Now keep your mouth shut.
And let's try not to get us both killed.
(Telephone ringing)
What's wrong?
You don't like the artwork for your graphic novel?
Oh, no, no, it's great.
It's good, it's, um...
So we were right about Coney Island, huh?
Yes.
One mystery solved.
Only it's led us to a few new ones.
Like what was Ted doing there in the first place?
- Yeah.
It's weird.
- It's more than weird.
Something bigger's going on here, don't you think?
Hey, guys.
Come check this out.
This is surveillance from that security camera at the entrance of the roller coaster repair yard.
Ted enters alone at 8:47 P.M.
Did anyone enter prior to that?
No.
But about 15 minutes later at 9:04 P.M., someone does.
(Beep)
Wait.
Zoom in and freeze it.
(Keys clack, beep)
That's Anderson Cross.
Oh, my God.
He's our killer.
This whole time it was Anderson Cross.
So Ted must've hacked into his system, and he decided to take matters into his own hands.
(Scoffs) But that doesn't seem likely.
I mean, he really doesn't seem the type.
Castle, what are you talking about?
He lied to us.
He told us he didn't know Ted, and there he is at the crime scene.
We don't actually see him commit murder.
There's a number of entrances to that area, but there's only one camera.
It just... may not be what it seems.
So, what?
He just happened to be there two hours after Ted hacked his company?
I'm... just saying that Anderson Cross is the killer?
It's just the obvious choice.
Well, that's usually what happens when all the evidence points to a suspect.
We have to get him down here.
Pull up everything you can on his company.
(Typing)
- This makes no sense.
- What?
It's gone.
The site disappeared.
Actually, not just the site.
Every trace of the company.
Find Anderson Cross now.
Who the hell is this guy?
He's obviously not a banker.
I know why he looks familiar.
- Where you going?
- To check something.
(Line ringing)
(Whispers) Pick up, pick up.
(Man) Leave a message.
(Beep)
(Buttons clicking)
- Hey, Castle.
- Jeez!
Damn, bro.
Why you so jumpy?
I'm... dude, I'm not.
I'm just...
Well, you will be once you hear what we've found.
Come on.
(Clicking)
So, this guy, Anderson Cross, is like a villain in one of your books.
His office was cleared out like he knew we were coming.
- There wasn't a trace of him?
- Nothin'.
Even his receptionist.
She was hired from a temp agency.
Just started working yesterday.
She doesn't know jack.
Neither did the building manager.
He said that Cross rented the place from him last month, paid for a year's lease with a cashier's check.
So it's totally untraceable.
Yeah, whoever this guy is, he's in a different league.
And we've crossed paths before.
What do you mean?
Check this out.
Remember this guy?
Alexis's kidnapping last year.
Damn, that's right.
Uh... witnesses kept seeing him pop up at locations associated with her abduction.
And at each one of those locations, there was a dead body.
So I sent the video surveillance to a friend of mine in the A.G.'s office, and he got a hit.
Now he couldn't get into details, but he did say that this guy is a former C.I.A. operative.
Wait a minute.
Former?
Yeah, he, uh, he was disowned for an unauthorized assassination.
He was sentenced to life, broke out, killed three guards in the process.
This guy's wanted by our government.
Now my friend said that the rumor is, he's working as a hit man.
And if we get eyes on him, the A.G.'s office wants us to call them so they can send in a strike team.
Why would a guy like this wanna kill Ted Rollins?
More than that, how are we gonna find a former spy?
He's spent a lifetime covering his tracks.
Yeah, but Ted hasn't.
And somehow they're connected.
So, we should see if Hansel left any breadcrumbs towards our suspect.
(Cell phone beeps)
We need to retrace every one of Ted's footsteps. (Clicking)
Our killer knew him well enough to know where he lived.
- I mean, they had to have had previous contact.
- Okay.
Castle, did you ever see this man in Paris?
Not that I can remember.
Why don't you, um, text me those sketches?
I'll have, uh, Alexis come over.
See if she recognizes him.
Do you want me to come along?
Uh, no.
No, no.
That's...
I'll call you.
You okay?
Yeah.
So I'm coming up with a whole bunch of nothing.
You?
Check it out.
It's a printout of Ted's metrocard.
Look how he got to Coney Island yesterday.
He swiped his card at the 33rd and Park Avenue South station.
Probably took the 6 to the N train.
So?
So look at his swipes for the past two weeks.
(Paper rustles)
He kept going back and forth to that subway stop at 33rd and Park.
Exactly.
And he didn't work, live, or know anyone in that area.
- All right.
Let's get up there and see what he was doing.
- All right.
(Whirring) (Martha humming)
(Door closes)
(Continues humming)
(Whirring stops, switch clicks)
Oh!
Richard, you're home early.
Care for a glass of liquefied heaven?
Good for your hair, good for your te...
Richard, what is it?
Of course, I believed him, because he's my father.
Well, especially after Paris.
I mean, why wouldn't you?
But he used me... to stay ahead of the investigation, to know when to make a run for it.
If he's innocent, why didn't he show up at the park?
Richard, look... the only thing we really know about him is that we don't know him.
Me?
I had one night with him.
You?
A day in Paris.
Lean on the people you trust.
Call Katherine.
Tell her what's going on.
(Knock on door)
I'll get that.
And what if he's telling the truth?
What if he isn't?
(Gasps)
Hello, Martha.
It's been a while, huh?
What the hell are you doing here?
Sorry to miss our meeting, but, uh, I was a little busy getting shot.
Oh, my God!
Come in.
(Martha groans)
You look good.
Yeah, well, you've looked better.
Oh!
Sorry.
Okay, I boiled everything just like you said.
(Clatter)
But I have to warn you, my only other experience with surgery involved a board game and a guy whose nose lit up when I made a mistake.
Did you bring the booze?
Yeah.
No, right here.
You want something to dull the pain?
No, I want you to steady your nerves.
Take a swig.
(Whispers) Good idea.
(Liquor sloshes) (Whispers) Okay.
(Groans)
Okay, now, make an incision through the wound about an inch long.
Here you go.
Okay.
About an inch.
(Inhales sharply)
- Okay.
- Oh.
All right, now here comes the fun part.
Carefully, and I do mean carefully, pull the slug out.
But do me a favor.
Try not to make my nose light up, huh?
(Chuckles lightly) Right.
(Whispers) Okay.
(Squishing)
(Groans)
I think I have it.
I got it.
- Oh!
- I don't got it.
Sorry.
Careful, Richard.
Now that you know how not to do it, let's try the other way.
(Whispering) Yeah, right.
(Whispers)
- Okay, let me just get you here.
- Thank you.
(Groans) Okay.
(Groans)
(Squishing)
(Grunts) I think I have it.
(Groans) All right...
I think I...
(Gasps)
- I have it.
- Bravo!
Real good.
(Chuckles)
- There we go.
- Oh, we go.
Martha, hand me the needle and thread.
Uh... okay, here it is.
And there we go.
All right, you've stitched yourself up before, I take it?
At least this time I got a needle.
Ah.
So, you wanna tell us how you got shot?
Not particularly.
What about the three guards you murdered while escaping from prison...
you wanna tell us about them?
Don't believe everything you read.
So you didn't kill 'em?
I work outside the system, which means I need an effective cover.
Hired assassin, wanted by Uncle Sam... opens a lot of doors.
(Door opens in distance)
(Beckett) Castle?
(Door closes)
(Whispers) Crap.
Hey, so I thought I'd see if Alexis remembers anything more about the man from the sketches.
Yeah, about the man in the sketches, um... something you should know about him.
What?
He's your future father-in-law.
Nice to see you again, Kate.
(Sighs) Katherine,
I wanna say this isn't what it looks like, but it is.
- I was gonna tell you.
I swear.
- When?
After you patched him up?
Sent him on his merry way?
He's wanted by the government.
You are harboring a fugitive.
That's just his cover.
And you know that, how?
Because he told you?
Because of Paris.
And because he's my father.
He is not your father.
He made that choice a long time ago.
This man is my suspect.
Now you know what I have to do, right?
Boy, she is a spitfire, this one.
I'm glad we're on the same side.
Who says we're on the same side?
I'm sorry.
He wouldn't stay put.
- Richard, I need your laptop.
Now.
- Right.
No.
The only thing that you are getting is a ride to my precinct in handcuffs.
You're not gonna arrest me.
Really?
Why?
Because you want answers.
And if you take me in, you're not gonna get any.
The feds will swoop in.
You won't have anything, and I'll have lost valuable time.
You want Ted's killer?
So do I.
There's a hell of a lot more at stake here than murder.
Then you're gonna have to tell me what it is.
There was a massive breach at the C.I.A.
Someone hacked the files containing the identities of our deep cover operatives.
Do you know who?
No.
But it was an inside job at the highest level.
That's why they called me.
Because I'm outside.
My orders were to find the mole and recover the files.
What does any of this have to do with Ted?
Ted was one of my best guys.
I recruited him to help me find Gemini.
Gemini?
Code name for the mole.
He was planning on selling the D.C.O. lists.
But we couldn't find him.
If these files get out, the consequences will be very real.
Then yesterday we had a breakthrough.
Ted identified the buyer and he signaled me to meet so he could tell me who it was.
But, uh...
But Gemini got there first.
He killed Ted.
Leaving me S.O.L., until you told me about the Iranian rial.
- You... you told him about the rial?
- I...
Ted left that as a fail-safe message... about the buyer.
Right, it's old school spycraft.
But Gemini knows all the old tricks, so he took that coin to throw you off his scent.
Yeah, once I found out the Iranians were involved,
I traced Ted's trail back to an apartment on East 38th street across from the Iranian mission.
Only Gemini got there ahead of me.
And he ambushed you?
From a rooftop across the way.
Soon as I opened the door, all hell broke loose.
But...
(Chuckles) I'm good at hell.
I made my way back to the car, but he was right on my tail.
I had to drive into the East River just to get away from him.
Look, this is an incredible story, and I can see where Castle gets his talent, but it doesn't mean that any of what you said is true.
You don't believe me?
Mnh-mnh.
Turn on the news.
A high-speed car chase rocked the neighborhood of Murray Hill just hours ago.
According to multiple reports, the pursuit began with gunshots at an apartment on East 38th street where two unidentified men were involved in a gun battle.
That doesn't prove anything.
(Cell phone rings)
(Cell phone beeps) Beckett.
(Camera shutter clicking) So, whatever our boy Ted was into, it's all some crazy-ass spy stuff.
What makes you say that?
Well, you heard about that car chase in Murray Hill?
Well, we're at the epicenter.
It's a shot-up apartment at 38th and 3rd.
It's where it all started.
According to the super,
Ted Rollins rented this place two weeks ago.
By the looks of the equipment, he was hacking.
- Hacking who?
- I don't know.
He's got a pretty sophisticated wi-fi sniffer here.
So, must've been intercepting Internet traffic from someone.
(Under breath) The Iranian mission across the street.
What exactly did Ted intercept?
I don't know.
Someone stole the hard drive.
Can I borrow your laptop now?
(Typing)
These are communications to and from the Iranian mission.
Yep.
That's incredibly illegal.
Yep.
Okay, here.
Ted flagged this one.
It's an anonymous e-mail from Izad Larjani.
He's part of Vevak...
Iran's C.I.A.
"F.C. payment received.
Central Library reading room."
"Tomorrow 5:00 P.M. Network name:
Kingfish."
This was sent yesterday.
Which means it's going down today.
He's sending the D.C.O. list over a secured wi-fi connection in... roughly 30 minutes.
(Typing) Central Library's a perfect location...
It's public.
Uh, there's lots of people on laptops.
Gemini never has to meet with his buyer face to face.
Wi-fi signals max out at about 200 feet indoors.
He and the buyer will have to be in the building at the same time.
Given everything that's happened, why would he still go through with the exchange?
"F.C." means "final communication."
All links have been severed.
If Gemini pulls out, he has no way to tell his buyer.
He will do anything in his power to make the transfer.
I gotta go.
I gotta stop this.
Well, are you crazy?
!
We just pulled a bullet out of you.
Can't you call someone?
This mission does not exist.
I don't exist.
There's no one to call.
Don't you have back-up?
I am the back-up.
- You're in no condition...
- You don't understand!
This list cannot get out into the open.
Then we'll go.
Castle's right.
You are in no condition.
And if we stop him, then we all get what we want.
Let's run this just so we know we're all on the same page.
Richard, what do you do?
As soon as the Kingfish network goes online, I log in,
I download the list.
- You don't just log in.
You gotta be first.
- Right.
Why does he have to be first?
Because it locks out the Iranians from downloading the list.
Right.
And while Castle's downloading,
I'll track the signal using the wi-fi analyzer on my phone.
You could find a spy on your phone?
Mother, there's an app for everything now.
Now, Kate, remember, if you don't have a tactical advantage, just get eyes on him.
He's C.I.A.
If you can describe him, I can find him.
Okay.
It's almost 5:00.
We should go.
Richard, this means a lot, kid.
Thanks.
- Martha, I'm gonna need you...
- I know.
- He's not going anywhere.
(Whispers)
- Okay.
If anything happens to them...
He's a smart kid.
And she's good at what she does.
No, they'll be fine.
I promise.
Forgive me, but your promises don't mean very much.
Gemini could be any one of these people.
Right.
Scanning for wi-fi signals.
(Beep)
I don't see Kingfish.
Maybe we're too late.
(Playing single notes)
You still play?
No, not so much anymore.
A shame.
You were good.
Hmm.
That was hell of a night.
Hell of a night.
You remember the song you played?
"My funny Valentine."
(Whispers) It was a long time ago.
(Groans)
Oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh.
You need to lie down.
- All right, I am calling an ambulance for you.
- No, no, no.
No, it's just... my blood sugar's low.
You got any juice?
Uh, yes.
5:04.
We blew it.
Did we?
Or did we just get played?
Look, Castle, I know he's your father.
What if there's an ulterior motive to all of this?
(Computer chines)
Kingfish is online.
Go.
(Typing) All right.
Okay.
"T," hashtag, less than, "l."
- Uppercase "L."
- Oh.
Capital "L."
We gotta get online before the buyer.
Come on.
(Beeps)
I'm in.
Downloading the file at slowest speed possible.
That gives you less than three minutes.
Okay, you stay here.
You tell me how much time I have.
(Cell phone beeps, auto-dials)
(Line ringing)
(Beep) Can you hear me?
Yeah.
- I can hear you.
- Signal's getting stronger.
You've got 2 minutes, 40 seconds left.
Oh, no.
- You've got under two minutes.
- Okay, Castle,
I'm at the stairs and the signal's gotten weak again.
Did I pass him?
Wait a minute.
Wait.
We are demonstrating two-dimensional thinking here.
Like Khan in "Star Trek II:
Wrath of Khan."
Khan didn't realize that the Enterprise was below him.
Right.
So if we are the Enterprise, that means Gemini is...
- Is above us.
- Exactly.
(Cell phone chimes) Oh.
Oh, this is so not the time, mother.
(Beep)
(Breathing heavily)
A minute 15 left.
Castle, I'm in the book stacks.
I'm close.
All right, less than a minute.
Be careful.
(Cell phone chimes)
(Whispers loudly) Mom!
(Beep)
Do you see him?
Is he there?
Beckett.
Oh, no.
What?
(Sighs) Castle.
He set up some kind of a relay system.
Gemini could be anywhere.
What?
!
(Computer chimes)
- Hang on.
Something is wrong.
- What?
Well, the download is complete.
But this is... this is not a C.I.A. list.
This is... this is a phone book.
- Richard Castle.
Wow. (Chuckles)
- Castle...
I'm so sorry to bother you, sir, but I'm, like, your number one fan.
Can I get an autograph?
Actually, this is really not a good time.
(Cocks gun)
What are you talking about?
Castle?
(Beep)
Castle, are you there?
That was you at the park, wasn't it?
Dressed as a homeless guy?
You're Gemini.
Let's go.
Nice and quiet.
(Thuds)
Man who sent you... who is he?
Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
I saw you in the park with him.
Is he C.I.A.?
The phone book.
You knew not to send the real list because you were trying to draw him into the open.
That's right.
Looks like he was smart enough to send someone expendable.
All right, mystery writer.
Tell me a story.
Who's your handler?
What's his name?
Where is he?
Why should I tell you?
You're just gonna kill me anyway.
Yeah.
But I can slow, or I can kill you fast.
It's up to you.
(Clatter)
(Groaning) Aah!
Aah!
Uhh!
Aah.
(Groans)
You all right?
Me?
You... you're the one who was shot.
Wasn't the first time.
- I'll go call an ambulance.
- Don't bother.
No!
No, no, wait.
(Silenced gunshot)
Wha... why would you do that?
That was the mission.
That's what I do.
H... how did you even find me?
Your left coat pocket.
Wha... what is this?
Some kind of G.P.S. locator?
How did you...
The hug.
You slipped this on me.
I needed to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, to use me as bait.
(Clatters)
Well, after the shoot-out at the apartment,
I knew I was blown.
But I still had to recover this list.
So, to keep the upper hand, you let Beckett and me walk into a trap.
We could've been killed.
I would never let anything happen to you two.
The way you never let anything happen to Ted?
There are reasons I have to do what I do, Richard.
- One day you'll understand.
- Hmm?
Now get Beckett.
Let her know we have her killer.
(Grunts) Castle, what happened?
- Come on.
Gemini's down here.
(Whispers)
- Okay.
No.
No, no, no, no.
He was here.
He was here just a minute ago.
Of course he took the body.
(Whispers) Yeah.
(Breathing heavily)
But left Gemini's weapon.
That gun was a ballistics match to the one that killed Ted.
It's registered to...
Tony Blaine.
We searched his place.
Found clothes that tested positive for Ted's blood.
- Blaine's definitely our killer.
- But who is he?
He's a researcher at a government think tank.
Yeah, but what a researcher at a government think tank is doing involved in all this, we have no idea.
Yeah, we may never know.
Well, hold on.
We've got a B.O.L.O. out on him and we're monitoring his credit cards.
- We'll find him.
- And when we do, maybe he can tell us who this Anderson Cross is.
Yeah, maybe.
All right, great job, guys.
Thanks.
Well, it looks like the C.I.A. wrapped all this up in a neat package.
Yeah, with a bow courtesy of my father.
At least Ted's killer was brought to justice, you know, in a... in a way.
But Blaine killed Ted but left his body at Coney Island.
It was my father that moved the body.
Now he could've put it anywhere, but he took it to Ted's apartment.
Do you know why?
To bring him into our jurisdiction.
He wanted us to catch the case so he could work me for information.
Well, maybe he was just looking for a reason to see you again, and this was his way.
I keep making the mistake of thinking he's family.
But he's not.
You are.
September.
What?
We're getting married in September.
It won't be too hot.
It won't be too cold.
It's in the goldilocks zone.
It's perfect.
Wait, wait, Castle.
What about your book tour?
Screw it.
(Kisses)
September.
(Whispers) Okay.
Hello, mother.
How are you?
Well, that was fun.
What a day.
(Sighs) You know, for years I wondered if your father was the one who got away.
Well, now, I finally know.
He was never worth your time.
Oh, yes, he was.
First time I met him, he gave me the greatest gift of my life... you.
And now after all these years, he's given me another one.
Closure.
So... what about you, kiddo?
How are you?
(Inhales deeply) I don't know.
(Exhales deeply) Think we'll ever see him again?
I wish I knew.
(Thunder rumbling)
(Beeping)
(Line ringing)
(Man) 9-1-1.
What's your emergency?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Do you need assistance?
Are you in danger?
(Beckett) Castle, what if it rains?
- On our wedding day?
- Mm-hmm.
That's supposed to be good luck.
But we'll find a venue that has an indoor area, just in case.
Even if we find the perfect place,
- it's not gonna be available until at least October.
- October!
Harvest season.
Perfect.
Perfect, except if you want my dad to walk me down the aisle.
He's gonna be in Europe on the research project.
Oh.
Fine.
We'll have a winter wedding.
Didn't we say we wanted to do it outside?
- Right.
Yeah, frostbite isn't very festive.
- Hmm.
How about we get hitched, uh, spring of next year?
And what if I wanna get married sooner?
Hmm?
Who could blame you?
Mm.
(Kisses)
You two are so adorable.
Oh, you know what?
Maybe we could find a venue for this summer.
You want to have a wedding in the middle of a New York summer?
No.
You're right.
Oh!
I know!
September!
It's not too hot.
It's not too cold.
It's right in the goldilocks zone.
- It's perfect.
- It is, except I'll be out of town every weekend on my book signing tour.
So unless we get married on a Monday,
September's gonna be tough.
(Clears throat) A little unsolicited advice.
Do you give another kind?
(Sighs) In life, there is no such thing as a perfect time for anything.
I'm sorry, that's advice how?
(Huffs) Don't wait!
Hell, just go down to city hall right now.
You love each other.
Stop talking about it.
Just do it.
(Exhales sharply)
- We'll find a date.
It's gonna be fine.
- Let's keep... yeah, looking.
Okay.
(Cell phone rings and beeps)
Beckett.
I don't know, Castle.
Maybe we're being too ambitious.
Maybe we should consider the spring of next year.
I thought you didn't wanna wait that long.
Nah, I just...
I wanna be flexible.
You already are flexible.
(Laughing) You see what I... did there.
(Chuckles)
What's so funny?
Well, actually, did you know Beckett can lift her...
- No, nothing.
Hello.
Nothing.
- I'll tell you later.
- No.
- No.
Well, our victim is a Ted Rollins.
He was shot twice in the chest.
He was 20 years old, lived alone, and worked part-time at a secondhand record store.
So how's a 20-year-old who sells used records for a living own a place like this?
This is one of the many things that don't add up here.
Like why he's soaking wet?
The killer left Ted Rollins' body in the shower.
When the officers arrived, the water was still going.
And who called them in?
That's a good question.
At 11:50, uniforms responded to a 9-1-1 call made from the victim's cell phone.
But the time of death is between 8:00 and 11:00.
So there's no way Ted could've placed that call.
So the killer shot him and then called 9-1-1.
Except our victim was not shot in this apartment.
How do we know that?
Because he has exit wounds in his back, but there are no bullets in the bathroom or anywhere else in the apartment.
Plus lividity indicates the body was moved.
Okay, so then the killer put him in the shower to wash off the trace evidence from the original crime scene.
And it almost worked except for this.
(Camera shutter clicks)
The grease here with the tiny red specks?
Water didn't get that out.
It's on his knees and his elbows.
I'm thinking he fell when he got shot and landed in that stuff.
Okay, let's get this material to C.S.U.
- See if they can tell us where he was killed.
- I don't get it.
Why would the killer risk moving the body back here from the crime scene?
Sounds like a case of
"Weekend at Bernie's" gone wrong.
No.
No, wait.
That would have to mean there's such a thing as a "Weekend at Bernie's" gone right.
Wait a minute.
These two shoelaces are tied differently.
That is odd.
(Floorboards creaking)
This is even more odd.
(Camera shutter clicks)
What are you doing?
(Groans)
Looks like Ted's got a secret compartment.
And what's a secret compartment... without a secret?
A laptop.
The key to our mystery and the identity of our killer may lie within that device.
(Tory) Well, if it does, I can't get to it.
Honestly, I've never seen anything like this before. (Beeps)
So what are we looking at here?
A very high-level encryption program.
What, and you can't crack it?
Come on, genius bar.
I thought you were the best.
I am.
It's just whoever designed this is... better.
- But give me some time.
Let me see what I can do.
- All right.
Anyone else wondering what a record store clerk is doing with this kind of technology?
Espo, did you contact next of kin?
Yeah, Ted's father and little brother.
They're on their way down.
I just talked to Ted yesterday.
How could he be gone?
Mr. Rollins, when you spoke with your son, did he seem worried or scared about anything?
He said everything was fine.
Maybe you could help us with something else.
We found a laptop in one of the floorboards of Ted's place with a highly sophisticated encryption system.
Either one of you know what it was doing there?
What is it?
Ted was a... computer whiz.
More like a genius.
But it got him into trouble.
When Ted was in high school, he got into identity theft... hijacking credit cards, bank accounts, stuff like that.
Yeah, he'd call it "pulling a Robin Hood."
'Cause he would steal from the rich and give to the poor.
The poor being Ted?
He was just a kid.
So how much did he end up stealing?
- $1.4 million.
- Whoa.
But the judge made him give it back.
Part of Ted's plea deal was that he was barred from using any devices connecting him to the Internet.
So he shouldn't have had that laptop.
Is there anything to indicate that he went back to committing identity theft?
I was laid off, and...
Ted helped me with Grant's tuition.
I knew he was up to something.
I just didn't wanna believe he was hacking again.
Okay, so, let's just say he went back to stealing identities.
Does that explain why he was killed?
Yeah, people get pissed about getting their identities stolen, but normally, they report it to the police.
Well, maybe he stole from the kind of people that don't report to the police.
Hey!
Look who's back from paternity leave.
(Chuckles)
So how's Sarah Grace?
Oh!
Man.
I tell you, she is just... (Cell phone chimes) my perfect little angel.
- Oh, she's so cute.
Wow.
- Yeah.
Is it me or... or does she...
look a lot like Esposito?
Yeah, she does.
(Whispers)
- Wow.
- Really, Beckett?
I expected that from Jackass but not from you.
Anyway, so I got that C.S.U. report back.
Looks like Ted might've been killed in an auto body shop.
Did he even own a car?
No, but they identified that sludge on Ted's clothes.
It's hydraulic fluid mixed with red paint flecks.
Now the paint is urethane-based with high levels of a volatile organic compound, so it's most likely from a car painted prior to the 1990s.
Okay, canvass the auto shops near Ted's place.
Maybe he was seen at one of them.
- Yeah.
- Hey!
Beckett, we got something.
(Typing) Now, Ted's laptop is like Fort Knox on steroids.
But Tory found some unscrambled artifacts in the registry to a service set identifier.
I don't know what that means either, but she got really excited about it.
And here's why.
(Beep) Yesterday at 7:19 P.M. Ted connected to a dedicated server of a private computer network.
I traced the network.
It belongs to...
(Typing)
Universal Banking Solutions.
They're based in Chicago but have satellite offices all over the world, including Manhattan, which is where Ted connected.
Now according to the web site, "Universal Banking Solutions"
"handles strategic and tactical procurements"
"for international clients."
And what does that mean?
I...
I don't...
I was just reading the screen there.
Okay, so what did Ted do when he connected to the server?
It's impossible to tell.
He could've sent an e-mail or accessed the web site.
Or he hacked it.
That, too.
Whatever he did, it was the last time this laptop was used before he died.
Okay, so, who runs the Manhattan office?
(Beep) Anderson Cross.
All right, let's see if Mr. Cross knows what Ted was up to.
I don't know, Castle.
Maybe your mom's right.
I think elopement's a great idea.
There's no planning, no lists.
All we do is we just get married.
Beckett, I promise you, there is a perfect date for our perfect wedding, and we will find it.
- Trust me.
- I do.
- Oh, wedding humor.
Nice.
- Mm-hmm.
We need to speak with Anderson Cross.
Let me see if he's available.
(Cell phone ringing)
- Excuse me.
(Whispers)
- Yeah.
(Beep) Castle.
(Man) Richard, something is about to happen.
But you cannot react.
I'm sorry.
Who is this?
Lives are at stake.
Don't react.
(Beep, line disconnects)
Sorry, Mr. Cross isn't picking up.
Oh.
Here he is.
Mr. Cross, these people are here to see you.
Hello there.
I'm Anderson Cross.
Hi.
I'm detective Kate Beckett.
N.Y.P.D.
Detective Beckett, so nice to meet you.
And, uh, this is Richard Castle.
Sorry.
I didn't get the name.
Richard.
Richard Castle.
So why don't we go on into the conference room where we can talk?
Yes.
(Whispers) Dad?
Not a word.
Castle 6x12
- Deep Cover Original air date January 13, 2014
So, I don't mean to rush us, but I do have an appointment in a few minutes.
Actually, this won't take very long, Mr. Cross.
Um, do you know a man named Ted Rollins?
No, I...
I don't believe I do.
Why?
He was murdered last night.
Oh.
Okay.
I'm not sure what that has to do with me.
Well, we believe that he tried to access your network yesterday evening around 7:19.
Do you have any idea why he would do that?
Well, as a matter of fact, I just got a report from my I.T. people saying that someone tried to hack into our system around about that time.
And what exactly does your company do?
Well, we basically handle, uh, multi-million dollar currency transactions for banks, international businesses, uh, foreign countries and the like.
Maybe Ted was trying to, uh...
tap in and steal from one of those transactions.
Well, if he did... (Chuckles) he was quite unsuccessful.
Has anyone tried to hack into your company's network before?
Oh, yes.
But we have quite a robust firewall system.
It's never been breached.
Um, well, would you mind giving me copies of your incursion reports along with the ones from last night?
Of course.
I'll send them right over to you. (Cell phone chimes and vibrates)
Okay, thank you.
Thanks for your time.
(Inhales deeply) I'm sorry, Mr. Cross, uh, have we ever met before?
I don't believe we have.
Really?
Because you just seem so familiar.
Really?
- Uh-huh.
- I have one of those faces.
Huh?
Um, Lanie's got something for us.
We should go.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Not at all.
My pleasure.
(Mouths words)
Okay, so I may know why one of Ted's shoes was tied differently.
The killer was looking for something.
In his shoes?
Yep.
At the time of his death,
Ted had a coin in his right sock.
Due to rigor mortis, an impression remained, including these faint markings.
You see that?
Yeah.
Wow.
Hey, Castle.
You with us?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Uh...
let me get this straight.
So, after Ted was shot, the killer took off the shoe and the sock, grabbed the coin and then put the shoe and sock back on?
Must've been a valuable coin.
Actually, it wasn't.
I did some enhancement.
(Beeps) And based on the coin's diameter and the markings, we've identified it as an Iranian rial, worth less than a penny.
Wow, an Iranian rial, huh?
Castle?
No... theories on international intrigue or covert espionage?
We really don't have the information to speculate at this point.
Okay.
Were you able to narrow down where Ted was killed?
No, but I did check his stomach contents.
And I can tell you this...
approximately 15 minutes before his death, Ted ate clams and funnel cake.
Can you believe that?
Ugh.
Lanie, you slice open dead people for a living and you're grossed out by that?
Even I have my limits.
Okay, fine, uh, clams and funnel cake.
That sounds like he had amusement park food.
Right, and the hydraulic fluid and red paint on Ted's clothes?
He was at an amusement park, and I can tell you which one.
How?
Well, as a connoisseur of carny food, there's only one amusement park that has both fried clams and funnel cake, and that park is...
- Coney Island.
- Coney Island.
Okay, you two creep me out (Cell phone chimes and vibrates)
When you do that shared brain thing.
Uh, I...
Hey, I...
I forgot I had to...
drop by my publisher's.
We gotta look at the... galleys.
There's another... uh, for the Derrick Storm... novels.
There's the galley, and, uh...
(Speaks indistinctly)
Great.
Thanks.
Hey, Beckett!
(Receiver thuds)
The head of Coney Island's maintenance staff said that the only place there would be hydraulic fluid and paint is the repair facility under the roller coaster.
Okay, let's have park security check it out for us.
They have.
And they found blood.
(Screaming)
(Track rattling)
(Police radio chatter)
(Camera shutter clicks)
Well, this is definitely where Ted was killed.
Why here?
What was he up to?
(Mouth full) Yo, funnel cake vendor remembered seeing Ted.
Said he got his food and walked in this direction.
Was he with anyone?
- Not that he saw.
- Killer must've followed him.
Or maybe they came here to meet.
Yeah, why wouldn't the killer leave the body here?
Why would he drag it all the way back to Manhattan to the victim's own apartment?
To throw us off his trail.
Or maybe the killer didn't want us to find the crime scene because there's something here that ties him to the murder.
Do they have security cameras here?
Just that one covering the south entrance.
Okay, let's talk to park security.
Get them to give us the surveillance footage.
(Track rattling)
(Children shouting playfully)
Oh.
There you go.
(Coins clink)
- God bless you, man.
- Yeah.
(Bird chirping)
Sit behind me.
Never thought I'd see you again.
Ted Rollins.
Your victim.
What have you learned?
What have I le...
I'm sorry, until a year ago, I had no idea who you were, and now you come out of the blue and the only thing you have to say is,
"what have you learned?"
How about a, "hello, son.
How you been?"
You're getting emotional.
Now is not the time.
Really?
'Cause it's been about 40 years.
So when would be a good time?
With what I do?
Never.
Or did you forget what happened in Paris?
No.
How could I forget?
Then stop acting like you did.
You know what I do.
You know who I am.
I let my guard down, people die.
People like Ted?
So who was he really?
Who killed him?
You need to tell me what you know.
You don't trust me.
Trust kills faster than bullets.
Look, there's a storm coming.
And if I don't stop it, a lot more people are gonna die.
Just tell me what you know.
Um... he was shot at Coney Island under the roller coaster.
There was a coin in his sock.
An Iranian rial.
Do you have the coin?
No, the killer took it.
Why would he do that?
What does that mean?
It means I gotta go.
If there's any update, text me.
Say you need to meet, and I'll be back here within 30 minutes.
Don't tell anyone about this, about me.
Not even your fiancée.
(Paper rustles)
How'd you know we were engaged?
Well, I may not be good at it, but I am still your father.
Now keep your mouth shut.
And let's try not to get us both killed.
(Telephone ringing)
What's wrong?
You don't like the artwork for your graphic novel?
Oh, no, no, it's great.
It's good, it's, um...
So we were right about Coney Island, huh?
Yes.
One mystery solved.
Only it's led us to a few new ones.
Like what was Ted doing there in the first place?
- Yeah.
It's weird.
- It's more than weird.
Something bigger's going on here, don't you think?
Hey, guys.
Come check this out.
This is surveillance from that security camera at the entrance of the roller coaster repair yard.
Ted enters alone at 8:47 P.M.
Did anyone enter prior to that?
No.
But about 15 minutes later at 9:04 P.M., someone does.
(Beep)
Wait.
Zoom in and freeze it.
(Keys clack, beep)
That's Anderson Cross.
Oh, my God.
He's our killer.
This whole time it was Anderson Cross.
So Ted must've hacked into his system, and he decided to take matters into his own hands.
(Scoffs) But that doesn't seem likely.
I mean, he really doesn't seem the type.
Castle, what are you talking about?
He lied to us.
He told us he didn't know Ted, and there he is at the crime scene.
We don't actually see him commit murder.
There's a number of entrances to that area, but there's only one camera.
It just... may not be what it seems.
So, what?
He just happened to be there two hours after Ted hacked his company?
I'm... just saying that Anderson Cross is the killer?
It's just the obvious choice.
Well, that's usually what happens when all the evidence points to a suspect.
We have to get him down here.
Pull up everything you can on his company.
(Typing)
- This makes no sense.
- What?
It's gone.
The site disappeared.
Actually, not just the site.
Every trace of the company.
Find Anderson Cross now.
Who the hell is this guy?
He's obviously not a banker.
I know why he looks familiar.
- Where you going?
- To check something.
(Line ringing)
(Whispers) Pick up, pick up.
(Man) Leave a message.
(Beep)
(Buttons clicking)
- Hey, Castle.
- Jeez!
Damn, bro.
Why you so jumpy?
I'm... dude, I'm not.
I'm just...
Well, you will be once you hear what we've found.
Come on.
(Clicking)
So, this guy, Anderson Cross, is like a villain in one of your books.
His office was cleared out like he knew we were coming.
- There wasn't a trace of him?
- Nothin'.
Even his receptionist.
She was hired from a temp agency.
Just started working yesterday.
She doesn't know jack.
Neither did the building manager.
He said that Cross rented the place from him last month, paid for a year's lease with a cashier's check.
So it's totally untraceable.
Yeah, whoever this guy is, he's in a different league.
And we've crossed paths before.
What do you mean?
Check this out.
Remember this guy?
Alexis's kidnapping last year.
Damn, that's right.
Uh... witnesses kept seeing him pop up at locations associated with her abduction.
And at each one of those locations, there was a dead body.
So I sent the video surveillance to a friend of mine in the A.G.'s office, and he got a hit.
Now he couldn't get into details, but he did say that this guy is a former C.I.A. operative.
Wait a minute.
Former?
Yeah, he, uh, he was disowned for an unauthorized assassination.
He was sentenced to life, broke out, killed three guards in the process.
This guy's wanted by our government.
Now my friend said that the rumor is, he's working as a hit man.
And if we get eyes on him, the A.G.'s office wants us to call them so they can send in a strike team.
Why would a guy like this wanna kill Ted Rollins?
More than that, how are we gonna find a former spy?
He's spent a lifetime covering his tracks.
Yeah, but Ted hasn't.
And somehow they're connected.
So, we should see if Hansel left any breadcrumbs towards our suspect.
(Cell phone beeps)
We need to retrace every one of Ted's footsteps. (Clicking)
Our killer knew him well enough to know where he lived.
- I mean, they had to have had previous contact.
- Okay.
Castle, did you ever see this man in Paris?
Not that I can remember.
Why don't you, um, text me those sketches?
I'll have, uh, Alexis come over.
See if she recognizes him.
Do you want me to come along?
Uh, no.
No, no.
That's...
I'll call you.
You okay?
Yeah.
So I'm coming up with a whole bunch of nothing.
You?
Check it out.
It's a printout of Ted's metrocard.
Look how he got to Coney Island yesterday.
He swiped his card at the 33rd and Park Avenue South station.
Probably took the 6 to the N train.
So?
So look at his swipes for the past two weeks.
(Paper rustles)
He kept going back and forth to that subway stop at 33rd and Park.
Exactly.
And he didn't work, live, or know anyone in that area.
- All right.
Let's get up there and see what he was doing.
- All right.
(Whirring) (Martha humming)
(Door closes)
(Continues humming)
(Whirring stops, switch clicks)
Oh!
Richard, you're home early.
Care for a glass of liquefied heaven?
Good for your hair, good for your te...
Richard, what is it?
Of course, I believed him, because he's my father.
Well, especially after Paris.
I mean, why wouldn't you?
But he used me... to stay ahead of the investigation, to know when to make a run for it.
If he's innocent, why didn't he show up at the park?
Richard, look... the only thing we really know about him is that we don't know him.
Me?
I had one night with him.
You?
A day in Paris.
Lean on the people you trust.
Call Katherine.
Tell her what's going on.
(Knock on door)
I'll get that.
And what if he's telling the truth?
What if he isn't?
(Gasps)
Hello, Martha.
It's been a while, huh?
What the hell are you doing here?
Sorry to miss our meeting, but, uh, I was a little busy getting shot.
Oh, my God!
Come in.
(Martha groans)
You look good.
Yeah, well, you've looked better.
Oh!
Sorry.
Okay, I boiled everything just like you said.
(Clatter)
But I have to warn you, my only other experience with surgery involved a board game and a guy whose nose lit up when I made a mistake.
Did you bring the booze?
Yeah.
No, right here.
You want something to dull the pain?
No, I want you to steady your nerves.
Take a swig.
(Whispers) Good idea.
(Liquor sloshes) (Whispers) Okay.
(Groans)
Okay, now, make an incision through the wound about an inch long.
Here you go.
Okay.
About an inch.
(Inhales sharply)
- Okay.
- Oh.
All right, now here comes the fun part.
Carefully, and I do mean carefully, pull the slug out.
But do me a favor.
Try not to make my nose light up, huh?
(Chuckles lightly) Right.
(Whispers) Okay.
(Squishing)
(Groans)
I think I have it.
I got it.
- Oh!
- I don't got it.
Sorry.
Careful, Richard.
Now that you know how not to do it, let's try the other way.
(Whispering) Yeah, right.
(Whispers)
- Okay, let me just get you here.
- Thank you.
(Groans) Okay.
(Groans)
(Squishing)
(Grunts) I think I have it.
(Groans) All right...
I think I...
(Gasps)
- I have it.
- Bravo!
Real good.
(Chuckles)
- There we go.
- Oh, we go.
Martha, hand me the needle and thread.
Uh... okay, here it is.
And there we go.
All right, you've stitched yourself up before, I take it?
At least this time I got a needle.
Ah.
So, you wanna tell us how you got shot?
Not particularly.
What about the three guards you murdered while escaping from prison...
you wanna tell us about them?
Don't believe everything you read.
So you didn't kill 'em?
I work outside the system, which means I need an effective cover.
Hired assassin, wanted by Uncle Sam... opens a lot of doors.
(Door opens in distance)
(Beckett) Castle?
(Door closes)
(Whispers) Crap.
Hey, so I thought I'd see if Alexis remembers anything more about the man from the sketches.
Yeah, about the man in the sketches, um... something you should know about him.
What?
He's your future father-in-law.
Nice to see you again, Kate.
(Sighs) Katherine,
I wanna say this isn't what it looks like, but it is.
- I was gonna tell you.
I swear.
- When?
After you patched him up?
Sent him on his merry way?
He's wanted by the government.
You are harboring a fugitive.
That's just his cover.
And you know that, how?
Because he told you?
Because of Paris.
And because he's my father.
He is not your father.
He made that choice a long time ago.
This man is my suspect.
Now you know what I have to do, right?
Boy, she is a spitfire, this one.
I'm glad we're on the same side.
Who says we're on the same side?
I'm sorry.
He wouldn't stay put.
- Richard, I need your laptop.
Now.
- Right.
No.
The only thing that you are getting is a ride to my precinct in handcuffs.
You're not gonna arrest me.
Really?
Why?
Because you want answers.
And if you take me in, you're not gonna get any.
The feds will swoop in.
You won't have anything, and I'll have lost valuable time.
You want Ted's killer?
So do I.
There's a hell of a lot more at stake here than murder.
Then you're gonna have to tell me what it is.
There was a massive breach at the C.I.A.
Someone hacked the files containing the identities of our deep cover operatives.
Do you know who?
No.
But it was an inside job at the highest level.
That's why they called me.
Because I'm outside.
My orders were to find the mole and recover the files.
What does any of this have to do with Ted?
Ted was one of my best guys.
I recruited him to help me find Gemini.
Gemini?
Code name for the mole.
He was planning on selling the D.C.O. lists.
But we couldn't find him.
If these files get out, the consequences will be very real.
Then yesterday we had a breakthrough.
Ted identified the buyer and he signaled me to meet so he could tell me who it was.
But, uh...
But Gemini got there first.
He killed Ted.
Leaving me S.O.L., until you told me about the Iranian rial.
- You... you told him about the rial?
- I...
Ted left that as a fail-safe message... about the buyer.
Right, it's old school spycraft.
But Gemini knows all the old tricks, so he took that coin to throw you off his scent.
Yeah, once I found out the Iranians were involved,
I traced Ted's trail back to an apartment on East 38th street across from the Iranian mission.
Only Gemini got there ahead of me.
And he ambushed you?
From a rooftop across the way.
Soon as I opened the door, all hell broke loose.
But...
(Chuckles) I'm good at hell.
I made my way back to the car, but he was right on my tail.
I had to drive into the East River just to get away from him.
Look, this is an incredible story, and I can see where Castle gets his talent, but it doesn't mean that any of what you said is true.
You don't believe me?
Mnh-mnh.
Turn on the news.
A high-speed car chase rocked the neighborhood of Murray Hill just hours ago.
According to multiple reports, the pursuit began with gunshots at an apartment on East 38th street where two unidentified men were involved in a gun battle.
That doesn't prove anything.
(Cell phone rings)
(Cell phone beeps) Beckett.
(Camera shutter clicking) So, whatever our boy Ted was into, it's all some crazy-ass spy stuff.
What makes you say that?
Well, you heard about that car chase in Murray Hill?
Well, we're at the epicenter.
It's a shot-up apartment at 38th and 3rd.
It's where it all started.
According to the super,
Ted Rollins rented this place two weeks ago.
By the looks of the equipment, he was hacking.
- Hacking who?
- I don't know.
He's got a pretty sophisticated wi-fi sniffer here.
So, must've been intercepting Internet traffic from someone.
(Under breath) The Iranian mission across the street.
What exactly did Ted intercept?
I don't know.
Someone stole the hard drive.
Can I borrow your laptop now?
(Typing)
These are communications to and from the Iranian mission.
Yep.
That's incredibly illegal.
Yep.
Okay, here.
Ted flagged this one.
It's an anonymous e-mail from Izad Larjani.
He's part of Vevak...
Iran's C.I.A.
"F.C. payment received.
Central Library reading room."
"Tomorrow 5:00 P.M. Network name:
Kingfish."
This was sent yesterday.
Which means it's going down today.
He's sending the D.C.O. list over a secured wi-fi connection in... roughly 30 minutes.
(Typing) Central Library's a perfect location...
It's public.
Uh, there's lots of people on laptops.
Gemini never has to meet with his buyer face to face.
Wi-fi signals max out at about 200 feet indoors.
He and the buyer will have to be in the building at the same time.
Given everything that's happened, why would he still go through with the exchange?
"F.C." means "final communication."
All links have been severed.
If Gemini pulls out, he has no way to tell his buyer.
He will do anything in his power to make the transfer.
I gotta go.
I gotta stop this.
Well, are you crazy?
!
We just pulled a bullet out of you.
Can't you call someone?
This mission does not exist.
I don't exist.
There's no one to call.
Don't you have back-up?
I am the back-up.
- You're in no condition...
- You don't understand!
This list cannot get out into the open.
Then we'll go.
Castle's right.
You are in no condition.
And if we stop him, then we all get what we want.
Let's run this just so we know we're all on the same page.
Richard, what do you do?
As soon as the Kingfish network goes online, I log in,
I download the list.
- You don't just log in.
You gotta be first.
- Right.
Why does he have to be first?
Because it locks out the Iranians from downloading the list.
Right.
And while Castle's downloading,
I'll track the signal using the wi-fi analyzer on my phone.
You could find a spy on your phone?
Mother, there's an app for everything now.
Now, Kate, remember, if you don't have a tactical advantage, just get eyes on him.
He's C.I.A.
If you can describe him, I can find him.
Okay.
It's almost 5:00.
We should go.
Richard, this means a lot, kid.
Thanks.
- Martha, I'm gonna need you...
- I know.
- He's not going anywhere.
(Whispers)
- Okay.
If anything happens to them...
He's a smart kid.
And she's good at what she does.
No, they'll be fine.
I promise.
Forgive me, but your promises don't mean very much.
Gemini could be any one of these people.
Right.
Scanning for wi-fi signals.
(Beep)
I don't see Kingfish.
Maybe we're too late.
(Playing single notes)
You still play?
No, not so much anymore.
A shame.
You were good.
Hmm.
That was hell of a night.
Hell of a night.
You remember the song you played?
"My funny Valentine."
(Whispers) It was a long time ago.
(Groans)
Oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh.
You need to lie down.
- All right, I am calling an ambulance for you.
- No, no, no.
No, it's just... my blood sugar's low.
You got any juice?
Uh, yes.
5:04.
We blew it.
Did we?
Or did we just get played?
Look, Castle, I know he's your father.
What if there's an ulterior motive to all of this?
(Computer chines)
Kingfish is online.
Go.
(Typing) All right.
Okay.
"T," hashtag, less than, "l."
- Uppercase "L."
- Oh.
Capital "L."
We gotta get online before the buyer.
Come on.
(Beeps)
I'm in.
Downloading the file at slowest speed possible.
That gives you less than three minutes.
Okay, you stay here.
You tell me how much time I have.
(Cell phone beeps, auto-dials)
(Line ringing)
(Beep) Can you hear me?
Yeah.
- I can hear you.
- Signal's getting stronger.
You've got 2 minutes, 40 seconds left.
Oh, no.
- You've got under two minutes.
- Okay, Castle,
I'm at the stairs and the signal's gotten weak again.
Did I pass him?
Wait a minute.
Wait.
We are demonstrating two-dimensional thinking here.
Like Khan in "Star Trek II:
Wrath of Khan."
Khan didn't realize that the Enterprise was below him.
Right.
So if we are the Enterprise, that means Gemini is...
- Is above us.
- Exactly.
(Cell phone chimes) Oh.
Oh, this is so not the time, mother.
(Beep)
(Breathing heavily)
A minute 15 left.
Castle, I'm in the book stacks.
I'm close.
All right, less than a minute.
Be careful.
(Cell phone chimes)
(Whispers loudly) Mom!
(Beep)
Do you see him?
Is he there?
Beckett.
Oh, no.
What?
(Sighs) Castle.
He set up some kind of a relay system.
Gemini could be anywhere.
What?
!
(Computer chimes)
- Hang on.
Something is wrong.
- What?
Well, the download is complete.
But this is... this is not a C.I.A. list.
This is... this is a phone book.
- Richard Castle.
Wow. (Chuckles)
- Castle...
I'm so sorry to bother you, sir, but I'm, like, your number one fan.
Can I get an autograph?
Actually, this is really not a good time.
(Cocks gun)
What are you talking about?
Castle?
(Beep)
Castle, are you there?
That was you at the park, wasn't it?
Dressed as a homeless guy?
You're Gemini.
Let's go.
Nice and quiet.
(Thuds)
Man who sent you... who is he?
Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
I saw you in the park with him.
Is he C.I.A.?
The phone book.
You knew not to send the real list because you were trying to draw him into the open.
That's right.
Looks like he was smart enough to send someone expendable.
All right, mystery writer.
Tell me a story.
Who's your handler?
What's his name?
Where is he?
Why should I tell you?
You're just gonna kill me anyway.
Yeah.
But I can slow, or I can kill you fast.
It's up to you.
(Clatter)
(Groaning) Aah!
Aah!
Uhh!
Aah.
(Groans)
You all right?
Me?
You... you're the one who was shot.
Wasn't the first time.
- I'll go call an ambulance.
- Don't bother.
No!
No, no, wait.
(Silenced gunshot)
Wha... why would you do that?
That was the mission.
That's what I do.
H... how did you even find me?
Your left coat pocket.
Wha... what is this?
Some kind of G.P.S. locator?
How did you...
The hug.
You slipped this on me.
I needed to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, to use me as bait.
(Clatters)
Well, after the shoot-out at the apartment,
I knew I was blown.
But I still had to recover this list.
So, to keep the upper hand, you let Beckett and me walk into a trap.
We could've been killed.
I would never let anything happen to you two.
The way you never let anything happen to Ted?
There are reasons I have to do what I do, Richard.
- One day you'll understand.
- Hmm?
Now get Beckett.
Let her know we have her killer.
(Grunts) Castle, what happened?
- Come on.
Gemini's down here.
(Whispers)
- Okay.
No.
No, no, no, no.
He was here.
He was here just a minute ago.
Of course he took the body.
(Whispers) Yeah.
(Breathing heavily)
But left Gemini's weapon.
That gun was a ballistics match to the one that killed Ted.
It's registered to...
Tony Blaine.
We searched his place.
Found clothes that tested positive for Ted's blood.
- Blaine's definitely our killer.
- But who is he?
He's a researcher at a government think tank.
Yeah, but what a researcher at a government think tank is doing involved in all this, we have no idea.
Yeah, we may never know.
Well, hold on.
We've got a B.O.L.O. out on him and we're monitoring his credit cards.
- We'll find him.
- And when we do, maybe he can tell us who this Anderson Cross is.
Yeah, maybe.
All right, great job, guys.
Thanks.
Well, it looks like the C.I.A. wrapped all this up in a neat package.
Yeah, with a bow courtesy of my father.
At least Ted's killer was brought to justice, you know, in a... in a way.
But Blaine killed Ted but left his body at Coney Island.
It was my father that moved the body.
Now he could've put it anywhere, but he took it to Ted's apartment.
Do you know why?
To bring him into our jurisdiction.
He wanted us to catch the case so he could work me for information.
Well, maybe he was just looking for a reason to see you again, and this was his way.
I keep making the mistake of thinking he's family.
But he's not.
You are.
September.
What?
We're getting married in September.
It won't be too hot.
It won't be too cold.
It's in the goldilocks zone.
It's perfect.
Wait, wait, Castle.
What about your book tour?
Screw it.
(Kisses)
September.
(Whispers) Okay.
Hello, mother.
How are you?
Well, that was fun.
What a day.
(Sighs) You know, for years I wondered if your father was the one who got away.
Well, now, I finally know.
He was never worth your time.
Oh, yes, he was.
First time I met him, he gave me the greatest gift of my life... you.
And now after all these years, he's given me another one.
Closure.
So... what about you, kiddo?
How are you?
(Inhales deeply) I don't know.
(Exhales deeply) Think we'll ever see him again?
I wish I knew.
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Do you need assistance?
Are you in danger?
Castle, what if it rains?
- On our wedding day?
- Mm-hmm.
That's supposed to be good luck.
But we'll find a venue that has an indoor area, just in case.
Even if we find the perfect place,
- it's not gonna be available until at least October.
- October!
Harvest season.
Perfect.
Perfect, except if you want my dad to walk me down the aisle.
He's gonna be in Europe on the research project.
Oh.
Fine.
We'll have a winter wedding.
Didn't we say we wanted to do it outside?
- Right.
Yeah, frostbite isn't very festive.
- Hmm.
How about we get hitched, uh, spring of next year?
And what if I wanna get married sooner?
Hmm?
Who could blame you?
Mm.
You two are so adorable.
Oh, you know what?
Maybe we could find a venue for this summer.
You want to have a wedding in the middle of a New York summer?
No.
You're right.
Oh!
I know!
September!
It's not too hot.
It's not too cold.
It's right in the goldilocks zone.
- It's perfect.
- It is, except I'll be out of town every weekend on my book signing tour.
So unless we get married on a Monday,
September's gonna be tough.
A little unsolicited advice.
Do you give another kind?
In life, there is no such thing as a perfect time for anything.
I'm sorry, that's advice how?
Don't wait!
Hell, just go down to city hall right now.
You love each other.
Stop talking about it.
Just do it.
- We'll find a date.
It's gonna be fine.
- Let's keep... yeah, looking.
Okay.
Beckett.
I don't know, Castle.
Maybe we're being too ambitious.
Maybe we should consider the spring of next year.
I thought you didn't wanna wait that long.
Nah, I just...
I wanna be flexible.
You already are flexible.
You see what I... did there.
What's so funny?
Well, actually, did you know Beckett can lift her...
- No, nothing.
Hello.
Nothing.
- I'll tell you later.
- No.
- No.
Well, our victim is a Ted Rollins.
He was shot twice in the chest.
He was 20 years old, lived alone, and worked part-time at a secondhand record store.
So how's a 20-year-old who sells used records for a living own a place like this?
This is one of the many things that don't add up here.
Like why he's soaking wet?
The killer left Ted Rollins' body in the shower.
When the officers arrived, the water was still going.
And who called them in?
That's a good question.
At 11:50, uniforms responded to a 9-1-1 call made from the victim's cell phone.
But the time of death is between 8:00 and 11:00.
So there's no way Ted could've placed that call.
So the killer shot him and then called 9-1-1.
Except our victim was not shot in this apartment.
How do we know that?
Because he has exit wounds in his back, but there are no bullets in the bathroom or anywhere else in the apartment.
Plus lividity indicates the body was moved.
Okay, so then the killer put him in the shower to wash off the trace evidence from the original crime scene.
And it almost worked except for this.
The grease here with the tiny red specks?
Water didn't get that out.
It's on his knees and his elbows.
I'm thinking he fell when he got shot and landed in that stuff.
Okay, let's get this material to C.S.U.
- See if they can tell us where he was killed.
- I don't get it.
Why would the killer risk moving the body back here from the crime scene?
Sounds like a case of
"Weekend at Bernie's" gone wrong.
No.
No, wait.
That would have to mean there's such a thing as a "Weekend at Bernie's" gone right.
Wait a minute.
These two shoelaces are tied differently.
That is odd.
This is even more odd.
What are you doing?
Looks like Ted's got a secret compartment.
And what's a secret compartment... without a secret?
A laptop.
The key to our mystery and the identity of our killer may lie within that device.
Well, if it does, I can't get to it.
Honestly, I've never seen anything like this before.
So what are we looking at here?
A very high-level encryption program.
What, and you can't crack it?
Come on, genius bar.
I thought you were the best.
I am.
It's just whoever designed this is... better.
- But give me some time.
Let me see what I can do.
- All right.
Anyone else wondering what a record store clerk is doing with this kind of technology?
Espo, did you contact next of kin?
Yeah, Ted's father and little brother.
They're on their way down.
I just talked to Ted yesterday.
How could he be gone?
Mr. Rollins, when you spoke with your son, did he seem worried or scared about anything?
He said everything was fine.
Maybe you could help us with something else.
We found a laptop in one of the floorboards of Ted's place with a highly sophisticated encryption system.
Either one of you know what it was doing there?
What is it?
Ted was a... computer whiz.
More like a genius.
But it got him into trouble.
When Ted was in high school, he got into identity theft... hijacking credit cards, bank accounts, stuff like that.
Yeah, he'd call it "pulling a Robin Hood."
'Cause he would steal from the rich and give to the poor.
The poor being Ted?
He was just a kid.
So how much did he end up stealing?
- $1.4 million.
- Whoa.
But the judge made him give it back.
Part of Ted's plea deal was that he was barred from using any devices connecting him to the Internet.
So he shouldn't have had that laptop.
Is there anything to indicate that he went back to committing identity theft?
I was laid off, and...
Ted helped me with Grant's tuition.
I knew he was up to something.
I just didn't wanna believe he was hacking again.
Okay, so, let's just say he went back to stealing identities.
Does that explain why he was killed?
Yeah, people get pissed about getting their identities stolen, but normally, they report it to the police.
Well, maybe he stole from the kind of people that don't report to the police.
Hey!
Look who's back from paternity leave.
So how's Sarah Grace?
Oh!
Man.
I tell you, she is just... my perfect little angel.
- Oh, she's so cute.
Wow.
- Yeah.
Is it me or... or does she...
look a lot like Esposito?
Yeah, she does.
- Wow.
- Really, Beckett?
I expected that from Jackass but not from you.
Anyway, so I got that C.S.U. report back.
Looks like Ted might've been killed in an auto body shop.
Did he even own a car?
No, but they identified that sludge on Ted's clothes.
It's hydraulic fluid mixed with red paint flecks.
Now the paint is urethane-based with high levels of a volatile organic compound, so it's most likely from a car painted prior to the 1990s.
Okay, canvass the auto shops near Ted's place.
Maybe he was seen at one of them.
- Yeah.
- Hey!
Beckett, we got something.
Now, Ted's laptop is like Fort Knox on steroids.
But Tory found some unscrambled artifacts in the registry to a service set identifier.
I don't know what that means either, but she got really excited about it.
And here's why.
Yesterday at 7:19 P.M. Ted connected to a dedicated server of a private computer network.
I traced the network.
It belongs to...
Universal Banking Solutions.
They're based in Chicago but have satellite offices all over the world, including Manhattan, which is where Ted connected.
Now according to the web site, "Universal Banking Solutions"
"handles strategic and tactical procurements"
"for international clients."
And what does that mean?
I...
I don't...
I was just reading the screen there.
Okay, so what did Ted do when he connected to the server?
It's impossible to tell.
He could've sent an e-mail or accessed the web site.
Or he hacked it.
That, too.
Whatever he did, it was the last time this laptop was used before he died.
Okay, so, who runs the Manhattan office?
Anderson Cross.
All right, let's see if Mr. Cross knows what Ted was up to.
I don't know, Castle.
Maybe your mom's right.
I think elopement's a great idea.
There's no planning, no lists.
All we do is we just get married.
Beckett, I promise you, there is a perfect date for our perfect wedding, and we will find it.
- Trust me.
- I do.
- Oh, wedding humor.
Nice.
- Mm-hmm.
We need to speak with Anderson Cross.
Let me see if he's available.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
Castle.
Richard, something is about to happen.
But you cannot react.
I'm sorry.
Who is this?
Lives are at stake.
Don't react.
Sorry, Mr. Cross isn't picking up.
Oh.
Here he is.
Mr. Cross, these people are here to see you.
Hello there.
I'm Anderson Cross.
Hi.
I'm detective Kate Beckett.
N.Y.P.D.
Detective Beckett, so nice to meet you.
And, uh, this is Richard Castle.
Sorry.
I didn't get the name.
Richard.
Richard Castle.
So why don't we go on into the conference room where we can talk?
Yes.
Dad?
Not a word.
Castle 6x12
- Deep Cover Original air date January 13, 2014
So, I don't mean to rush us, but I do have an appointment in a few minutes.
Actually, this won't take very long, Mr. Cross.
Um, do you know a man named Ted Rollins?
No, I...
I don't believe I do.
Why?
He was murdered last night.
Oh.
Okay.
I'm not sure what that has to do with me.
Well, we believe that he tried to access your network yesterday evening around 7:19.
Do you have any idea why he would do that?
Well, as a matter of fact, I just got a report from my I.T. people saying that someone tried to hack into our system around about that time.
And what exactly does your company do?
Well, we basically handle, uh, multi-million dollar currency transactions for banks, international businesses, uh, foreign countries and the like.
Maybe Ted was trying to, uh...
tap in and steal from one of those transactions.
Well, if he did... he was quite unsuccessful.
Has anyone tried to hack into your company's network before?
Oh, yes.
But we have quite a robust firewall system.
It's never been breached.
Um, well, would you mind giving me copies of your incursion reports along with the ones from last night?
Of course.
I'll send them right over to you.
Okay, thank you.
Thanks for your time.
I'm sorry, Mr. Cross, uh, have we ever met before?
I don't believe we have.
Really?
Because you just seem so familiar.
Really?
- Uh-huh.
- I have one of those faces.
Huh?
Um, Lanie's got something for us.
We should go.
- Great.
- Thank you.
Not at all.
My pleasure.
Okay, so I may know why one of Ted's shoes was tied differently.
The killer was looking for something.
In his shoes?
Yep.
At the time of his death,
Ted had a coin in his right sock.
Due to rigor mortis, an impression remained, including these faint markings.
You see that?
Yeah.
Wow.
Hey, Castle.
You with us?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Uh...
let me get this straight.
So, after Ted was shot, the killer took off the shoe and the sock, grabbed the coin and then put the shoe and sock back on?
Must've been a valuable coin.
Actually, it wasn't.
I did some enhancement.
And based on the coin's diameter and the markings, we've identified it as an Iranian rial, worth less than a penny.
Wow, an Iranian rial, huh?
Castle?
No... theories on international intrigue or covert espionage?
We really don't have the information to speculate at this point.
Okay.
Were you able to narrow down where Ted was killed?
No, but I did check his stomach contents.
And I can tell you this...
approximately 15 minutes before his death, Ted ate clams and funnel cake.
Can you believe that?
Ugh.
Lanie, you slice open dead people for a living and you're grossed out by that?
Even I have my limits.
Okay, fine, uh, clams and funnel cake.
That sounds like he had amusement park food.
Right, and the hydraulic fluid and red paint on Ted's clothes?
He was at an amusement park, and I can tell you which one.
How?
Well, as a connoisseur of carny food, there's only one amusement park that has both fried clams and funnel cake, and that park is...
- Coney Island.
- Coney Island.
Okay, you two creep me out
When you do that shared brain thing.
Uh, I...
Hey, I...
I forgot I had to...
drop by my publisher's.
We gotta look at the... galleys.
There's another... uh, for the Derrick Storm... novels.
There's the galley, and, uh...
Great.
Thanks.
Hey, Beckett!
The head of Coney Island's maintenance staff said that the only place there would be hydraulic fluid and paint is the repair facility under the roller coaster.
Okay, let's have park security check it out for us.
They have.
And they found blood.
Well, this is definitely where Ted was killed.
Why here?
What was he up to?
Yo, funnel cake vendor remembered seeing Ted.
Said he got his food and walked in this direction.
Was he with anyone?
- Not that he saw.
- Killer must've followed him.
Or maybe they came here to meet.
Yeah, why wouldn't the killer leave the body here?
Why would he drag it all the way back to Manhattan to the victim's own apartment?
To throw us off his trail.
Or maybe the killer didn't want us to find the crime scene because there's something here that ties him to the murder.
Do they have security cameras here?
Just that one covering the south entrance.
Okay, let's talk to park security.
Get them to give us the surveillance footage.
Oh.
There you go.
- God bless you, man.
- Yeah.
Sit behind me.
Never thought I'd see you again.
Ted Rollins.
Your victim.
What have you learned?
What have I le...
I'm sorry, until a year ago, I had no idea who you were, and now you come out of the blue and the only thing you have to say is,
"what have you learned?"
How about a, "hello, son.
How you been?"
You're getting emotional.
Now is not the time.
Really?
'Cause it's been about 40 years.
So when would be a good time?
With what I do?
Never.
Or did you forget what happened in Paris?
No.
How could I forget?
Then stop acting like you did.
You know what I do.
You know who I am.
I let my guard down, people die.
People like Ted?
So who was he really?
Who killed him?
You need to tell me what you know.
You don't trust me.
Trust kills faster than bullets.
Look, there's a storm coming.
And if I don't stop it, a lot more people are gonna die.
Just tell me what you know.
Um... he was shot at Coney Island under the roller coaster.
There was a coin in his sock.
An Iranian rial.
Do you have the coin?
No, the killer took it.
Why would he do that?
What does that mean?
It means I gotta go.
If there's any update, text me.
Say you need to meet, and I'll be back here within 30 minutes.
Don't tell anyone about this, about me.
Not even your fiancée.
How'd you know we were engaged?
Well, I may not be good at it, but I am still your father.
Now keep your mouth shut.
And let's try not to get us both killed.
What's wrong?
You don't like the artwork for your graphic novel?
Oh, no, no, it's great.
It's good, it's, um...
So we were right about Coney Island, huh?
Yes.
One mystery solved.
Only it's led us to a few new ones.
Like what was Ted doing there in the first place?
- Yeah.
It's weird.
- It's more than weird.
Something bigger's going on here, don't you think?
Hey, guys.
Come check this out.
This is surveillance from that security camera at the entrance of the roller coaster repair yard.
Ted enters alone at 8:47 P.M.
Did anyone enter prior to that?
No.
But about 15 minutes later at 9:04 P.M., someone does.
Wait.
Zoom in and freeze it.
That's Anderson Cross.
Oh, my God.
He's our killer.
This whole time it was Anderson Cross.
So Ted must've hacked into his system, and he decided to take matters into his own hands.
But that doesn't seem likely.
I mean, he really doesn't seem the type.
Castle, what are you talking about?
He lied to us.
He told us he didn't know Ted, and there he is at the crime scene.
We don't actually see him commit murder.
There's a number of entrances to that area, but there's only one camera.
It just... may not be what it seems.
So, what?
He just happened to be there two hours after Ted hacked his company?
I'm... just saying that Anderson Cross is the killer?
It's just the obvious choice.
Well, that's usually what happens when all the evidence points to a suspect.
We have to get him down here.
Pull up everything you can on his company.
- This makes no sense.
- What?
It's gone.
The site disappeared.
Actually, not just the site.
Every trace of the company.
Find Anderson Cross now.
Who the hell is this guy?
He's obviously not a banker.
I know why he looks familiar.
- Where you going?
- To check something.
Pick up, pick up.
Leave a message.
- Hey, Castle.
- Jeez!
Damn, bro.
Why you so jumpy?
I'm... dude, I'm not.
I'm just...
Well, you will be once you hear what we've found.
Come on.
So, this guy, Anderson Cross, is like a villain in one of your books.
His office was cleared out like he knew we were coming.
- There wasn't a trace of him?
- Nothin'.
Even his receptionist.
She was hired from a temp agency.
Just started working yesterday.
She doesn't know jack.
Neither did the building manager.
He said that Cross rented the place from him last month, paid for a year's lease with a cashier's check.
So it's totally untraceable.
Yeah, whoever this guy is, he's in a different league.
And we've crossed paths before.
What do you mean?
Check this out.
Remember this guy?
Alexis's kidnapping last year.
Damn, that's right.
Uh... witnesses kept seeing him pop up at locations associated with her abduction.
And at each one of those locations, there was a dead body.
So I sent the video surveillance to a friend of mine in the A.G.'s office, and he got a hit.
Now he couldn't get into details, but he did say that this guy is a former C.I.A. operative.
Wait a minute.
Former?
Yeah, he, uh, he was disowned for an unauthorized assassination.
He was sentenced to life, broke out, killed three guards in the process.
This guy's wanted by our government.
Now my friend said that the rumor is, he's working as a hit man.
And if we get eyes on him, the A.G.'s office wants us to call them so they can send in a strike team.
Why would a guy like this wanna kill Ted Rollins?
More than that, how are we gonna find a former spy?
He's spent a lifetime covering his tracks.
Yeah, but Ted hasn't.
And somehow they're connected.
So, we should see if Hansel left any breadcrumbs towards our suspect.
We need to retrace every one of Ted's footsteps.
Our killer knew him well enough to know where he lived.
- I mean, they had to have had previous contact.
- Okay.
Castle, did you ever see this man in Paris?
Not that I can remember.
Why don't you, um, text me those sketches?
I'll have, uh, Alexis come over.
See if she recognizes him.
Do you want me to come along?
Uh, no.
No, no.
That's...
I'll call you.
You okay?
Yeah.
So I'm coming up with a whole bunch of nothing.
You?
Check it out.
It's a printout of Ted's metrocard.
Look how he got to Coney Island yesterday.
He swiped his card at the 33rd and Park Avenue South station.
Probably took the 6 to the N train.
So?
So look at his swipes for the past two weeks.
He kept going back and forth to that subway stop at 33rd and Park.
Exactly.
And he didn't work, live, or know anyone in that area.
- All right.
Let's get up there and see what he was doing.
- All right.
Oh!
Richard, you're home early.
Care for a glass of liquefied heaven?
Good for your hair, good for your te...
Richard, what is it?
Of course, I believed him, because he's my father.
Well, especially after Paris.
I mean, why wouldn't you?
But he used me... to stay ahead of the investigation, to know when to make a run for it.
If he's innocent, why didn't he show up at the park?
Richard, look... the only thing we really know about him is that we don't know him.
Me?
I had one night with him.
You?
A day in Paris.
Lean on the people you trust.
Call Katherine.
Tell her what's going on.
I'll get that.
And what if he's telling the truth?
What if he isn't?
Hello, Martha.
It's been a while, huh?
What the hell are you doing here?
Sorry to miss our meeting, but, uh, I was a little busy getting shot.
Oh, my God!
Come in.
You look good.
Yeah, well, you've looked better.
Oh!
Sorry.
Okay, I boiled everything just like you said.
But I have to warn you, my only other experience with surgery involved a board game and a guy whose nose lit up when I made a mistake.
Did you bring the booze?
Yeah.
No, right here.
You want something to dull the pain?
No, I want you to steady your nerves.
Take a swig.
Good idea.
Okay.
Okay, now, make an incision through the wound about an inch long.
Here you go.
Okay.
About an inch.
- Okay.
- Oh.
All right, now here comes the fun part.
Carefully, and I do mean carefully, pull the slug out.
But do me a favor.
Try not to make my nose light up, huh?
Right.
Okay.
I think I have it.
I got it.
- Oh!
- I don't got it.
Sorry.
Careful, Richard.
Now that you know how not to do it, let's try the other way.
Yeah, right.
- Okay, let me just get you here.
- Thank you.
Okay.
I think I have it.
All right...
I think I...
- I have it.
- Bravo!
Real good.
- There we go.
- Oh, we go.
Martha, hand me the needle and thread.
Uh... okay, here it is.
And there we go.
All right, you've stitched yourself up before, I take it?
At least this time I got a needle.
Ah.
So, you wanna tell us how you got shot?
Not particularly.
What about the three guards you murdered while escaping from prison...
you wanna tell us about them?
Don't believe everything you read.
So you didn't kill 'em?
I work outside the system, which means I need an effective cover.
Hired assassin, wanted by Uncle Sam... opens a lot of doors.
Castle?
Crap.
Hey, so I thought I'd see if Alexis remembers anything more about the man from the sketches.
Yeah, about the man in the sketches, um... something you should know about him.
What?
He's your future father-in-law.
Nice to see you again, Kate.
Katherine,
I wanna say this isn't what it looks like, but it is.
- I was gonna tell you.
I swear.
- When?
After you patched him up?
Sent him on his merry way?
He's wanted by the government.
You are harboring a fugitive.
That's just his cover.
And you know that, how?
Because he told you?
Because of Paris.
And because he's my father.
He is not your father.
He made that choice a long time ago.
This man is my suspect.
Now you know what I have to do, right?
Boy, she is a spitfire, this one.
I'm glad we're on the same side.
Who says we're on the same side?
I'm sorry.
He wouldn't stay put.
- Richard, I need your laptop.
Now.
- Right.
No.
The only thing that you are getting is a ride to my precinct in handcuffs.
You're not gonna arrest me.
Really?
Why?
Because you want answers.
And if you take me in, you're not gonna get any.
The feds will swoop in.
You won't have anything, and I'll have lost valuable time.
You want Ted's killer?
So do I.
There's a hell of a lot more at stake here than murder.
Then you're gonna have to tell me what it is.
There was a massive breach at the C.I.A.
Someone hacked the files containing the identities of our deep cover operatives.
Do you know who?
No.
But it was an inside job at the highest level.
That's why they called me.
Because I'm outside.
My orders were to find the mole and recover the files.
What does any of this have to do with Ted?
Ted was one of my best guys.
I recruited him to help me find Gemini.
Gemini?
Code name for the mole.
He was planning on selling the D.C.O. lists.
But we couldn't find him.
If these files get out, the consequences will be very real.
Then yesterday we had a breakthrough.
Ted identified the buyer and he signaled me to meet so he could tell me who it was.
But, uh...
But Gemini got there first.
He killed Ted.
Leaving me S.O.L., until you told me about the Iranian rial.
- You... you told him about the rial?
- I...
Ted left that as a fail-safe message... about the buyer.
Right, it's old school spycraft.
But Gemini knows all the old tricks, so he took that coin to throw you off his scent.
Yeah, once I found out the Iranians were involved,
I traced Ted's trail back to an apartment on East 38th street across from the Iranian mission.
Only Gemini got there ahead of me.
And he ambushed you?
From a rooftop across the way.
Soon as I opened the door, all hell broke loose.
But...
I'm good at hell.
I made my way back to the car, but he was right on my tail.
I had to drive into the East River just to get away from him.
Look, this is an incredible story, and I can see where Castle gets his talent, but it doesn't mean that any of what you said is true.
You don't believe me?
Mnh-mnh.
Turn on the news.
A high-speed car chase rocked the neighborhood of Murray Hill just hours ago.
According to multiple reports, the pursuit began with gunshots at an apartment on East 38th street where two unidentified men were involved in a gun battle.
That doesn't prove anything.
Beckett.
So, whatever our boy Ted was into, it's all some crazy-ass spy stuff.
What makes you say that?
Well, you heard about that car chase in Murray Hill?
Well, we're at the epicenter.
It's a shot-up apartment at 38th and 3rd.
It's where it all started.
According to the super,
Ted Rollins rented this place two weeks ago.
By the looks of the equipment, he was hacking.
- Hacking who?
- I don't know.
He's got a pretty sophisticated wi-fi sniffer here.
So, must've been intercepting Internet traffic from someone.
The Iranian mission across the street.
What exactly did Ted intercept?
I don't know.
Someone stole the hard drive.
Can I borrow your laptop now?
These are communications to and from the Iranian mission.
Yep.
That's incredibly illegal.
Yep.
Okay, here.
Ted flagged this one.
It's an anonymous e-mail from Izad Larjani.
He's part of Vevak...
Iran's C.I.A.
"F.C. payment received.
Central Library reading room."
- "Tomorrow 5:00 P.M.
- Kingfish."
This was sent yesterday.
Which means it's going down today.
He's sending the D.C.O. list over a secured wi-fi connection in... roughly 30 minutes.
Central Library's a perfect location...
It's public.
Uh, there's lots of people on laptops.
Gemini never has to meet with his buyer face to face.
Wi-fi signals max out at about 200 feet indoors.
He and the buyer will have to be in the building at the same time.
Given everything that's happened, why would he still go through with the exchange?
"F.C." means "final communication."
All links have been severed.
If Gemini pulls out, he has no way to tell his buyer.
He will do anything in his power to make the transfer.
I gotta go.
I gotta stop this.
Well, are you crazy?
!
We just pulled a bullet out of you.
Can't you call someone?
This mission does not exist.
I don't exist.
There's no one to call.
Don't you have back-up?
I am the back-up.
- You're in no condition...
- You don't understand!
This list cannot get out into the open.
Then we'll go.
Castle's right.
You are in no condition.
And if we stop him, then we all get what we want.
Let's run this just so we know we're all on the same page.
Richard, what do you do?
As soon as the Kingfish network goes online, I log in,
I download the list.
- You don't just log in.
You gotta be first.
- Right.
Why does he have to be first?
Because it locks out the Iranians from downloading the list.
Right.
And while Castle's downloading,
I'll track the signal using the wi-fi analyzer on my phone.
You could find a spy on your phone?
Mother, there's an app for everything now.
Now, Kate, remember, if you don't have a tactical advantage, just get eyes on him.
He's C.I.A.
If you can describe him, I can find him.
Okay.
It's almost 5:00.
We should go.
Richard, this means a lot, kid.
Thanks.
- Martha, I'm gonna need you...
- I know.
- He's not going anywhere.
- Okay.
If anything happens to them...
He's a smart kid.
And she's good at what she does.
No, they'll be fine.
I promise.
Forgive me, but your promises don't mean very much.
Gemini could be any one of these people.
Right.
Scanning for wi-fi signals.
I don't see Kingfish.
Maybe we're too late.
You still play?
No, not so much anymore.
A shame.
You were good.
Hmm.
That was hell of a night.
Hell of a night.
You remember the song you played?
"My funny Valentine."
It was a long time ago.
Oh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh.
You need to lie down.
- All right, I am calling an ambulance for you.
- No, no, no.
No, it's just... my blood sugar's low.
You got any juice?
Uh, yes.
5:04.
We blew it.
Did we?
Or did we just get played?
Look, Castle, I know he's your father.
What if there's an ulterior motive to all of this?
Kingfish is online.
Go.
All right.
Okay.
"T," hashtag, less than, "l."
- Uppercase "L."
- Oh.
Capital "L."
We gotta get online before the buyer.
Come on.
I'm in.
Downloading the file at slowest speed possible.
That gives you less than three minutes.
Okay, you stay here.
You tell me how much time I have.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
- I can hear you.
- Signal's getting stronger.
You've got 2 minutes, 40 seconds left.
Oh, no.
- You've got under two minutes.
- Okay, Castle,
I'm at the stairs and the signal's gotten weak again.
Did I pass him?
Wait a minute.
Wait.
We are demonstrating two-dimensional thinking here.
Like Khan in "Star Trek II:
Wrath of Khan."
Khan didn't realize that the Enterprise was below him.
Right.
So if we are the Enterprise, that means Gemini is...
- Is above us.
- Exactly.
Oh.
Oh, this is so not the time, mother.
A minute 15 left.
Castle, I'm in the book stacks.
I'm close.
All right, less than a minute.
Be careful.
Mom!
Do you see him?
Is he there?
Beckett.
Oh, no.
What?
Castle.
He set up some kind of a relay system.
Gemini could be anywhere.
What?
!
- Hang on.
Something is wrong.
- What?
Well, the download is complete.
But this is... this is not a C.I.A. list.
This is... this is a phone book.
- Richard Castle.
Wow.
- Castle...
I'm so sorry to bother you, sir, but I'm, like, your number one fan.
Can I get an autograph?
Actually, this is really not a good time.
What are you talking about?
Castle?
Castle, are you there?
That was you at the park, wasn't it?
Dressed as a homeless guy?
You're Gemini.
Let's go.
Nice and quiet.
Man who sent you... who is he?
Look, I don't know what you're talking about.
I saw you in the park with him.
Is he C.I.A.?
The phone book.
You knew not to send the real list because you were trying to draw him into the open.
That's right.
Looks like he was smart enough to send someone expendable.
All right, mystery writer.
Tell me a story.
Who's your handler?
What's his name?
Where is he?
Why should I tell you?
You're just gonna kill me anyway.
Yeah.
But I can slow, or I can kill you fast.
It's up to you.
Aah!
Aah!
Uhh!
Aah.
You all right?
Me?
You... you're the one who was shot.
Wasn't the first time.
- I'll go call an ambulance.
- Don't bother.
No!
No, no, wait.
Wha... why would you do that?
That was the mission.
That's what I do.
H... how did you even find me?
Your left coat pocket.
Wha... what is this?
Some kind of G.P.S. locator?
How did you...
The hug.
You slipped this on me.
I needed to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, to use me as bait.
Well, after the shoot-out at the apartment,
I knew I was blown.
But I still had to recover this list.
So, to keep the upper hand, you let Beckett and me walk into a trap.
We could've been killed.
I would never let anything happen to you two.
The way you never let anything happen to Ted?
There are reasons I have to do what I do, Richard.
- One day you'll understand.
- Hmm?
Now get Beckett.
Let her know we have her killer.
Castle, what happened?
- Come on.
Gemini's down here.
- Okay.
No.
No, no, no, no.
He was here.
He was here just a minute ago.
Of course he took the body.
Yeah.
But left Gemini's weapon.
That gun was a ballistics match to the one that killed Ted.
It's registered to...
Tony Blaine.
We searched his place.
Found clothes that tested positive for Ted's blood.
- Blaine's definitely our killer.
- But who is he?
He's a researcher at a government think tank.
Yeah, but what a researcher at a government think tank is doing involved in all this, we have no idea.
Yeah, we may never know.
Well, hold on.
We've got a B.O.L.O. out on him and we're monitoring his credit cards.
- We'll find him.
- And when we do, maybe he can tell us who this Anderson Cross is.
Yeah, maybe.
All right, great job, guys.
Thanks.
Well, it looks like the C.I.A. wrapped all this up in a neat package.
Yeah, with a bow courtesy of my father.
At least Ted's killer was brought to justice, you know, in a... in a way.
But Blaine killed Ted but left his body at Coney Island.
It was my father that moved the body.
Now he could've put it anywhere, but he took it to Ted's apartment.
Do you know why?
To bring him into our jurisdiction.
He wanted us to catch the case so he could work me for information.
Well, maybe he was just looking for a reason to see you again, and this was his way.
I keep making the mistake of thinking he's family.
But he's not.
You are.
September.
What?
We're getting married in September.
It won't be too hot.
It won't be too cold.
It's in the goldilocks zone.
It's perfect.
Wait, wait, Castle.
What about your book tour?
Screw it.
September.
Okay.
Hello, mother.
How are you?
Well, that was fun.
What a day.
You know, for years I wondered if your father was the one who got away.
Well, now, I finally know.
He was never worth your time.
Oh, yes, he was.
First time I met him, he gave me the greatest gift of my life... you.
And now after all these years, he's given me another one.
Closure.
So... what about you, kiddo?
How are you?
I don't know.
Think we'll ever see him again?
I wish I knew.
See that aspiring model there?
That's me...
Deb... until the day I died.
I thought I'd go straight to heaven, but there was a bit of a mix-up, and I woke up in someone else's body.
So now I'm Jane, a super-busy lawyer with my very own assistant.
I got a new life, a new wardrobe, and the only people who really know what's going on with me are my girlfriend Stacy and my guardian angel, Paul.
I used to think everything happened for a reason.
Whoo!
Now, I sure hope I was right.
♪ La, la, la, la-la-la-la ♪
Previously on "Drop Dead Diva"...
Where am I?
Grayson, you're in the hospital.
Do you remember what happened?
My boyfriend is gonna propose, and I'm not supposed to know about it...
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Prepare to intubate.
I need 12 French tubes and...
Grayson.
Charging the 360.
- All clear?
- Clear.
Shock.
Asystole.
Check for pulse.
Negative.
I'm calling it.
Time of death... 5:17 PM.
It's me.
Sorry.
I don't know anyone at that facility.
Jane, it's me.
It's Grayson.
This isn't funny and I'm hanging up.
No!
Listen.
I hit "Return"... and I'm back.
Like I said a few hours ago, you can't see Ian Holt.
You're not his attorney.
Yeah, I heard you loud and clear, which is why I filed an emergency petition.
Here it is.
Oh, yeah.
Gosh, will you look at that?
I am his lawyer.
I'd like to see my client now, please.
Thank you.
Ian's been transferred back to his cell from the infirmary.
- The infirmary?
- Mm-hmm.
Guy was executed last night.
Dead a full two minutes, and then his ticker started up again.
Freaked the hell out of the warden.
Can you imagine being dead and then coming back to life?
Yeah, I know, it's crazy.
Cold-blooded killer like Ian Holt gets a second chance.
It's not right.
If you ask me, he deserves to die, slow and painful.
I didn't ask you.
I demand to see my client now.
Thank you.
I thought we'd never see each other again.
It's really... you.
Isn't it?
Yeah.
You know what?
The guard thinks I'm just your lawyer, not your girlfriend.
So... you pressed the Return button.
Yeah.
I met Fred.
He said he owed you.
Yeah.
He also made it clear that my return is a one-time thing.
All I remember is a flash of light, and suddenly I woke up in the prison infirmary handcuffed to a steel bed.
Your soul entered Ian's body the moment he died.
The moment he was executed.
Yes.
Jane, I don't even know what this guy did.
I have none of his memories.
I know.
That's how it works.
At first, I didn't know anything about Jane... her friends, her family, her Netflix password, nothing.
But I did get her IQ and her legal knowledge, and that's a really good thing, 'cause I'm gonna figure out a way to get you out of here.
Jane, if they tried to execute this body...
Mm-hmm.
That means he was out of appeals.
Well, I'm gonna talk to Ian's former lawyer.
I will find a way in.
You're amazing.
After what we've been through, a little thing like death row is not gonna keep us apart.
Did you feel that kick?
Ba-boom!
Wow!
The twins were partying all night long.
I had a dream that one became a rockette and the other the rock.
Did Jane... already leave this morning?
We were supposed to carpool.
Oh, she called.
She's at the prison.
She's meeting with a new client.
We don't have a new client in prison.
- Did she mention a name?
- Not that I recall.
Odd.
No.
No.
I mean, you know Jane.
She's always running from prison to prison passing out her business card.
So, hey, I wanted to run a few wedding ideas by you.
Which roses do you prefer?
Cherry Brandy or Freedom?
Either.
Either is fine.
Well, I have more pictures if you want to see.
Mnh-mnh.
Whichever one you want.
Owen, you're sweating.
It's hot in here, isn't it?
Well, I was actually gonna go get a sweater.
So, let's talk about the wedding cake.
I have narrowed it down to two bakeries, and we can meet with them tonight.
I'm...
I'm not sure what time that I'm...
I'm gonna be done tonight.
And... and in fact, look at the time.
I-I-I got to go.
Owen, are you really okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Everything's great.
It's great.
Ha-have a good day.
I love you.
Huh.
All the performers with the Dance Theatre of Compton are inner-city teenagers.
It's a creative outlet that keeps them away from the gang and drug culture.
I've seen the documentary on your troupe.
What you guys do is incredible.
Thank you.
As you know, the survival of the organization depends on grants and private donations.
Are you here for a donation?
Because I'm happy to...
Oh, no, no.
I need legal help.
This will sound strange.
Empress Katia stole my latest choreographed piece for her new music video.
Uh Empress Katia is a huge pop star who sells out the Staples Center.
I doubt she would steal from you.
I didn't think she would, either, but see for yourself.
I muted the music since she dances to pop music and my kids dance to classical, but check out the moves.
On the left is my troupe, on the right is Empress Katia's new music video "Out of My Bed."
Sponsored by Angry Girl Cosmetics.
The dances look identical.
She stole my work.
Step for step.
Two months ago, Empress Katia attended a performance.
The kids were so excited.
A superstar was coming to see our little troupe.
I guess she liked what she saw.
I mean, perhaps she was subconsciously inspired by the performance and didn't realize she appropriated your choreography.
Ms. Kaswell... critics are now accusing me of stealing her moves.
My reputation is on the line, as well as my grants.
Okay.
We'll sit down with Empress Katia and we'll... we'll try to sort it out.
Thank you.
This is what five years of appeals looks like?
Yeah.
I got these files from your former lawyer.
Let me guess... an overworked public defender.
Yep.
Now, apparently, through this entire trial, you've maintained your innocence.
All right.
So, what's my story?
Well...
You're Ian Michael Holt, 39 years old.
You were the facilities manager at the Costa Mar Country Club.
In 2009, you were convicted of the murder of the club president, Harry Beckett.
Oh, God.
Motive?
You were having an affair with Harry's wife, Cheryl.
He discovered your affair and fired you.
Jane, I'm Grayson.
I know.
But you keep saying "You"
like I'm the guy who did these things.
No, it's just... the world sees you as Ian.
But I know.
I know it's strange, but the sooner you adjust, the easier it'll get.
How did you adjust?
I mean I don't even connect with this body.
None of this feels like me.
I know.
I know.
I still have those moments.
You know, sometimes I look in the mirror and... and I see a stranger.
But then I remember that I was given a second chance.
It's all worth it.
Okay, now apparently, in your trial transcript... uh, yes, you were so enraged, you beat Harry to death with a 3-iron.
So I'm a violent killer.
Why would Fred put me in this body?
It d... it doesn't work like that.
It's... it's all random.
Listen, although you are now Ian,
I need you to think like Grayson and help me go through these files.
All right, we've got to find something to get back in court.
Excuse me.
Uh, here for your dinner order.
Same as last time, you get anything you want.
Wait, wait, wait.
Why are you asking for his last meal?
Execution's been rescheduled for midnight tonight.
They ordered a new batch of injections.
Make sure they get it right this time.
Jane.
Can't talk.
We saw you took on a new client.
Yeah, death-row inmate with a botched execution.
A pro bono death-penalty case can be quite time consuming.
I am defending this client, so help me God, and if you try and stop me...
- Stop you?
- Are you kidding me?
Ian Holt is all over the news.
It's exactly the kind of high-profile case this firm should be handling.
You have the full resources of the firm.
I was even gonna offer my help as second chair.
Great, search for any grounds for a stay.
I'd help you out, too, but, uh...
I have a client meeting.
Is that Empress Katia?
It's either her or a really good drag queen.
I got to go.
Who's Empress Katia?
We contend that the choreography in your latest video, "Get Out of My Bed,"
was copied from my client.
Now, all we're asking for is acknowledgement.
I'm honestly flattered.
I am a huge fan.
I do not copy or steal.
I create.
My client's choreography is original.
It was inspired by the joyous dances of street orphans
I witnessed on my goodwill trip to Haiti where I built houses and passed out bags of rice.
Wow, you're a regular bono, aren't you?
The only reason I attended your little show is because I am a patron of the arts, and I resent being dragged into this office.
I am a very busy woman.
Well, I'm... very sorry for the inconvenience.
Thank you.
We'll take this up in court.
Hey, Owen.
Oh.
Uh, I mean, it's nice to meet you, Mr. French.
Thanks for taking my case.
Of course.
I understand, Ms. Bingum, you're here to argue for a stay of execution?
Yes.
Your honor, the state has already injected our client with a lethal cocktail.
A second injection constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment.
Except Ian Holt was convicted by a jury.
The glitch in the execution does not alter the state's right to carry out the sentence.
I'm sorry, Ms. Bingum, but you've offered no new facts supporting a stay.
Argue that the death warrant is technically deficient.
Um, your honor.
Uh, the death warrant is required to specify the date, time, and method of execution.
Given that this is a new execution to take place in a new date and time, the law mandates a new death warrant.
That is correct.
It'll take 24 hours to issue a new warrant.
In that case, you bought yourself another day.
Thank you.
How did you know about the death warrant?
Uh, he's had a lot of time in jail to read up on the law, right?
Yeah, right.
Uh, lots of time.
Listen, we got to get to work.
We've only got 24 hours to save your life.
Your honor, once choreography is memorialized in writing, it's protected by the Copyright Act of 1976.
My client's notebook contains her choreographic notations dated March 1st.
And as you'll see in the video,
Nadine's dance is identical to Empress Katia's, therefore satisfying the standard of substantial similarity.
You don't need to show the video.
We will stipulate to the substantial similarity.
Oh, uh...
Okay.
Uh, here's a photo from "The National Inquisitor"
of Empress Katia attending the Dance Theatre of Compton's performance on March 10th, therefore proving the defendant had access to my client's work.
We agree with Ms. Kaswell's timeline, except she omits one key fact.
Empress Katia registered her dance with the Copyright Office on February 10th... a full month before she attended Nadine's performance.
Here are copies of the registration.
Your honor, given the plaintiff's aggressive stance towards my client, we are filing a counterclaim for copyright infringement against Nadine Comer.
We are asking for the maximum statutory damages.
Okay, wait a second.
Empress Katia's video was just released.
There's no way my client could've copied her choreography.
Leaked footage of Empress Katia's rehearsals have been online for weeks, giving your client access prior to her notebook sketches.
Uh, your honor, we can establish a date of creation prior to February 10th.
Nadine's company performed a preview in January.
We all know previews are largely attended by friends and family...
all biased witnesses.
All right, I've heard enough.
We need a factual hearing to sort this out.
Until then,
Nadine's company is enjoined from performing the piece.
Your honor...
And likewise, Empress Katia must refrain from performing those moves in concert.
Fine.
We also ask that you instruct Empress Katia to remove her video from the web.
That's going too far.
I think it's just far enough.
We are done for now.
I've been giving this a lot of thought, and our best shot is to get the court to commute your sentence from death to life in prison using a procedural attack.
You were legally dead for two minutes, so trying to execute you again constitutes double jeopardy.
That's clever.
But no.
I'd like you to make a claim of actual innocence.
Ian, Owen's strategy has a much better chance of...
Of keeping me in here for the rest of my life.
No.
Of keeping you alive.
If we're gonna spend the next 24 hours trying to prove your innocence, I have to ask...
- Are you innocent?
- Yes, I am.
Okay, um, Owen could I have a few minutes with Ian by myself?
Okay.
Are you saying this because you didn't kill that man or Ian didn't?
Ian didn't do it.
Look, Jane, in all of his appeals, he could've tried procedural attacks.
He didn't.
He always tried to clear his name.
It's just not enough to get you out of here.
And I found this in my cell hidden under the mattress.
Ian wrote a letter to his mother to be delivered after his death.
He swears he's innocent.
Guilty men don't write letters like this to be delivered after they've been executed.
Jane, I'm innocent, and I need you to save my life.
So... if you are innocent,
I'll have to get back and re-interview everyone who testified at your trial.
Based on the transcripts, I wrote up a list.
Great.
Excuse me, Ms. Bingum.
- Yeah.
- It's time.
It's time for what?
I'm here to take Ian Holt to the execution chamber.
What?
No, I have a stay.
The stay was lifted.
Judge issued a new death warrant.
What?
!
No!
No!
I-I-I need more time!
Jane.
It's okay.
You've done all you can do.
It's you.
Yeah.
Of course it's me.
No, look at him.
See?
He's... he's not Ian.
He's Grayson.
No!
Please, you're... you're taking the wrong man!
Stop!
Please!
Well, obviously, the dream means that you're worried you won't be able to free Grayson...
I mean, pshh, Ian... in time.
Stacy, I don't...
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to argue.
I can't lose him again.
You are the smartest woman I know.
If anyone can help him, it's you.
Look, I don't feel smart right now.
I feel desperate and scared.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
How's the wedding coming along?
Have you decided on the flowers?
Every time I want to discuss anything wedding,
Owen just looks upset and runs off to work.
Oh, God, I got to get to the jail.
Um, you know, men are just weird about weddings.
So, be patient with Owen, and I promise you everything will be fine.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Not only was I sleeping with my boss' wife, apparently, I hooked up with half the married women at the country club.
Jane, I'm a douche.
I know.
And I know I said for you to think of yourself as Ian, but listen.
Whatever this guy did or didn't do, you have Grayson's soul.
And Grayson is the kindest, most honorable man I've ever known.
You okay?
I can't seem to write.
Try your other hand.
Wow.
I am now left-handed.
Trust me, your body will be full of surprises.
This is odd.
What?
Cheryl... the victim's wife.
She testified on Ian's behalf in the penalty phase of the trial.
She pleaded with the judge to spare him the death penalty.
So, if Cheryl was openly sympathetic to a man convicted of killing her husband, she might know something that can help us.
You need to talk to her.
I don't know the woman.
Are you kidding me?
You know her.
Ian knew her intimately.
She'll figure out I'm not really him.
Trust me, nobody ever figures it out.
And the trick is to control the conversation.
So, defuse their questions with another question, and if you're hard pressed, just change the subject.
Oh, and people always forget their train of thought when you interrupt them with a compliment.
You did all those things to me before I knew you were Deb.
I know.
Sorry.
But now you have to do those things with Cheryl.
Owen!
Owen!
Stacy.
Hi!
How did you know I was here?
Oh, easy.
I installed a "Find My Fiancé" app on your phone, which didn't work.
Sent me to Glendale where I met a lovely man named Ohan who's getting married next month.
Anyway, Paul told me where you were.
So, listen, we need to lock down the flowers today, and then we need to discuss the band.
Uh, Stacy, I don't...
I don't think I'm gonna have time.
Oh, no, no, no.
I just need five minutes.
I was talking with Guido, our florist, and he thinks that if we added more lilies in the church...
O, are... a-are you okay?
No.
I feel dizzy.
I've got...
I got, like, a pressure in my chest.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I'm calling 911.
Oh, breathe.
Breathe.
Just breathe.
Okay.
I don't understand how Empress Katia can sue me.
Because she registered the copyright to the dance moves, she's the presumptive rights holder, which means that if the judge sides with her, you could pay $100,000 for every time you've performed that dance for a paying audience.
We've performed those moves at least 20 times.
That's... $2 million.
I have less than $1,000 in my bank account.
Well, then we better not lose.
"Empress Katia!" "Empress Katia!" "Empress Katia!"
- What the hell?
- Oh, God.
Long live Empress Katia!
They're Empress Katia's little soldiers... her super fans.
Hey!
It's Nadine Comer and her sleazy lawyer!
Hey, get out of my way, freak show!
Move!
I'm so glad you're back!
Oh!
Paul!
What are you doing in my office?
The little soldiers are creeping me out.
They showed up here right after Empress Katia took her video down and replaced it with another one.
Check this out.
I will not tolerate this outrageous assault on my artistic integrity, which was orchestrated by Nadine Comer of the Dance Theatre of Compton and Kim Kaswell of the law firm of Harrison Parker located in downtown Los Angeles.
- Oh, she's smart.
- And hot.
Sorry.
Her statement was perfectly worded to fall under first amendment protection.
There's nothing I can do about it.
This was a call to arms.
The little soldiers showed up here because of this message.
Yeah, and they're very loyal to Empress Katia.
They won't leave unless they're forced to.
You know what?
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
Paul, take off your shirt.
Don't you think, uh, you should buy me dinner first?
Do it.
Oh.
My.
You are going to infiltrate the little soldiers.
Go undercover and find out how Katia stole Nadine's dance moves.
Yes, ma'am.
Empress Katia!
Empress Katia!
Say it!
Empress Katia!
I felt pain and a shortness of breath.
Well, your EKG is fine and your troponin levels are normal.
You did not have a heart attack.
That's a huge relief.
Yeah, I believe it was an anxiety attack.
Anxiety?
Yeah, is there anything that's adding unusual stress to your life either at work or at home?
Um...
I'm assisting on a death-row case, but I've done that before.
Okay.
Well, what were you doing when the last attack was triggered?
Well, we were just talking about our wedding.
The flowers, the band.
The cake.
I think we just found the stressor.
Ms. Bingum, thank you so much for setting up this meeting with Ian.
Well, sure.
You can go now.
Oh, prison policy says I must remain in the room, and absolutely no touching.
But feel free, you know.
Carry on like I'm not even here.
Ian, it's been a lifetime since we've seen each other, but I've thought about you every day.
It's been a while since our last liaison, huh?
Liaison?
Listen to you and all your fancy new words.
Uh, they... they, uh, they have a word-a-day calendar in the prison library, so, uh...
Oh, I wrote you so many letters.
Why didn't you write me back?
Yeah, I... uh...
Wow... your perfume is really, really nice.
It's Acqua di Parma.
It's your favorite.
Remember that night in Ojai?
Mm-hmm.
You said that I smelled like summertime sex with a hint of lavender.
Yeah.
Oh.
Wow, you can... really smell that lavender.
I know it doesn't mean much, especially now, but...
I'm really very sorry.
Sorry?
Sorry for what?
For everything.
You're amazing, you know that?
Yeah.
But why... why am I so amazing again?
Prison hasn't taken away your charm.
To think of all the plans that we had.
My husband gets murdered, and you get arrested for it.
So unfair.
Cheryl... do you believe I'm innocent?
Of course.
We both know you didn't do it.
I know.
I want to touch you, too.
Want to hold you in my arms and make this all go away.
Is there any way that we could bend the rules and have a little privacy?
- No.
- No.
But thank you so much for visiting with my client.
Oh, oh, just a few minutes more.
Actually, I'm exhausted, so...
Oh, okay, baby.
It really was so good to see you.
Uh, time to go.
Really nice meeting you... seeing you... again.
- Okay.
- Bye.
What are you grinning about?
Are you happy that I had an affair with that over-sexed married woman?
Cheryl just said that you both know you didn't do it, and given that she's obsessed with you and hated her husband,
I don't think you killed Harry.
I think it's possible she did.
And according to that file, she was at the club the day of the murder.
Oh, yeah.
We have another suspect.
Stace?
Sweetie, what's wrong?
I'm worried about Owen.
I don't think he wants to marry me.
Well, of course he does.
Jane, he had an anxiety attack and ended up in the hospital.
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.
But... the doctor says that it was the wedding that triggered it, and I have tried to talk to him, but any time I mention the word "Wedding,"
he starts hyperventilating.
You know what?
You two need to talk to someone.
You know, like a professional.
In therapy?
Yeah.
Couple's therapy.
That'll be a great way for you and Owen to, you know, communicate with a neutral third party.
I mean, obviously, something's bothering Owen, and you need to get to the bottom of it before you walk down the aisle.
Okay?
Those little soldiers are very forthcoming.
Great.
What did you find out?
Well, Jamie's mom doesn't like her mohawk, and Ben's upset that he's not allowed to wear his kilt to school.
You know, thank goodness for Empress Katia.
She really understands them.
Paul, about the case.
Right.
Well, the little soldiers are really pissed that their leader is once again being targeted by a "Vulture of True Art."
What does that mean?
Pretty sure a vulture of true art is a type of bird that eats dead painters.
Paul.
Apparently, this is the third time Empress Katia has been accused of stealing someone else's dance moves.
The other two were also choreographers who ran small dance troupes, and one of them, Emily Lutsky, lives in LA.
We need to talk to Emily.
She'll be at the Shade Café in one hour.
She seemed very happy to get my call and very excited to talk to you.
Okay, why didn't you open with that?
Hey. ♪ Don't stomp on my style ♪
♪ What?
♪
It's one of Empress Katia's new songs.
It's very catchy.
Now can I put my shirt back on?
If you must.
See, now, this is a fancy country club.
Yeah, my parents belonged to one when I was a kid.
Look.
Dress code: blazers.
No jeans, no open-toed shoes.
Well...
And don't even get me started on the arrears list.
It's the names of all the members that are behind dues posted for everybody to see.
- A Wall of Shame?
- Mm-hmm.
- That's humiliating.
- Look.
Cheryl is the ladies club golf champion two years running.
Well, she'd certainly know how to wield a 3-iron.
Mm-hmm.
Can I help you?
Hi, we're looking for the club president, Richard Breeman.
- That's me.
- Hello.
You must be the lawyers.
I understand you have some new information on Harry's murder.
Oh, we're investigating a lead.
Harry was the best president in club history.
What can I do for you?
We're looking into his wife, Cheryl.
Cheryl left the club three hours before Harry's death, and before you ask,
I know this because Cheryl came down to say goodbye to Harry at our weekly poker game right here in this very room.
Did anyone else see her leave?
Everyone around the table... two lawyers, a CEO, and the lieutenant governor, and they're gonna be here this evening.
So, if you want to come back, you can speak with them.
Cheryl could've reentered the club later that night.
Not without one of these.
Every member uses a key card to get in and out of the club, and the system logs their names and time.
I gave a copy of the log to the police, showing that there was only two people in the middle of the club at the time of the murder...
Harry and the man who killed him, Ian Holt.
Mr. Breeman, someone else could've used Ian's access card.
Except they found the card on Ian when he was arrested.
I'm sorry, but your client is guilty.
My modern dance troupe was performing in North Hollywood when my friends pointed out
Empress Katia's latest dance moves.
She was using your choreography?
Yeah.
I sued, but she had already copyrighted my steps and countersued me.
Did you have to pay damages?
Yeah.
That lady is ruthless.
Hm.
I don't even dance anymore.
I wait tables to pay off the debt.
Do you have any idea how she stole your work?
Well, I've always thought that one of her people attended our preview,
- but I couldn't prove anything.
- I'm sorry.
It sounds like she's doing the same thing to your client.
Do you think you can stop her?
You know what?
Thanks to this conversation, I just might.
I was so sure Cheryl did it.
Why?
Because Ian told you he was innocent?
Yeah.
Jane, you don't know Ian.
He is a desperate man who sent us on a wild goose chase just hours before he was set to be executed again.
This is why you can't believe everything that comes out of your client's mouth.
Owen.
- I still believe him.
- Jane...
No.
Listen to me, I think...
- Jane!
- What?
Stop it.
It's over.
Like it or not,
Ian Holt is gonna be executed at midnight.
I'm sorry.
So, we were wrong?
Cheryl didn't kill Harry.
Yeah, it looks that way, but I'm not giving up.
I know the real killer is somewhere on the key log of the members that were at the club the day of the murder.
We have that document right there, but it's not gonna help you.
- Well...
- Jane, stop.
Stop.
Forget it.
If Ian was the killer, there's nothing we can do about it.
I refuse to accept that.
Let's not spend my last hours looking for a unicorn.
We're lucky we have this time together.
Jane, are you hearing me?
Richard Breeman told me he was playing poker at the club on the day of the murder.
He's not listed on the electronic key log.
The club shuts off cards 24 hours before a member's name is placed on the arrears list.
How do I know that?
I call it a Brain Freeze.
A what?
A Brain Freeze.
It happens when a piece of information from the brain's previous owner becomes unlocked.
Listen, if Richard Breeman was about to be placed on the arrears list, his card would've been turned off.
Right.
That list is social and economic suicide.
He would've done anything to keep his name off it.
Who controls the list?
The club president.
The murder victim.
And that, Dr. Hubert, is probably where my fear of anthropomorphic animals comes from.
I still can't go to Disney Land.
Thank you for sharing.
Mm-hmm.
But we've been here for 45 minutes, and I'm not hearing anything from Owen.
Owen, you recently had an anxiety attack.
Let's talk about that.
Yes, let's!
I don't think Owen wants to marry me.
What?
!
No, of course I do.
You had an anxiety attack just talking about flowers and cake.
I don't know if we're moving too fast or if I'm doing something wrong.
Owen, have you been married before?
No.
Uh, almost.
Broken engagement?
Left at the altar.
I went in to see if my bride was okay, and she was kissing another guy, and...
I had a heart attack.
That's wonderful.
It is?
Obviously, Owen's afraid that you're not gonna show up.
Oh!
I swear, I will show up.
It's my professional opinion that you two should call off the wedding.
You're a horrible therapist.
Let me finish.
Just go to a courthouse and get a marriage license.
You two are obviously in a loving, committed relationship.
It's not the marriage that's giving Owen anxiety.
It's the wedding.
So, you're saying no to "Here Comes the Bride"
and the five-tiered white chocolate tower?
Thank you, doctor.
Hey, Boss.
How'd the interview with Emily go?
Well, I'm trying to determine if a single patron attended all three performances where Katia allegedly stole the dance moves.
How you gonna do that?
I subpoenaed credit-card records from all three performances.
What's a subpoena again?
Something that makes me very, very happy.
Oh, like Jell-O.
I love Jell-O.
Ha.
The same credit card was used at all three venues.
Great, what's the name?
The ALM Group.
That's a weird name.
I once knew a girl named Lemonade.
She hated Jell-O.
Paul, The ALM Group is a corporation.
I'm gonna look it up on the Secretary of State website.
You found something, didn't you?
Call the clerk.
We're going back to court.
Empress Katia, you say the first time you saw Nadine's show was on March 12th, correct?
That's right.
Are you familiar with a company called The ALM Group?
No.
Do you know who the registered owner of The ALM Group is?
What part of "No" don't you understand... the "N" or the "O"?
Once again, you're wasting my time.
Okay, maybe you actually do know who the registered owner is.
John Bergman?
He's my manager.
Did he purchase a ticket for you to the January preview?
Objection.
We've been over this already.
Overruled.
Answer the question.
No.
Like I said, I only saw the show in March.
Okay.
I have here a receipt for a ticket to the January preview purchased through your manager's company.
Now, at first, I thought he attended the performance, but then I subpoenaed his financial records, and it turns out the cost of this ticket is attributed to your account.
So, I'm gonna ask you again.
Did you attend that concert?
If I were at the concert, people would've recognized me.
Unless you weren't wearing any makeup.
Your honor, at this point,
I'm requesting the witness remove her makeup.
I won't do that.
She's harassing my client.
Removing cosmetics is not harassment.
Witness will comply.
What if I refuse?
I will sentence you for contempt, and you will spend a night in jail.
And the wig.
As you can see,
Empress Katia is completely unrecognizable without her signature getup, making it easy for her to slip unnoticed into the preview performance.
So, Katia... let me remind you that you're under oath, and for the last time, did you attend that concert?
Your honor, I'd like to request a brief recess.
Absolutely not.
Witness will answer the question.
I don't remember.
Young lady, my offer to sentence you for contempt is still on the table.
Fine.
Maybe I did attend that performance.
I'm busy.
I can't remember everything I do.
And then you publicly attended the March performance as a smokescreen, knowing that you had already copyrighted those dance moves prior to that date.
If you say so.
Oh, I do.
Your honor, we're seeking damages.
What damages?
Your client hasn't suffered any loss.
No, but Empress Katia profited from that video under a corporate sponsorship with Angry Girl Cosmetics worth almost $200,000.
Under the Doctrine of Unjust Enrichment, my client should be awarded that money.
Ms. Kaswell is correct.
And going forward, my client would be happy to license her choreography at a fair rate so long as the Empress gives credit where credit is due.
Is that acceptable?
Good.
Then we're done here.
Richard Breeman, the current president of the Costa Mar Country Club had motive, means, and opportunity to kill Harry Beckett.
What are you talking about?
I was just going through Richard's financials.
At the time of the murder, he was flat broke.
Well, how does that make him a killer?
Richard was desperate.
He was days away from closing a deal to purchase a shopping mall with a fellow club member, and it would've gone south...
If he was put on the wall of arrears.
Yep.
And Harry was the only one who knew Richard's true financial predicament.
In fact, Harry had cut off Richard's key card the day of the murder, which is why we did not know that Richard was in the club.
You still haven't proved that he did it.
The prosecution's case rested on the fact that only Ian and the victim were in the club.
At the very least, we have enough evidence to extend Ian's stay of execution.
We're never gonna find a judge willing to stop an execution on such short notice.
Forget the judge.
I have a better idea.
Take two.
Hello, gentlemen.
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt your game.
- Can I help you?
- Mm-hmm.
We're here about the murder of your former president.
All of these men can confirm that Cheryl was not here when Harry was killed.
No, I know.
You're right.
And Cheryl did not kill Harry.
You did.
Are you out of your mind?
No.
No, I don't think so.
And to be honest, I'm not here to speak to you.
I am here to confer with the dealer, lieutenant governor.
Sir, these documents show on the day of Harry Beckett's murder,
Harry was about to put Richard on the arrears list.
In fact, Richard's key card had already been deactivated.
However, Richard never appeared on the Wall of Shame because Harry's head was smashed in with a 3-iron.
That same night, probably after Harry was murdered,
Richard's card was reactivated.
I wonder who did that.
It's all in the file, which is why I need the lieutenant governor to call his boss and get a stay of execution for Ian Holt pending a full investigation.
If you keep bad-mouthing me in front of my colleagues, I'm gonna... your accusations go to motive, but nothing connects Richard to the actual crime.
You're right.
We never had physical proof until just now.
Ugh.
Whoa, what the hell are you doing?
Thank you.
Oh, I'm collecting evidence.
See, I think the prints on that glass will match an unknown print on the murder weapon.
Think before you say anything.
If Ian is executed and we prove that you killed Harry, you'll be guilty of two murders.
Bill, I'm gonna need to hire your law firm.
Here's your retainer.
I'll get the governor on the line.
Hello.
Honey, are you here?
Stacy?
- Gotcha.
- Oh!
Wha...?
Feel secure now?
W-what is this?
Listen...
I want a wedding with flowers and a harpist and white doves released as we say our vows.
I will stay handcuffed to you if that's what it takes to convince you that I'm not going anywhere.
No, no.
You don't have to do that.
It's your wedding, too, and I want it to be perfect, and it won't be if you're feeling anxious.
You're amazing, you know that?
- I do, actually.
- I really do.
But I'm serious about the handcuffs.
If you feel anxiety at all that I won't show up, all you need to do is look at your wrist.
Thank you.
You know... there is... something I've always wanted to do with handcuffs.
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.
Good thing I'm free all night.
I never thought I'd see this place again.
You know, it's your home... now.
I mean, you don't want to go back to your old digs.
You need to start a new life.
How about some champaign?
To celebrate the afterlife.
Coming right up.
One thing I don't understand about my case.
Mm-hmm?
According to the file, the cops never found any prints on the murder weapon.
Yes, and I knew that.
But Richard didn't know that.
Which is why he got all panicky and lawyered up.
Which was enough to get the cops to launch a full investigation.
Yep.
So, faced with aggravated murder,
Richard cut a deal for 25 years without parole.
I literally owe you my life.
Well, I love you.
Ian Holt.
And I love you...
Jane Bingum.
Hey.
Um, before we get started, we should get some wine.
Sweetheart, you're pregnant.
I know, which is why I bought a vegan, non-alcoholic white-wine beverage.
All the pregnant celebrities are drinking it.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell you what.
- Mm-hmm?
I'll go get it.
Okay.
- Oh.
- Oh.
And I'll be with you every step of the way.
Come here.
- (knocking)
- Come in.
Dave, you wanted to see me?
Yes.
Beckett, are you familiar with the author Harper Thomas?
My literary hero?
He's the reason I wanted to become a writer.
I've read Gutter Alley a hundred times.
I keep a copy in my desk.
Well, I keep my copy, and then I keep 2 copies that bookend that copy.
Still a little unclear.
Do you know him?
Nobody really knows him.
After his first book came out, he became a total recluse.
No one's seen him in a decade.
Word is he bottles his own urine.
Well...
Beckett Ryan,
- meet Harper Thomas.
- (Beckett gasps.)
Hello.
Yeah, Harper is here because his second book
- is about to be released...
- (Beckett gasps.)
And he has graciously agreed to do a public reading.
(Beckett gasps.)
And our firm is handling the event and you'll be his personal guide.
And before you hyperventilate, perhaps Harper would like a cup of coffee?
No, he likes tea.
All of us writers know that he likes tea.
I'll get it.
- I'll get it.
I'll get it.
- Ok, go.
Ok, good.
I thought I was the socially inept one.
He's not gonna make a big deal out of me being here, is he?
No, no, no, no.
He's aware that you're a very private man and he's a professional.
HARPER THOMAS IS HERE!
HARPER THOMAS IS HERE!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
- I love you.
- No!
Harper Thomas is here!
He's tall for a teenage girl.

Oh!
Somebody tagged me on Facebook again.
This better be a cute one.
Nel-SON!
Why do you keep tagging me in ugly photos?
It's embarrassing!
Well, you just answered your own question.
That's my thing.
I find the worst photos of people, tag them for sport and then release them back into the wild.
Well, quit it.
I can't spend half my day untagging myself in stupid pictures!
Yet, you leave up all the ones of you making that duck face.
Duck face is my go-to!
I don't think you know how bad that actually makes you look.
That's not duck face.
This is.
Sorry, Stephanie, you just don't have the bone structure.
- Oh, hey, Gordon, make yourself comfortable.
- Ok!
You know, Gordon, I think you misunderstood me.
When I said,
"Make yourself comfortable", I meant: sit in that chair, listen to me... with pants on.
Oh!
Ok, but you need to be more specific.
I heard from your client, Falafel Zone, today.
They have an assignment for you.
Yeah, now see, they're losing some market share, so they would like you to come up with a concept that they can leverage over multiple platforms becau...
They want you to come up with an idea.
Oh, ok.
Hm...
Oh, I think cheese should have handles.
No, an idea about falafel.
Falafels with handles?
Ha!
I'm sorry, Dave, that's a bit of a non-starter.
Gordon, I really need you to concentrate.
- And no procrastination.
- You know me, Dave,
I don't procrastinate.
I have a process.
- Great!
Gordon...
- Shhh!
Process, Dave.
Process.
Shh...
Hate to ask you this, but...
- would you mind signing my book?
- No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, I don't sign autographs.
I consider my words to be a part of my soul, and I try not to give pieces of my soul away to strangers.
I suppose a lock of your hair is out of the question?
I don't have much hair, so...
- Everywhere?
- What?
Yeah, too far.
Hi.
You must be Harper Thomas.
I'm Stephanie Lyons.
I read your book in college.
It's an honour to meet you.
- Can I get your autograph?
- Uh, those are just the CliffsNotes.
Are you sure you don't just want his initials?
I loved the gist of your story.
(inaudible words)
Harper doesn't do autographs.
- (inaudible whispering)
- Huh.
Harper does do autographs.
Oh!
Ok.
Sign there.
- (indistinct whispering)
- Ok.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
- I will cherish this.
- Hey, Duck Face.
You checked your Facebook page lately?
Nelson, if you don't stop tagging me, I will end you!
- Missed me.
- You...
I know it looks like I do, but I don't care that she threw that.
Can I get another?
Oh, and some more hot water
- for my fellow writer's tea?
- Yeah, because the tip on hot water is huge.
So, where have you been hiding the last 10 years?
Inside my house...
- writing this.
- (Beckett gasps.)
That's the last one, promise.
I wrote a page a week for 10 years.
It's like being the first person to see the Holy Grail.
Yes, it is.
- May I?
- No no no no.
I'm not allowed to let anyone read it until it's released.
- I know.
I only wanted to smell it.
- Nope.
Touch it?
Ok.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Alright, sorry.
Sorry.
I can't wait for your reading.
You know, it sold out in about 10 minutes.
Did you say s... s... sold out?
You have a huge cult following.
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
I've been living in isolation for a decade.
I stopped receiving faxes 8 years ago.
Thank you.
I thought you didn't drink.
And I thought I'd be reading to 5 elderly people on a break from a mall walk!
Excuse me.
Oops!
Oh!
Oh!
Hmm.
Hey, it's fine,
I'll drink it from the tray.

Gordon, what the hell are you doing!
?
I'm looping.
It's part of the process.
And what does this have to do with Falafel Zone?
I think that's pretty clear, Dave.
Nothing.
You know, Gordon, a client comes to us 'cause they need something.
If we don't provide that something that they need, then I may have to take drastic action.
You're not going to quit, are you?
No, I'm not going to quit!
But if you keep this up, I may have to f-f-fire you!
- F-f-fire you!
- Oh, Gordon!
Phat beats, Dave.
Woof, woof!

(laughing hysterically)
- Harper...
- Hey, Bobcat!
Beckett.
Heh, heh!
I miss us, man.
Hey, I have a great idea.
We should fight.
- Oh...
- We should have a fight.
What we got over here?
A little worm?
HEY!
I'm a friend!
Oh, this is fun.
This is great.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, I read your book.
(laughing) My what!
?
You know, that thing you spent the last 10 years of your life writing?
Get out of here, man.
No, look, I'm telling you,
I got the same feeling reading that one as I did the first one.
It's like a sequel that doesn't disappoint.
What?
- Congrats, man.
- I just wasted 10 years of my life writing the same book 2 times!
- What?
- I am a failure... and a hack.
And that book can never be released.
No.
No, no.
I never said that.
When did I say that?
I didn't say that!
Well, you didn't not say that.
Only my best friend... could serve me up truth salad.
Truth salad with croutons of insight.
No, no.
I WANT TO BE ALONE!
Harper...
Oh no, that's not a good idea.
Harper, Harper, wait!
Hold my faxes.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You did not post a Vine of me trying to swallow my vitamins!
Well, it's up for Vine of the day.
I'm gonna make you a star!
A blinking, swallowing star!
- Ugh!
- Face it.
You're just not photogenic.
Yes, I am!
Take a picture of me right now.
Dammit!
What happened to my neck?
You know, Nelson, two can play at this game.
Oh, I don't think so.
See, I have a facial recognition app.
It detects and deletes any unflattering images of me.
It's the same technology that has the world fooled into thinking that George Clooney is still attractive.
Wow!
I know, it's pretty smart, huh?
Also, I had my parents sign waivers, and if they upload anything without my approval, I own their house.
Oh, hi, Dave...
listen, I went to every bar in town... everyone says "hi"...
but I couldn't find him.
Where would he be headed?
I think...
Oh, you want me beheaded.
Is that a Bobcat?
Ha, ha, ha!
Yes, I was just messing with you.
Like I do...
Ok, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Harper?
Are you alright?
- I'm fine, man.
How did you get in here?
And why are you wearing my roommate's robe?
Oh, my God, what did you do to Abby?
- There she is!
- Wait a minute...
Did you guys... ?
I had to.
She is my muse.
- You know me and writers.
- All too well.
Oh!
Tell him about your new book idea.
The new book?
What about the book that took you 10 years to write?
Come on, man, stop worrying!
This guy is always worrying about stuff.
- Because you're such a worrier!
- Alright!
I'm already started!
Do you have any idea how fast you can write when you're too drunk to obsess over every sentence or remember to put in punctuation?
- Yeah.
- It's about a werewolf and a vampire.
They're together, that's the hook.
Boom!
- Do you guys mind if I crash here?
- Yeah, for sure, but can you sleep with Beckett?
You just cuddle way too much.
Looks like we're gonna be bedmates!
But I should warn you:
- I'm a sleep puncher.
- Oh...
- Oh!
Ok.
- AH!
(laughing)
(He snores.)
Oh!
(Harper grunting)
I hurt everywhere.
I can feel my blood scraping trough my veins.
You're not just a good sleep puncher... you're also good at trying to stick my bedside lamp in places it does not belong.
- Yeah, sit down.
- Yeah.
(heavy sigh) Easy.
(He snores.)
How does he do that?
Is he dead?
- No.
- Alright, we'll wheel him into my office and keep him there until it's time for the reading.
He's not going to be reading his second book.
Oh, why not?
Because he wrote... this.
What the hell happened!
?
I thought you idolized this man.
Is there some reason you're trying to murder him and our company's reputation?
Look, Dave, trust me.
I've got this handled, alright?
I'm not gonna let anything happen to Harper.
(Harper groaning) Let's get crêpes.
- Ta!
Ta!
Ta!
Ta!
Shh...
- Oh...
- How's Harper?
- He's sleeping like a little baby.
I held a sleeping baby once.
But then the mall security made me give it back.
(in a low voice):
Get out of here!
Congratulations!
Your duck face has gone viral.
Well... tag, you're it!
Beckett gave me your high school yearbook.
(sigh) Do I look worried?
No?
You should.
Your mustache looks like it has a mullet!
That's the janitor.
A bit racist.
Besides, you can look all you want, you're not going to find anything.
That's the whole reason that I was yearbook editor:
to make sure that this day would never arrive.
Hey!
Could you two keep it down?
Harper is trying to sleep.
He's punching like a little angel.
Great news!
I cured my hangover!
- By getting drunk?
- No!
No, no, no, no, no...
By getting obliterated!
I used this... to finish this.
Harper, you're feeling better?
The best, Dave!
Thanks to your boy here.
Well... give my boy a raise. (laughs)
- Oh and I drank the rest of your liquor.
- Oh, there goes that raise!
- And I'm not releasing my book.
- And why don't you clean out your desk?
Instead, I will be previewing my new-new book at the bar-bar.
Bar...
It's about vampires and wait for it... (He snores.)
werewolves!
I've created a new genre.
If he extends the life of that genre,
I will destroy everything that you hold dear.
Yep, fair enough!
I'd like to give a shout out to all my muses in the audience tonight.
- My sex buddy, Abby.
- That's me!
- My working girl, Stephanie.
- (delighted exclamation)
- And the best PR man in the business, Bobcat.
- It's me.
Tonight, I will be reading from my new book...
The Vampire Who Loved a Werewolf... a Lot.
Chapter one.
(howling)
Chapter two.
"Their coming together was perfect.
He would not be able to go out into the daytime... because he's a vampire... and she preferred it, to make love underneath the full moon."
Harper, you have to stop.
You're making a fool out of yourself.
- Shut up.
Sit down.
- Ok. 10-4.
"And she woke up, because it was all... a dream."
(inaudible words)
Man, what a twist!
So none of that even happened?
(camera click)
Harper, you can't release that.
Come on, you're just jealous because I'm a real writer and you're stuck working in PR.
- I like my job.
- (Harper chuckles.)
Good!
Because you're gonna be stuck doing it for a long time.
Oh, hey, hey, Bobcat!
I have an idea, let's have a fight.
Let's fight each other.
I'm not fighting you.
Ok, cool.
Oh, by the way, I read your book.
Yeah, yeah... it's middling at best.
Alright, well... now, we're saying things we don't mean...
And writing things that aren't good.
Ok, yeah.
You know what?
I see what you're doing, and there's nothing you can say
- that is gonna make me fight you.
- Fight!
Fight!
Fight him!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
- Boys, maybe we should calm down.
We're all friends here.
- Yeah, we're all grown-ups.
Ok, alright, alright, alright.
No fight.
Ok?
- Just play a game instead.
Duck, Duck, Goose!
- (Stephanie gasps.)
- Hey!
- Ah!
What did you do that for?
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
I wasn't...
Sorry.
- No, no, it's my fault, I'm...
- Truce, ok?
- Yeah.
Alright.
"Hey!
My name's Bobcat,
- and I like my job!"
- I kind of like my job.
(Harper laughing mockingly)
I'm the greatest novelist of the 21st century!
(howling)
(telephone ringing)
Gordon, that's Falafel Zone calling.
- I'm not ready.
- They're calling to hear
- your idea, you better be ready.
- I'm not ready!
- You have to be ready, Gordon.
Gordon, just answer the phone.
- I can't.
My mouth is full.
- Answer the phone, Gordon.
- I don't know how!
I am not answering your phone, Gordon.
I am not answering your phone!
I am not answering
- the damn phone!
Alright!
- I'm not answering.
NOOO!
DLPR.
Dave Lyons speaking, for some reason.
Yes, you're calling for Gordon.
Yes, I understand, you want to hear his ideas.
Well, hold on just one second.
- Gordon, take it.
- No!
No!
I got NOTHING!
You better come up with something.
No, it's not my fault!
I kept having to leave every half hour to get a new falafel.
And you keep stifling my process.
- Gordon!
- (Gordon grunts.)
(Gordon sighs.)
It would be so much easier if we could just order them online and have them deliver to your door, like pizza.
Oooh, in pizza boxes!
Did you hear that?
Yes, I think it's a brilliant idea as well.
No, no, you're right.
I am very fortunate to work with such a... talented man.
Alright, thanks very much.
Well, Gordon, twice a year, you prove to me
- I'm right for keeping you here.
- See you in 6 months, Dave.
Alright.
Oh, and Gordon, pants up.
- Oh, come on!
- Now!
- Ah, Harper!
- Alright, look, I'm here.
But if you're gonna try to turn me back into that timid turtle of a man, you can just forget it.
Wouldn't think about it.
We here at DLPR support our clients, even if they want to use their world class talent to turn out
- mass market pulp fiction.
- Ok.
Good, good, good.
Because I'll tell you what.
Getting drunk and writing a book in one day then getting laid sure beats sitting alone in a room for 10 years.
It sure does.
You know, your new book is so different from your first too.
It's so much more...
commercial, which is why you'll be spending the next 2 years of your life doing this!
What the hell is this?
This is your new life.
Shopping malls,
- college campuses, book tours...
- Hmmm, no, no, no book tours.
Oh yeah!
Every night, 1500, 2500-seat venues.
- No, no.
I can't do that.
- Well, that is the life of a guy who writes vampire novels.
Something wrong?
No, I'm good.
Harper...
Hey, you could always see through me, Bobcat.
- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?
That my second book won't live up to my first.
That perhaps I only have one great novel in me.
Well, I know for a fact that you already have two.
And according to you, I don't even have one.
But I'm not giving up, so you shouldn't either.
Thank you.
Look, uh... the comment I made about your book...
- Ah, forget it, I know you didn't mean it.
- Oh, yes, I did.
But, you know, if you have anything else...
- Really?
- Sure.
'Cause it just so happens I've been working on a short story.
It's about a Ukrainian baba who...
It's... it's really more of an outline.
- We can probably expense that.
- Oh, really?
Did you have fun hanging out with Harper Thomas this week?
Yeah, but I like hanging out with you guys better.
Yeah, we're pretty good friends.
Pretty boy, move it or we're leaving without you!
Oh, you're just in a bad mood because you couldn't find a bad picture of me.
Yes, you're right.
There are no bad photos of you in existence.
I looked through Facebook,
Myspace, Tumblr, Instagram,
- YouTube... even tried Linkedln.
- Wow!
You were desperate.
- Hmm.
- Told you.
Hey, by the way, your grandma is really nice.
My grandma?
Previously on Twisted...
- There's been a car accident.
It's Vikram.
- Somebody must've moved the body.
- Jack.
- Why would he do that for me?
He would do it for me.
When you quit working for Vikram, you attacked...
How could you think I'm capable of something like this?
Well, you're capable of moving his body!
When I came to Green Grove, I was coming from juvie.
- Did you know Danny?
- I may know him better than you do.
I did not plan to kill my father.
You killed your dad?
I had another baby.
I thought you should know.
I did know.
Vikram told me.
I know where he kept the adoption papers.
- Do you want to find your child?
- Of course I do.
- Guys, they...
- Suck?
And lie!
- Something wrong?
- You could say that.
- Why did you arrest him?
- Lacey, can you take her home?
I'm not leaving until you tell me what he did.
- And I know what you're doing with Jo.
- Leave me and Jo the hell alone.
I came to Green Grove because Danny made it sound great.
1x18
- Danny, Interrupted [chattering]
They found my Dad's DNA in Danny's dad's car.
They think that my Dad killed him.
Look, I'm sure it's just a big misunderstanding.
I don't know.
I mean, it's DNA.
- Sure, but...
- And I know my Dad really loves Karen.
He always has.
Their affair is what broke up my parents' marriage.
- Oh, I didn't...
I didn't...
- So I don't know, maybe he thought... that was his chance
- to finally...
- Whitney, your dad is not a killer.
That's what I thought.
You don't know him.
You just met him.
Okay, you're right, I...
I may not know your dad, but I do know for sure that he did not kill Vikram.
- How do you know?
- I just do, okay?
- Do you know Vikram Desai?
- Yes.
Have you been sleeping with his wife?
- Yes.
- Whoa whoa whoa.
Hold on, hold on.
I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor, but I have to remind you that you're answering these
- questions against the legal counsel...
- I have nothing to hide.
I'll answer anything he wants.
Good.
How about this?
Did you tamper with Vikram's car?
What?
No.
Did you kill him?
Make it look like an accident?
That's absurd.
Next question.
Have you ever been inside Vikram's car?
I worked for him...
Years ago.
But the car that he was driving when he died?
No, never.
Then why is your DNA all over it?
- That's impossible.
It...
- It's not only possible, it's true.
- So you think...
- I think you killed him, murdered him for the money...
and a chance to be with his wife.
- What do you think?
- I think I'm gonna stop talking now.
[sighs] Whitney, my god.
Listen, what they're saying about your father, it's not true.
- It's impossible.
- Yeah, that's what I keep hearing.
- Uh, I want to see Jack.
- Sorry, the chief's in with him now.
And when he's done, he wants to talk to you.
[sighs] Danny, why don't you take Lacey and Whitney home, okay?
- Whitney:
I don't think I...
- Karen:
You're staying with us.
- I'll make sure it's okay.
- No, I mean I'm not leaving my Dad.
Honey, I've been through this.
They're not gonna let you see him anytime soon.
Danny:
It's true.
There's nothing else you can do right now except for try to get some rest.
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.
You know, Whitney, Danny's right.
We should probably go.
[sighs] Okay, whatever.
I'm telling you, we're gonna figure this out, okay?
Yeah, we'd better.
[theme music playing]
- Thank you for letting me stay with you.
- Uh, of course, no worries.
I just gotta take a shower.
Maybe I can borrow some sweats?
- Sure, yeah, it's all upstairs.
- Thank you.
Oh, hey, Whitney, I think I'm gonna take off
- if you're okay.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm just my Mom's probably worried.
It's so late.
- Of course, I'm sorry.
- No, please. "Sorry"?
Lacey, you're been... amazing.
Thank you so much.
- I'll call you in the morning, okay?
- Great.
Come here.
Look, I didn't say anything, because...
- Well, I don't know.
Maybe I should have.
- Lacey, no, look...
You need to do something.
You can't let Whitney's dad take the blame for this.
I know, okay?
No one understands that better than I do.
I got my Mom to call the best lawyer in New York.
She's on her way now...
[sighs] so just don't worry.
[breathes deeply]
It's late.
I should get out of here.
Oh my god, I can't believe I fell asleep.
[both laugh] This is so embarrassing.
No, it's so not.
I'm glad you felt comfortable enough to sleep.
Clearly so did I. [lock clicks] [both gasp]
- Mom.
- Hey, Ms. Masterson.
Nothing happened.
We were just...
[door closes]
Where's your father?
Isn't he home yet?
We wouldn't be... well, because of...
- I don't know where he is.
- I spoke to him hours ago.
I thought he'd be home by now.
It's been a crazy night.
- Why?
What happened?
- Jack Taylor was arrested for killing Vikram, so I need to go call your dad.
- Jack...
Jack Taylor?
Isn't that...
- Yeah, you should go.
No, I can stay.
Let me help you.
Please, I just...
I just need to talk to Danny.
All right.
[door opens, closes]
Is Jack all right?
Did he admit to anything?
You know I can't talk about that with you.
All right, well, I'm gonna go home and then...
Actually, I have a couple of questions to ask you if you don't mind.
Please.
- [sighs] Kyle.
- Have a seat.
[clears throat] [door closes] [sighs] [exhales sharply]
I know you two were having an affair.
Technically, it's not an affair.
My husband's dead.
But it started before he died, right?
[scoffs] Jack and I were together years ago,
- but it ended.
- Why?
'Cause he realized you were never gonna leave Vikram?
- Are you interrogating me?
- Just asking some questions.
- If you need to call a lawyer...
- [laughs] No, I'm fine.
Did you ever tell Jack about that life insurance policy?
$10 million?
Yes, but not until the night they found Vikram's body.
And Jack was with me the whole night, so...
The time of death was about 48 hours earlier.
The car had been in that gully for a while.
It's a pretty remote spot.
But Jack didn't know about the money then.
He used to work for Vikram, right?
I mena, maybe Vikram told him about the policy or he found out some other way, don't you think?
I guess it's... possible.
Do you think Jack is capable of murder?
Karen, do you have any reason to believe that Jack wanted Vikram dead?
I didn't think so, but...
I don't know.
I just don't know.
How good is this lawyer?
'cause I'm not letting an innocent man go to jail for something that I did.
Well, he's not exactly innocent.
He's the one who staged the accident.
- As a favor to me, to us.
- Well, maybe.
Maybe Jack knew about the life insurance policy before I even mentioned it.
[fridge door opens, closes]
Maybe he wanted them to find your dad's body so that we could claim the money.
Wait, what are you talking about?
- You're the one who said he was this nice guy...
- I know.
Vikram told Tess that his life was in danger, and he disappeared after Jack went to see him.
- They had a big fight, so...
- So what, you think Jack tried to kill him six months ago?
I mean, what does that matter now?
I'm just saying maybe Jack isn't such a saint after all.
Whatever he did, whatever his motives,
I'm the one who killed my Dad.
[sighs] And right now, that is all that matters.
[knocks on door]
[door opens] Karen:
Oh my god, what are you doing here?
[door closes] Jo:
I need to talk to Danny.
- Fine, but...
- It's okay.
I got it.
Thanks.
[sighs]
- Come on.
- Danny.
Danny.
Look, either Jack's about to tell my Dad everything or...
No, if he was gonna say anything, he would've done it by now.
So he's just gonna cover for you?
He's gonna go to prison for a murder he didn't commit?
You can't let him do that, Danny.
- We can't let him do that.
- I know that.
I'm handling it.
Right now, I'm more worried about Charlie.
Of course you are.
You know what?
You said you wanted some space, Jo,
- so take some space.
- Danny, seriously,
- just tell me what you're gonna do.
- No.
I'm on it.
Good night.
[door opens, closes] [clicks]
[music]
Okay.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you so much.
I'll see you then.
- Who was that?
- My daughter's mother.
- I mean, her adoptive...
- You're kidding.
[sighs] I saw her last night.
She's beautiful.
You were right.
It...
it was too late to knock, so I...
I just left a note...
for the mother.
And now she wants to meet, even said she'd come to Green Grove.
- Today?
- Yeah.
She's not gonna bring her daughter... not yet, anyway.
But...
I think it's a really great first step.
Sorry I can't be there.
I've got a huge day.
- Yeah, of... of course.
- Tess.
This is... [sighs]
I'm happy for you, but I still just... [sighs] I'm doing the best I can.
I know, I know.
I appreciate it.
I'll be fine.
[sighs] But I think it's time to tell Jo.
Come on!
What is this big conspiracy that my Dad's caught in the middle of?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please, it's all three of you...
you, Danny, Karen.
- If my Dad really is innocent...
- Look, Whitney,
- Danny hired a great lawyer.
- And what if that doesn't work?
I've only just now gotten this chance to spend time with my Dad again, and he's already slipping away.
No, that won't happen.
Danny won't let it.
Right.
Danny.
[scoffs] I thought you and I had made a connection.
We did, and it means a lot to me.
I just... it's...
[knocks rapidly]
Kyle:
Police!
Open the door, we have a warrant!
What now?
[sighs]
- I just came to get some of my stuff.
- Drop what you're taking.
It's evidence.
You girls need to leave right now.
Man:
Don't forget to check for fingerprints on any surface.
Man #2:
Yo, come over here.
So I have a sister?
I mean half, but...
Yeah.
You do.
I know.
It's a lot to take in.
Why didn't you tell me any of this before?
I wanted to, but, uh...
I kept it from your dad for so long...
I was afraid I would lose him.
And then one lie led to another and... suddenly it felt impossible to ever come clean.
Yeah.
Well, I don't want you to have to go through this alone, so...
If it's okay, I would really like to be here...
- to learn more about her.
- Of course it's okay.
[chuckles]
And, honey, if... if you ever wanna talk about...
- What?
- I don't know...
- Charlie, you, the couch.
- Nothing happened.
Honestly, that's the furthest thing from my mind right now.
[people chattering]
I couldn't get any of my stuff, because the cops came and they raided the boathouse.
Honey, I know.
Let's just get through this hearing and then you can go home with your father and get whatever you need.
Well, I'm glad you're so confident.
- Why are you?
- The truth is, I'm not.
I don't know what your father's capable of.
But we both know he can be very... protective of the people he loves.
So who is he protecting now?
You?
Danny?
Look, don't worry, okay?
- Just gotta keep faith and...
- Woman:
Okay, guys,
We're in good shape.
Yes, there's DNA, but that only proves that Jack was in Vikram's car at some point.
And yes, Jack's denied that, but I can find a workaround.
There's nothing other than the chief's cockamamie theory about an unrolled window that indicates foul play.
- So that's good, right?
- Yes.
Yeah, that's very good.
Hey, Karen, would you mind looking after Whitney a little bit longer?
I can call child protective services, but...
No, I'm fine.
Jack's gonna be out on bail, so...
Maybe not.
[scoffs] What are you saying?
And... what is that?
Look, you can tell us now or in 30 seconds in front of the judge, but you need to disclose that evidence.
We found Vikram's cellphone in the boathouse.
It's cracked and covered in dried blood.
Must've had it on him when he died.
How did that get in the boathouse?
That's what I'm hoping your father can tell me.
Excuse me.
Let's go inside.
We'll sort it out.
[whispers] How could Jack be so stupid to keep Vikram's cellphone?
That's just it... he's not.
- Well, clearly he is.
- No.
No.
Something about this doesn't seem right.
What are you saying?
I think somebody planted it there to frame him.
Who would do that?
I have a pretty good idea.
I'm so sorry.
If you saw us last night, then I understand the confusion, but that isn't your daughter.
[scoffs] But I have your name,
- your address.
- Yes, we adopted a baby, your baby.
We named her Samantha.
But... she died when she was only two years old.
What?
It was an accident at the playground.
She fell off the slide and hit her head.
[crying] I wanted to reach out to you then, but it was a closed adoption, so I had no way of finding out who you were.
Mom.
So, she's just...
gone?
I brought you some photos.
I wanted you to see how happy Sam was, just an absolute joy...
A real... gift to our lives.
Woman:
In the wake of new, incriminating evidence,
Jack Taylor has been denied bail.
He's expected to be arraigned on a murder one charge for the death of Vikram Desai.
[cameras clicking] Man:
Mr. Taylor
- Dad.
- Whitney.
- Dad.
- Whitney, come here.
Come on, guys, this is my daughter.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing, nothing.
- Where are you staying?
- At the Desais'.
- Find another place to stay.
- Why?
I mean, what do I tell them?
Tell them they broke my heart.
- It's that bad?
- Just tell them.
[reporters shouting]
This is so messed up.
I just want to tell wendy the truth, that whatever her father did, it wasn't murder.
Yeah, I...
I think it's even more messed up than that, actually.
I don't think...
I don't think that Jack is the one who moved the body.
- But there's DNA, the phone.
- Yeah.
That means the person who's framing him is doing a really good job.
- Framing him?
Who would... who would...
- Charlie.
- This again?
- It's like when we were in juvie.
He covered for me when I got into this fight.
He said that he beat up this kid, but really I did.
At first I thought that...
I thought that he was helping me, but...
I just think that he was really helping himself.
- How?
- People started looking up to him, they were scared of him, and I felt like I owed him, so I did whatever he wanted.
He's good at that.
He's good at twisting people like that.
So what's he trying to get now?
- Hmm?
- I don't know.
I just...
I think... it might be crazy, but I think he wants my life.
- Look, Danny...
- He stole this photo of the three of us, and then he comes... then he comes here to my town?
It's like he's obsessed.
Hmm.
Look, it's a long way from stealing a photo and the girl you clearly like
- to wanting your life.
- Yeah, you don't know... you don't know Charlie the way that I do, okay?
And he's the only person who makes sense.
- 'Cause he's the one that's obsessed.
- Okay, I'm moving out.
- What?
Why?
- Because my Dad just told me to.
Wh... why would he say that?
I just got him this lawyer, I'm doing everything I can...
I don't know, Danny.
There's obviously something going on that you guys aren't telling me.
What... what did he say exactly, Whitney?
He said that you and Karen broke his heart.
He's a mess, Danny.
- Can I stay with you?
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.
- Let's get out of here.
- Kyle:
She looks just like you.
- Jo:
Right?
I mean even more than me, 'cause I clearly got the Masterson chin.
Samantha.
I always thought I would've named her Catherine.
At least now I won't always be wondering.
Now we can both move on.
[door closes]
How long have you been standing there?
Sorry, I didn't want to interrupt.
Things looked a little...
Yeah, it's been intense.
I gained and lost a sister in less than 12 hours.
So...
- That is intense.
- I don't think it's really sunk in yet.
Also, I think I'm avoiding everything with Jack and...
Danny says he has a plan, though.
- What is it?
- He wouldn't tell me.
- But you trust him?
- I mean, the worst that he can do is tell the truth and... and maybe that's not such a bad thing.
No, Jo, I can't just let you throw your life away.
I can't let Jack take the blame for something that I did.
- Yo, you didn't do anything.
- You don't know what it's like, carrying this secret, lying to my parents.
Yes.
I do.
I know how hard that must be, but that's nothing compared to what your life is going to be like.
It's not about me.
It's about doing what's right.
It's Danny's... he's dragging you into all this.
He's the one that killed Vikram, not you.
Look, your mom just lost a daughter.
She can't lose you, too.
[lock buzzes] [door opens] [people chattering] [cuffs clicking]
[sighs deeply]
I think I know who's framing you.
And I think he's doing it to get to me.
Danny, what are you talking about?
[sighs] Charlie.
- Who's Charlie?
- He's this guy I went to juvie with.
We were friends, but then...
Maybe he staged the car accident because he thought that he was helping me, but I think that he's doing that so he can have something on me.
And now he's cashing that chip in.
By pinning it on me?
No.
He knows I'm not gonna let that happen.
He's trying... he's trying to force my hand, get me to confess.
Danny, why would he want you to do that?
To get rid of me so he can... he can have my life,
I mean, he already has Jo.
Jo?
Always about a girl, huh?
[chuckles] [scoffs] Amazing what we do for the women we love.
Is that why you didn't say anything?
Because you love my Mom?
At first, I didn't know anything.
Then I thought about what she said, moving a body to protect you.
- Figured it out.
- I have $10 million, and I will spend every penny of it trying to get you out of here if that's what it takes.
I don't think money is all it's gonna take, Danny.
[sighs]
Lacey:
Listen, Whitney, I'm really sorry about everything that's happening with your dad,
And I'm even more sorry that I can't tell you everything.
- It's just...
- It's okay.
I don't know why, but I still feel like I can trust you.
You can.
I really care about you, Whitney.
[motor whirring]
So are we ever gonna talk about the kiss or...
I mean, clearly you've been thinking about it.
You're doing everything you can to keep me off of your bed.
N-no.
I use this for all of my sleepovers.
I have a lot of sleepovers and this is what I use.
[laughing] I'm not trying to...
Seriously!
And also, out of respect...
I'm a sprawler, so I thought you'd be more comfortable on this.
- This is a nice air mattress.
- Yeah, sure, Lace.
That's... that's it.
Gah.
Okay, fine,
I've been thinking about it a lot, and the truth is...
- I'm really confused.
- Because...?
I kinda liked it.
- Hmm.
- A lot more than I thought I would, actually.
Does that mean I'm a lesbian?
[chuckles]
'Cause I've always been into guys, and I just recently found out that my Dad's gay,
- So actually...
- Your daddy's gay?
That is so chic.
But I hate it when people put labels on things.
- Oh, so you're... so you're not...
- Oh, definitely a lesbian.
For me, it's always and only been girls.
- Oh.
- Look, what happened between us was... a moment.
A really great moment.
But if you're confused, you should take your time figuring that out.
And I'll give you all the space you need.
- [sighs] Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.
So, good night.
[both laugh]
Good night.
[sighs]
Just F.Y.I. though... if you wake up in the middle of the night feeling any less confused, I'll be down here.
[neighs]
What is this?
I need to call the police, Desai?
Your door was open.
Look, I know...
I know things kind of got out of control...
- but we used to be pretty good friends.
- Yeah, I know.
I was there.
And I gotta believe that somewhere deep down inside that this good person still exists.
"Deep down inside"?
Gee, thanks.
Come on, you don't want to send an innocent man to prison.
I assume you're talking about Jack.
As far as going down for murder, that's on you.
And you too.
You're the one framing him.
[scoffs] Man, you must really think a lot of me.
I mean, to what... get Jack's DNA, plant it in your father's car, load a dead body into it, all before staging a car accident?
Yeah, and then plant my Dad's cellphone at the boathouse, which puts pressure on Jack, which put pressure on me.
- Dude, that's crazy.
- Admit it... you want me to confess!
If I wanted to, I could just turn you in.
Then you wouldn't look so good in front of Jo, which is the point, right?
You've really thought this through, huh?
If we can start talking about the truth, then I can start figuring out what to do about it.
I would love to help you out, Danny, 'cause I am a good person deep down inside.
And I know that you're in a tight spot and everything... [clattering]
Don't lie to me!
Screw you.
You're just pissed because I saw something in Jo that you never saw, something you missed for years.
- What are you talking about?
- What is it you called her?
A shy little puppy dog?
[laughing]
Did you read my journal?
- Did you read my journal?
!
- No, I just...
- Forget it.
You need help, man.
- Yeah, well, so do you.
[door opens, closes]
Hey, Whitney.
I'm sorry about your dad.
- You okay?
- Great, if you like being totally in the dark.
- Yeah, that's...
- Sucks, but even my Dad seems to want it that way, so...
On the bright side, Lacey's been amazing.
- I'm lucky to have her.
- Yeah, Lacey's great.
Tell you what:
I'm gonna go use the little girls'.
You guys chat.
[whispering] Jo, have you talked to Danny?
- What are you guys gonna do?
- I don't know.
He shut me out.
Yeah, because he's convinced that he can nail Charlie.
- For what?
- For... for moving the body
- and now for framing Jack.
- That's ridiculous.
I don't even understand.
Charlie could never do that.
Jo, I don't know.
Danny's a little off the rails right now.
This is ridiculous.
I thought he had a plan.
He's just making everything worse.
Danny, we need to talk.
Call me back.
[buzzes] [muttering] That's what it is.
- What are you doing?
- Uh, I have to...
I have to write all this down so it's documented
- in case I don't get a chance to.
- To what?
It's all Charlie.
I can't let him get away with it.
I have to make sure that Jo is safe.
- What makes you think that Charlie...
- It's not...
It is not just Jo.
It-it...
it's Lacey, too.
He started with Lacey.
It's all...
- It's all three of us.
- What are you talking about?
[sighs]
I made a promise to Jack,
- and that lawyer is not gonna...
- Hold on.
That lawyer is working on it.
And the only way to save Jack is by turning yourself in, so...
I'm not letting Jack go to jail, because he loves you, Mom.
It's his decision.
He's a grown man.
He's not an innocent child.
Well, neither am I!
[papers rustle]
Please don't do this to me.
I'll be all alone.
You... how can you say these things?
You love him, right?
You love Jack.
I love you more.
And if Jack needs to go to jail to save you,
- so be it.
- That is sick, okay?
That is a man's life, and I'm done with this.
- Please, I'm begging you!
- No!
[door opens]
Hey.
So...
I don't know how well garlic bread holds up, but...
- Sorry, I just...
- What's wrong?
There's something I have to...
I'll be back.
[people chattering]
- You have a good night.
- You too.
- Dr. Berger!
- Desai?
[car door shuts]
What the hell are you doing here?
[clicks, ringing]
This is Jo.
Leave a message.
[beeps]
Hey, Jo, it's... it's me.
I know you got a lot going on, but...
Danny was here and he has these... these crazy ideas...
and... he beat me up... pretty bad... and...
I'm in a lot of pain.
I was wondering if maybe you could come over.
So hopefully I'll...
see you soon.
Okay.
[beeps, clatters]
[sighs]
[groans]
Just come inside.
We can sit, get warm,
- talk about whatever you want to.
- No no, sorry.
There's no time.
I have some questions about... about Charlie.
He moved to my town right after he got out.
- Charlie McBride?
- Look, I need you to tell me anything you know about Charlie.
Danny, you know I can't do that.
I am bound by rules of confidentiality,
- and if...
- Okay, fine fine!
Just... [sighs]
I think that Charlie's dangerous.
Okay?
And I want to make sure that I'm right before I...
Before you what, Danny?
Everybody's saying that I'm crazy, and I feel like I'm losing it.
And I gotta know.
Am I?
[sighs] You're not crazy, Danny.
You were never crazy.
You know that.
So Charlie's...?
Has a past, like all you boys do, but... there's more to him you don't know.
None of it's good.
- Then I know what I need to do.
- Danny.
Danny, wait.
I... [engine starts, revs] I can get in touch with his parole officer!
[tires screech] [doorbell chimes]
- Hi.
- Hi, uh...
I'm sorry, but... this bracelet around Samantha's ankle.
- The hospital tag?
- Did she get sick right after she was born?
Is that why she was there?
No, I mean, she was born in the hospital.
[stammers]
I...
I don't understand.
I picked her up maybe 12 hours afterwards from that medical center over in Trenton.
But my baby wasn't born in the hospital.
We were at a farmhouse upstate.
Oh.
I don't know what you're saying, Tess.
I...
I don't think this is my baby.
[moaning softly] [knocks on door]
Yeah.
Coming.
[sighs]
- Oh my god.
- Yeah.
Danny kinda lost it.
Look, Jo, I think it's time to do something.
I mean, you said yourself Jack can't sit and rot in a jail.
I think that you should go to your dad, tell him what Danny did and leave yourself out of it.
- How could I do that?
- Look, just say that Danny was by himself, that he told you that he killed Vikram.
Danny'll back you up on it.
He... he loves you.
I don't think that...
And anyway, without anyone there
- to prove it was self-defense...
- I know.
I understand that you care about Danny...
- I care about telling the truth.
- Screw the truth!
Look at my face!
Look, I'm sorry.
I just...
Look, I don't wanna lose you, okay?
I mean, I just...
I just got you.
I've been dreaming about this moment forever,
I mean, since before we even met, and...
What are you talking about?
[sighs]
When I was in juvie, I saw Danny's pictures of you.
And...
Jo, you have to understand that everything that I have done... everything...
- has been for you.
- What have you done?
- Okay, let me...
let me...
let me...
- What have you done, Charlie?
Let me just explain, okay?
Look, what...
- When I saw what happened at the ravine...
- What do you mean,
- "when you saw what happened"?
- ...
I knew that I had to do something.
- And I was just trying to help Danny, okay?
- Oh my god, I have to go.
Wait!
Jo, just wait, okay?
- Please!
- Let me go!
[yells] [door closes] [knocks]
Hey, is Jo here?
No, she's out with Charlie, I think.
Why?
Chief Masterson, you've got the wrong guy.
Jack didn't kill my father.
I did.
My dad and I, we got into a fight by the ravine near the old post church and he tried to kill me, so I hit him with a piece of wood.
You have to stop talking right now.
I'm taking you in.
- We're gonna do this by the book.
- I know we will.
Turn around.
[handcuffs clicking]
What's happening?
Danny confessed to killing his father.
I don't know where you are or what happened between you and Charlie, I think you're right about him.
I can't do this anymore, Danny.
I have to confess.
[police radio chatter]
Hey, um... maybe you should sleep up here.
Are you sure?
I mean, I'm all about the cozy, but if you're really a sprawler,
- Just get up here.
- I don't wanna...
Okay.
I'm so sorry.
- You're not feeling it, huh?
- I don't think so.
Do you want to try it again?
[laughs] Just to be sure?
You know, the truth is I'm...
I'm kissing you but I'm still thinking about Danny.
Ouch.
- Whitney, I...
- For you, I mean.
That's... [sighs]
Whitney, I really like you.
[sighs]
I had such a good time the other night, but I...
It's okay.
I've been turned down before.
Actually, not really, ever, but... [laughs] ...I guess there's a first time for everything, right?
- Ice cream?
- Definitely.
So all through Regina, the accusations of an entire town, all of it, you kept this huge secret that you didn't kill your aunt?
Yes sir, that's exactly what I did.
- Danny, this is...
- I know.
It is.
Does anyone else know about this?
- Jo, Lacey, your mother?
- No sir.
- None of them know anything.
- And there's a problem with your story.
Your father's body wasn't found anywhere near that ravine.
It was found 10 miles away in a wrecked car.
[clears throat] I know that.
- Did you move the body?
- No sir.
- Try to cover it up?
- No sir.
But I know who did.
- All right, who?
- Charlie McBride.
- The kid that's dating Jo?
- Yes sir.
- Why would he do that?
- Because he wanted to have something on me.
We were in juvie together.
After he got out, he came here, 'cause he wants my life.
And that includes Jo.
[keys jingle]
Mom.
- What's wrong?
- Danny was here.
He confessed to killing his father.
Do you think that's true?
I know it is, because I was there.
I was with him.
Previously on Twisted...
- There's been a car accident.
It's Vikram.
- Somebody must've moved the body.
- Jack.
- Why would he do that for me?
He would do it for me.
When you quit working for Vikram, you attacked...
How could you think I'm capable of something like this?
Well, you're capable of moving his body!
When I came to Green Grove, I was coming from juvie.
- Did you know Danny?
- I may know him better than you do.
I did not plan to kill my father.
You killed your dad?
I had another baby.
I thought you should know.
I did know.
Vikram told me.
I know where he kept the adoption papers.
- Do you want to find your child?
- Of course I do.
- Guys, they...
- Suck?
And lie!
- Something wrong?
- You could say that.
- Why did you arrest him?
- Lacey, can you take her home?
I'm not leaving until you tell me what he did.
- And I know what you're doing with Jo.
- Leave me and Jo the hell alone.
I came to Green Grove because Danny made it sound great.
1x18
- Danny, Interrupted [chattering]
They found my Dad's DNA in Danny's dad's car.
They think that my Dad killed him.
Look, I'm sure it's just a big misunderstanding.
I don't know.
I mean, it's DNA.
- Sure, but...
- And I know my Dad really loves Karen.
He always has.
Their affair is what broke up my parents' marriage.
- Oh, I didn't...
I didn't...
- So I don't know, maybe he thought... that was his chance
- to finally...
- Whitney, your dad is not a killer.
That's what I thought.
You don't know him.
You just met him.
Okay, you're right, I...
I may not know your dad, but I do know for sure that he did not kill Vikram.
- How do you know?
- I just do, okay?
- Do you know Vikram Desai?
- Yes.
Have you been sleeping with his wife?
- Yes.
- Whoa whoa whoa.
Hold on, hold on.
I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor, but I have to remind you that you're answering these
- questions against the legal counsel...
- I have nothing to hide.
I'll answer anything he wants.
Good.
How about this?
Did you tamper with Vikram's car?
What?
No.
Did you kill him?
Make it look like an accident?
That's absurd.
Next question.
Have you ever been inside Vikram's car?
I worked for him...
Years ago.
But the car that he was driving when he died?
No, never.
Then why is your DNA all over it?
- That's impossible.
It...
- It's not only possible, it's true.
- So you think...
- I think you killed him, murdered him for the money...
and a chance to be with his wife.
- What do you think?
- I think I'm gonna stop talking now.
[sighs] Whitney, my god.
Listen, what they're saying about your father, it's not true.
- It's impossible.
- Yeah, that's what I keep hearing.
- Uh, I want to see Jack.
- Sorry, the chief's in with him now.
And when he's done, he wants to talk to you.
[sighs] Danny, why don't you take Lacey and Whitney home, okay?
- Whitney:
I don't think I...
- Karen:
You're staying with us.
- I'll make sure it's okay.
- No, I mean I'm not leaving my Dad.
Honey, I've been through this.
They're not gonna let you see him anytime soon.
Danny:
It's true.
There's nothing else you can do right now except for try to get some rest.
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.
You know, Whitney, Danny's right.
We should probably go.
[sighs] Okay, whatever.
I'm telling you, we're gonna figure this out, okay?
Yeah, we'd better.
[theme music playing]
- Thank you for letting me stay with you.
- Uh, of course, no worries.
I just gotta take a shower.
Maybe I can borrow some sweats?
- Sure, yeah, it's all upstairs.
- Thank you.
Oh, hey, Whitney, I think I'm gonna take off
- if you're okay.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm just my Mom's probably worried.
It's so late.
- Of course, I'm sorry.
- No, please. "Sorry"?
Lacey, you're been... amazing.
Thank you so much.
- I'll call you in the morning, okay?
- Great.
Come here.
Look, I didn't say anything, because...
- Well, I don't know.
Maybe I should have.
- Lacey, no, look...
You need to do something.
You can't let Whitney's dad take the blame for this.
I know, okay?
No one understands that better than I do.
I got my Mom to call the best lawyer in New York.
She's on her way now...
[sighs] so just don't worry.
[breathes deeply]
It's late.
I should get out of here.
Oh my god, I can't believe I fell asleep.
[both laugh] This is so embarrassing.
No, it's so not.
I'm glad you felt comfortable enough to sleep.
Clearly so did I. [lock clicks] [both gasp]
- Mom.
- Hey, Ms. Masterson.
Nothing happened.
We were just...
[door closes]
Where's your father?
Isn't he home yet?
We wouldn't be... well, because of...
- I don't know where he is.
- I spoke to him hours ago.
I thought he'd be home by now.
It's been a crazy night.
- Why?
What happened?
- Jack Taylor was arrested for killing Vikram, so I need to go call your dad.
- Jack...
Jack Taylor?
Isn't that...
- Yeah, you should go.
No, I can stay.
Let me help you.
Please, I just...
I just need to talk to Danny.
All right.
[door opens, closes]
Is Jack all right?
Did he admit to anything?
You know I can't talk about that with you.
All right, well, I'm gonna go home and then...
Actually, I have a couple of questions to ask you if you don't mind.
Please.
- [sighs] Kyle.
- Have a seat.
[clears throat] [door closes] [sighs] [exhales sharply]
I know you two were having an affair.
Technically, it's not an affair.
My husband's dead.
But it started before he died, right?
[scoffs] Jack and I were together years ago,
- but it ended.
- Why?
'Cause he realized you were never gonna leave Vikram?
- Are you interrogating me?
- Just asking some questions.
- If you need to call a lawyer...
- [laughs] No, I'm fine.
Did you ever tell Jack about that life insurance policy?
$10 million?
Yes, but not until the night they found Vikram's body.
And Jack was with me the whole night, so...
The time of death was about 48 hours earlier.
The car had been in that gully for a while.
It's a pretty remote spot.
But Jack didn't know about the money then.
He used to work for Vikram, right?
I mena, maybe Vikram told him about the policy or he found out some other way, don't you think?
I guess it's... possible.
Do you think Jack is capable of murder?
Karen, do you have any reason to believe that Jack wanted Vikram dead?
I didn't think so, but...
I don't know.
I just don't know.
How good is this lawyer?
'cause I'm not letting an innocent man go to jail for something that I did.
Well, he's not exactly innocent.
He's the one who staged the accident.
- As a favor to me, to us.
- Well, maybe.
Maybe Jack knew about the life insurance policy before I even mentioned it.
[fridge door opens, closes]
Maybe he wanted them to find your dad's body so that we could claim the money.
Wait, what are you talking about?
- You're the one who said he was this nice guy...
- I know.
Vikram told Tess that his life was in danger, and he disappeared after Jack went to see him.
- They had a big fight, so...
- So what, you think Jack tried to kill him six months ago?
I mean, what does that matter now?
I'm just saying maybe Jack isn't such a saint after all.
Whatever he did, whatever his motives,
I'm the one who killed my Dad.
[sighs] And right now, that is all that matters.
[knocks on door]
[door opens] Karen:
Oh my god, what are you doing here?
[door closes] Jo:
I need to talk to Danny.
- Fine, but...
- It's okay.
I got it.
Thanks.
[sighs]
- Come on.
- Danny.
Danny.
Look, either Jack's about to tell my Dad everything or...
No, if he was gonna say anything, he would've done it by now.
So he's just gonna cover for you?
He's gonna go to prison for a murder he didn't commit?
You can't let him do that, Danny.
- We can't let him do that.
- I know that.
I'm handling it.
Right now, I'm more worried about Charlie.
Of course you are.
You know what?
You said you wanted some space, Jo,
- so take some space.
- Danny, seriously,
- just tell me what you're gonna do.
- No.
I'm on it.
Good night.
[door opens, closes] [clicks]
[music]
Okay.
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you so much.
I'll see you then.
- Who was that?
- My daughter's mother.
- I mean, her adoptive...
- You're kidding.
[sighs] I saw her last night.
She's beautiful.
You were right.
It...
it was too late to knock, so I...
I just left a note...
for the mother.
And now she wants to meet, even said she'd come to Green Grove.
- Today?
- Yeah.
She's not gonna bring her daughter... not yet, anyway.
But...
I think it's a really great first step.
Sorry I can't be there.
I've got a huge day.
- Yeah, of... of course.
- Tess.
This is... [sighs]
I'm happy for you, but I still just... [sighs] I'm doing the best I can.
I know, I know.
I appreciate it.
I'll be fine.
[sighs] But I think it's time to tell Jo.
Come on!
What is this big conspiracy that my Dad's caught in the middle of?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please, it's all three of you...
you, Danny, Karen.
- If my Dad really is innocent...
- Look, Whitney,
- Danny hired a great lawyer.
- And what if that doesn't work?
I've only just now gotten this chance to spend time with my Dad again, and he's already slipping away.
No, that won't happen.
Danny won't let it.
Right.
Danny.
[scoffs] I thought you and I had made a connection.
We did, and it means a lot to me.
I just... it's...
[knocks rapidly]
Kyle:
Police!
Open the door, we have a warrant!
What now?
[sighs]
- I just came to get some of my stuff.
- Drop what you're taking.
It's evidence.
You girls need to leave right now.
Man:
Don't forget to check for fingerprints on any surface.
Man #2:
Yo, come over here.
So I have a sister?
I mean half, but...
Yeah.
You do.
I know.
It's a lot to take in.
Why didn't you tell me any of this before?
I wanted to, but, uh...
I kept it from your dad for so long...
I was afraid I would lose him.
And then one lie led to another and... suddenly it felt impossible to ever come clean.
Yeah.
Well, I don't want you to have to go through this alone, so...
If it's okay, I would really like to be here...
- to learn more about her.
- Of course it's okay.
[chuckles]
And, honey, if... if you ever wanna talk about...
- What?
- I don't know...
- Charlie, you, the couch.
- Nothing happened.
Honestly, that's the furthest thing from my mind right now.
[people chattering]
I couldn't get any of my stuff, because the cops came and they raided the boathouse.
Honey, I know.
Let's just get through this hearing and then you can go home with your father and get whatever you need.
Well, I'm glad you're so confident.
- Why are you?
- The truth is, I'm not.
I don't know what your father's capable of.
But we both know he can be very... protective of the people he loves.
So who is he protecting now?
You?
Danny?
Look, don't worry, okay?
- Just gotta keep faith and...
- Woman:
Okay, guys,
We're in good shape.
Yes, there's DNA, but that only proves that Jack was in Vikram's car at some point.
And yes, Jack's denied that, but I can find a workaround.
There's nothing other than the chief's cockamamie theory about an unrolled window that indicates foul play.
- So that's good, right?
- Yes.
Yeah, that's very good.
Hey, Karen, would you mind looking after Whitney a little bit longer?
I can call child protective services, but...
No, I'm fine.
Jack's gonna be out on bail, so...
Maybe not.
[scoffs] What are you saying?
And... what is that?
Look, you can tell us now or in 30 seconds in front of the judge, but you need to disclose that evidence.
We found Vikram's cellphone in the boathouse.
It's cracked and covered in dried blood.
Must've had it on him when he died.
How did that get in the boathouse?
That's what I'm hoping your father can tell me.
Excuse me.
Let's go inside.
We'll sort it out.
[whispers] How could Jack be so stupid to keep Vikram's cellphone?
That's just it... he's not.
- Well, clearly he is.
- No.
No.
Something about this doesn't seem right.
What are you saying?
I think somebody planted it there to frame him.
Who would do that?
I have a pretty good idea.
I'm so sorry.
If you saw us last night, then I understand the confusion, but that isn't your daughter.
[scoffs] But I have your name,
- your address.
- Yes, we adopted a baby, your baby.
We named her Samantha.
But... she died when she was only two years old.
What?
It was an accident at the playground.
She fell off the slide and hit her head.
[crying] I wanted to reach out to you then, but it was a closed adoption, so I had no way of finding out who you were.
Mom.
So, she's just...
gone?
I brought you some photos.
I wanted you to see how happy Sam was, just an absolute joy...
A real... gift to our lives.
Woman:
In the wake of new, incriminating evidence,
Jack Taylor has been denied bail.
He's expected to be arraigned on a murder one charge for the death of Vikram Desai.
[cameras clicking] Man:
Mr. Taylor
- Dad.
- Whitney.
- Dad.
- Whitney, come here.
Come on, guys, this is my daughter.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing, nothing.
- Where are you staying?
- At the Desais'.
- Find another place to stay.
- Why?
I mean, what do I tell them?
Tell them they broke my heart.
- It's that bad?
- Just tell them.
[reporters shouting]
This is so messed up.
I just want to tell wendy the truth, that whatever her father did, it wasn't murder.
Yeah, I...
I think it's even more messed up than that, actually.
I don't think...
I don't think that Jack is the one who moved the body.
- But there's DNA, the phone.
- Yeah.
That means the person who's framing him is doing a really good job.
- Framing him?
Who would... who would...
- Charlie.
- This again?
- It's like when we were in juvie.
He covered for me when I got into this fight.
He said that he beat up this kid, but really I did.
At first I thought that...
I thought that he was helping me, but...
I just think that he was really helping himself.
- How?
- People started looking up to him, they were scared of him, and I felt like I owed him, so I did whatever he wanted.
He's good at that.
He's good at twisting people like that.
So what's he trying to get now?
- Hmm?
- I don't know.
I just...
I think... it might be crazy, but I think he wants my life.
- Look, Danny...
- He stole this photo of the three of us, and then he comes... then he comes here to my town?
It's like he's obsessed.
Hmm.
Look, it's a long way from stealing a photo and the girl you clearly like
- to wanting your life.
- Yeah, you don't know... you don't know Charlie the way that I do, okay?
And he's the only person who makes sense.
- 'Cause he's the one that's obsessed.
- Okay, I'm moving out.
- What?
Why?
- Because my Dad just told me to.
Wh... why would he say that?
I just got him this lawyer, I'm doing everything I can...
I don't know, Danny.
There's obviously something going on that you guys aren't telling me.
What... what did he say exactly, Whitney?
He said that you and Karen broke his heart.
He's a mess, Danny.
- Can I stay with you?
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.
- Let's get out of here.
- Kyle:
She looks just like you.
- Jo:
Right?
I mean even more than me, 'cause I clearly got the Masterson chin.
Samantha.
I always thought I would've named her Catherine.
At least now I won't always be wondering.
Now we can both move on.
[door closes]
How long have you been standing there?
Sorry, I didn't want to interrupt.
Things looked a little...
Yeah, it's been intense.
I gained and lost a sister in less than 12 hours.
So...
- That is intense.
- I don't think it's really sunk in yet.
Also, I think I'm avoiding everything with Jack and...
Danny says he has a plan, though.
- What is it?
- He wouldn't tell me.
- But you trust him?
- I mean, the worst that he can do is tell the truth and... and maybe that's not such a bad thing.
No, Jo, I can't just let you throw your life away.
I can't let Jack take the blame for something that I did.
- Yo, you didn't do anything.
- You don't know what it's like, carrying this secret, lying to my parents.
Yes.
I do.
I know how hard that must be, but that's nothing compared to what your life is going to be like.
It's not about me.
It's about doing what's right.
It's Danny's... he's dragging you into all this.
He's the one that killed Vikram, not you.
Look, your mom just lost a daughter.
She can't lose you, too.
[lock buzzes] [door opens] [people chattering] [cuffs clicking]
[sighs deeply]
I think I know who's framing you.
And I think he's doing it to get to me.
Danny, what are you talking about?
[sighs] Charlie.
- Who's Charlie?
- He's this guy I went to juvie with.
We were friends, but then...
Maybe he staged the car accident because he thought that he was helping me, but I think that he's doing that so he can have something on me.
And now he's cashing that chip in.
By pinning it on me?
No.
He knows I'm not gonna let that happen.
He's trying... he's trying to force my hand, get me to confess.
Danny, why would he want you to do that?
To get rid of me so he can... he can have my life,
I mean, he already has Jo.
Jo?
Always about a girl, huh?
[chuckles] [scoffs] Amazing what we do for the women we love.
Is that why you didn't say anything?
Because you love my Mom?
At first, I didn't know anything.
Then I thought about what she said, moving a body to protect you.
- Figured it out.
- I have $10 million, and I will spend every penny of it trying to get you out of here if that's what it takes.
I don't think money is all it's gonna take, Danny.
[sighs]
Lacey:
Listen, Whitney, I'm really sorry about everything that's happening with your dad,
And I'm even more sorry that I can't tell you everything.
- It's just...
- It's okay.
I don't know why, but I still feel like I can trust you.
You can.
I really care about you, Whitney.
[motor whirring]
So are we ever gonna talk about the kiss or...
I mean, clearly you've been thinking about it.
You're doing everything you can to keep me off of your bed.
N-no.
I use this for all of my sleepovers.
I have a lot of sleepovers and this is what I use.
[laughing] I'm not trying to...
Seriously!
And also, out of respect...
I'm a sprawler, so I thought you'd be more comfortable on this.
- This is a nice air mattress.
- Yeah, sure, Lace.
That's... that's it.
Gah.
Okay, fine,
I've been thinking about it a lot, and the truth is...
- I'm really confused.
- Because...?
I kinda liked it.
- Hmm.
- A lot more than I thought I would, actually.
Does that mean I'm a lesbian?
[chuckles]
'Cause I've always been into guys, and I just recently found out that my Dad's gay,
- So actually...
- Your daddy's gay?
That is so chic.
But I hate it when people put labels on things.
- Oh, so you're... so you're not...
- Oh, definitely a lesbian.
For me, it's always and only been girls.
- Oh.
- Look, what happened between us was... a moment.
A really great moment.
But if you're confused, you should take your time figuring that out.
And I'll give you all the space you need.
- [sighs] Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.
So, good night.
[both laugh]
Good night.
[sighs]
Just F.Y.I. though... if you wake up in the middle of the night feeling any less confused, I'll be down here.
[neighs]
What is this?
I need to call the police, Desai?
Your door was open.
Look, I know...
I know things kind of got out of control...
- but we used to be pretty good friends.
- Yeah, I know.
I was there.
And I gotta believe that somewhere deep down inside that this good person still exists.
"Deep down inside"?
Gee, thanks.
Come on, you don't want to send an innocent man to prison.
I assume you're talking about Jack.
As far as going down for murder, that's on you.
And you too.
You're the one framing him.
[scoffs] Man, you must really think a lot of me.
I mean, to what... get Jack's DNA, plant it in your father's car, load a dead body into it, all before staging a car accident?
Yeah, and then plant my Dad's cellphone at the boathouse, which puts pressure on Jack, which put pressure on me.
- Dude, that's crazy.
- Admit it... you want me to confess!
If I wanted to, I could just turn you in.
Then you wouldn't look so good in front of Jo, which is the point, right?
You've really thought this through, huh?
If we can start talking about the truth, then I can start figuring out what to do about it.
I would love to help you out, Danny, 'cause I am a good person deep down inside.
And I know that you're in a tight spot and everything... [clattering]
Don't lie to me!
Screw you.
You're just pissed because I saw something in Jo that you never saw, something you missed for years.
- What are you talking about?
- What is it you called her?
A shy little puppy dog?
[laughing]
Did you read my journal?
- Did you read my journal?
!
- No, I just...
- Forget it.
You need help, man.
- Yeah, well, so do you.
[door opens, closes]
Hey, Whitney.
I'm sorry about your dad.
- You okay?
- Great, if you like being totally in the dark.
- Yeah, that's...
- Sucks, but even my Dad seems to want it that way, so...
On the bright side, Lacey's been amazing.
- I'm lucky to have her.
- Yeah, Lacey's great.
Tell you what:
I'm gonna go use the little girls'.
You guys chat.
[whispering] Jo, have you talked to Danny?
- What are you guys gonna do?
- I don't know.
He shut me out.
Yeah, because he's convinced that he can nail Charlie.
- For what?
- For... for moving the body
- and now for framing Jack.
- That's ridiculous.
I don't even understand.
Charlie could never do that.
Jo, I don't know.
Danny's a little off the rails right now.
This is ridiculous.
I thought he had a plan.
He's just making everything worse.
Danny, we need to talk.
Call me back.
[buzzes] [muttering] That's what it is.
- What are you doing?
- Uh, I have to...
I have to write all this down so it's documented
- in case I don't get a chance to.
- To what?
It's all Charlie.
I can't let him get away with it.
I have to make sure that Jo is safe.
- What makes you think that Charlie...
- It's not...
It is not just Jo.
It-it...
it's Lacey, too.
He started with Lacey.
It's all...
- It's all three of us.
- What are you talking about?
[sighs]
I made a promise to Jack,
- and that lawyer is not gonna...
- Hold on.
That lawyer is working on it.
And the only way to save Jack is by turning yourself in, so...
I'm not letting Jack go to jail, because he loves you, Mom.
It's his decision.
He's a grown man.
He's not an innocent child.
Well, neither am I!
[papers rustle]
Please don't do this to me.
I'll be all alone.
You... how can you say these things?
You love him, right?
You love Jack.
I love you more.
And if Jack needs to go to jail to save you,
- so be it.
- That is sick, okay?
That is a man's life, and I'm done with this.
- Please, I'm begging you!
- No!
[door opens]
Hey.
So...
I don't know how well garlic bread holds up, but...
- Sorry, I just...
- What's wrong?
There's something I have to...
I'll be back.
[people chattering]
- You have a good night.
- You too.
- Dr. Berger!
- Desai?
[car door shuts]
What the hell are you doing here?
[clicks, ringing]
This is Jo.
Leave a message.
[beeps]
Hey, Jo, it's... it's me.
I know you got a lot going on, but...
Danny was here and he has these... these crazy ideas...
and... he beat me up... pretty bad... and...
I'm in a lot of pain.
I was wondering if maybe you could come over.
So hopefully I'll...
see you soon.
Okay.
[beeps, clatters]
[sighs]
[groans]
Just come inside.
We can sit, get warm,
- talk about whatever you want to.
- No no, sorry.
There's no time.
I have some questions about... about Charlie.
He moved to my town right after he got out.
- Charlie McBride?
- Look, I need you to tell me anything you know about Charlie.
Danny, you know I can't do that.
I am bound by rules of confidentiality,
- and if...
- Okay, fine fine!
Just... [sighs]
I think that Charlie's dangerous.
Okay?
And I want to make sure that I'm right before I...
Before you what, Danny?
Everybody's saying that I'm crazy, and I feel like I'm losing it.
And I gotta know.
Am I?
[sighs] You're not crazy, Danny.
You were never crazy.
You know that.
So Charlie's...?
Has a past, like all you boys do, but... there's more to him you don't know.
None of it's good.
- Then I know what I need to do.
- Danny.
Danny, wait.
I... [engine starts, revs] I can get in touch with his parole officer!
[tires screech] [doorbell chimes]
- Hi.
- Hi, uh...
I'm sorry, but... this bracelet around Samantha's ankle.
- The hospital tag?
- Did she get sick right after she was born?
Is that why she was there?
No, I mean, she was born in the hospital.
[stammers]
I...
I don't understand.
I picked her up maybe 12 hours afterwards from that medical center over in Trenton.
But my baby wasn't born in the hospital.
We were at a farmhouse upstate.
Oh.
I don't know what you're saying, Tess.
I...
I don't think this is my baby.
[moaning softly] [knocks on door]
Yeah.
Coming.
[sighs]
- Oh my god.
- Yeah.
Danny kinda lost it.
Look, Jo, I think it's time to do something.
I mean, you said yourself Jack can't sit and rot in a jail.
I think that you should go to your dad, tell him what Danny did and leave yourself out of it.
- How could I do that?
- Look, just say that Danny was by himself, that he told you that he killed Vikram.
Danny'll back you up on it.
He... he loves you.
I don't think that...
And anyway, without anyone there
- to prove it was self-defense...
- I know.
I understand that you care about Danny...
- I care about telling the truth.
- Screw the truth!
Look at my face!
Look, I'm sorry.
I just...
Look, I don't wanna lose you, okay?
I mean, I just...
I just got you.
I've been dreaming about this moment forever,
I mean, since before we even met, and...
What are you talking about?
[sighs]
When I was in juvie, I saw Danny's pictures of you.
And...
Jo, you have to understand that everything that I have done... everything...
- has been for you.
- What have you done?
- Okay, let me...
let me...
let me...
- What have you done, Charlie?
Let me just explain, okay?
Look, what...
- When I saw what happened at the ravine...
- What do you mean,
- "when you saw what happened"?
- ...
I knew that I had to do something.
- And I was just trying to help Danny, okay?
- Oh my god, I have to go.
Wait!
Jo, just wait, okay?
- Please!
- Let me go!

Hey, is Jo here?
No, she's out with Charlie, I think.
Why?
Chief Masterson, you've got the wrong guy.
Jack didn't kill my father.
I did.
My dad and I, we got into a fight by the ravine near the old post church and he tried to kill me, so I hit him with a piece of wood.
You have to stop talking right now.
I'm taking you in.
- We're gonna do this by the book.
- I know we will.
Turn around.
[handcuffs clicking]
What's happening?
Danny confessed to killing his father.
I don't know where you are or what happened between you and Charlie, I think you're right about him.
I can't do this anymore, Danny.
I have to confess.
[police radio chatter]
Hey, um... maybe you should sleep up here.
Are you sure?
I mean, I'm all about the cozy, but if you're really a sprawler,
- Just get up here.
- I don't wanna...
Okay.
I'm so sorry.
- You're not feeling it, huh?
- I don't think so.
Do you want to try it again?
[laughs] Just to be sure?
You know, the truth is I'm...
I'm kissing you but I'm still thinking about Danny.
Ouch.
- Whitney, I...
- For you, I mean.
That's... [sighs]
Whitney, I really like you.
[sighs]
I had such a good time the other night, but I...
It's okay.
I've been turned down before.
Actually, not really, ever, but... [laughs] ...I guess there's a first time for everything, right?
- Ice cream?
- Definitely.
So all through Regina, the accusations of an entire town, all of it, you kept this huge secret that you didn't kill your aunt?
Yes sir, that's exactly what I did.
- Danny, this is...
- I know.
It is.
Does anyone else know about this?
- Jo, Lacey, your mother?
- No sir.
- None of them know anything.
- And there's a problem with your story.
Your father's body wasn't found anywhere near that ravine.
It was found 10 miles away in a wrecked car.
[clears throat] I know that.
- Did you move the body?
- No sir.
- Try to cover it up?
- No sir.
But I know who did.
- All right, who?
- Charlie McBride.
- The kid that's dating Jo?
- Yes sir.
- Why would he do that?
- Because he wanted to have something on me.
We were in juvie together.
After he got out, he came here, 'cause he wants my life.
And that includes Jo.
[keys jingle]
Mom.
- What's wrong?
- Danny was here.
He confessed to killing his father.
Do you think that's true?
I know it is, because I was there.
I was with him.

OVER A 30-YEAR PERIOD,
MORE THAN 100 MILLION PEOPLE WILL DIE
IN THE BLOODIEST CONFLICT THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.
BUT IT ALL BEGAN
IN THE SLUMS OF VIENNA.
[thunder booming]
AT AGE 25,
AND ASPIRING ARTIST
STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE.
BOTH HIS PARENTS ARE DEAD... [thunder booming]
LEAVING HITLER TRULY ALONE IN THE WORLD.
- HE WAS A LOST SOUL.
HE WANTED TO BE AN ARTIST,
BUT HE COULDN'T GET INTO THE ART SCHOOL,
AND HE ENDED UP LIVING IN A FLOPHOUSE.
narrator:
LEFT WITHOUT ANY MEANS OF SUPPORT,
HIS ONLY WAY TO MAKE MONEY IS SELLING PAINTINGS AROUND TOWN
FOR NEXT TO NOTHING.
- HITLER DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN B WHEN HE WAS REJECTED.
HE JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
SO HE STARTED TO DRIFT.
HE HAD VERY LITTLE MONEY.
HE WAS LIVING IN A HAND-TO-MOUTH EXISTENCE.
HE HAD NO CLEAR AIM IN LIFE AT ALL.
HE WAS, IN A SENSE, WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.
narrator:
BEFORE LONG,
A CHANCE EVENT 450 MILES AWAY
WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING.
JUNE 28, 1914.
[explosion]
AN ASSASSIN TAKES DOWN THE ARCHDUKE OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.
THE MURDER IGNITES A DEADLY CONFLICT
THAT QUICKLY ERUPTS INTO WAR.
FROM THE TANGLE OF ALLIANCES
TWO SIDES EMERGE.
BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND RUSSIA
BECOME KNOWN AS THE ALLIES,
WHILE AUSTRIA-HUNGARY, GERMANY, AND THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE
FORM THE CENTRAL POWERS.
FILLED WITH PATRIOTIC SENSE OF URGENCY,
MEN ON BOTH SIDES RUSH TO JOIN THE FIGHT.
FOR HITLER, IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY HE'S BEEN WAITING FOR.
HE QUICKLY RUSHES TO ENLIST.
- HE TRIED OUT FOR THE AUSTRIAN ARMY.
HE FAILED THE PHYSICAL.
HE WASN'T CONSIDERED STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY A RIFLE.
narrator:
REJECTED BY HIS OWN COUNTRY,
HITLER TURNS TO THE GERMANY ARMY
WHO'S ACCEPTING ALMOST ANYONE
AS THEY WORKED TO BUILD THE LARGEST FIGHTING FORCE
IN THE WORLD.
[bells tolling]
GERMANY HAS FINALLY GIVEN HITLER
WHAT HE'S ALWAYS WANTED:
A PLACE TO BELONG.
- I THINK THAT THE DECISION TO ENTER THE MILITARY
FOR MOST PEOPLE IS NOT A DECISION TO SERVE.
IT MAY BE IN A VERY GENERAL SENSE,
BUT IT'S MORE OFTEN
BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE IS MOTIVATING YOU.
- ZWEI!
DREI!
VIER!
narrator:
THROUGHOUT AUGUST OF 1914,
HITLER TRAINS AS A PRIVATE IN THE GERMAN ARMY.
- WELL, THE GERMAN ARMY WAS CONSIDERED
TO BE THE FINEST ARMY IN THE WORLD.
IT WAS A MASSIVE FORCE--
WELL EQUIPPED, WELL TRAINED,
AND VERY WELL LED,
AND HITLER WAS SWEPT AWAY.
BEING PART OF THE GERMAN ARMY
WAS SOMETHING THAT HITLER DEEPLY LOVED.
narrator:
THE STRUCTURE OF TRAINING TRANSFORMS HITLER
INTO A DEVOUT GERMAN SOLDIER.
HITLER JOINS 1 1/2 MILLION GERMANS
MARCHING TOWARDS THE FRENCH BORDER
AND THE UNIFIED ALLIED FORCES.
IN THE HISTORY OF WARFARE,
ARMIES THIS LARGE HAVE NEVER MET IN COMBAT.
6,000 MILES AWAY,
AMERICA HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WAR IN EUROPE.
THEY'RE IN THEIR OWN WAR
WITH PANCHO VILLA.
[hooves rumbling] [gunshots]
THE MEXICAN REVOLUTIONARY
IS CARRYING OUT VIOLENT ATTACKS ON U.S. CITIZENS
ALONG THE SOUTHWESTERN BORDER.
BUT HE GOES TOO FAR.
[gunshots ricocheting]
VILLA AND HIS MEN SEIZE AN AMERICAN MINING TRAIN,
BRUTALLY KILLING 16 INNOCENT AMERICANS,
LEAVING THE U.S. MILITARY NO CHOICE
BUT TO TAKE ACTION.
NEARLY 5,000 AMERICAN TROOPS CROSS THE MEXICAN BORDER
TO TAKE DOWN VILLA.
BUT FIGHTING A GUERRILLA FORCE WITH A TRADITIONAL ARMY
IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE.
[gunshot]
ONE ARMY CAPTAIN IS DETERMINED TO FIND A DIFFERENT WAY.
HIS NAME IS GEORGE S. PATTON.
- PATTON'S ANCESTORS FOUGHT IN THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR;
THEY FOUGHT IN THE CIVIL WAR.
HE GREW UP WANTING TO BE A MILITARY HERO.
HE HAS A REPUTATION FOR BEING SMART, TOUGH,
AND FOR BEING RUTHLESS.
AND HE HAS ANOTHER QUALITY THAT'S ESSENTIAL
IN MILITARY LEADERSHIP.
HE UNDERSTANDS THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY,
AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO FIGHT WITH CAVALRY AND WITH HORSES.
HE'S LOOKING FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY
THAT WILL CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE BATTLEFIELD.
SO THE CAR IS FAIRLY NEW.
IF YOU STRAP A GUN TO A CAR,
YOU'VE GOT A NEW INSTRUMENT OF WARFARE.
narrator:
WHAT PATTON DOESN'T KNOW
IS THAT HE'S ABOUT TO REVOLUTIONIZE WARFARE.
- I THINK PATTON KNEW ONLY ONE DIRECTION,
AND THAT WAS FORWARD.
HE HAD A LOT OF CHARISMA.
HE WAS A VERY COLORFUL LEADER.
I THOUGHT HE WAS VERY EGOTISTICAL,
AND THAT'S FINE AS LONG AS YOU TRANSLATE THAT
INTO GOOD LEADERSHIP.
BUT MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OVER THE TOP.
narrator:
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,
PATTON IS ABLE TO PUT HIS PLAN INTO ACTION... [motor rumbling]
AND HE LAUNCHES A SURPRISE RAID ON PANCHO VILLA'S CAMP.
- FASTER!
GOT 'EM ON THE RUN.
GO!
FASTER!
GET DOWN!
[gunfire]
LET'S GO, LET'S GO!
narrator:
THE BANDITS ARE NO MATCH
FOR PATTON AND HIS MOBILE ARMY,
AND BY THE END OF THE FIGHT,
THREE OF VILLA'S MEN HAVE BEEN KILLED,
INCLUDING HIS SECOND-IN-COMMAND.
THE FIRST USE OF MOTORIZED WARFARE
BY THE UNITED STATES ARMY
IS A HUGE SUCCESS,
AND FOR PATTON,
IT'S THE FIRST STEP IN HIS RISE TO GREATNESS.
HALF A WORLD AWAY,
TWO MASSIVE ARMIES COLLIDE ON THE BATTLEFIELD...
IN THE FIRST MAJOR WAR WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY.
- WHEN YOU LOOK AT WORLD WAR I,
IT'S ABOUT MACHINE GUNS, AND, YOU KNOW,
ALL OF THESE SORTS OF NEW KILLING MECHANISMS.
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY AS A TECH ERA.
THIS IS NOT MEN ON HORSEBACK ANYMORE.
THIS IS A MOTORIZED WAR.
narrator:
THE ADVANCED WEAPONRY TURNS THE CONFLICT
INTO A SLAUGHTER.
230 MEN ARE KILLED EACH HOUR--
ONE DEATH EVERY 15 SECONDS.
- REALLY THE MACHINE GUN
THEY FOUND IF THEY DUG EVEN SHALLOW TRENCHES
AND USED MACHINE GUNS,
A SMALL NUMBER OF TROOPS
COULD STOP A LARGE ATTACKING FORCE.
AND THEN BOTH SIDES STARTED TO DIG TRENCHES.
AND SO THEY WERE LOCKED ALONG THIS LINE, THE WESTERN FRONT,
WHICH WAS THIS EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX SET OF TRENCHES
THAT DIDN'T MOVE VERY MUCH EITHER WAY.
[explosion] narrator:
THE TRENCHES COVER 25,000 MILES.
LAID END TO END,
THEY WOULD CIRCLE THE GLOBE.
THE AREA BETWEEN THE TRENCHES IS SO DEADLY,
IT'S KNOWN...
AS NO-MAN'S-LAND.
AMONG THE GERMAN SOLDIERS
STATIONED IN THE TRENCHES ALONG THE WESTERN FRONT
IS ADOLF HITLER.
BUT EVEN AFTER MONTHS ON THE FRONT LINES,
HITLER'S STILL SEEN AS AN OUTCAST.
- HITLER WAS REGARDED BY THE OTHER TROOPS
AS SOMETHING OF A LONER,
SOMETHING OF A RATHER PECULIAR ECCENTRIC PERSON
WHO KEPT TO HIMSELF.
narrator:
BUT WHAT HITLER LACKS IN POPULARITY
HE MAKES UP FOR IN BLIND AMBITION.
- RUNNER!
COMMAND WANTS THIS TAKEN TO THE 3RD BATTALION.
NOW!
- YES, SIR.
- HITLER'S ROLE AS A MESSENGER
WAS ACTUALLY CONSIDERED PERHAPS THE MOST DANGEROUS TASK
IN TRENCH WARFARE--
RUNNING FROM TRENCH TO TRENCH, EXPOSING HIMSELF TO ENEMY FIRE.
THE MORTALITY RATE FOR MESSENGERS
WAS QUITE SIGNIFICANT.

- CHURCHILL HAD THE MOST ENORMOUS SELF-CONFIDENCE,
AND IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY THAT WAS THE CASE.
HE WAS THE SON OF LORD RANDOLPH CHURCHILL,
WHO WAS A BRILLIANT POLITICIAN.
AND SO CHURCHILL, FROM A VERY YOUNG MAN,
SAW HIMSELF, ALMOST BY DIVINE RIGHT,
AS PLAYING A LEADING ROLE IN POLITICS.
narrator:
CHURCHILL FORMS A BOLD PLAN
THAT HE'S CERTAIN WILL CHANGE THE ALLIES' FORTUNES.
- HE EVEN AT THAT POINT
CONSIDERED HIMSELF A STRATEGIST,
AND HE LOOKED FOR WAYS TO BREAK THE STALEMATE IN WESTERN EUROPE
RATHER THAN JUST TO GET MORE ARMIES AND MORE ARTILLERY,

- WHAT IF WE COULD SEND A FLEET

- RESUPPLY THE RUSSIANS?

THROUGH GALLIPOLI.

NO.

ON SEPTEMBER 12, 1918,
PATTON AND HIS FORCES SWEEP ONTO THE BATTLEFIELD
FROM EVERY ANGLE... [explosions, gunfire]
AND THE GERMANS HIT BACK WITH EVERYTHING THEY'VE GOT.
BUT ALL OF PATTON'S INTELLIGENCE IS PAYING OFF...
AND HIS TANK BRIGADE BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN THE GERMAN LINE.
- SOLDIER!
GET ON THE LEFT FLANK NOW!
- YES, SIR.
- GENERAL, CHARLIE COMPANY'S ADVANCING.
- TAKE POSITION ON THE RIDGE.
- YES, SIR.
- KEEP MOVING!
KEEP MOVING!
- LIEUTENANT GEORGE S. PATTON, 1ST TANK BRIGADE.
- BRIGADIER GENERAL DOUGLAS MACARTHUR, 42ND INFANTRY.
- GENERAL, SIR, THEY NEED YOU ON THE FRONT.
- ALL RIGHT, BOYS!
LET'S MOVE UP!
- PATTON AND MACARTHUR.
HERE THEY ARE IN SAINT-MIHIEL,
AND THEY MEET ON THE BATTLEFIELD FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN THE MIDST OF ARTILLERY SHELLS ALL AROUND THEM.
YOU HAVE THESE TWO MEN
WHO ARE GOING TO PLAY SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE
IN SHAPING THE FUTURE OF THE 20TH CENTURY,
AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HISTORY HAS IN STORE FOR THEM.
narrator:
MACARTHUR IS FROM A LONG LINE OF MILITARY MEN.
HIS FATHER WAS AWARDED THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR
IN THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR.
NO LESS IS EXPECTED OF HIS SON.
- DOUGLAS MACARTHUR WOULD LEAD ATTACKS
WALKING OUT INTO NO-MAN'S-LAND WITH A SWAGGER.
HE WAS EMBODIED WITH NOT ONLY TREMENDOUS ABILITY
BUT ALSO TREMENDOUS SELF-CONFIDENCE.

HE WAS DIFFERENT.
HE WAS SPECIAL.

- HITLER DIDN'T FEEL AT THIS TIME
DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR
THAT HE WAS A MAN OF DESTINY AT ALL.

WHAT HE DID FEEL WAS A SENSE OF BELONGING

HE FELT HE WAS FIGHTING IN A REALLY IMPORTANT CAUSE,
THE CAUSE OF GERMANY.

MASSIVE CROWDS GREET THE WORLD LEADERS... [cheers and applause]
INCLUDING UNITED STATES PRESIDENT
WOODROW WILSON.
- WOODROW WILSON WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
TO SPEND ANYWHERE NEAR SIX MONTHS
OUTSIDE THIS COUNTRY,
AND HE FELT THAT FOR HIM TO SEND ANYONE ELSE
TO NEGOTIATE THE PEACE,
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS WELL DONE.
WILSON SAID, "WHATEVER HAPPENS WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF THIS WAR,
"IF IT GOES WELL, GIVE ME CREDIT.
IF IT DOESN'T, BLAME ME."
narrator:
THE LEADERS GATHER AT THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES.
BUT ONE COUNTRY NOT INVITED TO THE TABLE IS GERMANY.
- GENTLEMEN, PLEASE, PLEASE SIT DOWN.
IF WE CAN START BY CONSIDERING THE POINTS
BEFORE WE DISCUSS ANY OF THE INDIVIDUAL IDEAS...
- THE MAIN THING
THAT WOODROW WILSON WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH AT VERSAILLES
WAS DEFANGING GERMANY,
NOT ALLOWING THEM TO DEVELOP A HUGE WAR MACHINE AGAIN.
THIS WAS WHAT THE VICTORS ALL WANTED TO SEE HAPPEN.
narrator:
BUT AS NEGOTIATIONS GET UNDERWAY,
WILSON QUICKLY REALIZES
THAT EACH COUNTRY HAS COME TO THE TABLE
- THERE WERE THESE NATIONAL LEADERS
WHO HAD DIFFERENT VIEWS OF WHAT THEY WANTED
OUT OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE.
THEY HAD LED THEIR COUNTRIES
THROUGH THIS BRUTAL, BLOODY, LONG WAR,
AND WILSON WALTZES IN WITH THE AMERICANS
JUST AT THE END.
SO THEY HAD TO LISTEN TO HIM,
AND WILSON COULD BE KIND OF PERSUASIVE--
BUT NOT THAT PERSUASIVE.
narrator:
AS NEGOTIATIONS DRAG ON FOR MONTHS,
THE TALKS FALL APART,
AND ONE ALLIED NATION
FEELS COMPLETELY CUT OUT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS.
JAPAN ENTERED THE WAR IN 1914,
CONTRIBUTING THOUSANDS OF TROOPS
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE WAR EFFORT.
THEY COME TO VERSAILLES WITH ONE GOAL:
TO BE TREATED EQUALLY.
BUT ALLIED LEADERS COMPLETELY IGNORE JAPAN
THROUGHOUT THE PROCEEDINGS,
AND FOR JAPAN,
IT'S THE ULTIMATE INSULT.
- THE JAPANESE, WHO'D BEEN ON THE WINNING SIDE,
SO THE JAPANESE BECAME ALIENATED
FROM THE UNITED STATES AND FROM THE WESTERN POWERS,
AND IT WAS A FAIRLY STRAIGHT LINE FROM THERE
TO THE BELIEF THAT,
"IF WE'RE GONNA GET ANY RESPECT,
narrator:
THE ATTENTION SHIFTS
FROM WILSON'S PLAN FOR A LASTING PEACE
TO A PLAN FOCUSED ON PUNISHING GERMANY,
FORCING THEM TO PAY
FOR THE DEVASTATION THEY'VE CAUSED.
- THE REPARATIONS THAT WERE DEMANDED OF GERMANY
WERE ASTRONOMICAL.
IT WAS A MATTER OF,
"WE'RE GONNA SQUEEZE AS MUCH OUT OF GERMANY AS WE CAN."
WELL, THERE WERE SOME ON THE AMERICAN SIDE
WHO SAID, "WE ARE MAKING THE NEXT WAR INEVITABLE."
WILSON WORKED AGAINST THAT.
WILSON WANTED A SOMEWHAT MORE REASONABLE PEACE,
AND HE WANTED THE GERMANS TO FEEL THAT THEY HAD A STAKE
IN THE CONTINUATION OF THE VERSAILLES SYSTEM.
THE PROBLEM WITH THE TREATY AS IT WAS FINALIZED WAS,
GERMANY HAD NO STAKE IN THAT SYSTEM.
IT HAD EVERY INTEREST IN OVERTURNING THE SYSTEM.

DESPITE WILSON'S BEST EFFORTS,
HE IS UNABLE TO CONVINCE THE OTHER ALLIES
TO BUY INTO HIS PLAN FOR PEACE.
AFTER SIX MONTHS OF INTENSE NEGOTIATIONS,
THE ALLIES FINALLY HAVE A TREATY.
BUT THE FINAL AGREEMENT
IS FAR FROM THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE PLAN
WILSON HAD ORIGINALLY HOPED FOR.
- THE LOSERS, GERMANY PRINCIPALLY,
THEY WERE THERE.
THEY DIDN'T GET TO SPEAK.
THEY WEREN'T ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE.
THEY WERE BASICALLY--
THEY HAD A GUN PUT AT THEIR HEADS FIGURATIVELY--
ALMOST LITERALLY--
AND SAID, "YOU'RE GONNA SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE."
IT WAS VERY MUCH A VICTOR'S PEACE.
THE VICTORS DICTATED THE TERMS OF THE PEACE.
THEY MADE OUT LIKE BANDITS.

EUROPE IS FINALLY AT PEACE.

AS A RESULT,
THE GOVERNMENT QUICKLY GOES BANKRUPT,
LEAVING MILLIONS OF GERMANS IMPOVERISHED.
THE ECONOMIC DEVASTATION
COMPLETELY TRANSFORMS THE COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE.

WITH A QUESTION OF SURVIVAL.

HE SETS OUT TO REESTABLISH HIS POLITICAL CAREER,

BUT FAILED TO GAIN THE TERRITORY THEY HAD EXPECTED TO GAIN,
AND THERE'S A SENSE OF OUTRAGE ABOUT THIS
AMONGST ITALIAN NATIONALISTS,
A SENSE ALMOST THAT ITALY HAS LOST THE WAR
DESPITE BEING ON THE WINNING SIDE.

MUSSOLINI USES HIS NEWSPAPER
TO CONVEY HIS VIEW OF A NEW ITALY,
THAT UNDER A STRONG LEADER THE COUNTRY CAN REGAIN
THE GLORY OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.
HE BELIEVES HE CAN BE THAT LEADER...

HE SOON BRINGS HIS ANTIGOVERNMENT VIEWS
RADIO.
- WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN AT WAR
SINCE WE LIFTED THE FLAG OF OUR REVOLUTION
WHICH WAS THEN DEFENDED BY A HANDFUL OF MEN
AGAINST THE MASONIC, DEMOCRATIC,
CAPITALISTIC WORLD.
- MUSSOLINI WAS A MAN OF STRONG WORDS.
HE LIKED THE IDEA OF OVERTHROWING
EXISTING INSTITUTIONS.
HE FAVORED THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO DO THIS.
narrator:
TO MAKE HIS VISION A REALITY,
MUSSOLINI FORMS A BAND OF DISGRUNTLED FORMER SOLDIERS
CALLED THE BLACKSHIRTS
WHO TERRORIZE HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS

MUSSOLINI HAS LAUNCHED A MOVEMENT

THE GERMAN WORKERS' PARTY.
WE NEED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THEM

- YES, SIR.
- TRY TO NOT STAND OUT.

WHICH GAVE RISE TO EXTREMISM.
YOU FIND IN HISTORY THAT WHEN AN ECONOMY IS TERRIBLE,
IT GIVES RISE TO ALL KINDS

BUT HITLER SOON REALIZES
THEY ARE RADICAL NATIONALISTS
INTENSELY LOYAL TO THE FATHERLAND,
AND MANY OF THEM HARBOR EXTREMIST VIEWS
VIEWS THAT ARE NO DIFFERENT FROM HIS OWN.
- THERE WAS NEVER REALLY AN EFFORT
TO DEAL WITH ALL THE DAMAGE
THAT HAD OCCURRED DURING WORLD WAR I.
THE FAILURE TO DO THAT
I THINK IS WHAT ULTIMATELY PRODUCED THE SEEDS

THERE IS NO GERMANY LEFT TO FIGHT FOR.
GERMANY MUST BREAK APART.
IT IS ONLY THROUGH THIS THAT WE CAN SURVIVE.

IN THE HISTORY OF WARFARE.
THE WEAK AMONG US TURN TO SUCH EXCUSES
AND ABANDON OUR PRIDE AND HOPE
WHEN IT IS ONLY UNITY
THAT SEPARATES THE VICTORS FROM THE DEFEATED.
CLEARLY YOU HAVE STOPPED FIGHTING.
BUT WE ARE STILL FIGHTING GERMANY'S GREAT WAR, OUR WAR,
FOR WHAT WE DESERVE:
A UNITED GERMANY,
A STRONG, PROUD GERMANY.

ABOUT HITLER'S CHARISMA AS A SPEAKER,
AND HE GRADUALLY CAME TO REALIZE
THAT HE WAS INDEED A POWERFUL SPEAKER--
FAR MORE POWERFUL THAN ANYONE ELSE AROUND--
AND BEGAN TO USE THAT AS AN ASSET.
narrator:
TO CAST ALL GERMANY UNDER HIS SPELL,
HITLER NEEDS AN IMAGE
THAT WILL BURN INTO THE MINDS OF MILLIONS.
- NOWADAYS WE'D CALL IT A LOGO OF COURSE.
IT WAS DESIGNED PERSONALLY BY HITLER,
AND IT MAY BE THAT HE PUT
SOME OF HIS ARTISTIC IMPULSES INTO THIS.
THE ESSENTIAL PART OF IT ULTIMATELY WENT BACK TO INDIA,
BUT IT WAS TAKEN UP AS A SYMBOL OF RACISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM
COMBINED WITH THE RED BACKGROUND FOR SOCIALISM
AND THE RED, WHITE, AND BLACK COLORS
FOR THE OLD KAISER REICH.
narrator:
WHILE HITLER IS STILL
IN THE EARLY STAGES OF HIS REVOLUTION,
BENITO MUSSOLINI HAS ALREADY AMASSED AN ARMY OF FOLLOWERS
AND IS READY TO TAKE ITALY BY FORCE.

MUSSOLINI LEADS A MARCH OF 30,000 BLACKSHIRTS INTO ROME.
WITH THE PEOPLE BEHIND HIM,
MUSSOLINI AND THE BLACKSHIRTS STORM THE ROYAL PALACE,
FORCING THE KING OF ITALY
TO HAND OVER CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT.
- MUSSOLINI CAME TO POWER IN ITALY IN 1922.
HIS SUCCESSFUL MARCH ON ROME
WAS EASED BY THE PROCESS OF EXPANDING EGO AND ADULATION
BY THE PEOPLE AROUND MUSSOLINI
AND THEN EVENTUALLY MOST OF THE PUBLIC OPINION
IN THE COUNTRY.
THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROCESS.

IN JUST MONTHS,
MUSSOLINI HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED FROM NEWSPAPER JOURNALIST
TO THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN ITALY.
600 MILES TO THE NORTH,
ADOLF HITLER IS WATCHING EVERYTHING MUSSOLINI HAS DONE,
AND HE WANTS THAT SAME ULTIMATE POWER FOR HIMSELF.
SO HE AMASSES AN ARMY OF HIS OWN.
- HITLER DOES SEEM EARLY TO HAVE BEEN
VERY IMPRESSED BY MUSSOLINI
AND INDEED BY THE MARCH ON ROME.
HIS RISE TO POWER WAS MODELED ON WHAT
HITLER LEADS THE NAZIS INTO A MUNICH BEER HALL

This summer marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War.
And the beginning of a period that saw two of the deadliest conflicts in our history.
It's a chance to remember those who died.
For their brothers, for their country and for the freedom we enjoy today.
And its a chance to honor the courage and bravery of all those who stepped forward and answered the call to serve.
Men like my Grandfather who marched through France as a member of Patton's army.
Women like my Grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line while he was gone.
So as we listen to the stories of the leaders like Roosevelt and Churchill, let's also remember the citizens whose names will never appear on monuments or in textbooks.
Men and Women who stood firm in the face of evil and in the years since have taken their rightful place in history.
May their sacrifice never be forgotten.

At age 25, Adolf Hitler is a poor loner, an aspiring artist, struggling to survive.
Both his parents are dead...
[Thunder booming]
Leaving Hitler truly alone in the world.
He was a lost soul.
He wanted to be an artist, but he couldn't get into the art school, and he ended up living in a flophouse.
Narrator:
Left without any means of support, his only way to make money is selling paintings around town for next to nothing.
Hitler didn't have a plan B when he was rejected.
He just didn't know what to do.
So he started to drift.

He was living in a hand-to-mouth existence.

The murder ignites a deadly conflict that quickly erupts into war.
From the tangle of alliances two sides emerge.
Britain, France, and Russia become known as the Allies, while Austria-Hungary, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire form the Central Powers.
Filled with a patriotic sense of urgency, men on both sides rush to join the fight.

He quickly rushes to enlist.
He tried out for the Austrian army.
He failed the physical.
He wasn't considered strong enough to carry a rifle.

Germany has finally given Hitler what he's always wanted:
A place to belong.
I think that the decision to enter the military for most people is not a decision to serve.
It may be in a very general sense, but it's more often because something else is motivating you.
Zwei!
Drei!
Vier!
Narrator:
Throughout August of 1914,
Hitler trains as a Private in the German army.
Well, the German army was considered to be the finest army in the world.
It was a massive force... well equipped, well trained, and very well led, and Hitler was swept away.
Being part of the German army was something that Hitler deeply loved.
Narrator:
The structure of training transforms Hitler into a devout German soldier.
Hitler joins 1 1/2 million Germans marching towards the French border and the unified Allied forces.
In the history of warfare, armies this large have never met in combat.
6,000 miles away,
America has nothing to do with the war in Europe.
They're in their own war with Pancho Villa.
[Hooves rumbling]
[Gunshots]
The Mexican Revolutionary is carrying out violent attacks on U.S. citizens along the southwestern border.
But he goes too far.
[Gunshots ricocheting]
Villa and his men seize an American mining train, brutally killing 16 innocent Americans, leaving the U.S. military no choice but to take action.
Nearly 5,000 American troops cross the Mexican border to take down Villa.
But fighting a guerrilla force with a traditional army is next to impossible.
[Gunshot]
One army Captain is determined to find a different way.
His name is George S. Patton.
Patton's ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War;
they fought in the Civil War.
He grew up wanting to be a military hero.
He has a reputation for being smart, tough, and for being ruthless.
And he has another quality that's essential in military leadership.
He understands the power of technology, and he doesn't want to fight with cavalry and with horses.
He's looking for new technology that will change the nature of the battlefield.
So the car is fairly new.
If you strap a gun to a car, you've got a new instrument of warfare.
Narrator:
What Patton doesn't know is that he's about to revolutionize warfare.
I think Patton knew only one direction, and that was forward.
He had a lot of charisma.
He was a very colorful leader.
I thought he was very egotistical, and that's fine as long as you translate that into good leadership.
But maybe a little bit over the top.
Narrator:
Almost immediately,
Patton is able to put his plan into action...
[Motor rumbling]
And he launches a surprise raid on Pancho Villa's camp.
Faster!
Got 'em on the run.
Go!
Faster!
Get down!
[Gunfire]
Let's go, let's go!
Narrator:
The bandits are no match for Patton and his mobile army, and by the end of the fight, three of villa's men have been killed, including his second-in-command.
The first use of motorized warfare by the United States army is a huge success, and for Patton, it's the first step in his rise to greatness.
Half a world away, two massive armies collide on the battlefield...
In the first major war with modern technology.
When you look at World War I, it's about machine guns, and, you know, all of these sorts of new killing mechanisms.
It's the beginning of the 20th century as a tech era.
This is not men on horseback anymore.
This is a motorized war.
Narrator:
The advanced weaponry turns the conflict into a slaughter.
230 men are killed each hour... one death every 15 seconds.
Really the machine gun probably did more than anything else.
They found if they dug even shallow trenches and used machine guns, a small number of troops could stop a large attacking force.
And then both sides started to dig trenches.
And so they were locked along this line, the Western front, which was this extraordinarily complex set of trenches that didn't move very much either way.
[Explosion]
Narrator:
The trenches cover 25,000 miles.
Laid end to end, they would circle the globe.
The area between the trenches is so deadly, it's known...
As no-man's-land.
Among the German soldiers stationed in the trenches along the Western front is Adolf Hitler.
But even after months on the front lines,
Hitler's still seen as an outcast.
Hitler was regarded by the other troops as something of a loner, something of a rather peculiar eccentric person who kept to himself.
Narrator:
But what Hitler lacks in popularity he makes up for in blind ambition.
Runner!
Command wants this taken to the 3rd Battalion.
- Now!
- Yes, sir.
Hitler's role as a messenger was actually considered perhaps the most dangerous task in trench warfare... running from trench to trench, exposing himself to enemy fire.
The mortality rate for messengers was quite significant.

The Germans are retreating, and Adolf Hitler has been injured, and he has this encounter with a Private Henry Tandey, a British Private.

Tandey has Adolf Hitler in his sights, and even though he's a trained soldier, he can't bring himself to pull the trigger.
If Tandey had pulled the trigger,
Adolf Hitler would have died on the battlefields in World War I, and the whole course of human history would have been changed.
It's one of the great what-ifs in history.
Narrator:
The World Wars have begun with Britain, France, and Russia squaring off against Germany and the Central Powers.
[Gunfire]
Modern weaponry is causing mass devastation on the battlefields, and tens of thousands of soldiers are now living in overcrowded trenches.
Very soon after the war began, both sides realized, "we can entrench, and the other side can't move us out.
"They can move us backwards a little bit but only at horrendous cost."
And the result of this, the war just bogged down in the muds of northern France.
Narrator:
But in London, one man is convinced he can break the stalemate.
He comes up to the barman and says...
Narrator:
Born into one of the wealthiest families in Britain, he's risen through the ranks at unusual speed...
To become the head of the British Navy.
His name is Winston Churchill.
Churchill had the most enormous self-confidence, and it's easy to see why that was the case.
He was the son of Lord Randolph Churchill, who was a brilliant politician.
And so Churchill, from a very young man, saw himself, almost by divine right, as playing a leading role in politics.
Narrator:
Churchill forms a bold plan that he's certain will change the Allies' fortunes.
He even at that point considered himself a strategist, and he looked for ways to break the stalemate in Western Europe rather than just to get more armies and more artillery, and it actually was fairly thoughtful.
What if we could send a fleet to the south into the Black Sea?
Resupply the Russians?
Well, yes, exactly.
There's no way.
Well, yes, there is.
Through Gallipoli.
Gallipoli?
No.
This is our way in.
With all due respect, we are here to provide information... this is what we are doing.
A lot of people Churchill worked with thought he was a man of contradictions, a Maverick, a loose cannon.
He was known as someone to watch.
His friends would say someone to watch because he's very talented, and his enemies would say someone to watch because he was dangerous.
Narrator:
The Gallipoli peninsula is heavily guarded by the Central Powers.
Churchill's plan is to blast through the narrow strait,
Pushing through to Russia and allowing the Allies to launch an overwhelming attack from the east, opening up a second front against Germany.
If it's successful, the Allies will be able to turn the tide of the war and crush the Central Powers.
More than 100 warships set sail for what will be the largest amphibious invasion the world has ever seen.

People often ask me, "what's the most difficult decision you've ever made?"
It's always the decision of sending men into battle, and the worst part of it all is the night that the battle begins, because you know you've just launched something, and you know that within a few hours
you will start getting calls from the battlefield, from your commanders out in the field, that will tell you how many young men have died.
[Telephone rings]
Yes?
They're halfway up the straits.
They should have broken through by now.
They'll make it.
Four ships sunk.
Another burning.
Losses were to be expected.
The fleet is requesting permission to turn back.
They are to press on at all costs.
This is war.
Gallipoli I don't think could ever have worked.
The troops who stormed ashore were met by a hail of machine gun fire and artillery, and the casualties were appalling.
Narrator:
The invasion is a devastating failure.
56,000 Allied troops are killed and nearly 200,000 are reported injured or missing.
Almost no ground is gained...
And the supply route to Russia remains closed off.
I think Churchill's credibility after Gallipoli was certainly called into question.
Warfare is not a science.
The one thing you do know when you commit to warfare is, it's gonna be horrible.
Narrator:
The public is outraged by the carnage.
Someone will have to take the blame.
It's over.
The plan was sound.
Excuse me?
The plan was sound.
All we needed to do was keep pushing forward.
I'm afraid your services as First Lord of the Admiralty are no longer required.
I'll expect your letter of resignation in the morning.
When Churchill was let go, he thought his career was over, finished.
And that wasn't melodrama on his part, and he could be melodramatic.
It appeared that it would be finished.
It's hard to imagine Churchill being humbled by something like Gallipoli, but he was chastened.
He thought, "never again.
"The next time, if there's a next time"... and it didn't look like there would be...
"I'll do it right."
Narrator:
Defeated and humiliated,
Churchill's career is all but ruined.
He's offered a desk job which he turns down.
He knows if he's ever going to redeem himself, he needs a new path.
So Churchill does the unthinkable.
He enlists in the British army...
And heads straight for the front lines.
While Winston Churchill looks for redemption,
Germany looks to capitalize on its victory at Gallipoli, devising a plan to eliminate the Russian threat once and for all.
The Germans load a secret weapon onto a heavily guarded train headed for Russia.

That weapon is Vladimir Lenin.
Lenin is the leader of Russia's Communist Revolutionaries hell-bent on toppling the Russian Czar.
For the past ten years, he's been in exile in Switzerland until Germany sends him home on a train along with over $10 million to fund his revolution.
The Germans decided that they would take this enormous gamble and bring Lenin back to Russia to bring about a revolution to get Russia out the war.

Europe is at war, and in a bold move, the Central Powers have ended the fighting on the eastern front, sending exiled revolutionary Vladimir Lenin back to Russia where he seized control of the country and took the Russian army out of the fight.
Germany can turn its attention to the other Allies, and one of the countries now forced to fend off a new wave of German soldiers is Italy.
Italy joined the fight in 1915 and now must face the full might of the German army for the first time.
Tens of thousands of troops are rushed to defend the Italian border in the alps.
Among them is a sharpshooter named Benito Mussolini.
Before the war, Mussolini is an antiwar activist.
He's a journalist.
He's pretty much a pacifist.

It was a war of attrition.
You had to kill as many of the enemy as you could so you could possibly advance.
Chemical warfare just enabled that in a very horrific way.
For a way to alter the course of the war.
So they look to the one country that could finally tip the scales in their favor.
Until now, President Woodrow Wilson has kept America out of the war.
Wilson recognized that the American people did not want to get involved in a war, particularly if it's a war far away involving people and for causes that we had nothing to do with.
Frankly, the American people did not see themselves at immediate risk.
Narrator:
But with hostilities escalating, a peaceful solution seems less and less likely, and Wilson's advisors urge him to begin preparing military forces.
Among them is the 35-year-old Assistant Secretary of the Navy
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Mr. President, I recommend an immediate allocation of more funds to our naval resources if we want to maintain military preparedness.
Wilson found himself being drawn closer and closer to war.
In the spring of 1915, the British liner the lusitania was sunk, and on board were over a hundred Americans.
Now, this was a big deal.
Until this time, it had been a European war.
But now in this European war,
Americans were getting killed.
Narrator:
American resentment grows against Germany, and on February 26, 1917, it to finally reaches a boiling point.
Mr. President, I think you should look at this right away.
Narrator:
The United States intercepts a secret telegram from Germany intended for the Mexican government containing a shocking proposal.
The Germans are offering to fund a Mexican invasion of the United States that would allow the country to reclaim the border states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.
The German ploy was, preoccupy America with a war with Mexico, and therefore you keep them out of Europe.
Well, this incensed a lot of Americans, and rightfully so.
Narrator:
The U.S. government releases the contents of the secret message, and almost instantly, anti-German protests erupt all across America.
The Zimmermann telegram was one of the stupidest things the German government ever did.
Texas didn't care about the war in Europe.
Now all of a sudden, the Germans are trying to return Texas to Mexico?
Enough with Germany.
They need to be taught a lesson.
Narrator:
President Wilson signs the declaration of war in April of 1917.
Germany's plan to keep America out of Europe completely backfires.
The Americans may finally be ready for war, but their military isn't.
The U.S. has a standing army of only 100,000 men while the German army has 4 1/2 million.
The United States hurries to build its military, and those few with fighting experience are rushed to France.
George S. Patton has been presented with a huge challenge...
To command a Battalion of American men using the latest form of military innovation...
The tank.
Some American Generals were really resisting the tank because they didn't want to get rid of the horse cavalry.
George Patton understood the power of the new technology of mobile and armed warfare, and he invested a lot in that.
Narrator:
The tank is already being used on the Western front but with little success.
It runs out of gas too quickly, gets stuck in the mud too easily, and its sheer size makes it difficult to incorporate in military maneuvers.
But where others see an insurmountable challenge,
Patton sees a chance to prove that his tanks can break the stalemate.
I think innovation comes between the ears.
It's not about the gizmo.
It's about how you think about using technology and so forth.
You have to give credit to the people like Patton that experienced World War I, that had been thinking about how to employ new things.

Patton knows the stakes are high.

But with his Battalion of tanks, he's determined to win the war...

Or die trying.

The global war rages in Europe...

Things are ugly in World War I.
Europe was staggered, exhausted, many cities in rubble.
Starvation and disease were widespread.
You know, the Red Cross couldn't even keep up with what was going on.
If you were the Allies in Europe, you needed the reinforcements...
The new energy, the new blood.
To aid in the fight, the Allies recruit a new country to their side.
Following their long-awaited entry into the war,
America is ready to make its presence felt.
Their first major offensive is an attack on the Western front hoping to force the Central Powers out of their trenches and drive them out of France.
They're armed with a secret weapon of their own:
A Battalion of lightweight tanks under the command of Colonel George S. Patton.
In a column.
We're gonna go down the main road.
Don't let anyone know we're coming.
- We move at dawn.
- Yes, sir!
Patton is testing his new strategy.
He's leading this new form of weaponry, the tank.
So it's an important battle for him to prove that tanks are valuable on the battlefield and also to establish himself as an important military leader.

For Patton, everything in his career has led up to this moment.
George Patton had grown up to be a soldier.
It was his identity.
And so in the first World War, he is in his element.

Tanks are still unproven in warfare, and Patton knows he can't leave anything to chance.

He's scouting a route to ensure his machines won't get stuck in the mud.
I think when you look at someone like George Patton, he used intelligence well but I think the best thing he did was, he turned intelligence into action, very quickly.
George Patton's tendency was for action.
Because he was aggressive, for him it worked very, very well.

On September 12, 1918,

You have these two men who are going to play such an important role in shaping the future of the 20th century, and they have no idea what history has in store for them.
Narrator:
MacArthur is from a long line of military men.
His father was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in the American Civil War.
No less is expected of his son.
Douglas MacArthur would lead attacks walking out into no-man's-land with a swagger.
He was embodied with not only tremendous ability but also tremendous self-confidence.
Watch the right flank!
From an early age, he was different.
He was special.
I don't want to say "anointed".
But he may have thought he was.
Narrator:
The two West Point graduates will be allies and rivals for decades.
I don't think there's any question that a leader who has experienced war and what it means to be in battle.
If you're a military commander, that experience is invaluable.
How you try to ensure that in the midst of all of that chaos and the killing that's going on, that you keep your eye on the mission that has to be accomplished, that's not easy to do.

As negotiations to secure the peace get underway in France, massive crowds greet the world leaders...
[Cheers and applause]
Including United States President
Woodrow Wilson.
Woodrow Wilson was the first President of the United States to spend anywhere near six months outside this country, and he felt that for him to send anyone else to negotiate the peace, it would not have been as well done.
Wilson said, "Whatever happens with the settlement of this war,
"if it goes well, give me credit.
If it doesn't, blame me."
Narrator:
The leaders gather at the Palace of Versailles.
But one country not invited to the table is Germany.
Gentlemen, please, please sit down.
If we can start by considering the points before we discuss any of the individual ideas...

To be treated equally.
But Allied leaders completely ignore Japan throughout the proceedings, and for Japan, it's the ultimate insult.
The Japanese, who'd been on the winning side, get this slap at the peace conference.
So the Japanese became alienated from the United States and from the Western powers, and it was a fairly straight line from there to the belief that,
"if we're gonna get any respect, it's going to be by fighting are way to respect.
Narrator:
The attention shifts from Wilson's plan for a lasting peace to a plan focused on punishing Germany, forcing them to pay for the devastation they've caused.
The reparations that were demanded of Germany were astronomical.
It was a matter of,
"we're gonna squeeze as much out of Germany as we can."
Well, there were some on the American side who said, "we are making the next war inevitable."
Wilson worked against that.
Wilson wanted a somewhat more reasonable peace, and he wanted the Germans to feel that they had a stake in the continuation of the Versailles system.
The problem with the treaty as it was finalized was,
Germany had no stake in that system.
It had every interest in overturning the system.
Narrator:
Despite Wilson's best efforts, he is unable to convince the other Allies to buy into his plan for peace.
After six months of intense negotiations, the Allies finally have a treaty.
But the final agreement is far from the fair and equitable plan
Wilson had originally hoped for.
The losers, Germany principally, they were there.
They didn't get to speak.
They weren't asked to contribute.
They were basically... they had a gun put at their heads figuratively... almost literally... and said, "you're gonna sign on the dotted line."
It was very much a Victor's peace.
The victors dictated the terms of the peace.
They made out like bandits.
Narrator:
Europe is finally at peace.
But while most of the world celebrates,
Germany is ordered to pay the Allies over 80 Billion dollars.
The modern equivalent of nearly 1/2 a trillion dollars, a debt they won't pay off until 2010.
As a result, the government quickly goes bankrupt, leaving millions of Germans impoverished.
The economic devastation completely transforms the country and its people.
Germany immediately is struggling with a question of survival.
For ordinary Germans, the war did not end in November 1918.
For ordinary Germans the battle for survival, the daily struggle for food, the effort to find shoes and clothing stretched on into the 1920s.
Narrator:
As the anger and starvation spread, tensions rise throughout the country.
[Indistinct shouting]
Germany is in a state of near Civil War.
The left and the right are fighting with each other in the streets.
Paramilitary groups clash.
Germany is a country divided against itself.
When World War I came to an end, this is not a treaty.
This is an armistice that'll probably last 20 years...
Meaning we have not really defeated the German spirit.
We have not really solved this problem.
Narrator:
With the fighting stopped, the treaty for peace is signed at Versailles.
[Cheers and applause]
And for the first time in over four years,
Europe is at peace.
While celebrations erupt around the world,
Germany is in a state of unrest, and many are convinced that the peace won't hold.
Among them is Winston Churchill.
Having just returned to England from the front lines, he sets out to reestablish his political career, narrowly winning reelection to his old seat in parliament.
There were a lot of doubts about Churchill.
He seemed erratic in his judgments.
His decision in respect to the Gallipoli campaign had disastrous consequences.
But it was in war that he proved his leadership credentials, and that's what transformed him.
Narrator:
Churchill returns to government convinced the German threat hasn't gone away.
[Whistle blowing intermittently]
After leading his troops to victory in France,
Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur is given one of the most prestigious positions in the armed forces...
- Will you be late again?
- No, sir!
Superintendent of the Military Academy at West Point.
Where he immediately gets to work preparing American soldiers for combat in case the peace fails.
240 miles away at his tank academy in Camp Meade, Maryland,
Colonel George S. Patton...
Ready!
Narrator:
Is also training the next generation of American soldiers.
Aim!
Narrator:
And like MacArthur, he's betting the cease-fire won't last.
[Gunshots]
- Fire!
- [Gunshots]
Fire!
- Fire!
- [Gunshots]
[Bells tolling]
Narrator:
In Italy, one man sees the end of fighting as an opportunity.
Benito Mussolini returns to his job as a newspaper journalist.
But the country he fought to protect is now in disarray.
The Italians came out of the war on the winning side but failed to gain the territory they had expected to gain, and there's a sense of outrage about this amongst Italian nationalists, a sense almost that Italy has lost the war
despite being on the winning side.
Narrator:
Mussolini uses his newspaper to convey his view of a new Italy, that under a strong leader the country can regain the glory of the Roman empire.
He believes he can be that leader...
The man who returns Italy to greatness.
He soon brings his anti-government views... to a new medium... radio.
We have actually been at war since we lifted the flag of our revolution which was then defended by a handful of men against the masonic, democratic, capitalistic world.
Mussolini was a man of strong words.
He liked the idea of overthrowing existing institutions.
He favored the use of violence to do this.
Narrator:
To make his vision a reality,
Mussolini forms a band of disgruntled former soldiers called the Blackshirts who terrorize his political opponents and begin preparing for an armed revolution.
In a matter of months,
Mussolini has launched a movement that is about to change the fate of Italy.
Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler.
Sir.
Sit down.
- So you're looking for work.
- Yes, sir.
I am ready for duty.
I understand.
Unfortunately, I have nothing.
Nothing?
There is no work.
The war is over.
There has to be something.
After all I've done, after all I've given...
There is a new political group in town:
The German Workers' party.
We need to find out more about them and what their intentions are.
- Yes, sir.
- Try to not stand out.
The Versailles Treaty caused the economic conditions which gave rise to extremism.
You find in history that when an economy is terrible, it gives rise to all kinds of different extremist organizations.
Narrator:
Hitler is assigned to infiltrate the German Workers' party, one of many anti-government organizations that have formed in the wake of the treaty.
[Door creaks]
For months, he attends secret meetings held at undisclosed locations throughout the country.
They signed away our army.
The Versailles Treaty is not my treaty.
It was as if nothing had happened, as if we are forgotten.
Narrator:
But Hitler soon realizes they are radical nationalists intensely loyal to the fatherland, and many of them harbor extremist views of German superiority.
Views that are no different from his own.
There was never really an effort to deal with all the damage that had occurred during World War I.
The failure to do that
I think is what ultimately produced the seeds for Hitler and Nazism.
Germany as a whole is dead.
It has nothing left in its heart.
There are riots on the streets.
There is no Germany left to fight for.
Germany must break apart.
It is only through this that we can survive.
No Germany?
Yes, there's nothing left to fight for.
"There's nothing left to fight for"
are the famous last words of every turncoat in the history of warfare.
The weak among us turn to such excuses and abandon our pride and hope when it is only unity that separates the victors from the defeated.
Clearly you have stopped fighting.
But we are still fighting Germany's great war, our war, for what we deserve:
A united Germany, a strong, proud Germany.
Germany is a sleeping giant, and once we rid our nation of the spineless frauds among us and alongside the criminals of Versailles, we will once again know greatness.
[Applause]
Narrator:
After four years of war, a tenuous peace holds.
[Birds cawing]
But anger and resentment are spreading... and shots are about to be fired again.
[Applause]
Adolf Hitler leaves the German army to fully devote himself to the anti-government Workers Party.
Our Germany is dead, and you have conspired...
Narrator:
His popularity and fiery rhetoric make him stand out in the group.
You have bled her with your corruption.
Narrator:
And he's promoted to the head of propaganda.
We will call ourselves the National Socialist Party!
[Cheers and applause]
Narrator:
Under Hitler's leadership, membership in the National Socialist Party quickly expands as Hitler experiences his first taste of real power.
There are many reports from fairly early on about Hitler's charisma as a speaker, and he gradually came to realize that he was indeed a powerful speaker... far more powerful than anyone else around... and began to use that as an asset.
Narrator:
To cast all Germany under his spell,
Hitler needs an image that will burn into the minds of millions.
Nowadays we'd call it a logo of course.
It was designed personally by Hitler, and it may be that he put some of his artistic impulses into this.
The essential part of it ultimately went back to India, but it was taken up as a symbol of racism and anti-semitism combined with the red background for socialism and the red, white, and black colors for the old Kaiser Reich.
Narrator:
While Hitler is still in the early stages of his revolution,
Benito Mussolini has already amassed an army of followers and is ready to take Italy by force.
For seven days in October of 1922 in a massive show of his popularity.
Mussolini leads a march of 30,000 Blackshirts into Rome.
With the people behind him,
Mussolini and the Blackshirts storm the Royal Palace, forcing the King of Italy to hand over control of the government.
Mussolini came to power in Italy in 1922.
His successful march on Rome was eased by the process of expanding ego and adulation by the people around Mussolini and then eventually most of the public opinion in the country.
This is a dangerous process.
Narrator:
In just months,
Mussolini has been transformed from newspaper journalist to the most powerful man in Italy.
600 miles to the north,
Adolf Hitler is watching everything Mussolini has done, and he wants that same ultimate power for himself.
So he amasses an army of his own.
Hitler does seem early to have been very impressed by Mussolini and indeed by the march on Rome.
His rise to power was modeled on what the Italian Fascists had done in Italy.
On November 8, 1923,
Hitler leads the Nazis into a Munich beer hall where top government officials are meeting.
[Indistinct chatter]
[Gunshots]
Germany is dead, and you have conspired to kill her!
You have crushed her with your incompetence.
You have bled her with your corruption.
[Gun cocking]
You have profaned her by consorting with degenerate peoples.
No more!
The revolution has begun!
Join us now as we give birth to a new Germany!
You watch him, and you think of how Adolf Hitler was able to do that, to get other people to follow him.
I think it was partly because he could persuade people that that was a good thing to do and partly because people were intimidated by him.
Narrator:
After storming the beer hall,
Hitler leads the Nazis into the streets to take the city by force.
But unlike in Italy, the German police are prepared.
Halt!
Ready!
[Guns cocking]
Aim!
Join us!
The National Socialist Party has taken over the government!
[Gunshot]

It is time to end America's threat once and for all.
This summer marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War.
And the beginning of a period that saw two of the deadliest conflicts in our history.
It's a chance to remember those who died.
For their brothers, for their country and for the freedom we enjoy today.
And its a chance to honor the courage and bravery of all those who stepped forward and answered the call to serve.
Men like my Grandfather who marched through France as a member of Patton's army.
Women like my Grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line while he was gone.
So as we listen to the stories of the leaders like Roosevelt and Churchill, let's also remember the citizens whose names will never appear on monuments or in textbooks.
Men and Women who stood firm in the face of evil and in the years since have taken their rightful place in history.
May their sacrifice never be forgotten.

Over a 30-year period, from 1914 to 1945 more than 100 million people will die in the bloodiest conflict the world has ever seen.
But it all began in the slums of Vienna.
At age 25, Adolf Hitler is a poor loner, an aspiring artist, struggling to survive.
Both his parents are dead...
Leaving Hitler truly alone in the world.
He was a lost soul.
He wanted to be an artist, but he couldn't get into the art school, and he ended up living in a flophouse.
Left without any means of support, his only way to make money is selling paintings around town for next to nothing.
Hitler didn't have a plan B when he was rejected.
He just didn't know what to do.
So he started to drift.
He had very little money.
He was living in a hand-to-mouth existence.
He had no clear aim in life at all.
He was, in a sense, waiting for something to happen.
Before long, a chance event 450 miles away will change everything.
June 28, 1914.
An assassin takes down the Archduke of Austria-Hungary.
The murder ignites a deadly conflict that quickly erupts into war.
From the tangle of alliances two sides emerge.
Britain, France, and Russia become known as the Allies, while Austria-Hungary, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire form the Central Powers.
Filled with a patriotic sense of urgency, men on both sides rush to join the fight.
For Hitler, it's the opportunity he's been waiting for.
He quickly rushes to enlist.
He tried out for the Austrian army.
He failed the physical.
He wasn't considered strong enough to carry a rifle.
Rejected by his own country,
Hitler turns to the German army who's accepting almost anyone as they worked to build the largest fighting force in the world.
Germany has finally given Hitler what he's always wanted:
A place to belong.
I think that the decision to enter the military for most people is not a decision to serve.
It may be in a very general sense, but it's more often because something else is motivating you.
Zwei!
Drei!
Vier!
Throughout August of 1914,
Hitler trains as a Private in the German army.
Well, the German army was considered to be the finest army in the world.
It was a massive force... well equipped, well trained, and very well led, and Hitler was swept away.
Being part of the German army was something that Hitler deeply loved.
The structure of training transforms Hitler into a devout German soldier.
Hitler joins 1 1/2 million Germans marching towards the French border and the unified Allied forces.
In the history of warfare, armies this large have never met in combat.
6,000 miles away,
America has nothing to do with the war in Europe.
They're in their own war with Pancho Villa.
The Mexican Revolutionary is carrying out violent attacks on U.S. citizens along the southwestern border.
But he goes too far.
Villa and his men seize an American mining train, brutally killing 16 innocent Americans, leaving the U.S. military no choice but to take action.
Nearly 5,000 American troops cross the Mexican border to take down Villa.
But fighting a guerrilla force with a traditional army is next to impossible.
One army Captain is determined to find a different way.
His name is George S. Patton.
Patton's ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War;
they fought in the Civil War.
He grew up wanting to be a military hero.
He has a reputation for being smart, tough, and for being ruthless.
And he has another quality that's essential in military leadership.
He understands the power of technology, and he doesn't want to fight with cavalry and with horses.
He's looking for new technology that will change the nature of the battlefield.
So the car is fairly new.
If you strap a gun to a car, you've got a new instrument of warfare.
What Patton doesn't know is that he's about to revolutionize warfare.
I think Patton knew only one direction, and that was forward.
He had a lot of charisma.
He was a very colorful leader.
I thought he was very egotistical, and that's fine as long as you translate that into good leadership.
But maybe a little bit over the top.
Almost immediately,
Patton is able to put his plan into action...
And he launches a surprise raid on Pancho Villa's camp.
Faster!
Got 'em on the run.
Go!
Faster!
Get down!
Let's go, let's go!
The bandits are no match for Patton and his mobile army, and by the end of the fight, three of villa's men have been killed, including his second-in-command.
The first use of motorized warfare by the United States army is a huge success, and for Patton, it's the first step in his rise to greatness.
Half a world away, two massive armies collide on the battlefield...
In the first major war with modern technology.
When you look at World War I, it's about machine guns, and, you know, all of these sorts of new killing mechanisms.
It's the beginning of the 20th century as a tech era.
This is not men on horseback anymore.
This is a motorized war.
The advanced weaponry turns the conflict into a slaughter.
230 men are killed each hour... one death every 15 seconds.
Really the machine gun probably did more than anything else.
They found if they dug even shallow trenches and used machine guns, a small number of troops could stop a large attacking force.
And then both sides started to dig trenches.
And so they were locked along this line, the Western front, which was this extraordinarily complex set of trenches that didn't move very much either way.
The trenches cover 25,000 miles.
Laid end to end, they would circle the globe.
The area between the trenches is so deadly, it's known...
As no-man's-land.
Among the German soldiers stationed in the trenches along the Western front is Adolf Hitler.
But even after months on the front lines,
Hitler's still seen as an outcast.
Hitler was regarded by the other troops as something of a loner, something of a rather peculiar eccentric person who kept to himself.
But what Hitler lacks in popularity he makes up for in blind ambition.
Runner!
Command wants this taken to the 3rd Battalion.
- Now!
- Yes, sir.
Hitler's role as a messenger was actually considered perhaps the most dangerous task in trench warfare... running from trench to trench, exposing himself to enemy fire.
The mortality rate for messengers was quite significant.
Pull back!
The Germans are retreating, and Adolf Hitler has been injured, and he has this encounter with a Private Henry Tandey, a British Private.
Tandey has Adolf Hitler in his sights, and even though he's a trained soldier, he can't bring himself to pull the trigger.
If Tandey had pulled the trigger,
Adolf Hitler would have died on the battlefields in World War I, and the whole course of human history would have been changed.
It's one of the great what-ifs in history.
The World Wars have begun with Britain, France, and Russia squaring off against Germany and the Central Powers.
Modern weaponry is causing mass devastation on the battlefields, and tens of thousands of soldiers are now living in overcrowded trenches.
Very soon after the war began, both sides realized, "we can entrench, and the other side can't move us out.
"They can move us backwards a little bit but only at horrendous cost."
And the result of this, the war just bogged down in the muds of northern France.
But in London, one man is convinced he can break the stalemate.
He comes up to the barman and says...
Born into one of the wealthiest families in Britain, he's risen through the ranks at unusual speed...
To become the head of the British Navy.
His name is Winston Churchill.
Churchill had the most enormous self-confidence, and it's easy to see why that was the case.
He was the son of Lord Randolph Churchill, who was a brilliant politician.
And so Churchill, from a very young man, saw himself, almost by divine right, as playing a leading role in politics.
Churchill forms a bold plan that he's certain will change the Allies' fortunes.
He even at that point considered himself a strategist, and he looked for ways to break the stalemate in Western Europe rather than just to get more armies and more artillery, and it actually was fairly thoughtful.
What if we could send a fleet to the south into the Black Sea?
Resupply the Russians?
Well, yes, exactly.
There's no way.
Well, yes, there is.
Through Gallipoli.
Gallipoli?
No.
This is our way in.
With all due respect, we are here to provide information... this is what we are doing.
A lot of people Churchill worked with thought he was a man of contradictions, a Maverick, a loose cannon.
He was known as someone to watch.
His friends would say someone to watch because he's very talented, and his enemies would say someone to watch because he was dangerous.
The Gallipoli peninsula is heavily guarded by the Central Powers.
Churchill's plan is to blast through the narrow strait,
Pushing through to Russia and allowing the Allies to launch an overwhelming attack from the east, opening up a second front against Germany.
If it's successful, the Allies will be able to turn the tide of the war and crush the Central Powers.
More than 100 warships set sail for what will be the largest amphibious invasion the world has ever seen.
People often ask me, "what's the most difficult decision you've ever made?"
It's always the decision of sending men into battle, and the worst part of it all is the night that the battle begins, because you know you've just launched something, and you know that within a few hours
you will start getting calls from the battlefield, from your commanders out in the field, that will tell you how many young men have died.
Yes?
They're halfway up the straits.
They should have broken through by now.
They'll make it.
Four ships sunk.
Another burning.
Losses were to be expected.
The fleet is requesting permission to turn back.
They are to press on at all costs.
This is war.
Gallipoli I don't think could ever have worked.
The troops who stormed ashore were met by a hail of machine gun fire and artillery, and the casualties were appalling.
The invasion is a devastating failure.
56,000 Allied troops are killed and nearly 200,000 are reported injured or missing.
Almost no ground is gained...
And the supply route to Russia remains closed off.
I think Churchill's credibility after Gallipoli was certainly called into question.
Warfare is not a science.
The one thing you do know when you commit to warfare is, it's gonna be horrible.
The public is outraged by the carnage.
Someone will have to take the blame.
It's over.
The plan was sound.
Excuse me?
The plan was sound.
All we needed to do was keep pushing forward.
I'm afraid your services as First Lord of the Admiralty are no longer required.
I'll expect your letter of resignation in the morning.
When Churchill was let go, he thought his career was over, finished.
And that wasn't melodrama on his part, and he could be melodramatic.
It appeared that it would be finished.
It's hard to imagine Churchill being humbled by something like Gallipoli, but he was chastened.
He thought, "never again.
"The next time, if there's a next time"... and it didn't look like there would be...
"I'll do it right."
Defeated and humiliated,
Churchill's career is all but ruined.
He's offered a desk job which he turns down.
He knows if he's ever going to redeem himself, he needs a new path.
So Churchill does the unthinkable.
He enlists in the British army...
And heads straight for the front lines.
While Winston Churchill looks for redemption,
Germany looks to capitalize on its victory at Gallipoli, devising a plan to eliminate the Russian threat once and for all.
The Germans load a secret weapon onto a heavily guarded train headed for Russia.
It's a weapon that promises to destroy their enemies from the inside out.
That weapon is Vladimir Lenin.
Lenin is the leader of Russia's Communist Revolutionaries hell-bent on toppling the Russian Czar.
For the past ten years, he's been in exile in Switzerland until Germany sends him home on a train along with over $10 million to fund his revolution.
The Germans decided that they would take this enormous gamble and bring Lenin back to Russia to bring about a revolution to get Russia out the war.
That's about as radical a step as you can take.
When Lenin gets to Moscow, he's greeted by an old friend.
Six times he's been exiled to Siberia, and six times he's escaped.
His name is Joseph Stalin.
Comrade.
Comrade.
Let me show you to your new place.
Reunited, the two play right into Germany's plan as they begin to plot an armed rebellion.
Over the next few months,
Lenin and Stalin recruit a massive workers' militia.
Using the $10 million from the German government, they quietly amass a stockpile of weapons...
Until they are ready to make their move.
I've arranged to take the train stations and the telephone communications.
And the Palace guard?
Many of our sources say they are sympathetic to our cause.
Our timing has to be perfect.
The Communists storm the Winter Palace, toppling the Russian Czar.
The Soviet union is born.
This is just the beginning, comrade.
Just days later,
Lenin signs a decree that takes Russia out of the war.
The German plan works, bringing them one step closer to victory.
Europe is at war, and in a bold move, the Central Powers have ended the fighting on the eastern front, sending exiled revolutionary Vladimir Lenin back to Russia where he seized control of the country and took the Russian army out of the fight.
Germany can turn its attention to the other Allies, and one of the countries now forced to fend off a new wave of German soldiers is Italy.
Italy joined the fight in 1915 and now must face the full might of the German army for the first time.
Tens of thousands of troops are rushed to defend the Italian border in the alps.
Among them is a sharpshooter named Benito Mussolini.
Before the war, Mussolini is an antiwar activist.
He's a journalist.
He's pretty much a pacifist.
The time spent defending Italy's border makes Mussolini hungry to return Italy to greatness.
Mussolini becomes a very different person than he was before the war.
His whole attitude toward his nation and his role in it changes.
He develops this hyper sense of nationalism, this real pride in his country.
The horrors of war have transformed Mussolini into a ruthless killing machine.
A trait he'll take back with him to Rome.
600 miles to the north in Belgium, the British army digs in...
Since the beginning of the war, nearly 400,000 British soldiers have been killed just to be replaced by new arrivals.
Among the new recruits is a man battling back from the biggest failure of his life...
Winston Churchill.
Churchill took responsibility for everything he ever did in his life.
He never passed the buck.
He was humbled, humiliated by Gallipoli, and he had to do something, and he put himself in harm's way and volunteered to go to the trenches.
It was a very dangerous thing to do.
- Move!
- Go!
Sir, 2nd Platoon lost this main trench.
Get me the Mortar Team from the West Reserve now.
You get the hell scared out of you first of all.
The first time I got shot at, um, was,
"hey, this isn't a game.
This is for real.
This guy really missed me, and he killed somebody else.
But tomorrow he'll try to kill me."
As we say in the military, that opens your nostrils.
With British casualties escalating,
Churchill is quickly promoted and discovers he has what it takes to lead men into battle.
For a man of Churchill's ambition, it's the first step towards redemption.
In his heart, what Churchill always wanted to be was the great warrior, the great hero.
Here he was commanding a mere 800 men, whereas he dreamed of directing the battle destinies of millions.
The fight seems unending...
Mail!
Until Germany unleashes a secret weapon.
Incoming!
Gas!
Move!
Move!
Out of the way!
Go!
Go, go, go, go!
The fight between the Central and Allied powers has become the bloodiest war in human history.
By 1917, nearly 7 million British, French, and German soldiers have been killed.
- Gas!
- Go.
It was a war of attrition.
You had to kill as many of the enemy as you could so you could possibly advance.
Chemical warfare just enabled that in a very horrific way.
For a way to alter the course of the war.
So they look to the one country that could finally tip the scales in their favor.
Until now, President Woodrow Wilson has kept America out of the war.
Wilson recognized that the American people did not want to get involved in a war, particularly if it's a war far away involving people and for causes that we had nothing to do with.
Frankly, the American people did not see themselves at immediate risk.
But with hostilities escalating, a peaceful solution seems less and less likely, and Wilson's advisors urge him to begin preparing military forces.
Among them is the 35-year-old Assistant Secretary of the Navy
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Mr. President, I recommend an immediate allocation of more funds to our naval resources if we want to maintain military preparedness.
Wilson found himself being drawn closer and closer to war.
In the spring of 1915, the British liner the lusitania was sunk, and on board were over a hundred Americans.
Now, this was a big deal.
Until this time, it had been a European war.
But now in this European war,
Americans were getting killed.
American resentment grows against Germany, and on February 26, 1917, it to finally reaches a boiling point.
Mr. President, I think you should look at this right away.
The United States intercepts a secret telegram from Germany intended for the Mexican government containing a shocking proposal.
The Germans are offering to fund a Mexican invasion of the United States that would allow the country to reclaim the border states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.
The German ploy was, preoccupy America with a war with Mexico, and therefore you keep them out of Europe.
Well, this incensed a lot of Americans, and rightfully so.
The U.S. government releases the contents of the secret message, and almost instantly, anti-German protests erupt all across America.
The Zimmermann telegram was one of the stupidest things the German government ever did.
Texas didn't care about the war in Europe.
Now all of a sudden, the Germans are trying to return Texas to Mexico?
Enough with Germany.
They need to be taught a lesson.
President Wilson signs the declaration of war in April of 1917.
Germany's plan to keep America out of Europe completely backfires.
The Americans may finally be ready for war, but their military isn't.
The U.S. has a standing army of only 100,000 men while the German army has 4 1/2 million.
The United States hurries to build its military, and those few with fighting experience are rushed to France.
George S. Patton has been presented with a huge challenge...
To command a Battalion of American men using the latest form of military innovation...
The tank.
Some American Generals were really resisting the tank because they didn't want to get rid of the horse cavalry.
George Patton understood the power of the new technology of mobile and armed warfare, and he invested a lot in that.
The tank is already being used on the Western front but with little success.
It runs out of gas too quickly, gets stuck in the mud too easily, and its sheer size makes it difficult to incorporate in military maneuvers.
But where others see an insurmountable challenge,
Patton sees a chance to prove that his tanks can break the stalemate.
I think innovation comes between the ears.
It's not about the gizmo.
It's about how you think about using technology and so forth.
You have to give credit to the people like Patton that experienced World War I, that had been thinking about how to employ new things.
Patton knows the stakes are high.
But with his Battalion of tanks, he's determined to win the war...
Or die trying.
The global war rages in Europe...
As the Allies fight to hold their ground against Germany and the Central Powers... in the sprawling system of trenches.
Things are ugly in World War I.
Europe was staggered, exhausted, many cities in rubble.
Starvation and disease were widespread.
You know, the Red Cross couldn't even keep up with what was going on.
If you were the Allies in Europe, you needed the reinforcements...
The new energy, the new blood.
To aid in the fight, the Allies recruit a new country to their side.
Following their long-awaited entry into the war,
America is ready to make its presence felt.
Their first major offensive is an attack on the Western front hoping to force the Central Powers out of their trenches and drive them out of France.
They're armed with a secret weapon of their own:
A Battalion of lightweight tanks under the command of Colonel George S. Patton.
In a column.
We're gonna go down the main road.
Don't let anyone know we're coming.
- We move at dawn.
- Yes, sir!
Patton is testing his new strategy.
He's leading this new form of weaponry, the tank.
So it's an important battle for him to prove that tanks are valuable on the battlefield and also to establish himself as an important military leader.
For Patton, everything in his career has led up to this moment.
George Patton had grown up to be a soldier.
It was his identity.
And so in the first World War, he is in his element.
The night before the planned invasion,
Patton can't sleep.
Tanks are still unproven in warfare, and Patton knows he can't leave anything to chance.
He slips out of the trenches totally unprotected, deep into the heart of no-man's-land.
He's scouting a route to ensure his machines won't get stuck in the mud.
I think when you look at someone like George Patton, he used intelligence well but I think the best thing he did was, he turned intelligence into action, very quickly.
George Patton's tendency was for action.
Because he was aggressive, for him it worked very, very well.
On September 12, 1918,
Patton and his forces sweep onto the battlefield from every angle...
And the Germans hit back with everything they've got.
But all of Patton's intelligence is paying off...
And his Tank Brigade begins to break down the German line.
Soldier!
- Get on the left flank now!
- Yes, sir.
General, Charlie Company's advancing.
- Take position on the Ridge.
- Yes, sir.
Keep moving!
Keep moving!
Lieutenant George S. Patton, 1st Tank Brigade.
Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur, 42nd Infantry.
General, sir, they need you at the front.
All right, boys!
Let's move up!
Patton and MacArthur.
Here they are in Saint-Mihiel, and they meet on the battlefield for the first time in the midst of artillery shells all around them.
You have these two men who are going to play such an important role in shaping the future of the 20th century, and they have no idea what history has in store for them.
MacArthur is from a long line of military men.
His father was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in the American Civil War.
No less is expected of his son.
Douglas MacArthur would lead attacks walking out into no-man's-land with a swagger.
He was embodied with not only tremendous ability but also tremendous self-confidence.
Watch the right flank!
From an early age, he was different.
He was special.
I don't want to say "anointed".
But he may have thought he was.
The two West Point graduates will be allies and rivals for decades.
I don't think there's any question that a leader who has experienced war and what it means to be in battle.
If you're a military commander, that experience is invaluable.
How you try to ensure that in the midst of all of that chaos and the killing that's going on, that you keep your eye on the mission that has to be accomplished, that's not easy to do.
The two men lead the Allies to victory as the German line crumbles.
And for the first time, the Central Powers are on the run.
Just 240 miles away, years of trench warfare have transformed Adolf Hitler from a directionless loner to a hardened soldier.
Hitler has escaped death twice...
And it's left him a changed man.
Hitler didn't feel at this time during the First World War that he was a man of destiny at all.
What he did feel was a sense of belonging and a sense of commitment, and that, I think, made him braver than he might otherwise have been.
He felt he was fighting in a really important cause, the cause of Germany.
Hitler's ideology takes root on the front lines.
He begins to believe in Germany's superiority over the Allies and is now certain he can withstand anything the Allied forces throw his way.
Gas!
The gas attacks are endless.
To Hitler, they've become almost routine.
But this time it's different.
The Allies hit the Germans with a deadly new form of chemical warfare:
Mustard gas.
It lingers in the trenches for days.
And attacks both the respiratory system and the skin.
Mustard gas affects the central nervous system.
It creates mustard-colored blisters on the skin.
It blinds people.
It strips away the mucous membranes.
It's incredibly painful and debilitating, and since it had no odor, by the time you realized that you had inhaled it, and it was on your skin, it was too late.
After three years of bloody war, the stalemate in Europe has been broken.
The United States has joined the fighting...
Giving Allied armies a needed boost...
Fire!
Pull back!
And driving the Germans back to their original defensive line in northern France.
But the German army remains powerful, meaning the Allies have to act fast.
Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur is seeking every tactical advantage.
Military leaders are human beings that are remarkably different in personality and background.
Every so often, someone crosses the constellation of military leaders a little bit like a shooting star, and Douglas MacArthur did that.
MacArthur learns of a surveillance photograph of German trenches along the Western front...
That reveals an undetected gap in the German line.
Where others see an unbreakable defense,
MacArthur knows he can exploit that weakness.
Intelligence is essential, and the more you can get, the better.
But at the end of the day, it's your instinct as a senior person.
The reason we're wearing stars or have these elevated positions is, we have demonstrated over the years our ability to have an instinct that works.
MacArthur is determined to break through the line and surround the Germans in their trenches...
Supported by George S. Patton and his Battalion of tanks.
In the fall of 1918...
Come on!
Come on!
The Allies launch an all-out attack in what will come to be known...
Fire!
As the 100 days offensive.
Boosted by MacArthur's men.
And Patton's tanks...
Get a move... move!
Move!
The Allied armies become the most dominant fighting force the war has ever seen.
Press forward!
Both of 'em had big egos, but there's no doubt that both of them were brilliant on the battlefield.
Go on, keep advancing!
MacArthur was an extraordinarily talented and effective military leader.
Fire!
Patton, for what he was asked to do, which was trying to break out of the trenches, there was probably nobody better.
Move!
Move!
On, come on!
Move!
Incoming!
Move!
Move!
Move!
The Allies relentlessly attack the German line from every direction.
Move!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
After months of fighting, the Allies finally break through...
Putting the mighty German army on the run.
Finally, with no other option, tens of thousands of German soldiers...
Do it now!
Lay down their guns...
Hands up!
And surrender.
You look at the great leaders.
These were men who understood the most important resource they had available to them to fight a war... not the weapons, not the planes, not the tanks.
It's the soldiers who get it done, and leadership is all about inspiring your soldiers to achieve a decisive win.
After four years of continuous fighting and 37 million casualties, the two sides agree to a cease fire.
When the world is shaking and rearranging itself as it does after a great events, like the end of a war.
There are a whole range of different emotions.
The first is exhilaration, a very personal feeling, exhilaration at being part of an event that is changing the world, and there's never much time to look back.
There's always a lot to look forward to.
While most of the world celebrates the end of the fighting, some deep in the heart of Germany refuse to accept defeat.
Hitler was wounded in the gas attack at the very end of the war, and he was then hospitalized, temporarily blinded.
That our people will be losing the war against the Western armies...
While he was in hospital, he was then told that Germany had lost the First World War, and that's a crucial turning point in Hitler's life.
In Hitler's worldview, it was always, um, dead or alive, win or total defeat.
For him, surrender was something un-German.
You are a coward, somehow, if you surrender.
Hitler took the surrender personally...
A personal destructive blow to himself.
He also took it as a mission, a mission in life to avenge and rectify the surrender.
After four long and bloody years and 37 million casualties, the United States and the Allies have finally claimed victory, forcing Germany to surrender.
But while the fighting has stopped, the pressure is now on the Allied leaders to come to an agreement preventing war from ever breaking out again.
As negotiations to secure the peace get underway in France, massive crowds greet the world leaders...
Including United States President
Woodrow Wilson.
Woodrow Wilson was the first President of the United States to spend anywhere near six months outside this country, and he felt that for him to send anyone else to negotiate the peace, it would not have been as well done.
Wilson said, "Whatever happens with the settlement of this war,
"if it goes well, give me credit.
If it doesn't, blame me."
The leaders gather at the Palace of Versailles.
But one country not invited to the table is Germany.
Gentlemen, please, please sit down.
If we can start by considering the points before we discuss any of the individual ideas...
The main thing that Woodrow Wilson wanted to accomplish at Versailles was defanging Germany, not allowing them to develop a huge war machine again.
This was what the victors all wanted to see happen.
But as negotiations get underway,
Wilson quickly realizes that each country has come to the table with their own agenda.
There were these national leaders who had different views of what they wanted out of the Paris peace conference.
They had led their countries through this brutal, bloody, long war, and Wilson waltzes in with the Americans just at the end.
So they had to listen to him, and Wilson could be kind of persuasive... but not that persuasive.
As negotiations drag on for months, the talks fall apart, and one Allied nation feels completely cut out of the negotiations.
Japan entered the war in 1914, contributing thousands of troops and millions of dollars to the war effort.
They come to Versailles with one goal:
To be treated equally.
But Allied leaders completely ignore Japan throughout the proceedings, and for Japan, it's the ultimate insult.
The Japanese, who'd been on the winning side, get this slap at the peace conference.
So the Japanese became alienated from the United States and from the Western powers, and it was a fairly straight line from there to the belief that,
"if we're gonna get any respect, it's going to be by fighting are way to respect.
The attention shifts from Wilson's plan for a lasting peace to a plan focused on punishing Germany, forcing them to pay for the devastation they've caused.
The reparations that were demanded of Germany were astronomical.
It was a matter of,
"we're gonna squeeze as much out of Germany as we can."
Well, there were some on the American side who said, "we are making the next war inevitable."
Wilson worked against that.
Wilson wanted a somewhat more reasonable peace, and he wanted the Germans to feel that they had a stake in the continuation of the Versailles system.
The problem with the treaty as it was finalized was,
Germany had no stake in that system.
It had every interest in overturning the system.
Despite Wilson's best efforts, he is unable to convince the other Allies to buy into his plan for peace.
After six months of intense negotiations, the Allies finally have a treaty.
But the final agreement is far from the fair and equitable plan
Wilson had originally hoped for.
The losers, Germany principally, they were there.
They didn't get to speak.
They weren't asked to contribute.
They were basically... they had a gun put at their heads figuratively... almost literally... and said, "you're gonna sign on the dotted line."
It was very much a Victor's peace.
The victors dictated the terms of the peace.
They made out like bandits.
Europe is finally at peace.
But while most of the world celebrates,
Germany is ordered to pay the Allies over 80 Billion dollars.
The modern equivalent of nearly 1/2 a trillion dollars, a debt they won't pay off until 2010.
As a result, the government quickly goes bankrupt, leaving millions of Germans impoverished.
The economic devastation completely transforms the country and its people.
Germany immediately is struggling with a question of survival.
For ordinary Germans, the war did not end in November 1918.
For ordinary Germans the battle for survival, the daily struggle for food, the effort to find shoes and clothing stretched on into the 1920s.
As the anger and starvation spread, tensions rise throughout the country.
Germany is in a state of near Civil War.
The left and the right are fighting with each other in the streets.
Paramilitary groups clash.
Germany is a country divided against itself.
When World War I came to an end, this is not a treaty.
This is an armistice that'll probably last 20 years...
Meaning we have not really defeated the German spirit.
We have not really solved this problem.
With the fighting stopped, the treaty for peace is signed at Versailles.
And for the first time in over four years,
Europe is at peace.
While celebrations erupt around the world,
Germany is in a state of unrest, and many are convinced that the peace won't hold.
Among them is Winston Churchill.
Having just returned to England from the front lines, he sets out to reestablish his political career, narrowly winning reelection to his old seat in parliament.
There were a lot of doubts about Churchill.
He seemed erratic in his judgments.
His decision in respect to the Gallipoli campaign had disastrous consequences.
But it was in war that he proved his leadership credentials, and that's what transformed him.
Churchill returns to government convinced the German threat hasn't gone away.
After leading his troops to victory in France,
Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur is given one of the most prestigious positions in the armed forces...
- Will you be late again?
- No, sir!
Superintendent of the Military Academy at West Point.
Where he immediately gets to work preparing American soldiers for combat in case the peace fails.
240 miles away at his tank academy in Camp Meade, Maryland,
Colonel George S. Patton...
Ready!
Is also training the next generation of American soldiers.
Aim!
And like MacArthur, he's betting the cease-fire won't last.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
In Italy, one man sees the end of fighting as an opportunity.
Benito Mussolini returns to his job as a newspaper journalist.
But the country he fought to protect is now in disarray.
The Italians came out of the war on the winning side but failed to gain the territory they had expected to gain, and there's a sense of outrage about this amongst Italian nationalists, a sense almost that Italy has lost the war
despite being on the winning side.
Mussolini uses his newspaper to convey his view of a new Italy, that under a strong leader the country can regain the glory of the Roman empire.
He believes he can be that leader...
The man who returns Italy to greatness.
He soon brings his anti-government views... to a new medium... radio.
We have actually been at war since we lifted the flag of our revolution which was then defended by a handful of men against the masonic, democratic, capitalistic world.
Mussolini was a man of strong words.
He liked the idea of overthrowing existing institutions.
He favored the use of violence to do this.
To make his vision a reality,
Mussolini forms a band of disgruntled former soldiers called the Blackshirts who terrorize his political opponents and begin preparing for an armed revolution.
In a matter of months,
Mussolini has launched a movement that is about to change the fate of Italy.
Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler.
Sir.
Sit down.
- So you're looking for work.
- Yes, sir.
I am ready for duty.
I understand.
Unfortunately, I have nothing.
Nothing?
There is no work.
The war is over.
There has to be something.
After all I've done, after all I've given...
There is a new political group in town:
The German Workers' party.
We need to find out more about them and what their intentions are.
- Yes, sir.
- Try to not stand out.
The Versailles Treaty caused the economic conditions which gave rise to extremism.
You find in history that when an economy is terrible, it gives rise to all kinds of different extremist organizations.
Hitler is assigned to infiltrate the German Workers' party, one of many anti-government organizations that have formed in the wake of the treaty.
For months, he attends secret meetings held at undisclosed locations throughout the country.
They signed away our army.
The Versailles Treaty is not my treaty.
It was as if nothing had happened, as if we are forgotten.
But Hitler soon realizes they are radical nationalists intensely loyal to the fatherland, and many of them harbor extremist views of German superiority.
Views that are no different from his own.
There was never really an effort to deal with all the damage that had occurred during World War I.
The failure to do that
I think is what ultimately produced the seeds for Hitler and Nazism.
Germany as a whole is dead.
It has nothing left in its heart.
There are riots on the streets.
There is no Germany left to fight for.
Germany must break apart.
It is only through this that we can survive.
No Germany?
Yes, there's nothing left to fight for.
"There's nothing left to fight for"
are the famous last words of every turncoat in the history of warfare.
The weak among us turn to such excuses and abandon our pride and hope when it is only unity that separates the victors from the defeated.
Clearly you have stopped fighting.
But we are still fighting Germany's great war, our war, for what we deserve:
A united Germany, a strong, proud Germany.
Germany is a sleeping giant, and once we rid our nation of the spineless frauds among us and alongside the criminals of Versailles, we will once again know greatness.
After four years of war, a tenuous peace holds.
But anger and resentment are spreading... and shots are about to be fired again.
Adolf Hitler leaves the German army to fully devote himself to the anti-government Workers Party.
Our Germany is dead, and you have conspired...
His popularity and fiery rhetoric make him stand out in the group.
You have bled her with your corruption.
And he's promoted to the head of propaganda.
We will call ourselves the National Socialist Party!
Under Hitler's leadership, membership in the National Socialist Party quickly expands as Hitler experiences his first taste of real power.
There are many reports from fairly early on about Hitler's charisma as a speaker, and he gradually came to realize that he was indeed a powerful speaker... far more powerful than anyone else around... and began to use that as an asset.
To cast all Germany under his spell,
Hitler needs an image that will burn into the minds of millions.
Nowadays we'd call it a logo of course.
It was designed personally by Hitler, and it may be that he put some of his artistic impulses into this.
The essential part of it ultimately went back to India, but it was taken up as a symbol of racism and anti-semitism combined with the red background for socialism and the red, white, and black colors for the old Kaiser Reich.
While Hitler is still in the early stages of his revolution,
Benito Mussolini has already amassed an army of followers and is ready to take Italy by force.
For seven days in October of 1922 in a massive show of his popularity.
Mussolini leads a march of 30,000 Blackshirts into Rome.
With the people behind him,
Mussolini and the Blackshirts storm the Royal Palace, forcing the King of Italy to hand over control of the government.
Mussolini came to power in Italy in 1922.
His successful march on Rome was eased by the process of expanding ego and adulation by the people around Mussolini and then eventually most of the public opinion in the country.
This is a dangerous process.
In just months,
Mussolini has been transformed from newspaper journalist to the most powerful man in Italy.
600 miles to the north,
Adolf Hitler is watching everything Mussolini has done, and he wants that same ultimate power for himself.
So he amasses an army of his own.
Hitler does seem early to have been very impressed by Mussolini and indeed by the march on Rome.
His rise to power was modeled on what the Italian Fascists had done in Italy.
On November 8, 1923,
Hitler leads the Nazis into a Munich beer hall where top government officials are meeting.
Germany is dead, and you have conspired to kill her!
You have crushed her with your incompetence.
You have bled her with your corruption.
You have profaned her by consorting with degenerate peoples.
No more!
The revolution has begun!
Join us now as we give birth to a new Germany!
You watch him, and you think of how Adolf Hitler was able to do that, to get other people to follow him.
I think it was partly because he could persuade people that that was a good thing to do and partly because people were intimidated by him.
After storming the beer hall,
Hitler leads the Nazis into the streets to take the city by force.
But unlike in Italy, the German police are prepared.
Halt!
Ready!
Aim!
Join us!
The National Socialist Party has taken over the government!
Unlike Mussolini,
Hitler's attempt to seize power is a failure, and he's arrested and charged with treason.
He spends his time in prison plotting his next move.
To gain followers and to spread his message,
Hitler creates a manifesto...
The heart of which is a radical plan for world domination.
What we must fight for is to safeguard the existence...
And the reproduction of our race and our people.
Coming up on The World Wars...
The fighting may have stopped, but the war isn't over.
Out of a great global depression a new generation of leader emerges.
We must reverse the Treaty of Versailles.
Let these chains be burst asunder.
While some are desperate to maintain the peace...
None of these people, General, want me putting money towards the next war.
Others rise from the ashes, looking to re-ignite a great global war.
Hitler is far more dangerous than anything we've ever faced before!
Bomb every city, every town, every village.
We will annihilate them.
And as the fighting breaks out again...
It's not a request!
It's a damned order.
The fate of mankind hangs in the balance.
It is time to end America's threat once and for all.
Hi, welcome to Big Taters.
My name is Sarah.
Can I start you guys off with an order of our freedom tops?
Sarah, you know the rule about cell phones.
I'm sorry.
I just...
I was just checking on something.
Yeah, well check it on your break.
Mario, where has she been hiding that thing?
Put the car in drive, Charlie.
You're here for one reason and one reason only because...
You know the lines.
Keep your eyes up.
I stopped going to church when I was 16.
- So I don't...
- Up, up, up.
I really haven't been able to take my eyes off of Erin.
The word on the street there's a rumor going around that she's bicycle but sadly I'm sitting here realizing that I've never gone to take a ride...
Oh, hi, how are you?
Good to see you.
- Hey, Sarah.
Nice to see you.
- Hello.
How's it going?
- I'm glad you came.
- Fine.
Yeah.
And I'm glad you brought your wonderful roommate.
- Suck it, Danny.
- I said you were wonderful.
- You coming?
- Hey, I honestly don't know what it is.
Oh, don't be coy.
You're coming.
Yeah, come, and I'll tell you all about my new project.
Yeah, it's really good.
We've been working on it for like the last two,
- three months now.
- Cool.
I'm playing Simone.
She has the best lines in the whole thing.
I've been writing it and Erin has been providing some very insightful feedback.
I am honestly actually kind of surprised to see you here.
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- Erin.
- Why would you think that?
- Because I "stole your role."
Okay, Danny do you want to help me in the kitchen?
Yeah.
- I'm kidding, Sarah.
Don't worry.
- Okay.
I didn't even know that you auditioned for it and it was just a stupid commercial.
Honestly, it was kind of a horrible experience anyway.
The director was a total perv and you should be glad that you didn't get it.
- Okay.
- I'm going to get a drink.
- Sarah?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God, Sarah.
- Did you do something with your hair?
- No.
Are you coming to Performation?
You totally have to.
- Everyone's going to perform something.
- Oh, perform?
Yeah, we'll finally get to see these acting chops that we've heard so much about.
Okay.
I like your shoes, Sarah.
...I'm no ginko but I am Poe.
The Rosebowl's got a table of them.
Hey I had to find the film
- but it works great.
- Oh.
- Here, check this out.
- Oh.
- That's sexy right?
- Yeah.
Danny and I are making a dark room so we can do all the processing.
That's cool.
Well, we were going to do a gallery show but it's just so much easier to put that shit on Instagram.
It's just a way bigger audience.
Are you kidding me?
Beer on my butt.
- Are you okay?
- Dudes, don't.
Nip slip.
Sarah.
- Hey, Sarah, hey you alright?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey listen, so about this script that we were talking about earlier,
I was wondering maybe you and I could get together sometime and...
Oh, my God.
- What's going on?
- Oh, this ad for a role.
- They just called me in for an audition.
- What?
Really?
- That's great.
Congratulations.
- No, way, cool.
- That's cool.
- Thank you.
What is the role for?
It's this movie called The Silver Scream.
Oh, my God.
I hope that's a working title.
- What?
- It's really cool.
Chloe did not get fed up and just take off.
She's not out on another one of her, benders.
She's not out on another one of her benders.
Something happened to her.
I, I went to her...
I...
I...
I went over to her trailer and I...
Sorry.
I, I went to...
I...
I went to...
I...
Oh, oh, God.
I'm...
I'm...
Sarah Walker.
I'm Sarah Walker.
I'm Sarah Walker.
Hi, Sarah.
I brought a headshot.
That won't be necessary.
We have your digital file.
Yeah, of course.
I just thought you might want a hard copy.
What you do in this room right now will render that headshot null and void.
When you exit this room you will either have made a lasting impression or blend into the sea of thousands of forgotten girls who pass through these halls every day.
A photograph won't change that.
Okay.
Well, hopefully you'll see something in me because I know I'd be great for this.
I grew up on scary movies and I'm an actor obviously.
So I, I think I'd be pretty good.
Don't tell us, Sarah.
Show us.
Chloe didn't get fed up with the shoot and just take off.
She's not out there on one of her benders.
- Something happened to her.
- Happened to her, like what?
I went to her trailer after everyone said that she took off and I found this.
- And?
- Her dad gave her this, Chaz.
On the morning of her birthday before he left for work
- when he still lived in Long Island.
- So?
So her birthday is September 11.
Her dad died that morning in the World Trade Center.
She would never leave without this.
- No way, not ever.
- Okay, so she wouldn't leave without it.
I mean, that still doesn't mean something happened.
Well, that's not all.
When I was in her trailer
I-I heard a shuffling and then I saw something out of the corner of my eye.
Don't say it.
Don't tell me you're believing these stories now too.
I turned.
I saw her, Chaz.
- Saw who?
- Chloe.
So she's still here.
It was her... only it wasn't.
- Thank you, Sarah.
- No problem.
We'll be in touch.
Okay.
Do you have any notes for me?
I can do it again, different if you didn't like what you saw.
We saw what we needed, Sarah.
Thank you.
Fuck.
Fuck.
God.
Fuck.
Fuck!
God!
Maybe we didn't see all we needed from you after all.
What was that you were doing in the washroom, Sarah?
What?
Your fit.
That... that was nothing.
Sarah, you have my attention.
- I was disappointed in myself.
- So you punished yourself.
No, I don't...
It's just something I do.
I don't know.
Would you do it again, for us, now?
- What?
- I want to see your fit, Sarah.
I've never done that in front of anyone before.
Alright then, thank you for coming in.
Thank you, Sarah.
We'll be in touch.
Hey, how'd it go?
How did the audition go?
What happened?
Not good.
I think they made fun of me.
What?
I don't really want to talk about it right now.
Okay, well, hey, everyone's coming by in a little bit.
You should come hang out with us.
I kind of want to be alone.
Thanks.
Our little tater tot full of birthing cheer, our little tater tot has lived another year.
I love birthdays.
Again with the phone, Sarah?
Am I going to have to start frisking you?
David, what are you doing standing there staring at me?
I told you to go defrost those chicken strips like an hour ago.
They're like a block of ice.
Jesus Christ.
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling you back.
You just called me.
Hello Sarah.
Yes, we tried to call...
Yes, yeah, I'm so sorry about that.
- I was...
- Please don't cut me off, Sarah.
We'd like to see you again.
Yes, yeah, yeah, I would...
I would love to come in again.
Great.
I'll e-mail you the details.
And Sarah, this will be different from the last time.
Oh, well good because I only have so much hair on my head.
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much
- and I'm sorry that I cut you off...
- Yeah.
Jeez.
What's going on with you lately?
Listen, Sarah,
Tater's girls are all family.
So, if one of you isn't on the ball then that affects the whole family.
You would never want to hurt your family now, would you, Sarah?
- I don't really have a family, Carl.
- I'm talking about your Big Tater's family, the phone thing, all these auditions that you're going on.
I know it's important to you but...
this is your job.
You got to prioritize.
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- I know that I am.
I think I may have to quit.
No, I don't...
You didn't understand what I was trying to say.
This job is getting in the way, Carl.
I have a talent, a real talent and I'm not going to take that for granted anymore.
Now that's...
You...
You're twisting my words around and that's not what I meant.
Let me...
Let's...
Let's start over.
You have a gift.
No.
This.
This place.
Sarah, there are a million other girls who would beg for a steady job like this.
I am not a million other girls.
You can go right in.
Close the door behind you.
Step forward please.
Stand right on that pink mark.
It's so dark.
Lower your hand.
Thank you for seeing us again, Sarah.
Of course, yeah, this is my top priority.
Today we'd like to try something different with you.
Of course.
Sure, I...
I didn't get any...
- Would you mind disrobing for us?
- Excuse me?
Would you mind disrobing, please?
The ad didn't say anything about nudity.
Does the role call for that?
It doesn't.
Sarah, you've already proven that you can memorize lines.
Now we need to see you bare.
Let your inhibitions go.
Didn't I do that last time?
That's the reason you're here Sarah, the only reason you got a call back.
Sarah, you know who we are.
You know the pictures we've made, yes?
Completely, Sarah.
It's okay, Sarah.
I told you this would be different.
Sarah, relax yourself.
Sarah, if you can't fully let yourself go, how can you ever transform into something else?
That's what we were looking for, Sarah.
Thank you.
Okay, okay.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
If I have to take one more goddamn photo of you two idiots jumping,
I swear to God I'm going to kill myself.
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey.
Hey, how'd it go?
- Tracy told us that you had a callback.
- Oh, yeah, they wanted to see me again.
Yeah, I read the ad.
The role seemed a little silly though.
Yeah, but it's Astreus Pictures so it's legit.
It's Astreus?
Wow, that is legit.
They're the real deal.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
- Good job.
Don't you think it's kind of a long shot, though?
What's Extra, Extraneous...?
- Astre...
Astreus Pictures.
- Astreus.
It's stupid.
They're a production company.
They've been around forever.
Fell off a little last few years but they're coming back?
Maybe you can put in a word with production, get a little PA work or something?
- What about our film?
- We're still going to make our film.
Well, I haven't gotten the role yet.
So...
That's true.
- Oh, Trace.
- Hey.
Hey.
- How'd it go?
- Great.
I think it went great.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
You didn't feel like they were making fun of you this time?
No, you know what, I don't think they were making fun of me the first time either.
- Oh, okay.
Awesome.
- Yeah.
- Anyway, I don't want to jinx it.
- Of course.
- You and your superstitions.
- Yeah.
Hey, you should go throw on a bathing suit and come join us.
Oh, shit.
Yo, Erin, Erin.
Shit.
Ashley, here.
Here, here.
Here, you're okay.
You're okay.
You're okay...
Sarah, if you can't really let yourself go how can you transform into something else?
- Hello?
- I have some good news for you, Sarah.
He wants to meet you.
He, who?
The producer.
Oh, my God.
...this is your moment.
Oh, man.
- I don't know what this is.
- Jesus Christ, can we not watch another one.
- Wait, wait, just...
- Do you know who wrote this?
Watch what he does.
I'm not trying to be rude but this is fucking stupid.
Oh, yeah.
That guy rocks.
Do you know how many times I've wanted to do that?
It's crazy.
Wow.
- That's right, you have that thing.
- What thing?
She's got a meeting with the producer.
- At Astreus?
- Yeah.
I told you you'd get it.
Don't you think you're a little overdressed?
- This?
This is nothing.
- It's a little much.
Look, you look amazing.
Go kick some ass.
Just remember to be yourself in here.
Sarah,
- thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having me.
You're just as beautiful in person as you are on the audition tapes.
Thank you.
I didn't realize I was being taped.
Well, I am excited, Sarah.
We audition a lot of young women in this building but very, very few ever make it to this room.
Wow, that's great.
Yes, we've had our share of winners, some pretty big names have passed right through here, going way back.
So, did you like our little yarn?
Absolutely, I loved it.
I read it three times.
Good.
I have high hopes for this picture.
Yes.
It's kind of my love letter to this town.
Ambition, the blackest of human desires.
Everyone has it.
But how many act on it?
That's what intrigues me.
That's what lights me up as they say.
There's something primal they're and that's why you're sitting right here in this room.
- But I mean, it's a horror movie as well.
- Of course.
The two are not mutually exclusive.
This industry is a plague Sarah, a plague of unoriginality, hollow be thy name, shallow be thy name.
Yes, it's a plague alright.
And what does every plague have a lot of?
- Rats?
- Precisely.
Yes, thousands of them, hungry little rats, hungry for the cheese.
You cut through the fog of this town and you get desperation, plastic parishioners worshiping their deity of debauchery.
But that's what I find interesting, Sarah.
That's what I want to capture in this film, the ugliness of the human spirit.
Yeah, okay, I mean, I can see that.
So why do you do it, darling?
Why, why do I do what?
Why do you pull your beautiful hair out?
I...
It's just a habit.
I started doing it when I was a little girl and... it helps me focus on the moment.
The moment.
- Well, this is a moment.
- Yes, yes it is.
The role of Celeste is a really big deal for a young actress with no other credits to her name.
Your face will be on the poster.
The poster on a wall, a wall in the lobby, a lobby of a movie theater, a theater with a marquee,
The Silver Scream.
Now you know that doesn't happen very much anymore, right?
This is a great opportunity for a young actress, a great opportunity for an actress with ambition.
That's me.
I'm your girl.
I will do whatever it takes for this role.
Good, because we want to offer it to you.
We think you could be great in this role, Sarah.
I think you could be great in this role.
I agree.
Truthfully, I think I am this role.
I mean, this character has a dream and she has so much potential.
Sarah, forget about all that.
This world is about the doers, the people who don't just talk about what they're going to do, they just do it.
And that's you.
Thank you.
Thank you for saying that.
I worked so hard, you know.
Every week is a new class, a new audition and I just never...
If you want me to...
to read more with... other actors, or another audition.
Sarah, this is the audition.
I told you before, very, very few actresses ever get to this room.
Sarah, you're at the gates.
All you need is for me to open them for you.
I can make you a star, Sarah.
- You know I can.
- Whoa, no.
Let me out.
Let me out.
Open the door.
How'd it go?
Not good.
- Maybe I should submit my headshot.
- Seriously.
I'm kidding.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, honey, I'm kidding.
Hey.
- Maybe you should...
- Yeah.
It was a fucking joke.
Coming in.
What are you doing?
Hey, don't cry, hun.
What happened?
Everything was going so well.
I was so sure I was going to get it.
I quit my job for this.
You quit your job for this?
I was so sure.
I was so sure.
Okay, wait a minute, what happened?
It was one final step and I could have had it too if I was just willing to...
Hun, willing to what?
Come on, you don't...
You don't mean sex.
I mean, he didn't say specifically what.
Oh, my God.
Are you being serious?
What a fucking creep, okay.
Do people still even do that?
Well, no one out there does.
And I sure as heck don't.
And you don't.
Okay?
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
Wait, you don't wish that you did it do you?
It was a gateway part.
Sarah, it was two auditions.
I mean, and seriously, who gets hired for a lead role that quickly?
Doesn't that seem a little suspicious to you?
Listen, Danny was just telling me how badly he wants to have you in his movie.
You should talk to him.
Oh, shut up.
What are they up to now?
I can make you a star, Sarah.
You know I can.
So I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
I know that you were trying to help me and I twisted your words.
I twisted them and...
Look, Sarah, I get it.
Really, I do.
I'm not an idiot.
I know what town we live in.
I mean, you think you're the first waitress I've ever had that was destined for stardom?
I've had my share.
But they all understood that being a Taters girl is what paid the bills while they chased the dream.
Now I'm not sure you see how the two are connected.
I mean, I don't know what else you want me to say.
Do you want me to beg for this job?
Well, you don't got to be a jerk about it.
I mean, I've already had like,
- 20 applications since you quit, so...
- I'm sorry.
I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.
Look, I want you to see this place for what it really is.
Yeah, I know you think it's cheesy.
Too self-aware, not ironic enough for you, the menus, the specials, all those clever meal names, calling the little kids tater tots, saying see you later tater gator when the customers are leaving.
That's all me.
All right?
It may not be cool to a young woman your age
- but it's me.
- Okay.
Look, just... promise me that until your star is on the sidewalk out there you'll try and value me and what I'm trying to do here.
Can you...
Can you do that for me?
Are you a Taters girl?
Yeah, I can do that.
I'm a Taters girl.
I guess my point is that I just feel like, the austerity lifestyles, sort of eastern lifestyles exists...
I got no friends at my party.
Hey.
Back to slumming it like the rest of us?
Hey.
Hey.
- What's up, Erin?
- Hi.
What's up?
Do you have like, an amp for that?
This is good.
Who knows how to scat?
This is the issue with the millennial generation.
It's just, it's entitlement.
Hey, you get off my lawn.
It's my property you're sitting on.
You're loitering.
I could have you arrested.
It's a crime.
It's where I live.
- You live there?
- Yeah.
Why?
See, it's LA.
Why should I spend $1500 a month on an apartment when I'm just going to spend all day in the car anyway?
- So this is your car too?
- It's my car.
It doesn't run but... it did when I had that epiphany.
Tracy told us what happened.
Told you, told you what?
That the producer at Astreus got inappropriate.
Maybe it's worth it.
I just started back up at Big Taters yesterday.
I kind of feel like I'm selling my soul already.
So it may as well be for something I love.
I don't know.
If you want to do what you love, why not just do it?
I mean, you work at this restaurant.
You work at Big Taters.
I live in a van.
So what?
Those things aren't mutually exclusive from us being able to do what we want to do.
We got all these people, all our friends, they're just sitting around trying to figure out what to do, trying to figure out how to make something.
Maybe we should be sitting around anymore.
Maybe we should just get together and make something.
I'm going to send you my script.
You're going to dig it, trust me.
And we'll work around your precious Big Taters schedule.
You'd direct me?
Yeah.
I'd be your leading lady?
I say rape, you say don't.
- Sure.
- Simone?
If you want.
Then, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I'll be in your movie.
Alright, okay.
I've been trying to talk to you about it for a week.
Fuck Astreus Pictures.
We're going to make our own movie.
All right?
Do you have any champagne?
Okay.
Hold on.
What is it?
It's the start of the night we're never going to forget.
Three, two, one.
This world is about the doers, the people who don't just talk about what they're going to do, they just do it.
And that's you.
Astreus Pictures.
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling.
I made a mistake.
I never should have left that office.
I want to meet him again.
582 Canyon Drive.
Be there in one hour.
Come in, Sarah.
There won't be a third opportunity, Sarah.
Your house is beautiful.
Do you want me to read a scene?
Do you want to discuss the role some more?
I'm sorry that I left the other night.
I'm...
I'm...
I...
I really could be great for this part.
Words, Sarah, just words.
What would you be willing to do to convince me, to make me believe in you again?
Would you forgo your eyes for a new pair of eyes, eyes that see with our vision?
Would you give up your body to become a vessel for our voice, for my voice?
Will you give your old life away for a glorious, new life?
Yes.
Then show me.
The gateway is opened, Sarah.
All you have to do is be willing to step inside forever and never look back.
Kill your old life, Sarah.
Bury it in the earth and join us in the skies.
Show me the girl I thought you were.
Let me see the real, Sarah.
Sarah, order's up.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Sarah.
Go home.
You shouldn't be here right now.
No, no, it's...
I'm fine.
It's fine.
It's not fine.
What are you doing?
Come here.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Give me that.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Get the fuck out of here and don't come back.
Astreus Pictures.
This is Sarah Walker calling.
I'm not feeling very well.
I mean, I'm fine.
It's fine.
I just...
I don't...
I don't know what's happening right now.
So if someone could...
If someone could please call me back when you get this, please.
Thank you.
Are you okay?
Are you alright?
Hey, Sarah, you alright?
Let me look at you.
Come here.
Hey, are you okay?
You alright, Sarah?
- Danny, get drunk with me.
- I'm alright right now, man.
But I love you.
I love you very much.
Suit yourself but we won't be able to sneak booze into the bowl.
It easy to sneak booze in.
All you have to do is flirt with the dude at the door.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, I'll give that a shot.
Dude.
She's going to Ralph.
Hey, I think maybe we need to get her home.
Get her like some water or something.
- Yo, Poe, put that away.
- No, no, no, this is golden.
I'm going to make a Tumblr.
It's going to be called Sick, slutty Sarah, yeah.
No, you're not.
What the fuck are you thinking?
- Damn it, leave him alone.
- I love you.
It's okay.
Give me my fucking phone!
- Whoa!
- Jesus.
Dude.
Sarah?
What the...
I was trying to stop him.
What...
- Okay, what...?
- Let's just keep it funny everybody.
- Relax.
- Am I the bad guy now?
- Why are you defending her, Danny?
- Go after her.
She's sick.
Sarah, you shouldn't go down there.
It's not safe.
Go after her.
She's going to...
She just pushed me.
She's not going to want me to...
I mean it.
She's obviously not feeling well.
Astreus Pictures.
Hello?
Hello?
I don't feel good.
I don't feel...
Hello?
!
I did what you asked.
Hey, you okay?
How dare you!
How dare you touch me!
How dare you!
I'm sorry.
Sarah, if you can't really let yourself go how can you ever transform
- into something else?
- You're at the gates.
All you need is for me to open them for you.
Maybe we didn't see what we needed from you after all.
Your face would be on the poster, the poster on the wall, a wall in a lobby, the lobby of the movie theater, a theater with a marquee.
They are all losers.
Cancer.
Kill your old life, Sarah.
Bury it in the earth and join us in the skies.
Sarah?
You okay?
Go away.
Listen, I really need to get in there.
I...
Just go away please.
You've been in there for like, two hours.
I have to get ready for work.
Are you okay?
Sweetie, what...?
Do you smell that?
I think it's coming from you.
Yeah,
Sarah, no offense, but I mean, that's you.
- Are you on your period?
- What?
Fuck you.
All right, that's enough, okay.
I've had enough of your shit.
What the hell's going on with you?
You told them.
- You told them.
- Who?
What?
About my audition.
And the producer,
- right?
- It came...
I bet you all got off on it too, right?
- No.
- Seeing me fail like that?
Sarah, those are your friends.
Okay, nobody wanted that for you.
They're your friends!
They're your friends!
I am trying to do something big.
I'm trying to do something with my life.
How am I supposed to do this when you surround me with these... losers?
Do you hear the words that are coming out of your mouth right now?
They're like venom to me, like, like a cancer, all of you guys, just all of you.
You and Danny, Erin, just like, living off of me.
Oh, living off of you?
Okay, the last time I checked I covered your rent for the past two months and I'm guessing you don't have this month's either because you're so obsessed with this job that just wants to fuck you
instead of the job that actually pays your bills.
What the fuck?
Now it's our apartment again.
So do me a favor, Trace, and fuck off!
Sarah.
Don't fight it.
Sleep now, Sarah.
We want to show you something.
I hope that's a working title.
- Are you sure you really...
- Danny was just talking about it...
Maybe we get to see the acting chops that we've heard so much about.
- Sarah, are you a Tater's girl?
- Tracey told us what happened.
He was just telling me...
You know what you have to do.
What's the matter, Sarah?
Are you not feeling well?
I'm dying.
- I'm dying.
- Yes, you are.
You can go into the ground to be forgotten forever or you can be reborn.
Did you expect it to be painless, that it would be easy, that you'd simply wake up one morning with everything you ever wanted laid out before you?
I told you Sarah, dreams require sacrifice.
And so do we.
I can give you what you want Sarah, but you need to embrace who you really are.
It's time to become one of us.
It's time to be remembered.
Grab something.
Hit him.
I can't get over comfortable your bed is.
More comfortable than the five year old futon you've been dragging around since college?
I got to pee.
- You want anything?
- Yeah, I want some water and a treat, a little special something.
Okay.
- Bravo.
- Jesus fucking Christ.
Sarah?
You scared the shit out of me.
Don't!
Sarah, what are you doing here?
You let him put that revolting thing in you.
And then he gives you the role of Simone back.
You were watching us?
You think I had to fuck Danny to get a role in his movie?
That's sad that you see the world like that.
Sarah, you know that me and Danny have hooked up before, right?
Did it ever occur to you that maybe we just like each other?
Sarah, get the fuck out of here.
You know what's sad?
You.
All of you.
A role in Danny's little film, how sad.
What's sadder is that you think I want any of it, that I'd sink so low.
Right.
Why would you have to fuck Danny for her role when you've already fucked some big time movie producer?
Yeah, Tracy told us about the stack of cash from Astreus Pictures.
Oh, my God,
Sarah, did you...
Did you actually suck some old producer's cock for a role in a movie called The Silver Scream?
That's sad.
It's a gateway part.
From here it sounds a lot like prostitution.
Don't!
- Sarah, what happened to you?
- Don't, don't touch me.
- Sarah...
- Don't touch me.
- Sarah.
- Don't.
Stop it, stop it.
- We need to get you to a hospital.
- No, no, get off me.
It feels good.
See what happens when you stop fighting?
Trust us, Sarah.
Don't hurt yourself.
Let us in.
Embrace who you are.
What's up?
Sarah?
What are you doing here?
Hey, did you see Erin?
Yeah.
We talked.
Okay, what did you talk about?
You.
Right.
Did she tell you how worried we are about you?
Since you ran off the other night?
You know, Tracy came by here, she said the two of you had a big fight.
We're all pretty concerned.
Look, Sarah, whatever is going on... we can help you.
You know, just talk to me.
You, help me?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm your friend.
No, you're not.
None of you are.
Sarah, of course we are.
Sarah?
Jesus, what's wrong with you?
Are you...?
I don't have any friends.
Wait!
Don't!
Sarah, don't, don't.
Why, why?
There's only one thing in this whole world that I want and they're going to give it to me.
They see the real me.
Yes.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail...
She is ready to transform.
Sarah?
Sarah, are you here?
Sarah?
Are you in there?
Sarah?
All right, this is just weird.
And a fire hazard.
Look, I'm sorry, okay.
I shouldn't have told everyone what happened.
That's your business.
If you wanted them to know then well you would've told them.
Anyway, I needed to say that.
Hey, are you okay in there?
You're hurting me.
Your eyes.
You told everyone.
Lie down next to me.
Come lie next to me, Trace, like old times.
I don't want to do that.
Come to me.
We're all alone.
There's nothing.
Things are changing for me, Trace.
That's good.
I'm happy for you.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
Where... are you going?
Just say goodbye to me, Trace.
Hi, welcome to Big Taters.
My name is Sarah.
Can I start you guys off with an order of our freedom tops?
Sarah, you know the rule about cell phones.
I'm sorry.
I just...
I was just checking on something.
Yeah, well check it on your break.
Mario, where has she been hiding that thing?
Put the car in drive, Charlie.
You're here for one reason and one reason only because...
You know the lines.
Keep your eyes up.
I stopped going to church when I was 16.
- So I don't...
- Up, up, up.
I really haven't been able to take my eyes off of Erin.
The word on the street there's a rumor going around that she's bicycle but sadly I'm sitting here realizing that I've never gone to take a ride...
Oh, hi, how are you?
Good to see you.
- Hey, Sarah.
Nice to see you.
- Hello.
How's it going?
- I'm glad you came.
- Fine.
Yeah.
And I'm glad you brought your wonderful roommate.
- Suck it, Danny.
- I said you were wonderful.
- You coming?
- Hey, I honestly don't know what it is.
Oh, don't be coy.
You're coming.
Yeah, come, and I'll tell you all about my new project.
Yeah, it's really good.
We've been working on it for like the last two,
- three months now.
- Cool.
I'm playing Simone.
She has the best lines in the whole thing.
I've been writing it and Erin has been providing some very insightful feedback.
I am honestly actually kind of surprised to see you here.
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- Erin.
- Why would you think that?
- Because I "stole your role."
Okay, Danny do you want to help me in the kitchen?
Yeah.
- I'm kidding, Sarah.
Don't worry.
- Okay.
I didn't even know that you auditioned for it and it was just a stupid commercial.
Honestly, it was kind of a horrible experience anyway.
The director was a total perv and you should be glad that you didn't get it.
- Okay.
- I'm going to get a drink.
- Sarah?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God, Sarah.
- Did you do something with your hair?
- No.
Are you coming to Performation?
You totally have to.
- Everyone's going to perform something.
- Oh, perform?
Yeah, we'll finally get to see these acting chops that we've heard so much about.
Okay.
I like your shoes, Sarah.
...I'm no ginko but I am Poe.
The Rosebowl's got a table of them.
Hey I had to find the film
- but it works great.
- Oh.
- Here, check this out.
- Oh.
- That's sexy right?
- Yeah.
Danny and I are making a dark room so we can do all the processing.
That's cool.
Well, we were going to do a gallery show but it's just so much easier to put that shit on Instagram.
It's just a way bigger audience.
Are you kidding me?
Beer on my butt.
- Are you okay?
- Dudes, don't.
Nip slip.
Sarah.
- Hey, Sarah, hey you alright?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey listen, so about this script that we were talking about earlier,
I was wondering maybe you and I could get together sometime and...
Oh, my God.
- What's going on?
- Oh, this ad for a role.
- They just called me in for an audition.
- What?
Really?
- That's great.
Congratulations.
- No, way, cool.
- That's cool.
- Thank you.
What is the role for?
It's this movie called The Silver Scream.
Oh, my God.
I hope that's a working title.
- What?
- It's really cool.
Chloe did not get fed up and just take off.
She's not out on another one of her, benders.
She's not out on another one of her benders.
Something happened to her.
I, I went to her...
I...
I...
I went over to her trailer and I...
Sorry.
I, I went to...
I...
I went to...
I...
Oh, oh, God.
I'm...
I'm...
Sarah Walker.
I'm Sarah Walker.
I'm Sarah Walker.
Hi, Sarah.
I brought a headshot.
That won't be necessary.
We have your digital file.
Yeah, of course.
I just thought you might want a hard copy.
What you do in this room right now will render that headshot null and void.
When you exit this room you will either have made a lasting impression or blend into the sea of thousands of forgotten girls who pass through these halls every day.
A photograph won't change that.
Okay.
Well, hopefully you'll see something in me because I know I'd be great for this.
I grew up on scary movies and I'm an actor obviously.
So I, I think I'd be pretty good.
Don't tell us, Sarah.
Show us.
Chloe didn't get fed up with the shoot and just take off.
She's not out there on one of her benders.
- Something happened to her.
- Happened to her, like what?
I went to her trailer after everyone said that she took off and I found this.
- And?
- Her dad gave her this, Chaz.
On the morning of her birthday before he left for work
- when he still lived in Long Island.
- So?
So her birthday is September 11.
Her dad died that morning in the World Trade Center.
She would never leave without this.
- No way, not ever.
- Okay, so she wouldn't leave without it.
I mean, that still doesn't mean something happened.
Well, that's not all.
When I was in her trailer
I-I heard a shuffling and then I saw something out of the corner of my eye.
Don't say it.
Don't tell me you're believing these stories now too.
I turned.
I saw her, Chaz.
- Saw who?
- Chloe.
So she's still here.
It was her... only it wasn't.
- Thank you, Sarah.
- No problem.
We'll be in touch.
Okay.
Do you have any notes for me?
I can do it again, different if you didn't like what you saw.
We saw what we needed, Sarah.
Thank you.
Fuck.
Fuck.
God.
Fuck.
Fuck!
God!
Maybe we didn't see all we needed from you after all.
What was that you were doing in the washroom, Sarah?
What?
Your fit.
That... that was nothing.
Sarah, you have my attention.
- I was disappointed in myself.
- So you punished yourself.
No, I don't...
It's just something I do.
I don't know.
Would you do it again, for us, now?
- What?
- I want to see your fit, Sarah.
I've never done that in front of anyone before.
Alright then, thank you for coming in.
Thank you, Sarah.
We'll be in touch.
Hey, how'd it go?
How did the audition go?
What happened?
Not good.
I think they made fun of me.
What?
I don't really want to talk about it right now.
Okay, well, hey, everyone's coming by in a little bit.
You should come hang out with us.
I kind of want to be alone.
Thanks.
Our little tater tot full of birthing cheer, our little tater tot has lived another year.
I love birthdays.
Again with the phone, Sarah?
Am I going to have to start frisking you?
David, what are you doing standing there staring at me?
I told you to go defrost those chicken strips like an hour ago.
They're like a block of ice.
Jesus Christ.
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling you back.
You just called me.
Hello Sarah.
Yes, we tried to call...
Yes, yeah, I'm so sorry about that.
- I was...
- Please don't cut me off, Sarah.
We'd like to see you again.
Yes, yeah, yeah, I would...
I would love to come in again.
Great.
I'll e-mail you the details.
And Sarah, this will be different from the last time.
Oh, well good because I only have so much hair on my head.
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much
- and I'm sorry that I cut you off...
- Yeah.
Jeez.
What's going on with you lately?
Listen, Sarah,
Tater's girls are all family.
So, if one of you isn't on the ball then that affects the whole family.
You would never want to hurt your family now, would you, Sarah?
- I don't really have a family, Carl.
- I'm talking about your Big Tater's family, the phone thing, all these auditions that you're going on.
I know it's important to you but...
this is your job.
You got to prioritize.
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- I know that I am.
I think I may have to quit.
No, I don't...
You didn't understand what I was trying to say.
This job is getting in the way, Carl.
I have a talent, a real talent and I'm not going to take that for granted anymore.
Now that's...
You...
You're twisting my words around and that's not what I meant.
Let me...
Let's...
Let's start over.
You have a gift.
No.
This.
This place.
Sarah, there are a million other girls who would beg for a steady job like this.
I am not a million other girls.
You can go right in.
Close the door behind you.
Step forward please.
Stand right on that pink mark.
It's so dark.
Lower your hand.
Thank you for seeing us again, Sarah.
Of course, yeah, this is my top priority.
Today we'd like to try something different with you.
Of course.
Sure, I...
I didn't get any...
- Would you mind disrobing for us?
- Excuse me?
Would you mind disrobing, please?
The ad didn't say anything about nudity.
Does the role call for that?
It doesn't.
Sarah, you've already proven that you can memorize lines.
Now we need to see you bare.
Let your inhibitions go.
Didn't I do that last time?
That's the reason you're here Sarah, the only reason you got a call back.
Sarah, you know who we are.
You know the pictures we've made, yes?
Completely, Sarah.
It's okay, Sarah.
I told you this would be different.
Sarah, relax yourself.
Sarah, if you can't fully let yourself go, how can you ever transform into something else?
That's what we were looking for, Sarah.
Thank you.
Okay, okay.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
If I have to take one more goddamn photo of you two idiots jumping,
I swear to God I'm going to kill myself.
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey.
Hey, how'd it go?
- Tracy told us that you had a callback.
- Oh, yeah, they wanted to see me again.
Yeah, I read the ad.
The role seemed a little silly though.
Yeah, but it's Astreus Pictures so it's legit.
It's Astreus?
Wow, that is legit.
They're the real deal.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
- Good job.
Don't you think it's kind of a long shot, though?
What's Extra, Extraneous...?
- Astre...
Astreus Pictures.
- Astreus.
It's stupid.
They're a production company.
They've been around forever.
Fell off a little last few years but they're coming back?
Maybe you can put in a word with production, get a little PA work or something?
- What about our film?
- We're still going to make our film.
Well, I haven't gotten the role yet.
So...
That's true.
- Oh, Trace.
- Hey.
Hey.
- How'd it go?
- Great.
I think it went great.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
You didn't feel like they were making fun of you this time?
No, you know what, I don't think they were making fun of me the first time either.
- Oh, okay.
Awesome.
- Yeah.
- Anyway, I don't want to jinx it.
- Of course.
- You and your superstitions.
- Yeah.
Hey, you should go throw on a bathing suit and come join us.
Oh, shit.
Yo, Erin, Erin.
Shit.
Ashley, here.
Here, here.
Here, you're okay.
You're okay.
You're okay...
Sarah, if you can't really let yourself go how can you transform into something else?
- Hello?
- I have some good news for you, Sarah.
He wants to meet you.
He, who?
The producer.
Oh, my God.
- ...this is your moment.
- Oh, man.
- I don't know what this is.
- Jesus Christ, can we not watch another one.
- Wait, wait, just...
- Do you know who wrote this?
Watch what he does.
I'm not trying to be rude but this is fucking stupid.
Oh, yeah.
That guy rocks.
Do you know how many times I've wanted to do that?
It's crazy.
Wow.
- That's right, you have that thing.
- What thing?
She's got a meeting with the producer.
- At Astreus?
- Yeah.
I told you you'd get it.
Don't you think you're a little overdressed?
- This?
This is nothing.
- It's a little much.
Look, you look amazing.
Go kick some ass.
Just remember to be yourself in here.
Sarah,
- thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having me.
You're just as beautiful in person as you are on the audition tapes.
Thank you.
I didn't realize I was being taped.
Well, I am excited, Sarah.
We audition a lot of young women in this building but very, very few ever make it to this room.
Wow, that's great.
Yes, we've had our share of winners, some pretty big names have passed right through here, going way back.
So, did you like our little yarn?
Absolutely, I loved it.
I read it three times.
Good.
I have high hopes for this picture.
Yes.
It's kind of my love letter to this town.
Ambition, the blackest of human desires.
Everyone has it.
But how many act on it?
That's what intrigues me.
That's what lights me up as they say.
There's something primal there and that's why you're sitting right here in this room.
- But I mean, it's a horror movie as well.
- Of course.
The two are not mutually exclusive.
This industry is a plague Sarah, a plague of unoriginality, hollow be thy name, shallow be thy name.
Yes, it's a plague alright.
And what does every plague have a lot of?
- Rats?
- Precisely.
Yes, thousands of them, hungry little rats, hungry for the cheese.
You cut through the fog of this town and you get desperation, plastic parishioners worshiping their deity of debauchery.
But that's what I find interesting, Sarah.
That's what I want to capture in this film, the ugliness of the human spirit.
Yeah, okay, I mean, I can see that.
So why do you do it, darling?
Why, why do I do what?
Why do you pull your beautiful hair out?
I...
It's just a habit.
I started doing it when I was a little girl and... it helps me focus on the moment.
The moment.
- Well, this is a moment.
- Yes, yes it is.
The role of Celeste is a really big deal for a young actress with no other credits to her name.
Your face will be on the poster.
The poster on a wall, a wall in the lobby, a lobby of a movie theater, a theater with a marquee,
The Silver Scream.
Now you know that doesn't happen very much anymore, right?
This is a great opportunity for a young actress, a great opportunity for an actress with ambition.
That's me.
I'm your girl.
I will do whatever it takes for this role.
Good, because we want to offer it to you.
We think you could be great in this role, Sarah.
I think you could be great in this role.
I agree.
Truthfully, I think I am this role.
I mean, this character has a dream and she has so much potential.
Sarah, forget about all that.
This world is about the doers, the people who don't just talk about what they're going to do, they just do it.
And that's you.
Thank you.
Thank you for saying that.
I worked so hard, you know.
Every week is a new class, a new audition and I just never...
If you want me to...
to read more with... other actors, or another audition.
Sarah, this is the audition.
I told you before, very, very few actresses ever get to this room.
Sarah, you're at the gates.
All you need is for me to open them for you.
I can make you a star, Sarah.
- You know I can.
- Whoa, no.
Let me out.
Let me out.
Open the door.
How'd it go?
Not good.
- Maybe I should submit my headshot.
- Seriously.
I'm kidding.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, honey, I'm kidding.
Hey.
- Maybe you should...
- Yeah.
It was a fucking joke.
Coming in.
What are you doing?
Hey, don't cry, hun.
What happened?
Everything was going so well.
I was so sure I was going to get it.
I quit my job for this.
You quit your job for this?
I was so sure.
I was so sure.
Okay, wait a minute, what happened?
It was one final step and I could have had it too if I was just willing to...
Hun, willing to what?
Come on, you don't...
You don't mean sex.
I mean, he didn't say specifically what.
Oh, my God.
Are you being serious?
What a fucking creep, okay.
Do people still even do that?
Well, no one out there does.
And I sure as heck don't.
And you don't.
Okay?
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
Wait, you don't wish that you did it do you?
It was a gateway part.
Sarah, it was two auditions.
I mean, and seriously, who gets hired for a lead role that quickly?
Doesn't that seem a little suspicious to you?
Listen, Danny was just telling me how badly he wants to have you in his movie.
You should talk to him.
Oh, shut up.
What are they up to now?
I can make you a star, Sarah.
You know I can.
So I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
I know that you were trying to help me and I twisted your words.
I twisted them and...
Look, Sarah, I get it.
Really, I do.
I'm not an idiot.
I know what town we live in.
I mean, you think you're the first waitress I've ever had that was destined for stardom?
I've had my share.
But they all understood that being a Taters girl is what paid the bills while they chased the dream.
Now I'm not sure you see how the two are connected.
I mean, I don't know what else you want me to say.
Do you want me to beg for this job?
Well, you don't got to be a jerk about it.
I mean, I've already had like,
- 20 applications since you quit, so...
- I'm sorry.
I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.
Look, I want you to see this place for what it really is.
Yeah, I know you think it's cheesy.
Too self-aware, not ironic enough for you, the menus, the specials, all those clever meal names, calling the little kids tater tots, saying see you later tater gator when the customers are leaving.
That's all me.
All right?
It may not be cool to a young woman your age
- but it's me.
- Okay.
Look, just... promise me that until your star is on the sidewalk out there you'll try and value me and what I'm trying to do here.
Can you...
Can you do that for me?
Are you a Taters girl?
Yeah, I can do that.
I'm a Taters girl.
I guess my point is that I just feel like, the austerity lifestyles, sort of eastern lifestyles exists...
I got no friends at my party.
Hey.
Back to slumming it like the rest of us?
Hey.
Hey.
- What's up, Erin?
- Hi.
What's up?
Do you have like, an amp for that?
This is good.
Who knows how to scat?
This is the issue with the millennial generation.
It's just, it's entitlement.
Hey, you get off my lawn.
It's my property you're sitting on.
You're loitering.
I could have you arrested.
It's a crime.
It's where I live.
- You live there?
- Yeah.
Why?
See, it's LA.
Why should I spend $1500 a month on an apartment when I'm just going to spend all day in the car anyway?
- So this is your car too?
- It's my car.
It doesn't run but... it did when I had that epiphany.
Tracy told us what happened.
Told you, told you what?
That the producer at Astreus got inappropriate.
Maybe it's worth it.
I just started back up at Big Taters yesterday.
I kind of feel like I'm selling my soul already.
So it may as well be for something I love.
I don't know.
If you want to do what you love, why not just do it?
I mean, you work at this restaurant.
You work at Big Taters.
I live in a van.
So what?
Those things aren't mutually exclusive from us being able to do what we want to do.
We got all these people, all our friends, they're just sitting around trying to figure out what to do, trying to figure out how to make something.
Maybe we should be sitting around anymore.
Maybe we should just get together and make something.
I'm going to send you my script.
You're going to dig it, trust me.
And we'll work around your precious Big Taters schedule.
You'd direct me?
Yeah.
I'd be your leading lady?
I say rape, you say don't.
- Sure.
- Simone?
If you want.
Then, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I'll be in your movie.
Alright, okay.
I've been trying to talk to you about it for a week.
Fuck Astreus Pictures.
We're going to make our own movie.
All right?
Do you have any champagne?
Okay.
Hold on.
What is it?
It's the start of the night we're never going to forget.
Three, two, one.
This world is about the doers, the people who don't just talk about what they're going to do, they just do it.
And that's you.
Astreus Pictures.
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling.
I made a mistake.
I never should have left that office.
I want to meet him again.
582 Canyon Drive.
Be there in one hour.
Come in, Sarah.
There won't be a third opportunity, Sarah.
Your house is beautiful.
Do you want me to read a scene?
Do you want to discuss the role some more?
I'm sorry that I left the other night.
I'm...
I'm...
I...
I really could be great for this part.
Words, Sarah, just words.
What would you be willing to do to convince me, to make me believe in you again?
Would you forgo your eyes for a new pair of eyes, eyes that see with our vision?
Would you give up your body to become a vessel for our voice, for my voice?
Will you give your old life away for a glorious, new life?
Yes.
Then show me.
The gateway is opened, Sarah.
All you have to do is be willing to step inside forever and never look back.
Kill your old life, Sarah.
Bury it in the earth and join us in the skies.
Show me the girl I thought you were.
Let me see the real, Sarah.
Sarah, order's up.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Sarah.
Go home.
You shouldn't be here right now.
No, no, it's...
I'm fine.
It's fine.
It's not fine.
What are you doing?
Come here.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Give me that.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Get the fuck out of here and don't come back.
Astreus Pictures.
This is Sarah Walker calling.
I'm not feeling very well.
I mean, I'm fine.
It's fine.
I just...
I don't...
I don't know what's happening right now.
So if someone could...
If someone could please call me back when you get this, please.
Thank you.
Are you okay?
Are you alright?
Hey, Sarah, you alright?
Let me look at you.
Come here.
Hey, are you okay?
You alright, Sarah?
- Danny, get drunk with me.
- I'm alright right now, man.
But I love you.
I love you very much.
Suit yourself but we won't be able to sneak booze into the bowl.
It easy to sneak booze in.
All you have to do is flirt with the dude at the door.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, I'll give that a shot.
Dude.
She's going to Ralph.
Hey, I think maybe we need to get her home.
Get her like some water or something.
- Yo, Poe, put that away.
- No, no, no, this is golden.
I'm going to make a Tumblr.
It's going to be called Sick, slutty Sarah, yeah.
No, you're not.
What the fuck are you thinking?
- Damn it, leave him alone.
- I love you.
It's okay.
Give me my fucking phone!
- Whoa!
- Jesus.
Dude.
Sarah?
What the...
I was trying to stop him.
What...
- Okay, what...?
- Let's just keep it funny everybody.
- Relax.
- Am I the bad guy now?
- Why are you defending her, Danny?
- Go after her.
She's sick.
Sarah, you shouldn't go down there.
It's not safe.
Go after her.
She's going to...
She just pushed me.
She's not going to want me to...
I mean it.
She's obviously not feeling well.
Astreus Pictures.
Hello?
Hello?
I don't feel good.
I don't feel...
Hello?
!
I did what you asked.
Hey, you okay?
How dare you!
How dare you touch me!
How dare you!
I'm sorry.
Sarah, if you can't really let yourself go how can you ever transform
- into something else?
- You're at the gates.
All you need is for me to open them for you.
Maybe we didn't see what we needed from you after all.
Your face would be on the poster, the poster on the wall, a wall in a lobby, the lobby of the movie theater, a theater with a marquee.
They are all losers.
Cancer.
Kill your old life, Sarah.
Bury it in the earth and join us in the skies.
Sarah?
You okay?
Go away.
Listen, I really need to get in there.
I...
Just go away please.
You've been in there for like, two hours.
I have to get ready for work.
Are you okay?
Sweetie, what...?
Do you smell that?
I think it's coming from you.
Yeah,
Sarah, no offense, but I mean, that's you.
- Are you on your period?
- What?
Fuck you.
All right, that's enough, okay.
I've had enough of your shit.
What the hell's going on with you?
You told them.
- You told them.
- Who?
What?
About my audition.
And the producer,
- right?
- It came...
I bet you all got off on it too, right?
- No.
- Seeing me fail like that?
Sarah, those are your friends.
Okay, nobody wanted that for you.
They're your friends!
They're your friends!
I am trying to do something big.
I'm trying to do something with my life.
How am I supposed to do this when you surround me with these... losers?
Do you hear the words that are coming out of your mouth right now?
They're like venom to me, like, like a cancer, all of you guys, just all of you.
You and Danny, Erin, just like, living off of me.
Oh, living off of you?
Okay, the last time I checked I covered your rent for the past two months and I'm guessing you don't have this month's either because you're so obsessed with this job that just wants to fuck you
instead of the job that actually pays your bills.
What the fuck?
Now it's our apartment again.
So do me a favor, Trace, and fuck off!
Sarah.
Don't fight it.
Sleep now, Sarah.
We want to show you something.
I hope that's a working title.
- Are you sure you really...
- Danny was just talking about it...
Maybe we get to see the acting chops that we've heard so much about.
- Sarah, are you a Tater's girl?
- Tracey told us what happened.
He was just telling me...
You know what you have to do.
What's the matter, Sarah?
Are you not feeling well?
I'm dying.
- I'm dying.
- Yes, you are.
You can go into the ground to be forgotten forever or you can be reborn.
Did you expect it to be painless, that it would be easy, that you'd simply wake up one morning with everything you ever wanted laid out before you?
I told you Sarah, dreams require sacrifice.
And so do we.
I can give you what you want Sarah, but you need to embrace who you really are.
It's time to become one of us.
It's time to be remembered.
Grab something.
Hit him.
I can't get over comfortable your bed is.
More comfortable than the five year old futon you've been dragging around since college?
I got to pee.
- You want anything?
- Yeah, I want some water and a treat, a little special something.
Okay.
- Bravo.
- Jesus fucking Christ.
Sarah?
You scared the shit out of me.
Don't!
Sarah, what are you doing here?
You let him put that revolting thing in you.
And then he gives you the role of Simone back.
You were watching us?
You think I had to fuck Danny to get a role in his movie?
That's sad that you see the world like that.
Sarah, you know that me and Danny have hooked up before, right?
Did it ever occur to you that maybe we just like each other?
Sarah, get the fuck out of here.
You know what's sad?
You.
All of you.
A role in Danny's little film, how sad.
What's sadder is that you think I want any of it, that I'd sink so low.
Right.
Why would you have to fuck Danny for her role when you've already fucked some big time movie producer?
Yeah, Tracy told us about the stack of cash from Astreus Pictures.
Oh, my God,
Sarah, did you...
Did you actually suck some old producer's cock for a role in a movie called The Silver Scream?
That's sad.
It's a gateway part.
From here it sounds a lot like prostitution.
Don't!
- Sarah, what happened to you?
- Don't, don't touch me.
- Sarah...
- Don't touch me.
- Sarah.
- Don't.
Stop it, stop it.
- We need to get you to a hospital.
- No, no, get off me.
It feels good.
See what happens when you stop fighting?
Trust us, Sarah.
Don't hurt yourself.
Let us in.
Embrace who you are.
What's up?
Sarah?
What are you doing here?
Hey, did you see Erin?
Yeah.
We talked.
Okay, what did you talk about?
You.
Right.
Did she tell you how worried we are about you?
Since you ran off the other night?
You know, Tracy came by here, she said the two of you had a big fight.
We're all pretty concerned.
Look, Sarah, whatever is going on... we can help you.
You know, just talk to me.
You, help me?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm your friend.
No, you're not.
None of you are.
Sarah, of course we are.
Sarah?
Jesus, what's wrong with you?
Are you...?
I don't have any friends.
Wait!
Don't!
Sarah, don't, don't.
Why, why?
There's only one thing in this whole world that I want and they're going to give it to me.
They see the real me.
Yes.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail...
She is ready to transform.
Sarah?
Sarah, are you here?
Sarah?
Are you in there?
Sarah?
All right, this is just weird.
And a fire hazard.
Look, I'm sorry, okay.
I shouldn't have told everyone what happened.
That's your business.
If you wanted them to know then, well, you would've told them.
Anyway, I needed to say that.
Hey, are you okay in there?
You're hurting me.
Your eyes.
You told everyone.
Lie down next to me.
Come lie next to me, Trace, like old times.
I don't want to do that.
Come to me.
We're all alone.
There's nothing.
Things are changing for me, Trace.
That's good.
I'm happy for you.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
Where... are you going?
Just say goodbye to me, Trace.
Hi, welcome to Big Taters.
My name is Sarah.
Can I start you guys off with an order of our freedom tots?
Sarah, you know the rule about cell phones.
I'm sorry.
I just...
I was just checking on something.
Yeah, well check it on your break.
Mario, where has she been hiding that thing?
Put the car in drive, Charlie.
You're here for one reason and one reason only because...
You know the lines.
Keep your eyes up.
I stopped going to church when I was 16.
So I don't... up!
up;
Up.
I really haven't been able to take my eyes off of Erin.
The word on the street there's a rumor going around that she 's...
HEY-.
Bicycle but sadly I'm sitting here realizing that I've never gotten to take a ride...
Oh, hi, how are you?
Good to see you.
Hey, Sarah.
Nice to see you.
Hello.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
- I'm glad you came.
- Yeah.
And I'm glad you brought your wonderful roommate.
Suck it, Danny.
I said you were wonderful.
Are you coming?
Hey.
Um...
I honestly don't know what it is.
Oh, don't be coy.
You're coming.
Yeah, come, and I'll tell you all about my new project.
Yeah, it's really good.
We've been working on it for like the last two, three months now.
Cool.
I'm playing Simone.
She has the best lines in the whole thing.
I've been writing it and Erin has been providing some very insightful feedback.
I am honestly actually kind of surprised to see you here.
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- Erin
Why would you think that?
Because I "stole your role."
Okay, Danny do you want to help me in the kitchen?
Yeah.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding, Sarah.
- Don't worry.
- Okay.
I didn't even know that you auditioned for it and it was just a stupid commercial.
Honestly, it was kind of a horrible experience anyway.
The director was a total perv and you should be glad that you didn't get it.
- Okay.
- I'm going to get a drink.
- Sarah?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God, Sarah.
Did you do something with your hair?
No.
Are you coming to Performation?
- Uh...
- You totally have to.
Everyone's going to perform something.
Uh, perform?
Yeah, we'll finally get to see these acting chops that we've heard so much about.
Okay.
I like your shoes, Sarah.
I'm no ginkgo but I am Poe.
The Rosebowl's got a table of them.
Hey I had to find the film but it works great.
Oh.
- Here, check this out.
- Oh.
- That's sexy right?
- Yeah.
Danny and I are making a dark room so we can do all the processing.
Uh-huh.
That's cool.
Well, we were going to do a gallery show but it's just so much easier to put that shit on instagram.
It's just a way bigger audience.
Are you kidding me?
Beer on my butt.
- Are you okay?
- Dudes, don't.
Nip slip.
Sarah.
Hey, Sarah, hey you alright?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey listen, so about this script that we were talking about earlier,
I was wondering maybe you and I could get together sometime and...
Oh, my God.
What's going on?
Oh, um, this ad for a role.
They just called me in for an audition.
- What'?
Really?
- That's great.
Yeah.
- No, way, cool.
- Congratulations.
- That's cool.
- Thank you.
What is the role for?
It's this movie called The Silver Scream.
Oh my God.
I hope that's a working title.
Shh.
What?
It's really cool.
Um, ah, Chloe did not get fed up and just take off.
She's not out on another one of her, uh, benders.
She's not out on another one of her benders.
Something happened to her.
I, uh, I went to her...
I...
I...
I went over to her trailer and I, um...
Sorry.
I, uh,
I went to, um...
I, uh...
I went to, uh...
I
Oh, oh God.
Um, um, I'm...
I'm...
Sarah Walker.
I'm Sarah Walker.
I'm Sarah Walker.
Hi, Sarah.
I brought a headshot.
That won't be necessary.
We have your digital file.
Yeah, of course.
Um, I just thought you might want a hard copy.
What you do in this room right now will render that headshot null and void.
When you exit this room you will either have made a lasting impression or blend into the sea of thousands of forgotten girls who pass through these halls every day.
A photograph won't change that.
Okay.
Uh, well, hopefully you'll see something in me because I know I'd be great for this.
I grew up on scary movies and I'm an actor obviously.
Sol, I think I'd be pretty good.
Don't tell us, Sarah.
Show us.
Oh.
Chloe didn't get fed up with the shoot and just take off.
She's not out there on one of her benders.
Something happened to her.
Happened to her, like what?
I went to her trailer after everyone said that she took off and I found this.
And?
Her dad gave her this, Chazz.
On the morning of her birthday before he left for work when he still lived in Long Island.
So?
So her birthday is September 11.
Her dad died that morning in the World Trade Center.
She would never leave without this.
No way, not ever.
Okay, so she wouldn't leave without it.
I mean, that still doesn't mean something happened.
Well that's not all.
When I was in her trailer I heard a shuffling and then I saw something out of the corner of my eye.
Don't say it.
Don't tell me you're believing these stories now too.
I turned.
I saw her, Chazz.
Saw who?
Chloe.
So she's still here.
It was her... only it wasn't.
Thank you, Sarah.
No problem.
We'll be in touch.
Okay.
Do you have any notes for me?
I can do it again, different if you didn't like what he saw.
We saw what we needed, Sarah.
Thank you.
Fuck.
Fuck.
God.
Fuck.
Fuck!
God!
Maybe we didn't see all we needed from you after all.
What was that you were doing in the washroom, Sarah?
What?
Your fit.
Um... that...
That was nothing.
Sarah, you have my attention.
Uh, I was disappointed in myself.
So you punished yourself.
No, I don't...
It's just something I do.
I don't know.
Would you do it again, for us, now?
What?
I want to see your fit, Sarah.
I've never done that in front of anyone before.
Alright then, thank you for coming in.
Thank you, Sarah.
We'll be in touch.
Hey, how'd it go?
How did the audition go?
What happened?
Uh, not good.
I think they made fun of me.
What?
I don't really want to talk about it right now.
Okay, well, hey, everyone's coming by in a little bit.
You should come hang out with us.
I kind of want to be alone.
Thanks.
Our little tater tot full of birthday cheer, our little tater tot has lived another year.
I love birthdays.
Again with the phone, Sarah?
Am I going to have to start frisking you?
David, what are you doing standing there staring at me?
I told you to go defrost those chicken strips like an hour ago.
They're like a block of ice.
Jesus Christ.
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling you back.
You just called me.
Hello Sarah.
Yes, we tried to call...
Yes, yeah, I'm so sorry about that.
I was...
Please don't cut me off, Sarah.
We'd like to see you again.
Yes, yeah, yeah, I would...
I would love to come in again.
Great.
I'll e-mail you the details.
And Sarah, this will be different from the last time.
Oh, well good because I only have so much hair on my head.
Uh-huh.
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much and I'm sorry that I cut you off...
Yeah.
Jeez.
What's going on with you lately?
Listen, Sarah,
Tater's girls are all family.
So if one of you isn't on the ball then that affects the whole family.
You would never want to hurt your family now, would you, Sarah?
I don't really have a family, Carl.
I'm talking about your Big Tater's family, the phone thing, all these auditions that you're going on.
I know it's important to you but this is your job.
You got to prioritize.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
I know that I am.
I think I may have to quit.
No, I don't...
You didn't understand what I was trying to say.
This job is getting in the way, Carl.
I have a talent, a real talent and I'm not going to take that for granted anymore.
Now that's...
You...
You're twisting my words around and that's not what I meant.
Let me...
Let's...
Let's start over.
You have a gift.
No.
This.
This place.
Sarah, there are a million other girls who would beg for a steady job like this.
I am not a million other girls.
You can go right in.
Close the door behind you.
Step forward please.
Stand right on that pink mark.
Its so dark.
Oh.
Lower your hand.
Thank you for seeing us again, Sarah.
Of course, yeah, this is my top priority.
Today we'd like to try something different with you.
Of course.
Um, sure, I...
I didn't get any...
Would you mind disrobing for us?
Excuse me?
Would you mind disrobing, please?
Um, the ad didn't say anything about nudity.
Does the role call for that?
It doesn't.
Sarah, you've already proven that you can memorize lines.
Now we need to see you bare.
Let your inhibitions go.
Didn't I do that last time?
That's the reason you're here Sarah, the only reason you got a call back.
Sarah, you know who we are.
You know the pictures we've made, yes?
Completely, Sarah.
It's okay, Sarah.
I told you this would be different.
Sarah, relax yourself.
Sarah, if you can't fully let yourself go, how can you ever transform into something else?
That's what we were looking for, Sarah.
Thank you.
Okay, okay.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
If I have to take one more goddamn photo of you two idiots jumping,
I swear to God I'm going to kill myself.
Hey, Sarah.
Hey.
Hey, how'd it go?
Tracy told us that you had a callback.
Oh, yeah, they wanted to see me again.
Yeah, I read the ad.
The role seemed a little silly though.
Uh, yeah, but it's Astreus Pictures so it's legit.
- Its Astreus, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Wow, that is legit.
They're the real deal.
Yeah.
- Good job.
- Thank you.
Don't you think it's kind of a long shot, though?
- Uh.
- What's Extra, Extraneous...?
- Astre...
Astreus Pictures.
- Astreus.
Its stupid.
They're a production company.
They've been around forever.
Fell off a little last few years but they're coming back, huh?
Maybe you can put in a word with production, get a little PA work or something?
What about our film?
We're so going to make our film.
Well, I haven't gotten the role yet.
So...
That's true.
- Oh, Trace.
- Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go?
Great.
I think it went great.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
You didn't feel like they were making fun of you this time?
No, you know what, I don't think they were making fun of me the first time either.
- Oh, okay.
Awesome.
- Yeah.
Um, anyway, I don't want to jinx it.
Of course.
- You and your superstitions.
- Yeah.
Hey, you should go throw on a bathing suit and come join us.
Oh, shit.
Yo, Erin, Erin.
Shit.
Ashley, here.
Here, here.
Here, you're okay.
You're okay.
You're okay, baby...
Sarah, if you can't really let yourself go how can you ever transform into something else?
Hello?
I have some good news for you, Sarah.
He wants to meet you.
He, who?
The producer.
Oh, my God.
This is your moment.
Oh, man.
I don't know what this is.
Jesus Christ, can we not watch another one.
- Wait, wait, just...
- Do you know who wrote this?
Watch what he does.
I'm not trying to be rude but this is fucking stupid.
Oh, yeah.
That guy rocks.
Do you know how many times I've wanted to do that?
It's crazy.
Wow.
That's right, you have that thing.
What thing?
She's got a meeting with the producer.
At Astreus?
Yeah.
I told you you'd get it.
Don't you think you're a little overdressed?
This?
This is nothing.
It's a little much.
Look, you look amazing.
Go kick some ass.
Just remember to be yourself in here.
Sarah, thank you for coming.
Thank you for having me.
You're just as beautiful in person as you are on the audition tapes.
Thank you.
I didn't realize I was being taped.
Well, I am excited, Sarah.
We audition a lot of young women in this building but very, very few ever make it to this room.
Wow, that's great.
Yes, we've had our share of winners, some pretty big names have passed right through here, going Way back.
So, did you like our little yarn?
Absolutely, I loved it.
I read it three times.
Good.
I have high hopes for this picture.
Yes.
It's kind of my love letter to this town.
Ambition, the blackest of human desires.
Everyone has it.
But how many act on it?
That's what intrigues me.
That's what lights me up as they say.
There's something primal they're and that's why you're sitting right here in this room.
But I mean, it's a horror movie as well.
Of course.
The two are not mutually exclusive.
This industry is a plague Sarah, a plague of unoriginality, hollow be thy name, shallow be thy name.
Yes, it's a plague alright.
And what does every plague have a lot of?
- Rats?
- Precisely.
Yes, thousands of them, hungry little rats, hungry for the cheese.
You cut through the fog of his town and you get desperation, plastic parishioners worshiping their deity of debauchery.
But that's what I find interesting, Sarah.
That's what I want to capture in this film, the ugliness of the human spirit.
Yeah, okay, I mean, I can see that.
So why do you do it, darling?
Why, why do I do what?
Why do you pull your beautiful hair out?
Um, I...
it's just a habit.
I started doing it when I was a little girl and it helps me focus on the moment.
The moment.
Well, this is a moment.
Yes, yes it is.
The role of Celeste is a really big deal for a young actress with no other credits to her name.
Your face will be on the poster.
The poster on a wall, a wall in a lobby, a lobby of a movie theater, a theater with a marquee,
The Silver Scream.
Now you know that doesn't happen very much anymore, right?
This is a great opportunity for a young actress, a great opportunity for an actress with ambition.
That's me.
I'm your girl.
I will do whatever it takes for this role.
Good, because we want to offer it to you.
We think you could be great in this role, Sarah.
I think you could be great in this role.
I agree.
Truthfully, I think I am this role.
I mean, this character has a dream and she has so much potential.
Sarah, forget about all that.
This world is about the doers, the people who don't just talk about what they're going to do, they just do it.
And that's you.
Thank you.
Thank you for saying that.
I worked so hard, you know.
Every week it's a new class, a new audition and I just never...
Uh, if you want me to, to read more with other actors,
um, or another audition.
Sarah, this is the audition.
I told you before, very, very few actresses ever get to this room.
Sarah, you're at the gates.
All you need is for me to open them for you.
I can make you a star, Sarah.
You know I can.
Whoa, no.
Let me out.
Let me out.
Open the door.
How'd it go?
Not good.
Maybe I should submit my headshot.
Seriously.
I'm kidding.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, honey, I'm kidding.
Hey.
- Maybe you should...
- Yeah.
It was a fucking joke.
Coming in.
What are you doing?
Hey!
Don't cry, hun.
What happened?
Everything was going so well.
I was so sure I was going to get it.
I quit my job for this.
Wait.
You quit your job for this?
I was so sure.
I was so sure.
Okay, wait a minute, what happened?
It was one final step and I could have had it too if I was just willing to...
What?
Willing to what?
Come on, you don't...
You don't mean sex.
I mean, he didn't say specifically what.
Oh, my God.
Are you being serious?
What a fucking creep, okay.
Do people still even do that?
Well, no one out there does.
And I sure as heck don't.
And you don't.
Okay?
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
Wait, you don't wish that you did it, do you?
It was a gateway part.
Sarah, it was two auditions.
I mean, and seriously, who gets hired for a lead role that quickly?
Doesn't that seem a little suspicious to you?
Listen, Danny was just telling me how badly he wants to have you in his movie.
You should talk to him.
Oh, shut up.
What are they up to now?
I can make you a star, Sarah.
You know I can.
So I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
I know that you were trying to help me and I twisted your words.
I twisted them and...
Look, Sarah, I get it.
Really, I do.
I'm not an idiot.
I know what town we live in.
I mean, you think you're the first waitress I've ever had that was destined for stardom?
I've had my share.
But they all understood that being a Taters girl is what paid the bills while they chased the dream.
Now, I'm not sure you see how the two are connected.
I mean, I don't know what else you want me to say.
Do you want me to beg for this job?
Well, you don't got to be a jerk about it.
I mean, I've already had like, 20 applications since you quit, so...
I'm sorry.
I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.
Look, I want you to see this place for what it really is.
Yeah, I know you think it's cheesy.
Too self-aware, not ironic enough for you, the menus, the specials, all those clever meal names, calling the little kids tater tots, saying see you later tater gator when the customers are leaving.
That's all me.
All right?
It may not be cool to a young woman your age but it's me.
Okay.
Look, just promise me that until your star is on the sidewalk out there you'll try and value me and what I'm trying to do here.
Can you...
Can you do that for me?
Are you a Taters girl?
Yeah, I can do that.
I'm a Taters girl.
I guess my point is that
I just feel like the austerity lifestyles, sort of eastern lifestyles exists...
I got no friends at my party.
Hey.
Back to slumming it like the rest of us?
Hey.
What's up, Erin?
Hi.
What's up?
Do you have like, an amp for that?
This is good.
Who knows how to scat?
This is...
This is the issue with the millennial generation.
It's just, it's entitlement.
Its...
Hey, you get off my lawn.
It's my property you're sitting on.
You're loitering.
I could have you arrested.
It's a crime.
It's where I live.
You live there?
Yeah.
Why?
See, it's LA.
Why should I spend $1500 a month on an apartment when I'm just going to spend all day in the car anyway?
So this is your car too?
It's my car.
It doesn't run but it did when I had that epiphany.
Tracy told us what happened.
Told you, told you what?
That the producer at Astreus got inappropriate.
Maybe it's worth it.
I just started back up at Big Taters yesterday.
I kind of feel like I'm selling my soul already.
So it may as well be for something I love.
I don't know.
If you want to do what you love, why not just do it?
I mean, you work at this restaurant.
You work at Big Taters.
I live in a van.
So what?
Those things aren't mutually exclusive from us being able to do what we want to do.
We got all these people, all our friends, they're just sitting around trying to figure out what to do, trying to figure out how to make something.
Maybe we should be sitting around anymore.
Maybe we should just get together and make something.
I'm going to send you my script.
You're going to dig it, trust me.
And we'll work around your precious Big Taters schedule.
Hmm?
You'd direct me?
Yeah.
I'd be your leading lady?
I say rape, you say don't.
- Sure.
- Simone?
If you want.
Then, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll be in your movie.
Alright, okay.
I've been trying to talk to you about it for a week.
Fuck Astreus Pictures.
We're going to make our own movie.
All right?
Do you have the champagne?
Okay.
Hold on.
What is it?
It's the start of the night we're never going to forget.
Three, two, one.
This world is about the doers, the people who don't just talk about what they're going to do, they just do it.
And that's you.
Astreus Pictures.
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling.
I made a mistake.
I never should have left that office.
I want to meet him again.
582 Canyon Drive.
Be there in one hour.
Come in, Sarah.
There won't be a third opportunity, Sarah.
Your house is beautiful.
Um, do you want me to read a scene?
Um... do you want to, uh, discuss the role some more?
I'm sorry that I left the other night.
I'm...
I...
I really could be great for this part.
Words, Sarah, just words.
What would you be willing to do to convince me, to make me believe in you again?
Would you forgo your eyes for a new pair of eyes, eyes that see with our vision?
Would you give up your body to become a vessel for our voice, for my voice?
Will you give your old life away for a glorious, new life?
Yes.
Then show me.
The gateway is opened, Sarah.
All you have to do is be willing to step inside for ever and never look back.
Kill your old life, Sarah.
Bury it in the earth and join us in the skies.
Show me the girl I thought you were.
Let me see the real, Sarah.
Sarah, order's up.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Sarah.
Go home.
You shouldn't be here right now.
No, no, its...
I'm fine.
Its fine.
It's not fine.
What are you doing?
Come here.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Give me that.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Get the fuck out of here and don't come back.
Astreus Pictures.
Uh, this is Sarah Walker calling.
Um, I...
I'm not feeling very well.
I mean, I'm fine.
It's fine.
I just, um...
I don't...
I don't know what's happening right now.
So if someone could...
If someone could please call me back when you get this, please.
Thank you.
Are you okay?
Are you alright?
Hey, Sarah, you alright?
Let me look at you.
Come here.
Hey, are you Okay?
You alright, Sarah?
Danny, get drunk with me.
I'm alright right now, man.
But I love you.
I love you very much.
Suit yourself but we won't be able to sneak booze into the bowl.
It easy to sneak booze in.
All you have to do is flirt with the dude at the door.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, I'll give that a shot.
Dude.
She's going to Ralph.
Hey, I think maybe we need to get her home.
Get her like, some water or something.
Yo, Poe, put that away.
No, no, no, this is golden.
I'm going to make a Tumbler.
It's going to be called Sick, Slutty Sarah, yeah.
No, you're not.
What the fuck are you thinking?
- Hey Danny, leave him alone.
- I love you.
It's okay.
Give me my fucking phone!
- Whoa!
- Jesus.
Dude.
Sarah?
What the...
I was trying to stop him.
- Okay, what...?
- Let's just keep it funny everybody.
- Relax.
- Am I the bad guy now?
Why are you defending her, Danny?
Go after her.
She's sick.
Sarah, you shouldn't go down there.
It's not safe.
Go after her.
She's going to...
She just pushed me.
She's not going to want me to...
I mean it.
She's obviously not feeling well.
Astreus Pictures.
Hello?
Hello?
I don't feel good.
I don't feel...
Hello?
!
I did what you asked.
Hey, you okay?
How dare you!
How dare you touch me!
How dare you!
I'm sorry.
Sarah, if you can't really let yourself go how can you ever transform into something else?
You're at the gates.
All you need is for me to open them for you.
Maybe we didn't see what we needed from you after all.
Your face would be on the poster, the poster on the wall, a wall In a lobby, the lobby of a movie theater, a theater with a marquee.
They are all losers.
Cancer.
Kill your old life, Sarah.
Bury it in the earth and join us in the skies.
Sarah?
You Okay?
Go away.
Listen, I really need to get in there.
I...
Just go away please.
You've been in there for like, two hours.
I have to get ready for work.
Are you okay?
Sweetie, what...?
Do you smell that?
- Uh...
- I think it's coming from you.
Yeah, uh,
Sarah, no offense, but I mean, that's you.
- Are you on your period?
- What?
Fuck you.
All right, that's enough, okay.
I've had enough of your shit.
What the hell's going on with you?
You told them.
- You told them.
- Who?
What?
About my audition.
And the producer, right?
It came...
I bet you all got off on it too, right?
No.
Seeing me fail like that?
Sarah, those are your friends.
Okay, nobody wanted that for you.
They're your friends!
They're your friends!
I am trying to do something big.
I'm trying to do something with my life.
How am I supposed to do this when you surround me with these losers?
Do you hear the words that are coming out of your mouth right now?
They're like venom to me, like, like a cancer, all of you guys, just all of you.
You and Danny, Erin, just like, living off of me.
Oh, living off of you?
Okay, the last time I checked
I covered your rent for the past two months and I'm guessing you don't have this month either because you're so obsessed with this job that just wants to fuck you instead of the job that actually pays your bills.
What the fuck?
Now it's our apartment again.
So do me a favor, Trace, and fuck off!
Sarah.
Shh, don't fight it.
Sleep now, Sarah.
We want to show you something.
I hope that's a working title.
Are you sure you really...
Danny was just talking about it...
Maybe we get to see the acting chops that we've heard so much about.
Sarah, are you a Tater's girl?
Tracey told us what happened.
He was just telling me...
You know what you have to do.
What's the matter, Sarah?
Are you not feeling well?
I'm dying.
I'm dying.
Yes, you are.
You can go into the ground to be forgotten forever or you can be reborn.
Did you expect it to be painless, that it would be easy, that you'd simply wake up one morning with everything you ever wanted laid out before you?
I told you Sarah, dreams require sacrifice.
And so do we.
I can give you what you want Sarah, but you need to embrace who you really are.
It's time to become one of us.
It's time to be remembered.
Grab something.
Hit him.
I can't get over comfortable your bed is.
More comfortable than the five year old futon you've been dragging around since college?
I got to pee.
- You want anything?
- Yeah, I want some water and a treat, a little special something.
Okay.
Bravo.
Jesus Christ.
Sarah?
You scared the shit out of me.
Don't!
Sarah, what are you doing here?
You let him put that revolting thing in you.
And then he gives you the role of Simone back.
You were watching us?
You think I had to fuck Danny to get a role in his movie?
That's sad that you see the world like that.
Sarah, you know that me and Danny have hooked up before, right?
Did it ever occur to you that maybe we just like each other?
Sarah, get the fuck out of here.
You know what's sad?
You.
All of you.
A role in Danny's little film, how sad.
What's sadder is that you think I want any of it, that I'd sink so low.
Right.
Why would you have to fuck Danny for her role when you've already fucked some big time movie producer?
Yeah, Tracy told us about the stack of cash from Astreus Pictures.
Oh my God,
Sarah, did you...
Did you actually suck some old producers cock for a role in a movie called The Silver Scream?
Wow, that's sad.
It's a gateway part.
From here it sounds a lot like prostitution.
Don't!
Sarah, what happened to you?
Don't, don't touch me.
- Sarah...
- Don't touch me.
- Sarah.
- Don't
Stop it, stop it.
We need to get you to a hospital.
No, no, get away!
It feels good.
See what happens when you stop fighting?
Trust us, Sarah.
Don't hurt yourself.
Let us in.
Embrace who you are.
Ah!
What's up?
Ah!
Sarah?
What are you doing here?
Hey, did you see Erin?
Yeah.
We talked.
Okay, what did you talk about?
You.
Right.
Did she tell you how worried we are about you?
Since you ran off the other night?
You know, Tracy came by here, she said the two of you had a big fight.
We're all pretty concerned.
Look, Sarah, whatever is going on we can help you.
You know, just talk to me.
You, help me?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm your friend.
No you're not.
None of you are.
Sarah, of course we are.
Sarah?
Jesus, what's wrong with you?
Are you"?
I don't have any friends.
Wait!
Don't!
Sarah, don't, don't.
Why, Why?
There's only one thing in this whole world that I want and they're going to give it to me.
They see the real me.
Yes.
Hail Astreus.
Hail Astreus.
Hail...
She is ready to transform.
Sarah?
Sarah, are you here?
Sarah?
Are you in there?
Sarah?
All right, this is just weird.
And a fire hazard.
Look, I'm sorry okay.
I shouldn't have told everyone what happened.
That's your business.
If you wanted them to know, then...
Well, you would've told them.
Anyway, I needed to say that.
Hey, are you okay in there?
You're hurting me.
Your eyes.
You told everyone.
Lie down next to me.
Come lie next to me, Trace, like old times.
I don't want to do that.
Come to me.
We're all alone.
There's nothing.
Things are changing for me, Trace.
That's good.
I'm happy for you.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
Where... are you going?
Just say goodbye to me, Trace.
(distant cheering)
Hi, welcome to Big Taters.
My name is Sarah.
Can I start you guys off with an order of our freedom tops?
Sarah, you know the rule about cell phones.
I'm sorry.
I just-
- I was just checking on something.
Yeah, well check it on your break.
Mario, where has she been hiding that thing?
Put the car in drive, Charlie.
You're here for one reason and one reason only because--.
You know the lines.
Keep your eyes up.
I stopped going to church when I was 16.
So I don't--
Up, up, up.
Ireallyhaven'tbeenable to takemyeyesoff ofErin .
Thewordon thestreet there'sa rumorgoing aroundthatshe's--
Hey.
...bicyclebutsadly I'msittinghererealizing thatI 'venevergone totakearide--
Oh, hi, how are you?
Good to see you.
Hey, Sarah.
Nice to see you.
- Hello.
How's it going?
- Fine.
- I'm glad you came.
- Yeah.
And I'm glad you brought your wonderful roommate.
Suck it, Danny.
I said you were wonderful.
You coming?
Hey, I honestly don't know what it is.
Oh, don't be coy.
You're coming.
Yeah, come, and I'll tell you all about my new project.
Yeah, it's really good.
We've been working on it for like the last two, three months now.
- Cool.
- I'm playing Simone.
She has the best lines in the whole thing.
I've been writing it and Erin has been providing some very insightful feedback.
I am honestly actually kind of surprised to see you here.
- I thought you were avoiding me.
- Erin.
Why would you think that?
Because I "stole your role."
Okay, Danny do you want to help me in the kitchen?
Yeah.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding, Sarah.
Don't worry, okay.
I didn't even know that you auditioned for it and it was just a stupid commercial.
Honestly, it was kind of a horrible experience anyway.
The director was a total perv and you should be glad that you didn't get it.
- Okay.
- I'm going to get a drink.
- Sarah?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God, Sarah.
Did you do something with your hair?
- No.
Are you coming to Performation?
- Uh...
- You totally have to.
Everyone's going to perform something.
Oh, perform?
Yeah, we'll finally get to see these acting chops that we've heard so much about.
Okay.
I like your shoes, Sarah.
...I'mnoginkobut Iam Poe.
The Rosebowl's got a table of them.
Hey I had to find the film but it works great.
Oh.
- Here, check this out.
- Oh.
- That's sexy right?
- Yeah.
Danny and I are making a dark room so we can do all the processing.
Uh-huh.
That's cool.
Well, we were going to do a gallery show but it's just so much easier to put that shit on instagram.
It's just a way bigger audience.
Are you kidding me?
Beer on my butt.
- Are you okay?
- Dudes, don't.
Nip slip.
Sarah.
Hey, Sarah, hey you alright?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey listen, so about this script that we were talking about earlier,
I was wondering maybe you and I could get together sometime and--
Oh, my God.
What's going on?
Oh, um, this ad for a role.
They just called me in for an audition.
- What?
Really?
- That's great.
- Yeah.
- No, way, cool.
- Congratulations.
- That's cool.
- Thank you.
What is the role for?
It's this movie called The Silver Scream.
Oh my God.
I hope that's a working title.
Shh.
What?
It's really cool.
Um, ah, Chloe did not get fed up and just take off.
She's not out on another one of her, uh, benders.
She's not out on another one of her benders.
Something happened to her.
I, uh, I went to her--
I-
- I--
I went over to her trailer and I, um--
Sorry.
I, uh,
I went to, um--
I, uh--
I went to, uh--
I--
Oh, oh God.
Um, um, I'm-
- I'm--.
Sarah Walker.
I'm Sarah Walker.
I'm Sarah Walker.
Hi, Sarah.
I brought a headshot.
That won't be necessary.
We have your digital file.
Yeah, of course.
Um, I just thought you might want a hard copy.
What you do in this room right now will render that headshot null and void.
When you exit this room you will either have made a lasting impression or blend into the sea of thousands of forgotten girls who pass through these halls every day.
A photograph won't change that.
Okay.
Uh, well, hopefully you'll see something in me because I know I'd be great for this.
I grew up on scary movies and I'm an actor obviously.
So I, I think I'd be pretty good.
Don't tell us, Sarah.
Show us.
Oh.
Chloe didn't get fed up with the shoot and just take off.
She's not out there on one of her benders.
Something happened to her.
Happened to her, like what?
I went to her trailer after everyone said that she took off and I found this.
And?
Her dad gave her this, Chaz.
On the morning of her birthday before he left for work when he still lived in Long Island.
So?
So her birthday is September 11.
Her dad died that morning in the World Trade Center.
She would never leave without this.
No way, not ever.
Okay, so she wouldn't leave without it.
I mean, that still doesn't mean something happened.
Well that's not all.
When I was in her trailer I heard a shuffling and then I saw something out of the corner of my eye.
Don't say it.
Don't tell me you're believing these stories now too.
I turned.
I saw her, Chaz.
Saw who?
Chloe.
So she's still here.
It was her...only it wasn't.
Thank you, Sarah.
No problem.
We'll be in touch.
Okay.
Do you have any notes for me?
I can do it again, different if you didn't like what you saw.
We saw what we needed, Sarah.
Thank you.
Fuck.
Fuck.
God.
Fuck.
Fuck!
God!
Maybe we didn't see all we needed from you after all.
What was that you were doing in the washroom, Sarah?
What?
Your fit.
Um...that-- That was nothing.
Sarah, you have my attention.
Uh, I was disappointed in myself.
So you punished yourself.
No, I don't -- It's just something I do.
I don't know.
Would you do it again, for us, now?
What?
I want to see your fit, Sarah.
I've never done that in front of anyone before.
Alright then, thank you for coming in.
Thank you, Sarah.
We'll be in touch.
Hey, how'd it go?
How did the audition go?
What happened?
Uh, not good.
I think they made fun of me.
What?
I don't really want to talk about it right now.
Okay, well, hey, everyone's coming by in a little bit.
You should come hang out with us.
I kind of want to be alone.
Thanks.
Ourlittletatertot fullofbirthingcheer, ourlittletatertot haslivedanotheryear.
I love birthdays.
Again with the phone, Sarah?
Am I going to have to start frisking you?
David, what are you doing standing there staring at me?
I told you to go defrost those chicken strips like an hour ago.
They're like a block of ice.
Jesus Christ.
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling you back.
You just called me.
HelloSarah.
Yes,wetriedtocall--
Yes, yeah, I'm so sorry about that.
I was--
Please don't cut me off, Sarah.
We'dliketo seeyou again.
Yes, yeah, yeah, I would--
I would love to come in again.
Great.
I'lle-mailyouthe details.
AndSarah,thiswillbe differentfromthelasttime .
Oh, well good because I only have so much hair on my head.
Uh-huh.
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much and I'm sorry that I cut you off--
Yeah.
Jeez.
What's going on with you lately?
Listen, Sarah,
Tater's girls are all family.
So, if one of you isn't on the ball then that affects the whole family.
You would never want to hurt your family now, would you, Sarah?
I don't really have a family, Carl.
I'm talking about your Big Tater's family, the phone thing, all these auditions that you're going on.
I know it's important to you but this is your job.
You got to prioritize.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
I know that I am.
I think I may have to quit.
No, I don't --
You didn't understand what I was trying to say.
This job is getting in the way, Carl.
I have a talent, a real talent and I'm not going to take that for granted anymore.
Now that's-
- You--
You're twisting my words around and that's not what I meant.
Let me-
- Let's--
Let's start over.
You have a gift.
No.
This.
This place.
Sarah, there are a million other girls who would beg for a steady job like this.
I am not a million other girls.
You can go right in.
Close the door behind you.
Step forward please.
Stand right on that pink mark.
It's so dark.
Oh.
Lower your hand.
Thank you for seeing us again, Sarah.
Of course, yeah, this is my top priority.
Today we'd like to try something different with you.
Of course.
Um, sure, I-- I didn't get any--.
Would you mind disrobing for us?
Excuse me?
Would you mind disrobing, please?
Um, the ad didn't say anything about nudity.
Does the role call for that?
It doesn't.
Sarah, you've already proven that you can memorize lines.
Now we need to see you bare.
Let your inhibitions go.
Didn't I do that last time?
That's the reason you're here Sarah, the only reason you got a call back.
Sarah, you know who we are.
You know the pictures we've made, yes?
Completely, Sarah.
It's okay, Sarah.
I told you this would be different.
Sarah, relax yourself.
Sarah, if you can't fully let yourself go, how can you ever transform into something else?
That's what we were looking for, Sarah.
Thank you.
Okay, okay.
Here we go.
One, two, three.
If I have to take one more goddamn photo of you two idiots jumping,
I swear to God I'm going to kill myself.
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey.
Hey, how'd it go?
Tracy told us that you had a callback.
Oh, yeah, they wanted to see me again.
Yeah, I read the ad.
The role seemed a little silly though.
Uh, yeah, but it's Astreus Pictures so it's legit.
- It's Astreus, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Wow, that is legit.
They're the real deal.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
- Good job.
Don't you think it's kind of a long shot, though?
- Uh.
- What's Extra, Extraneous--?
- Astre...
Astreus Pictures.
- Astreus.
It's stupid.
They're a production company.
They've been around forever.
Fell off a little last few years but they're coming back, huh?
Maybe you can put in a word with production, get a little PA work or something?
What about our film?
We're so going to make our film.
Well, I haven't gotten the role yet.
So...
That's true.
- Oh, Trace.
- Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go?
Great.
I think it went great.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
You didn't feel like they were making fun of you this time?
No, you know what, I don't think they were making fun of me the first time either.
- Oh, okay.
Awesome.
- Yeah.
- Um, anyway, I don't want to jinx it.
- Of course.
- You and your superstitions.
- Yeah.
Hey, you should go throw on a bathing suit and come join us.
Oh, shit.
Yo,Erin,Erin.
Shit.
Ashley,here.
Here, here.
Here, you're okay.
You're okay.
You're okay...
Sarah, if you can't really let yourself go how can you transform into something else?
Hello?
Ihavesomegoodnews foryou,Sarah.
Hewantsto meetyou .
He, who?
Theproducer.
Oh, my God.
...Thisisyourmoment.
Oh,man.
I don't know what this is.
Jesus Christ, can we not watch another one.
- Wait, wait, just--.
-Doyouknowwhowrote this?
Watch what he does.
I'mnottryingtoberude butthisis fuckingstupid.
Oh, yeah.
That guy rocks.
Do you know how many times I've wanted to do that?
It's crazy.
Wow.
That's right, you have that thing.
What thing?
She's got a meeting with the producer.
At Astreus?
Yeah.
I told you you'd get it.
Don't you think you're a little overdressed?
This?
This is nothing.
It's a little much.
Look, you look amazing.
Go kick some ass.
Just remember to be yourself in here.
Sarah, thank you for coming.
Thank you for having me.
You're just as beautiful in person as you are on the audition tapes.
Thank you.
I didn't realize I was being taped.
Well, I am excited, Sarah.
We audition a lot of young women in this building but very, very few ever make it to this room.
Wow, that's great.
Yes, we've had our share of winners, some pretty big names have passed right through here, going way back.
So, did you like our little yarn?
Absolutely, I loved it.
I read it three times.
Good.
I have high hopes for this picture.
Yes.
It's kind of my love letter to this town.
Ambition, the blackest of human desires.
Everyone has it.
But how many act on it?
That's what intrigues me.
That's what lights me up as they say.
There's something primal they're and that's why you're sitting right here in this room.
But I mean, it's a horror movie as well.
Of course.
The two are not mutually exclusive.
This industry is a plague Sarah, a plague of unoriginality, hollow be thy name, shallow be thy name.
Yes, it's a plague alright.
And what does every plague have a lot of?
- Rats?
- Precisely.
Yes, thousands of them, hungry little rats, hungry for the cheese.
You cut through the fog of this town and you get desperation, plastic parishioners worshiping their deity of debauchery.
But that's what I find interesting, Sarah.
That's what I want to capture in this film, the ugliness of the human spirit.
Yeah, okay, I mean, I can see that.
So why do you do it, darling?
Why, why do I do what?
Why do you pull your beautiful hair out?
Um, I-- It's just a habit.
I started doing it when I was a little girl and it helps me focus on the moment.
The moment.
Well, this is a moment.
Yes, yes it is.
The role of Celeste is a really big deal for a young actress with no other credits to her name.
Your face will be on the poster.
The poster on a wall, a wall in the lobby, a lobby of a movie theater, a theater with a marquee,
The Silver Scream.
Now you know that doesn't happen very much anymore, right?
This is a great opportunity for a young actress, a great opportunity for an actress with ambition.
That's me.
I'm your girl.
I will do whatever it takes for this role.
Good, because we want to offer it to you.
We think you could be great in this role, Sarah.
I think you could be great in this role.
I agree.
Truthfully, I think I am this role.
I mean, this character has a dream and she has so much potential.
Sarah, forget about all that.
This world is about the doers, the people who don't just talk about what they're going to do, they just do it.
And that's you.
Thank you.
Thank you for saying that.
I worked so hard, you know.
Every week is a new class, a new audition and I just never--
Uh, if you want me to, to read more with other actors, um, or another audition.
Sarah, this is the audition.
I told you before, very, very few actresses ever get to this room.
Sarah, you're at the gates.
All you need is for me to open them for you.
I can make you a star, Sarah.
You know I can.
Whoa, no.
Let me out.
Let me out.
Open the door.
How'd it go?
Not good.
Maybe I should submit my headshot.
Seriously.
I'm kidding.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, honey, I'm kidding.
Hey.
- Maybe you should--
- Yeah.
It was a fucking joke.
Comingin.
What are you doing?
Hey, don't cry, hun.
What happened?
Everything was going so well.
I was so sure I was going to get it.
I quit my job for this.
You quit your job for this?
I was so sure.
I was so sure.
Okay, wait a minute, what happened?
It was one final step and I could have had it too if I was just willing to--
Hun, willing to what?
Come on, you don't-- You don't mean sex.
I mean, he didn't say specifically what.
Oh, my God.
Are you being serious?
What a fucking creep, okay.
Do people still even do that?
Well, no one out there does.
And I sure as heck don't.
And you don't.
Okay?
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
Wait, you don't wish that you did it do you?
It was a gateway part.
Sarah, it was two auditions.
I mean, and seriously, who gets hired for a lead role that quickly?
Doesn't that seem a little suspicious to you?
Listen, Danny was just telling me how badly he wants to have you in his movie.
You should talk to him.
Oh,shutup .
What are they up to now?
Icanmakeyou astar ,Sarah.
YouknowIcan .
So I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
I know that you were trying to help me and I twisted your words.
I twisted them and--
Look, Sarah, I get it.
Really, I do.
I'm not an idiot.
I know what town we live in.
I mean, you think you're the first waitress I've ever had that was destined for stardom?
I've had my share.
But they all understood that being a Taters girl is what paid the bills while they chased the dream.
Now I'm not sure you see how the two are connected.
I mean, I don't know what else you want me to say.
Do you want me to beg for this job?
Well, you don't got to be a jerk about it.
I mean, I've already had like, 20 applications since you quit, so--
I'm sorry.
I didn't-- I didn't mean it like that.
Look, I want you to see this place for what it really is.
Yeah, I know you think it's cheesy.
Too self-aware, not ironic enough for you, the menus, the specials, all those clever meal names, calling the little kids tater tots, saying see you later tater gator when the customers are leaving.
That's all me.
All right?
It may not be cool to a young woman your age but it's me.
Okay.
Look, just promise me that until your star is on the sidewalk out there you'll try and value me and what I'm trying to do here.
Can you--
Can you do that for me?
Are you a Taters girl?
Yeah, I can do that.
I'm a Taters girl.
I guess my point is that
I just feel like, the austerity lifestyles, sort of eastern lifestyles exists I got no friends at my party.
Hey.
Back to slumming it like the rest of us?
Hey.
Hey.
What's up, Erin?
Hi.
What's up?
Do you have like, an amp for that?
This is good.
Who knows how to scat?
This is-
- This is the issue with the millennial generation.
It's just, it's entitlement.
It's...
Hey, you get off my lawn.
It's my property you're sitting on.
You're loitering.
I could have you arrested.
It's a crime.
It's where I live.
You live there?
Yeah.
Why?
See, it's LA.
Why should I spend $1500 a month on an apartment when I'm just going to spend all day in the car anyway?
So this is your car too?
It's my car.
It doesn't run but it did when I had that epiphany.
Tracy told us what happened.
Told you, told you what?
That the producer at Astreus got inappropriate.
Maybe it's worth it.
I just started back up at Big Taters yesterday.
I kind of feel like I'm selling my soul already.
So it may as well be for something I love.
I don't know.
If you want to do what you love, why not just do it?
I mean, you work at this restaurant.
You work at Big Taters.
I live in a van.
So what?
Those things aren't mutually exclusive from us being able to do what we want to do.
We got all these people, all our friends, they're just sitting around trying to figure out what to do, trying to figure out how to make something.
Maybe we should be sitting around anymore.
Maybe we should just get together and make something.
I'm going to send you my script.
You're going to dig it, trust me.
And we'll work around your precious Big Taters schedule.
Hmm?
You'd direct me?
Yeah.
I'd be your leading lady?
I say rape, you say don't.
- Sure.
- Simone?
If you want.
Then, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll be in your movie.
Alright, okay.
I've been trying to talk to you about it for a week.
Fuck Astreus Pictures.
We're going to make our own movie.
All right?
Do you have any champagne?
Okay.
Hold on.
What is it?
It's the start of the night we're never going to forget.
Three,two,one.
Thisworldis aboutthe doers, thepeoplewhodon 'tjusttalk about what they're going to do, theyjustdo it .
And that's you.
AstreusPictures.
Hi, this is Sarah Walker calling.
I made a mistake.
I never should have left that office.
I want to meet him again.
582CanyonDrive.
Betherein onehour.
Come in, Sarah.
There won't be a third opportunity, Sarah.
Your house is beautiful.
Um, do you want me to read a scene?
Um, you want to discuss the role some more?
I'm sorry that I left the other night.
I'm-
- I-
- I really could be great for this part.
Words, Sarah, just words.
What would you be willing to do to convince me, to make me believe in you again?
Would you forgo your eyes for a new pair of eyes, eyes that see with our vision?
Would you give up your body to become a vessel for our voice, for my voice?
Will you give your old life away for a glorious, new life?
Yes.
Then show me.
The gateway is opened, Sarah.
All you have to do is be willing to step inside for ever and never look back.
Kill your old life, Sarah.
Bury it in the earth and join us in the skies.
Showmethegirl Ithoughtyouwere.
Letmeseethe real,Sarah.
Sarah, order's up.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Sarah.
Go home.
You shouldn't be here right now.
No, no, it's-
- I'm fine.
It's fine.
It's not fine.
What are you doing?
Come here.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Give me that.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Give me it.
Get the fuck out of here and don't come back.
AstreusPictures.
Uh, this is Sarah Walker calling.
Um, I-- I'm not feeling very well.
I mean, I'm fine.
It's fine.
I just, um--
I don't-
- I don't know what's happening right now.
So if someone could--
If someone could please call me back when you get this, please.
Thank you.

Areyoualright?
Hey,Sarah,youalright?

Hey,areyouokay?
Youalright,Sarah?
Danny, get drunk with me.
I'm alright right now, man.
But I love you.
I love you very much.
Suit yourself but we won't be able to sneak booze into the bowl.
It easy to sneak booze in.
All you have to do is flirt with the dude at the door.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, I'll give that a shot.
Dude.
She's going to Ralph.
Hey, I think maybe we need to get her home.
Get her like some water or something.
Yo, Poe, put that away.
No, no, no, this is golden.
I'm going to make a Tumblr.
It's going to be called Sick, slutty Sarah, yeah.
No, you're not.
What the fuck are you thinking?
- Damn it, leave him alone.
- I love you.
It's okay.
Give me my fucking phone!
- Whoa!
- Jesus.
Dude.
Sarah?
What the-- I was trying to stop him.
- Okay, what--?
- Let's just keep it funny everybody.
- Relax.
- Am I the bad guy now?
Why are you defending her, Danny?
Go after her.
She's sick.
Sarah, you shouldn't go down there.
It's not safe.
Go after her.
She's going to--
She just pushed me.
She's not going to want me to--
I mean it.
She's obviously not feeling well.
AstreusPictures.
Hello?
Hello?
I don't feel good.
I don't feel--
Hello?

I did what you asked.
Hey, you okay?
How dare you!
How dare you touch me!

Sweetie, what--?
Do you smell that?
- Uh...
- I think it's coming from you.
Yeah, uh,
Sarah, no offense, but I mean, that's you.
- Are you on your period?
- What?
Fuck you.
All right, that's enough, okay.
I've had enough of your shit.
What the hell's going on with you?
You told them.
- You told them.
- Who?
What?
About my audition.
And the producer, right?
It came--
I bet you all got off on it too, right?
No.
Seeing me fail like that?
Sarah, those are your friends.
Okay, nobody wanted that for you.
They're your friends!
They're your friends!
I am trying to do something big.
I'm trying to do something with my life.
How am I supposed to do this when you surround me with these losers?
Do you hear the words that are coming out of your mouth right now?
They're like venom to me, like, like a cancer, all of you guys, just all of you.
You and Danny, Erin, just like, living off of me.
Oh, living off of you?
Okay, the last time I checked
I covered your rent for the past two months and I'm guessing you don't have this month either because you're so obsessed with this job that just wants to fuck you instead of the job that actually pays your bills.
What the fuck?
Now it's our apartment again.
So do me a favor, Trace, and fuck off!
Sarah.
Shh, don't fight it.
Sleep now, Sarah.
We want to show you something.

More comfortable than the five year old futon you've been dragging around since college?
I got to pee.
- You want anything?
- Yeah, I want some water and a treat, a little special something.
Okay.
Bravo.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Sarah?
You scared the shit out of me.
Don't!
Sarah, what are you doing here?
You let him put that revolting thing in you.
And then he gives you the role of Simone back.
You were watching us?
You think I had to fuck Danny to get a role in his movie?
That's sad that you see the world like that.
Sarah, you know that me and Danny have hooked up before, right?
Did it ever occur to you that maybe we just like each other?
Sarah, get the fuck out of here.
You know what's sad?
You.
All of you.
A role in Danny's little film, how sad.
What's sadder is that you think I want any of it, that I'd sink so low.
Right.
Why would you have to fuck Danny for her role when you've already fucked some big time movie producer?
Yeah, Tracy told us about the stack of cash from Astreus Pictures.
Oh my God,
Sarah, did you--
Did you actually suck some old producers cock for a role in a movie called The Silver Scream?
Wow, that's sad.
It's a gateway part.
From here it sounds a lot like prostitution.
Don't!
Sarah, what happened to you?
Don't, don't touch me.
- Sarah--
- Don't touch me.
- Sarah.
- Don't
Stop it, stop it.
We need to get you to a hospital.
No, no, get off me.

Sarah?
What are you doing here?
Hey, did you see Erin?
Yeah.
We talked.
Okay, what did you talk about?
You.
Right.
Did she tell you how worried we are about you?
Since you ran off the other night?
You know, Tracy came by here, she said the two of you had a big fight.
We're all pretty concerned.
Look, Sarah, whatever is going on we can help you.
You know, just talk to me.
You, help me?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm your friend.
No you're not.
None of you are.
Sarah, of course we are.
Sarah?
Jesus, what's wrong with you?
Are you--?
I don't have any friends.
Wait!
Don't!
Sarah, don't, don't.
Why, why?
There's only one thing in this whole world that I want and they're going to give it to me.
They see the real me.
Yes.
Hail Astreus.

She is ready to transform.
Sarah?
Sarah, are you here?
Sarah?
Are you in there?
Sarah?
All right, this is just weird.
And a fire hazard.
Look, I'm sorry okay.
I shouldn't have told everyone what happened.
That's your business.
If you wanted them to know then well you would've told them.
Anyway, I needed to say that.
Hey, are you okay in there?
You're hurting me.
Your eyes.
Youtoldeveryone.
Liedownnexttome.
Come lie next to me, Trace, like old times.
I don't want to do that.
Cometome .
We'reallalone.
There'snothing.
Things are changing for me, Trace.
That's good.
I'm happy for you.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
Where...are you going?
Just say goodbye to me, Trace.
Previously on Being Human...
I'm from the future, and I need help to return.
Who you think you are now, you will have no memory of.
If I forget, make me remember.
I love you.
- I'm back.
- As long as I am alive,
I will keep you safe.
What's the real reason you came back?
To kill vampires before they kill people.
I killed our little boy.
I drained every last drop
- from his tiny body.
- No!
What happened last night?
I don't remember everything, but I feel...
Joshy boy's wolf thought it would be ok to sleep with my wife during the change!
What?
The wolf is winning!
Just get out!
- Please don't go.
- I'm scared of you.
Find a way to deal with what you are, 'cause I can't.
Can you tell us why we're here?
'Cause this took a lot of convincing.
I just wanted to apologize for everything and make tonight a new start.
I'm only here to see what you have to have to show us, not to make friends.
Ok.
What are we doing here?
You dusted the majority of their patrons.
It just might be wise to keep a low profile.
I agree.
That's why I need you.
You ended Amy's life yesterday.
I haven't forgotten.
I know that.
I believe you.
Sometimes remorse isn't enough.
It will need a life for a life, Aidan.
Who's life?
I don't understand.
Well, I've been slowly chipping away at this vamp population, but...
I need to hit this Boston dust where it hurts.
That's their leader.
You're gonna end him.
I know what you're doing.
- I'm just having a conversation!
- No, you're holding me up so I'll be here when Nora picks up her stuff.
- Is Nora coming here?
Good!
- Sally, come on!
It gives you a chance to say hi to check-in and maybe let her know that you're gettin' your life back together!
That's a great idea!
Who wouldn't wanna be with a cheater with anger issues?
- Josh...
- No!
- She's moving out, Sally.
- Well, don't let her, Josh!
Listen, I would have done anything to make this work.
I'm late.
I gotta go meet up with Andrew and Caroline.
Ok, don't go start a new pack.
Just start fresh with Nora.
Sally, listen, I know you spent years in, like, back to the future, bizarre old version of us, but in this world, right now...
My wife is terrified of me.
That's my reality.
Well, it was real to me!
What was real?
If I forget, make me remember.
I think I've loved you for a while now.
Then make me remember.
I have to know.
Sally?
What?
Uh, nothing.
Um...
Nothing.
Put some frickin' clothes on!
You guys... you guys don't do anything halfway, do you?
Well, we loved our place in the city, but priorities change.
- Oh, yeah?
- It's so quiet.
It sure is.
It kind of drives me bonkers!
Me too, but we'll get used to it, right?
The most important thing is keeping April safe and sound.
That just wasn't gonna happen in the city.
Hello, hello!
Hey!
Hey!
Josh, you made it!
Yeah, yeah.
Bring it in!
Do you know how happy I am that you're here?
Mm-hmm.
It's so good to see you!
So, what's up with the...
Are you preparing for the apocalypse?
The groceries...
You didn't tell him about the party?
We invited the entire pack by for a pre-turn housewarming.
Thought we'd give 'em the lay of the land, then tomorrow night, we run.
It'll be like a long weekend with wolves.
You're all gonna turn here?
At the same time?
- Yeah.
- That's the plan!
Part of keeping April safe is keeping the pack safe, right?
It's too dangerous for us to turn at the same place as last time.
There's even news reports of wolf sightings!
And with hunting season starting...
We found this place just in time.
I got enough room, it's just, I'd like it if you were there, gave it your seal of approval.
He doesn't do anything wolf-related without checking' on you first.
- Amen to that!
- Mm-hmm!
- I'll try and make it.
- Try?
No, no, no, no.
It's not a party without our pack leader.
Why would you want to change with that Mark guy?
He punched you in the face!
Yeah, but to be fair, I did wolf-mate his wife.
Ok, yep, in that case, then you should change with them instead of Nora!
Nora doesn't wanna be near me, ok?
Human or wolf.
- Let's just let it go, please!
- I can't!
I can't let it go, Josh!
You're a weird wolf thing because of me, because of my spell.
If I had been there to finish it, maybe none of this would have happened!
Yeah, right!
And I'd still be a wolf all the time.
Well, why don't you just let me try to fix that?
No, absolutely not!
No more magic, ok?
If you even try another spell, we may never see you again!
You know what?
What if it works?
What if I can get that guy back?
- Then, it's worth it to me.
- Well, it's not to me.
Whatever I am now, I can deal with.
Losing you forever...
No, it's not an option.
I'm sorry.
Well, you're very sweet and I love you, but this wolf is not who you are.
Because that wolf chased Nora away.
Ok, Nora can't accept what I am...
Understandably so, ok?
But Mark and Andrew and Caroline, they don't just accept me, they want to be me.
And it actually feels... kind of good.
I mean, it feels good to be, like, the Alpha for once, you know?
- What?
- You're not the Alpha.
You think you're Alpha?
You're not.
You're a Beta.
You are a nice, solid Beta.
And that's ok!
Because everyone loves a Beta!
- Nora loves her some Beta...
- Nora, who moved out...
Who slept with a knife under her bed because she was afraid of me.
Nora...
Who I might have told to come over later because you'd be here.
See ya!
Peace!
W-what?
I'm sorry.
I can, uh...
I'll just come back.
It's totally fine.
I'm on my way out.
Um... it'll only take me a couple of hours to get the rest of my stuff.
Take your time.
Hey, uh...
Do you have a...
Do you have a place to change tonight?
Yeah.
You?
Mm-hmm, yeah.
Hey, um...
Just be safe.
You too.
It took 240 years, but the streak is over.
What streak is that?
I've finally become the nagging wife.
We had an agreement.
Uh... you know, we didn't exactly have an agreement, but what we talked over, I haven't forgotten.
Every day that kid is in charge, people die.
The body count keeps ticking up.
I'm not particularly interested in a suicide mission.
- He's far too well-protected.
- For me, maybe, but not you.
I'm sure if Aidan Waite asks for a meeting, he'll get one.
Maybe you're not all that interested in changing.
Hey!
Maybe killing that girl the other night, maybe that's just who you are now.
No, it isn't!
But I don't wanna see anyone else die.
That's it.
Then protect them.
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?
It's from our church in Corwich.
That's the last place I want a souvenir from!
It's not all that bad.
We got married there, baptized Isaac.
After he died, I went in there and I took that.
- I even said a prayer.
- Said a prayer to what?
It isn't like there's a heaven waiting for us.
Well, maybe there is for Isaac.
When I made that, killing other vampires was the last thing on my mind.
You were gonna use this on yourself.
It's harder than it seems, isn't it?
You thought about it too?
Yeah.
Sometimes, I think it's the only decent thing that we can do, but I never could either.
You think I have self-discipline, willpower.
If I did, I would have been dust centuries ago.
Beating yourself up over it isn't gonna help anything either.
It'll help the next Isaac.
You think those new vampires are really that different, that they're so evolved?
You should pull your head out of the sand and go see what they're really doing.
- Hey, I'd be happy to check out...
- And then, put an end to it!
Sorry things are still rocky between you and Nora.
Well, that makes 2 of us.
It's like she knew you a certain way, but you're just...
You're not that guy anymore.
You're this guy.
And this guy is awesome.
Thanks, man.
Yeah, I don't know, I'm, uh...
I can't believe I'm saying this, I'm, um...
Almost look forward to this turn.
Because you're with us.
And I mean this when I say this:
Everyone here gets you, Josh.
And Nora will too.
She just has to come around and deal with what you are now.
You're right.
It just...
It's so weird not turning with her.
If it's any consolation, it looks like we're both flying solo.
Wendy's not here?
Uh, she, uh...
Wanted to take a bit of time, you know, away from everything.
I'm... should we...
I'm so sorry, by the way.
- I don't know...
- I don't want to...
- Should we talk about it?
- No.
About what happened?
- No, let's...
- What's up, Andrew?
Look, I had a blowup, but I promise it will never happen again, not after I realized what you are.
What am I?
You're this special kind of wolf.
The way you can change whenever you want, do you know how amazing that is?
When I saw that, I got it.
I saw what Wendy saw, and it's pheromones, man!
You can't fight that!
Ok...
And I realized that the wolf knows things before we do, and I have to trust those instincts.
Deviled-egg dude!
Hey, man!
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.
And you?
- How's the arm?
- Fully operational.
That's good.
You must be Josh.
Yeah, I am.
It's so great to finally meet you.
He's taller than I thought.
- He is, yeah.
- I'm standing right here.
I heard about how you delivered Caroline's baby.
Oh, I didn't do...
It was my wife, mostly.
Dude, it was you.
It was me and my...
Me and my wife.
It was him.
It takes a special person to do that for a stranger.
I do what I can!
That's why I trust you.
Anyway, I can't wait to see you later.
Isn't she cute?
What the hell is she doing here, man?
By the way she spoke to you, I'm guessing whatever you want.
No, I mean, why would they bring her here, now?
She's here for the same reason as everyone else is here,
- to turn together.
- I can smell her.
She's not a wolf!
Not yet.
Hey!
- Hey!
I recognize that voice!
- How are you doing?
I'm good.
Did I owe you a phone call?
- Mm-mmm.
- Ok, good.
'Cause I've been pretty crazed here.
No kidding!
What's going on?
It's a lot, I know.
It's weird how quickly we're blowing up.
Indeed, right.
How does this all fit in with your "we're doing things differently" spiel?
Oh, we are.
I mean, who knew that vampire re-population was gonna be such a growth industry?
Well, anybody who's ever sold anything to an addict.
Well, don't worry.
We've still got the full veggie options at our new blood dens.
Oh, at the blood dens?
Really?
How many blood dens do you have these days?
Just a few.
Not that you asked me my advice, but don't you think you ought to just slow down a little bit?
Well, I mean, I'm barely doing anything.
I'm serious!
People are actually coming to me, from everywhere:
Providence, Baltimore, Buffalo...
See, they want me to do there what I'm doing here.
Well, you know that you can always say no, right?
Well, I mean, it's kind of rude not to hear them out, right?
Hmm.
You know what people like about the way I do things?
What's that?
See, most of the old-timers are grim.
I hope you don't mean me!
No offense.
Just listen.
They're all about the "plague this, Bishop that."
Most of the new ones didn't want to be turned.
Hmm...
I mean, you know me.
This is all I've ever really cared about.
You gotta be a fan first, right?
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not trying to harsh the old regime.
I'm saying there's improvements.
We're a little more open-minded.
We're not locked in the way of thinking that the old guys were.
Well, look, you are sitting where Bishop sat and you are telling me how different you are.
I was there, and I knew all of Bishop's plans.
You're starting to sound like Bishop.
Just blue sky-ing here.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Can you give me one second?
Thanks.
Everybody knows what they're doing?
If you have questions or concerns, come to me.
- Hey!
- Hey!
Astrid...
Um...
Aidan, you remember Astrid, right?
Yeah!
- The world's worst baby shower!
- Indeed, yeah!
I'm sorry my friends trashed your place.
Believe me.
That place has seen worse.
Are you allowed to be here?
Yeah.
I mean, I got some glares.
Yeah, but if anybody has a problem, they keep it to themselves.
They've actually been way cooler than my pack has to Kenny.
- Really?
- You break one guy's arm...
They'll get over it!
Or I'll stop turning with them.
Ok.
Andrew and Caroline invited us all to their new place for the turn.
Anyways, I should get going.
Well, the turn is tomorrow, though, right?
Yeah, they want some pack bonding time.
I just hope they don't make us do trust falls.
Well, I packed you a change bag, and I might have thrown in an extra rump roast.
I saw it, and your note.
You did all right with this one!
Ok, look, I know that expansion is a dirty word to you, but if I can go anywhere with Astrid and not get hassled for it,
I'm gonna do it!
Kenny, you can do whatever you want.
You can compel whoever you want, you can go wherever you want.
So, let me ask you this:
Are you doing all of this for her...
Or is it for you?
- No!
- What the hell?
I'm saving you from yourself!
You saved me from aspirin!
Oh, sorry, ghost foul.
What did you think I was taking?
I don't know!
Uppers, downers, reds, blues...
Whatever gets you through the day.
Sorry.
Ok, I've had my vices, but pills ain't it!
Well, maybe not in this life, but when I went back in time, you went hardcore Nurse Jackie.
- I did?
- Yeah.
You don't have to be so thrilled about it.
What?
It's not like it actually happened.
I really wish that people would stop saying that.
It did actually happen.
It happened to me.
Every second of it actually happened.
And by the way, that's how I know that in either version, you and Josh are better together.
You don't think I wanna believe that too?
So, what else happened when you went back in time?
Well, um, I left Danny.
I became a werewolf.
Yeah.
And somewhere along the line, I sort of...
I kind of fell in love with Aidan.
Um, you what?
You... you fell in love with Aidan?
Yes!
And it's not the most ridiculous thing you ever heard!
No, my God!
Not at all!
It's just...
- It's just unexpected!
- I know.
And until Ray accidentally murdered me and turned me into a ghost again, it was kind of the greatest thing ever.
Well, does Aidan know?
I mean, obviously, that Aidan knew.
- But this Aidan, did you tell him?
- No!
God no!
No!
First of all, healthy enough ego on that boy as is.
Also, back then, it was possible.
I was alive!
Even when I was a wolf, I was alive.
And now, meh-meh.
But you guys could still be together, mostly.
Yeah, I don't think he thinks of me that way.
And it's ok, 'cause I didn't either until I got to go back and do it over from scratch.
And he never gets to do that, so I just don't...
I don't...
I don't see how he could feel like that for me.
Ok, no more cliffsnotes.
- I need to know everything.
- Ok.
Josh, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Do you know about this?
He's planning on turning all these people into wolves!
Yeah, it was our idea.
What?
You can't do this!
They have no idea what's about to happen to them!
You said you'd help us build the pack.
- This is what we need!
- No!
No!
No, I said that I would teach you what I know, all right?
I will never, ever pass this on willingly!
You were alone when you were attacked.
- It'll be different.
- This is insane.
These people are gonna have us, a support system, a family.
Yeah, a Manson Family!
I can't believe I didn't see...
They'll be killers.
Did you explain that?
- Just calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down, Mark.
You met Charlotte.
Does she look like a victim?
No!
She wants to be here.
Everyone chose to be with us, ok?
And you, man, you are the only one...
Don't touch me!
You are the only one who can do this.
You're out of luck then.
We can't scratch them, not safely, not with the full moon.
As werewolves, we'll be too out of control!
We'll go too far!
We've seen what you can do.
You're the only one who can change at will!
We're just gonna scratch the new ones.
That's why you invited me here.
This is it, huh?
Well, you either just did a piss-poor job explaining it to those people or you just recruited a bunch of psychopaths.
Either way, I'm out of here!
This is...
- Josh...
- Get out of my way.
Josh, I'm sorry.
The pack needs you.
I know this sounds weird, but I know exactly how you feel.
Oh yeah?
You spend a lot of time naked in a cage?
I was just like you, Josh.
Afraid, convinced that being a wolf was a death sentence.
The thought of passing it on to somebody else was terrifying, but then I had April.
She's your ch... child, Andrew.
It's completely different.
You're gonna see, Josh.
Making your own wolf, it's not curse at all!
Having April was the best thing that I ever did with my life.
If you're so convinced I'm gonna love it, why don't you let me the hell out of the cage, huh?
We can't do that, Josh.
See, the cage is gonna keep everyone safe.
They just get a scratch.
And how do you know that I'm not gonna turn on you, huh?
When I change?
How do you know?
Because we are your pack now.
That's right.
And we're gonna fall in line like we always have.
And you, you would never hurt your own pups.
You already have a pack!
You already have one!
Why do you need more wolves?
One day, the truce with those parasites is gonna come to an end.
You have to understand that when that happens, we have to be ready.
The vamps can choose who can join them and when.
Us, it's more random.
You scratch somebody during a full moon, and they're one of us.
But with you leading us, we could finally choose who's part of our family too!
And once you made a few of your own, you're gonna realize this is what you were meant to do.
This is crazy.
Just know that what you're asking me to do, I will never do this.
We have seen your true wolf, Josh.
You showed us.
And that is who we need helping us right now.
Come on, Josh!
Show him to us again.
Never.
What are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Josh.
- No.
No, no, no.
No, stop.
This is for everyone's good.
No!
Stop!
Do it again!
Do it again!
Josh ran a pie shop?
That actually doesn't sound that bad!
No, he was miserable.
Trust.
Am I horrible if that makes me feel just a little bit good?
Don't pretend you don't know.
The guy is a wreck without you, past, present, future.
You know it!
I know, but if I stay, I'm enabling him, this violent guy that he's ok with.
If I stay in this house, the next time someone gets hurt or worse...
I know.
I know.
It just breaks my heart to see you go.
Hmm, you look unhappy.
Is that because you kept your word or because you broke it?
You're not the only one that I gave my word to.
What?
Like you owe those vampires something?
Not all of them, no.
But Kenny, yeah, I do.
Suzanna, Kenny is my son.
Oh!
Well, that does change the equation, doesn't it?
Yes, it does.
He saved me during the plague, and when he needed help, I gave it to him,
- and I made him one of us.
- You call that help?
You don't understand the circumstances.
He would've died if I hadn't helped him, and I gave him my word to do whatever it takes to protect him.
Now you want me to give him a pass too?
He's different!
Not...
He's not Bishop!
Why didn't you tell me this when I first saw you?
Because, Suzanna, I wanted you to know that I was a different kind of vampire, that I'm a little bit more like you.
And it's a little bit hard to do that when I just turned the next leader of Boston, ok?
I understand a weakness for our kids, but I thought after that girl, after you dried up,
I thought you were done with all this.
The pain that you felt after killing Isaac.
That never really goes away completely, does it?
No.
Well, then why would you wish that on me?
Don't ask me to do that to Kenny.
You're asking me to look the other way while people die.
I didn't know what he was up to.
I really didn't.
So just give me a chance to rein him in.
Fine, I'll give you 2 months.
And I'll have to trust that you can raise him up into something decent, like you would've with Isaac.
I will.
I will.
Fine, then I'll back off.
But if you can't get him under control, the next time I see you, you won't see me coming.
So what's next for you?
Hmm?
Are you gonna stay in Boston?
No, I think I'll find someplace new.
I was just hoping that next place might've been with you.
Oh, hey... hey!
Uh, you got a minute?
I just...
No, 'cause I'm doing...
Just kind of need some impartial advice from a friend.
Ok.
What... am I crazy to let Suzanna leave town?
She's the only wife that I ever had.
Suzanna's not right for you.
Ok, but what are the chances, you know, that someone that you love that much is gone, you think for good, then comes back...
Different, but the connection's still there.
I mean, what do you do?
Do you just let them go?
- No!
- I thought you said Suzanna...
For the right person, yes, but Suzanna is not that person.
Ok, well, then who are we talking about?
Are we talking about, like, Kat, or...
- Not Celine.
- Oh, also not right for you!
Why not?
- Ok, should we take Suzanna?
- Sure!
- She loves you in theory.
- Yes.
As long as you never mess up!
She would never put up with you day to day.
No!
Not the real you.
No!
All right, well, that's true.
You need someone who knows that you slip.
You need someone who knows that you're not perfect, but who loves you anyway, who knows that you'll get there someday.
One day!
Yeah, there's only one problem with that.
That woman doesn't exist.
- You've gotta stop them!
- Astrid?
They've got Josh.
How long has it been?
Like 15 minutes?
This is ridiculous.
We never should've let her go in there alone.
She'll be back soon.
I saw Josh.
He's in a cage in the basement.
Is he ok?
Uh, he's in a cage in the basement!
Right!
Is there anyone else with him?
- No, they just left.
- Where did they go?
They're showing the new ones where to turn tomorrow.
It's like a super creepy college tour.
Well, are you gonna show us where Josh is?
Ok, yes!
Hello?
Can we at least pretend we run a fake business?
You don't wanna do this.
Oh, I heard that you can compel vampires.
That even gave me a little tingle.
Looks like the juniper's working.
- You want to let me go.
- No, I really don't.
Oh my God!
Josh!
Hey!
You all right, pal?
Let's get you out of here.
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on!
Let's go, man.
Let's go, Josh.
Come on.
We're gonna help you.
Guys.
Guys!
Oh, you can leave, but he stays.
He's coming with us.
You already left him once.
You know how it's done.
And you picked the wrong night to cross us.
Let us leave with him.
Sorry, he's meeting his brand new family tomorrow.
Your wife and daughter are alive because of him, and you do this?
We didn't kick Josh out for what he is.
You did.
We took him in.
At least, with these new wolves, he'll get the respect you should've given him.
We can take them.
No, Nora, we can't.
I can hear more coming.
Get Josh out of here.
- Go, Sally.
- I'm not leaving without you.
I got this.
Behind you!
Behind you!
Get out of here, Sally.
You don't wanna see what happens.
I'm not leaving!
Ok.
No!
Sally, you need to go.
I can't!
I'm gonna enjoy this.
Nah!
Ha!
Hit him, hit him, hit him!
Hit me!
Get down!
Get up!
Sally, no more possessing!
I'm serious!
Hi!
You know what?
Hey, hey, hey!
I can handle one guy!
I know you can.
I know.
I just... this one's for me.
Come on!
You know what it does to you!
What are you doing?
- I need a body.
- Why?
To remind you of this.
Please tell me you remember.
That was, uh...
- Confusing.
- Amazing!
Have we done that before?
Now hit me.
Punch me in the face!
I can't hit a girl, not after that.
Oh really?
You have to.
Ok.
So, um...
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- Ok.
Hey, uh, we gonna talk about this?
Yes.
Yes, let's talk about it.
- Let's talk about it.
- Ok, first question:
Was that you or was that the dude?
Ok.
Hey!
Hey, sweetheart, we gotta get you home.
No, just wait.
Let's talk about it.
No, you're glowing, Sally.
Well, it was a really good kiss!
No, I mean that your skin...
It was a very good kiss.
It was a great kiss.
Um, I...
What?
What is it?
I don't know, I don't know!
Really?
You're reading that right now?
It's nothing.
Even with 200 years of experience, you're a bad liar.
Ha ha!
Just give me a second.
- Just go.
I'll meet you at home.
- No, I'm just gonna...
Wow!
Just one little text is all that took.
You're much more responsive to this one than to me.
What happened to giving me 2 months to rein him in?
That's an oddly specific time-frame, right?
I find it helps with lies.
Please, let him go.
I killed our own perfect child.
What makes you think I'm gonna let this live.
Suzanna...
Don't do this.
I told you that he is my son, because I wanted you to understand
I can't let anything happen to him.
What, like I didn't already know that?
And you ask me to do that anyway?
Because he's not your son!
You had a son.
I wanted to be wrong about you.
I wanted to believe that deep in your core, there was some small shred of that good man that I loved.
Suzanna, there is and you know that.
No, there's not.
Not anymore.
Not after everything that you've done.
Everything that I've done?
No, uh-uh.
Suzanna, I don't believe you.
You knew all about my reputation before you set foot in Boston.
When I rattled off all of those horrible, awful things that I did to my victims, if you were truly shocked, you would've ended me right there.
But you didn't.
You let me live!
Why?
To give you a chance to make it right, to kill your boy here.
You don't care about everyone that I've killed.
The thing that you can't get past is the one that you killed.
But that wasn't your fault.
It was Bishop's.
He made you what you are, just like I made Kenny!
But this isn't about him, and it isn't about me.
- It is about you.
- No, it's about Isaac, and it has always been about Isaac.
All I did was forgive you.
That's what you hate.
And I do.
Suzanna, I forgive you.
Isaac was our child.
We were his parents!
We are supposed to protect him!
You did your best to protect him, and I forgive you.
This is your son?
This is your son.
I want you to know how this feels.
- It wasn't your fault.
- Stop staying that!
- Forgive yourself.
- Don't tell me how to grieve!
Forgive yourself.
No!
Forgive yourself.
Where did you go?
It was a long night.
How are they?
Josh is upstairs sleeping.
Sally's...
Oh no!
Oh no, no, no, no!
How long has she been like this?
Almost since she got back.
I think she was keeping a lid on it, so you wouldn't worry.
Ok, she's gonna bounce back, right?
She always bounces back.
Sally, you're gonna be ok.
You gotta be.
What did you want me to remember?
You helped me, Sally.
You always help me.
I never should've let her stay.
She wanted to help.
I told her not to possess wolves.
She knows what it does to her, and I told her to leave.
She was never gonna leave you.
Yeah, but why would she do something so stupid?
Because she's in love with you, you dummy.
You think Sally's been acting weird around you since she's been back?
She has.
Because in that other life, you and Sally were in love.
Well, why wouldn't she tell me?
We have to make sure she gets better so she can tell you herself.
I will.
I would do anything for her.
No, let me go!
The blood of the child revives us.
No!
Josh?
Aidan!
Nora!
If you leave now, we won't call the police.
[ grunts ] I think they want our jewelry.
[ gasps ]
That...
I can't take.
Too hot to handle.
This is for you, ma'am.
Wear it well.
Adrian is having a normal emotional reaction
To a devastating experience.
You should consider hiring a bodyguard.
And I look forward to protecting you and your husband.
I'm not coming back home.
Where do you plan on staying?
I understand you're looking for a maid?
Hey.
You must be zoila's daughter.
You the new pool boy?
I'm ethan.
We will produce your album.
If I pretend to be your wife.
I'm going to propose tonight.
Will she still love you when she finds out what you did?
She better not.
Hey, there.
Hello, my darling.
Dahlia died 15 years ago.
I think nicholas is ready to move on.
Did he mention that she committed suicide?
Ms. Falta, you are released in good faith.
Hello, mrs.
Peri.
I really thought you were deported.
Is mr.
Spence here?
I'd like to see him, too.
Well, you're in a good mood.
[ chuckles ]
I have great news and amazing news.
Okay.
I'm all ears.
I'm pregnant.
[ laughs ]
I don't understand.
Spence and I have been having sex every day.
I should be knocked up by now.
Well, I can start you on fertility drugs if you like,
Let's just say it's better for my marriage if I'm pregnant.
Now...
Shoot me up with everything you got.
[ sighs ] [ door closes ]
Hey!
Just had my first visit with the o.B.
Doc says I won't be showing for a while.
Lucky me.
What's wrong?
[ sighs ]
I had an affair with rosie.
It's not just a one-time thing.
I'm in love with her.
And I need to be with her.
I want a divorce.
We're having a baby, spence.
[ sighs ] yeah, I know.
I know the timing is rotten,
But the truth is, our marriage has been over for a long time,
And we both deserve to be happy.
I just want to thank you.
You're doing me a huge favor.
You're helping me stay in america.
I should thank you.
[ car door closes ]
And I will take wonderful care of your family.
Oh, well, mostly, you'll be taking care of my uncle ken.
He recently had a stroke, but I'm sure
That his wife and daughter will need some help, as well.
Mm-hmm.
[ chuckles ]
Good luck to you.
Aren't you going inside?
[ chuckling ] oh, no.
I'm not going in there.
Why not?
You'll see.
So, your husband doesn't talk?
Not since the stroke, and...
I'm his daughter.
I'm his wife.
Oh.
I married kenny two years ago.
Should I call you mrs.
Miller?
[ chuckles ] I'm just didi.
But you can call her miss miller.
She's never been married, and she's 40.
Call me lucinda.
And you can also call her ambrosia.
That was your name at the strip club, wasn't it --
Ambrosia?
So, rosie, this is your little boy.
Does he speak english?
He's learning new words every day.
Do you have kids?
Maybe once ken gets better, but there's no rush.
I've got time.
I hope you do have a baby.
They'll never let her adopt
With that arrest for drug possession.
What did the cops catch you with -- ecstasy?
¿mama, qué es ecstasy?
No, no, no.
You don't need to learn that word.
Could you show us to our room now?
Sure.
Follow me.
Hey, papito.
You know, rosie,
Lucinda and I are not always like this.
[ chuckles ] okay.
Sometimes, we get nasty.
H-hey!
That's my breakfast.
No, that is a heart attack wrapped in a flour tortilla.
What did the doctor say about your cholesterol?
You know I can't hear you when I'm looking at cheese.
[ groans ]
Can you hear me now?
[ cellphone rings ]
Hey, mija!
Is that valentina?
Let me talk to her.
Hey, your mom's here.
You want to say hi?
Whatever.
Just find out where she is.
[ chuckling ] really?
You're working as a maid?
What?
!
Give me the phone.
So, you're a live-in?
That's good.
No!
That is not good!
She's supposed to be in design school!
She says you know the people she's working for.
I do?
Evelyn and adrian powell?
No, no, no.
That's good.
That's good, mija.
What is going on?
Marisol asked me to help her clean out the closet.
Yeah, the rest of my stuff is being delivered tomorrow,
So I'm gonna need more room.
But those are dahlia's letters, her private things.
Look, I am being careful.
I am just moving this stuff into the garage.
That is not your decision to make.
If you want to rearrange things around here,
You need permission.
From you?
From nicholas.
It's his house, remember?
I thought I had a say in where things go.
Well, you're not married yet.
[ indistinct conversations ]
You should have seen it.
It was like...
Cut him in two.
Yeah.
[ chuckles ]
Oh, hey, carmen.
I want you to meet dario.
Dario, this is carmen.
His fiancée.
Really?
It's a long story.
I'd love to hear it.
Since I'm beautiful, I can't help but notice
That neither of you is looking at me.
[ sighs ] I'm sorry.
Um, dario is an old friend.
We haven't seen each other in years.
And we were just catching up.
No.
What you're doing is flirting,
And everyone at this party's starting to notice.
Maybe it's time to go.
Yeah, I think so.
[ chuckles ]
Here's, uh, the keys to my car.
Don't wait up.
Hmm.
No.
Tanya and I will call once we've finished shopping.
Well, kudos on the new bodyguard.
He is positively scrumptious.
Is he?
I hadn't noticed.
And my breasts are real, and I love my stepchildren.
[ chuckles ]
Are we done lying to each other now?
I admit tony's handsome,
But it's not like anything's going to happen.
Not all of us like to seduce the help.
I shower with my plumber one time...
[ chuckles ]
Evelyn, what's wrong?
Ow.
Where did you get that?
It was a gift.
Let me see it.
No!
That's my blood ruby pendant.
No, it's mine!
No!
Evelyn, what are you doing?
Leave me alone!
She stole my necklace.
[ screaming ]
They're just having a...
Minor disagreement.
Give it back, you bitch!
Hey.
You're hurting me!
Hey, hey.
Hey.
[ gasps ]
She's getting away!
For the love of god, someone shoot her!
Alejandro.
It's 6:00 in the morning!
Can we discuss this later, please?
Well, I'm your fiancée.
You should have called.
You know, from now on,
If you want to have sex with hot guys,
You do it here, home, okay, so I don't worry.
Dario and I didn't have sex.
Don't tell that to the other gays.
They'll kick you out of the union.
We hadn't seen each other in 10 years.
We had some serious catching up to do.
So...
Is he an ex?
He was the one that got away.
When he moved to europe, he begged me to come with him,
But I couldn't because of my career.
Of course, because your career is very important.
But seeing him last night
Made me rethink a lot of my choices.
He said he still loves me,
And he asked me to move to Spain with him.
And this time, I'm considering it.
Uh, but -- but wh-- what about us?
We have the engagement party Friday.
Yeah.
I'm thinking we should wait on that.
We're getting married in six weeks.
Maybe not.
I don't know.
Look, I need to get some rest 'cause I'm seeing dario again tonight,
And this time, we won't be talking.
[ exhales sharply ] [ mixer whirring ]
Hey.
Are you baking a cake?
[ chuckles ] I'm trying to.
It's daddy's birthday tomorrow.
Mm.
You're such a good daughter.
Well, I like to think so.
Have you always lived with your father?
Oh, lord, no.
After I got my master's, I lived in new york.
I was a sculptor.
Really?
I was starting to make a name for myself,
But then mama died.
And daddy was so devastated,
I had to come back and take care of him.
It was really nice.
Then, one night, he goes out drinking,
And he comes back
With that cheap piece of hollywood trash.
You mean mrs.
Didi?
He let that slut crawl into my mama's bed.
I will never forgive him for that.
[ spatula clatters ]
Are you okay?
I really shouldn't talk about this.
It makes me want to spit.
Maybe I should finish the cake.
Good idea.
Miss lucinda?
I'm sure mrs.
Didi loves your father.
Rosie, do me a favor.
Don't ever say anything nice about that woman.
Okay, but, uh, I just don't want to take sides.
Taking sides is part of this job,
And I'm just happy to know you'll be on mine.
Hey, pool boy!
What are you doing?
If you must know, I'm looking for a bathroom.
But you're tracking in mud.
Well, that's something to remember me by.
[ chuckles ] [ doorbell rings ] [ mop clatters ]
I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want to talk to you, either.
Where's your room?
Upstairs.
Why?
Mom!
What are you doing?
Mom.
That's a closet.
I don't want you working for the powells.
Why not?
Because you're only 19, and they're dangerous.
That's the gift-wrapping room.
Damn, this house is big.
Look, I don't care what you think of the powells.
They have been nothing but nice to me.
Yeah, well, the powells are not the only reason
You should be in school making something of your life.
I can't afford school right now.
Your father and I will take care of it.
I can do it on my own.
I just need a little time.
Girls like you think you have all the time in the world,
But the years fly by
And you realize it's too late to make your dreams come true.
And then, you spend the rest of your life
Cleaning somebody else's oven.
You're doing it again.
You're trying to control me.
Can't you get a different job --
Something in a mall?
No!
I work for the powells, and that's all there is to it.
Now, please, go back to your life, and let me have mine.
Okay, guys,
I'm gonna want everything in the master bedroom.
I mean, there's over 50 boxes in the truck.
Oh, I know.
What's all this?
The rest of my boxes arrived today.
Y-yeah, I -
- I can see that.
Some of this stuff in the hallway closet.
Well, why didn't you?
[ sighs ]
Because it's already filled...
With dahlia's things.
Oh.
So, this little display,
It's your way of asking me to move them?
I guess it was a little passive-aggressive.
Tell me, what part of this is passive?
[ chuckles ]
All right, first thing tomorrow,
I'll have ethan move dahlia's things to the garage.
[ sighs ] thank you.
I didn't think you'd mind,
But opal said that I needed your permission.
I don't want dahlia's things in the garage.
Call goodwill tomorrow.
Have them take everything away.
Are you sure?
Dahlia's gone.
But you are here to stay.
[ sighs ] oh, nick.
Mm.
[ door closes ]
Rosie:
Hello, there.
Rosie.
You scared me.
[ chuckles ]
I wanted to fix mr.
Ken's robe before he got up in the morning.
Oh. [ chuckles ] well...
That's a pretty dress.
I know how it looks, me hitting the clubs
While kenny's stuck in that chair,
But every once in a while, I need to have a good time.
It must be hard on you, having a sick husband.
It is.
When I first met kenny, I didn't think he was that old.
I just thought he was adorable.
And funny.
And he dressed better than any man I'd ever met --
Custom-made shirts, italian shoes.
[ chuckles ]
We had two wonderful years.
Then, one day, I found him lying on the floor.
So, what has lucinda told you about me?
Did she call me a gold digger and a slut and a moron?
She never said moron.
Well, don't you believe a word she says.
I love kenny.
She's just jealous 'cause that big old ass of hers
Has been on the market for years and no one's buying.
Mrs. Didi.
How could you live with someone you hate?
I just try to remind myself
When kenny dies, all this belongs to me.
And you should keep that in mind, too.
[ indistinct conversations ]
I really have to advise against this.
The man at the soup kitchen said
He's seen that homeless woman around here.
If any of the other bums recognize her,
I could have my necklace back by tonight.
Well, at least let's stick together
While we hand these sketches out.
Oh, that'll take hours.
Relax.
Adrian and I will be fine.
[ sighs ] [ car door closes ]
Now...
You try that alley,
And, uh, we'll search over there.
[ sighs ]
Adrian?
Darling, what's wrong?
We shouldn't have come here.
But you agreed to this.
At home, in the living room.
Now that we're here, it's so dark.
This adolescent cowardice of yours
Is really getting on my nerves.
Get out of the car.
No!
Adrian!
Hey, little mama.
[ chuckling ] hello, there.
You startled me.
Oh, well, that's all right.
Perhaps you can help me.
I'm looking for a woman.
So am I.
I don't mean to s-sound rude,
But...
You are terrifying.
Could you stay there?
I'm warning you, my husband is in this car,
And he will defend me to the death.
Isn't that right, dear?
Adrian!
Adrian, open this door!
Don't just sit there.
Do something!
Leave her alone!
Oh, my --
Not one more step!
You got pretty hair.
[ gasps ] [ panting ]
Are you hurt?
No.
I'm just angry.
[ sighs ]
Hey.
Can I talk to you about something?
Oh, god.
Are you going to ask me out?
[ chuckling ] no, but thank you for the enthusiasm.
What, then?
You know those egg thingies upstairs?
Your mom sort of took one.
What?
Yeah, I was coming out of the bathroom, [ scoffs ] that's ridiculous.
My mother doesn't steal.
Well, does she borrow?
No.
Why would mother want an egg thingy?
I don't know why anyone
Would want half of the crap in this house,
But if mrs.
Powell finds that it's missing,
She might think that...
You stole it.
And then she'd fire me.
And just so you know, I'm gonna ask you out next week,
So try to act [chuckling] surprised.
What are you doing with that?
Good morning to you, too, opal.
That belongs to dahlia.
I told you not to touch her things.
No, you said I needed permission to move her things,
So I spoke to nicholas last night.
And what did he say?
It's a bit of a surprise, actually.
I just wanted to put dahlia's things in the garage,
But he said to get rid of them entirely.
What?
The folks at goodwill sent a truck.
I guess this got left behind.
[ gasps ]
No!
[ gasps ] [ sobs ]
Look, opal...
You had no right!
Oh, for god's sake...
Those were not your things,
And this is not your house!
And then she screams, "this isn't your house!"
She didn't!
Yeah.
I am seriously thinking about asking nick to fire her.
Eh.
How long has she been working for nicholas?
About 20 years.
And how long have you been living there?
I see where you're going with this,
But I'm not some houseguest.
I'm the future mrs.
Deering,
And if I politely ask a maid to clean out a closet,
I think she should do it.
Eh.
God, that is annoying.
Look, when you work in a house for 20 years,
You start to think of it as your own.
Like this place --
My name may not be on the deed, but...
It's my home.
I get that.
But opal freaked out on me,
And now I have to walk on eggshells in my own home?
In that case, you should fire her.
Thank you.
If she's leaving eggshells on the floor...
A maid can be bitchy, but she's still got to clean up.
Anyway, I think you should go back to opal and apologize.
Seriously?
!
It's a chance to clear the air,
And if she doesn't start to behave,
Then talk to nicholas.
I hope you're right.
I don't want to be one of these beverly hills divas
That's always complaining about her maid.
It's already happened, hasn't it?
Mm...
Mm... [ papers thud ] you never read the contract?
It's my first phony marriage!
Now, give me a break.
Just tell me, my album, my tour --
I still get all that, right, even if we're just engaged?
Hold on.
I'm reading.
How could alejandro do this to me?
You know, promises were made, hearts were crossed.
I thought we really meant something to each other.
Why?
It's a fake relationship.
And we were gonna live a long fake life together, okay?
Odessa:
Mm.
Oh!
Here it is.
"the terms of this contract will not be binding
"until such time as the undersigned
And the artist are legally joined."
It means if you don't get married, you get bubkes.
No, no, no!
Why can't he just marry me and have gay sex on the weekends
Like every other husband in hollywood?
Look, I know you got a lot riding on this,
But it's time to start facing reality.
No.
I am carmen luna, and I never face reality.
I just talked to my lawyer.
I told him I don't want alimony or the house,
So there's no reason this thing has to get ugly.
[ tucker babbling ]
And I'm sorry I hurt you.
I didn't mean to fall in love with rosie.
[ toy clacking ]
I'm a star.
Men don't leave stars for maids.
Well, this one's going to, but I won't tell anyone why.
We'll just let people believe
We're another hollywood casualty.
If you continue seeing rosie, trust me...
You'll be the casualty.
What exactly do you think that you can do to me?
I'm america's sweetheart, remember?
My tear-stained face
Will be on the cover of every tabloid.
I'll tell anyone who will listen
My husband seduced the maid
While our baby was asleep in the next room.
You'll be the most hated man in show business.
Your career as daytime tv's nicest doctor will be over.
I don't care about that.
Do you care about our son?
Because I also plan on moving to europe
And taking tucker with me.
I will not allow that.
I will fight you in court.
And you'll lose.
You're the scum shacking up with the maid, remember?
A judge won't let you go to europe,
Not when you're about to give birth to our brand-new baby.
[ chuckles ]
Joke's on you.
I'm not pregnant.
That was just a maneuver
Designed to save our marriage.
Oh, well.
[ tucker babbles ]
You're a monster.
And yet I seem so nice in my films.
[ grunts ]
To recap,
If you see rosie again, even one more time,
I will destroy you.
Got it...
[as rosie] mr.
Spence?
Opal, I was hoping we could talk.
Did you know I'm writing a book?
It's about what I went through to get my son out of jail.
I had to work as a maid for six months,
So you'd think I would remember
To respect the people who do this job.
You've taken such beautiful care of dahlia's things
For all these years.
I should have spoken to you before I gave them away.
I'm sorry.
I was 19 when I met dahlia.
I was single, pregnant...
And terrified.
She offered to take me in and give me a job.
She was more than an employer.
She was my friend.
It's been 15 years since she died,
And I -- I still grieve for her.
I am so sorry.
[ sniffles ] [ voice breaking ] no.
I should apologize to you.
The way I've been behaving, it's...
Unacceptable.
So...
Maybe we can start over.
I would like that.
[ sighs ]
Well, well, well.
You are a difficult woman to find.
Do I know you?
No.
But I know you.
You're a thief.
Somebody gave this to me.
Well, now you're going to give it to me...
Whether you like it or not.
Mr. Kenneth, I fixed your robe.
Now we can get you ready for your birthday dinner.
I love birthdays.
My favorite part is the presents.
I wish I knew you better
So I could give you something you'd like.
You know what, mr.
Kenneth?
I think I know what you'd like for your birthday.
[ indistinct conversation ] ...Of getting to the bottom of this --
What in the world?
Uncle ken?
[ chuckles ] look at you!
I thought mr.
Kenneth would like to dress up for a change.
That was very thoughtful.
[ voice breaking ] I can't remember
The last time kenny looked this nice.
Are you done performing?
Excuse me?
!
Reggie is the executor of daddy's estate.
Every time he stops by,
Didi turns on the waterworks to impress him.
You are such a liar.
You could put daddy in a suit any time you want!
And when was the last time you did something nice for him?
I gave up my whole life for him.
Now who's performing?
Okay, ladies, please...
Rosie, go ahead and serve dinner.
No.
I want to do presents first.
Rosie, this is my house.
She's just an elderly guest.
No one asked you, ambrosia.
You work for me, remember?
No, she works for me.
You know, I'm sick of this.
Just go to hell!
Back off, bitch!
[ panting ] [ sighs ]
I think that means I work for him.
[ cellphone rings ]
[ cellphone beeps ] hey, mija, what's up?
Whoa, whoa.
Ho-- ho-- hold on.
Slow down!
Your mother did what?
What the hell were you thinking?
!
I wanted her out of that house.
That's your excuse for stealing?
Do you want your daughter to be a maid,
To watch while she throws her life away?
It's her life to throw!
I know what I'm talking about.
I had a chance to go to college.
I thought that scholarship would always be there --
Yeah, I know -- your life didn't turn out the way you wanted.
How does that justify trying to get your own daughter fired?
!
All right!
I'm sorry!
It just happened!
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking you could control
Everything under the sun --
The world according to zoila Always making us jump through your hoops.
Valentina and I have been doing it for years,
And we're sick of it!
I mean, we love you, but, god, you make us so unhappy!
You're unhappy?
Since when?
Since as long as I can remember.
Oh.
[ sighs ]
I'm taking this back to valentina.
[ knock on door ]
Tony:
Mrs. Powell?
I believe this belongs to you.
Tony!
[ gasps ]
How in the world...?
[ gasps ] I have my ways.
Oh [chuckles]
Here.
Allow me.
[ sighs ]
When those men broke into our home,
They stole so much more than this necklace.
They took our dignity, our sense of security...
Now I feel like I've gotten some of those things back.
I'm glad.
Oh, how can I ever repay you?
Seeing you smile is payment enough.
That longtime couple spence and peri westmore
Are calling it quits.
Although the couple issued a statement
Saying the divorce will be amicable,
Rumors are swirling that the hunky soap star
May have cheated on america's sweetheart.
And, of course, we'll always keep you updated
For the latest on this story.
[ doorbell rings ]
Rosie, what are you doing here?
I saw the tv.
They were talking about you and mrs.
Peri.
Look, I can't talk right now.
I just wanted to see if you were okay.
Not really.
Do you want to go to breakfast tomorrow,
Tell me what happened?
No, I don't.
As a matter of fact, uh, I can't see you again.
Why?
My family is breaking up because of you.
I'm very upset.
You have to stay away.
I'm sorry.
You know, my meetings are only during the days.
You sure you don't want to come with me?
San francisco sounds fun,
But I have a lot of writing to do.
Okay.
About you being all alone in the house with opal.
Well, I told you, we're good now.
By the time you get back, we're gonna be besties.
Oh, now I'm definitely worried.
[ both chuckle ]
See you in a week.
Okay.
[ sighs ]
[ speaking indistinctly ]
Alejandro!
Where's your tie?
Well, isn't this a casual thing?
No!
No. [ chuckles ]
This is our engagement party.
We have to look nice.
Ah, geez.
[ sighs ]
I should have called the whole thing off.
What -- you know, the more I think about dario...
You seem tense.
...The more that I'm --
While you get a tie -- I'm thinking black --
I'll get you a beverage.
Okay.
So, that's alejandro, huh?
Keep his glass full, make every drink a double,
And if he orders water, put vodka in it.
Why do you need him drunk?
You're paid to pour, not to ask questions.
When I give the cue, this is what I need you to say.
I'll give you an extra $50 if you stop judging me.
Oh!
You got the white flowers.
Perfect.
Carmen.
Why did you give the bartender money?
What are you up to?
Nothing.
Why do you always think I'm up to something?
[ door opens ]
Father tomas!
I'm so glad you could come.
[ door opens ] [ door closes ]
What's with the suitcase?
You might want to sit down.
I need some space.
I found a little apartment.
Not too expensive.
So, you're leaving me?
I'm taking a break.
Zoila, if I stay in this house, the way I'm feeling about you,
We're not gonna make it.
Oh.
So, I just need to [sighs] take a few months.
Trust me.
It's gonna be good for both of us.
I'll give you a call when I get settled, okay?
[ voice breaking ] and I promise to eat healthy.
[ door closes ] [ upbeat music playing, indistinct conversations ]
Hey.
How are you feeling?
Pretty hammered.
What the hell's in these drinks?
Who cares?
It's time to make our toast.
Mm.
Okay.
[ music stops ] hello, everyone!
Hey!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
[ exhales sharply ]
Alejandro and I are so happy
To have you with us on this special night.
I wish you could all feel
The passion we have for each other.
Aww!
I don't feel so good.
Neither do I. [ chuckles ]
Waiting and waiting for the big day.
Are you as excited about the wedding as we are?
[ cheers and applause ]
But I guess we have to wait a few more weeks.
Aw!
Aw!
Aw!
Aw!
What else can we do?
Why don't you get married now?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Get married now?
[ chuckling ] that's crazy!
I mean, we don't have anyone here to marry us, right?
I could do it.
Oh, my god!
Father tomas?
Who invited you?
[ chuckles ] oh, dear god.
Wedding!
Wedding!
All: [ chanting ] wedding!
Wedding!
Wedding!
Wedding!
Aah!
[ cheers and applause ]
What the hell's going on?
We're giving the people what they want.
[ crowd cheers ]
Carmen, we need to talk about this.
Yeah, we'll talk on the honeymoon.
We need to talk now.
Take five, padre.
Nobody leave!
[ chuckles ]
Man:
Let's do this.
Listen.
Listen.
We have to get married!
Why?
Because if we don't...
I get nothing.
What are you talking about?
Read the contract, alejandro!
You know, my album, my tour --
If you run off with dario, it -- it all goes away.
[ sighing ] oh...
Baby, I won't let that happen.
You won't?
I should have been clearer.
I will personally see to it that my label honors our deal...
Oh, my god.
...Not just because you're an amazing friend,
But because I believe in your talent.
You're a star waiting to happen, ms.
Carmen luna.
[ inhales sharply ]
You are the best husband I never married.
[ chuckles ] thank you.
Thank you.
[ guests screaming ] [ indistinct shouting ]
Shut up!
Get down on the ground!
Get down!
[ shouting continues ]
I'm not screwing around, people!
[ grunts ] [ screams ]
What did you do?
!
Let's go.
Let's go.
Get out of here now!
[ panting ]
Oh.
[ voice breaking ] somebody call 911, please!
Oh, my god.
You shot him!
Well, do you think we should go back to see if he's okay?
The cops are gonna be here any minute.
[ engine turns over ]
The ambulance is on its way.
[ sobbing ] he's not saying anything,
And there's so much blood.
[ sobs ]
Why?
[ sobbing loudly ]
Previously on Devious Maids...
If you leave now, we won't call the police.
I think they want our jewelry.
That...
I can't take.
Too hot to handle.
This is for you, ma'am.
Wear it well.
Adrian is having a normal emotional reaction to a devastating experience.
You should consider hiring a bodyguard.
I'm Tony Bishara, and I look forward to protecting you and your husband.
I'm not coming back home.
Where do you plan on staying?
Hi, there.
I understand you're looking for a maid?
Hey.
You must be Zoila's daughter.
- You the new pool boy?
- I'm Ethan.
We will produce your album.
If I pretend to be your wife.
I'm going to propose tonight.
Will she still love you when she finds out what you did?
She better not.
Hey, there.
Hello, my darling.
Dahlia died 15 years ago.
I think Nicholas is ready to move on.
Did he mention that she committed suicide?
Ms. Falta, you are released in good faith.
- Hello, Mrs. Peri.
- I really thought you were deported.
Is Mr. Spence here?
I'd like to see him, too.
Well, you're in a good mood.
I have great news and amazing news.
Okay.
I'm all ears.
I'm pregnant.
I don't understand.
Spence and I have been having sex every day.
I should be knocked up by now.
Well, I can start you on fertility drugs if you like, but what's the rush?
Let's just say it's better for my marriage if I'm pregnant.
Now...
Shoot me up with everything you got.
Hey!
Just had my first visit with the O.B.
Doc says I won't be showing for a while.
Lucky me.
What's wrong?
I had an affair with Rosie.
It's not just a one-time thing.
I'm in love with her.
And I need to be with her.
I want a divorce.
We're having a baby, Spence.
Yeah, I know.
I know the timing is rotten, but the truth is, our marriage has been over for a long time, and we both deserve to be happy.
I just want to thank you.
You're doing me a huge favor.
You're helping me stay in America.
I should thank you.
And I will take wonderful care of your family.
Oh, well, mostly, you'll be taking care of my Uncle Ken.
He recently had a stroke, but I'm sure that his wife and daughter will need some help, as well.
Good luck to you.
Aren't you going inside?
Oh, no.
I'm not going in there.
Why not?
You'll see.
So, your husband doesn't talk?
Not since the stroke, and...
I'm his daughter.
I'm his wife.
Oh.
I married Kenny two years ago.
Should I call you Mrs. Miller?
I'm just Didi.
But you can call her miss Miller.
She's never been married, and she's 40.
Call me Lucinda.
And you can also call her Ambrosia.
That was your name at the strip club, wasn't it...
Ambrosia?
So, Rosie, this is your little boy.
Does he speak English?
Almost.
He's learning new words every day.
Do you have kids?
Maybe once Ken gets better, but there's no rush.
I've got time.
I hope you do have a baby.
They'll never let her adopt with that arrest for drug possession.
What did the cops catch you with... ecstasy?
¿Mama, qué es ecstasy?
No, no, no.
You don't need to learn that word.
Could you show us to our room now?
Sure.
Follow me.
Hey, papito.
You know, Rosie,
Lucinda and I are not always like this.
Okay.
Sometimes, we get nasty.
H-hey!
That's my breakfast.
No, that is a heart attack wrapped in a flour tortilla.
What did the doctor say about your cholesterol?
You know I can't hear you when I'm looking at cheese.
Can you hear me now?
Hey, mija!
Is that Valentina?
Let me talk to her.
Hey, your mom's here.
You want to say hi?
Whatever.
Just find out where she is.
Really?
You're working as a maid?
What?
!
Give me the phone.
So, you're a live-in?
That's good.
No!
That is not good!
She's supposed to be in design school!
What's that?
She says you know the people she's working for.
I do?
Evelyn and Adrian Powell?
No, no, no.
That's good.
That's good, mija.
What is going on?
Marisol asked me to help her clean out the closet.
Yeah, the rest of my stuff is being delivered tomorrow, so I'm gonna need more room.
But those are Dahlia's letters, her private things.
Look, I am being careful.
I am just moving this stuff into the garage.
That is not your decision to make.
If you want to rearrange things around here, you need permission.
From you?
From Nicholas.
It's his house, remember?
We're getting married.
I thought I had a say in where things go.
Well, you're not married yet.
You should have seen it.
It was like...
Cut him in two.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, Carmen.
I want you to meet Dario.
Dario, this is Carmen.
His fiancée.
Really?
- It's a long story.
- I'd love to hear it.
Since I'm beautiful, I can't help but notice that neither of you is looking at me.
I'm sorry.
Um, Dario is an old friend.
We haven't seen each other in years.
And we were just catching up.
No.
What you're doing is flirting, and everyone at this party's starting to notice.
Maybe it's time to go.
Yeah, I think so.
Here's, uh, the keys to my car.
Don't wait up.
Hmm.
Anything else, Mrs. Powell?
No.
Tanya and I will call once we've finished shopping.
Well, kudos on the new bodyguard.
He is positively scrumptious.
Is he?
I hadn't noticed.
And my breasts are real, and I love my stepchildren.
Are we done lying to each other now?
I admit Tony's handsome, but it's not like anything's going to happen.
Not all of us like to seduce the help.
Oh, pbht!
I shower with my plumber one time...
Evelyn, what's wrong?
Where did you get that?
It was a gift.
Let me see it.
No!
That's my blood Ruby pendant.
No, it's mine!
No!
Evelyn, what are you doing?
- Leave me alone!
- She stole my necklace.
What's going on?
They're just having a... minor disagreement.
Give it back, you bitch!
Hey.
You're hurting me!
Hey, hey.
Hey.
She's getting away!
For the love of God, someone shoot her!
Alejandro.
It's 6:00 in the morning!
Can we discuss this later, please?
I am exhausted.
Well, I'm your fiancée.
You should have called.
You know, from now on, if you want to have sex with hot guys, you do it here, home, okay, so I don't worry.
Dario and I didn't have sex.
Don't tell that to the other gays.
They'll kick you out of the union.
We hadn't seen each other in 10 years.
We had some serious catching up to do.
So... is he an ex?
He was the one that got away.
When he moved to Europe, he begged me to come with him, but I couldn't because of my career.
Of course, because your career is very important.
But seeing him last night made me rethink a lot of my choices.
He said he still loves me, and he asked me to move to Spain with him.
And this time, I'm considering it.
Uh, but... but wh...
What about us?
We have the engagement party Friday.
Yeah.
I'm thinking we should wait on that.
Wait?
We're getting married in six weeks.
Maybe not.
I don't know.
Look, I need to get some rest 'cause I'm seeing Dario again tonight, and this time, we won't be talking.
Hey.
Are you baking a cake?
I'm trying to.
It's daddy's birthday tomorrow.
You're such a good daughter.
Well, I like to think so.
Have you always lived with your father?
Oh, lord, no.
After I got my master's, I lived in New York.
I was a sculptor.
Really?
I was starting to make a name for myself, but then mama died.
And daddy was so devastated,
I had to come back and take care of him.
It was really nice.
Then, one night, he goes out drinking, and he comes back with that cheap piece of Hollywood trash.
You mean Mrs. Didi?
He let that slut crawl into my mama's bed.
I will never forgive him for that.
Are you okay?
I really shouldn't talk about this.
It makes me want to spit.
Maybe I should finish the cake.
Good idea.
Miss Lucinda?
I'm sure Mrs. Didi loves your father.
Rosie, do me a favor.
Don't ever say anything nice about that woman.
Okay, but, uh, I just don't want to take sides.
Taking sides is part of this job, and I'm just happy to know you'll be on mine.
Hey, pool boy!
What are you doing?
If you must know, I'm looking for a bathroom.
But you're tracking in mud.
Well, that's something to remember me by.
I don't want to talk to you.
Good.
I don't want to talk to you, either.
Where's your room?
Upstairs.
Why?
Mom!
What are you doing?
Mom.
That's a closet.
I'm here to pack up all your stuff and take you home.
I don't want you working for the Powells.
Why not?
Because you're only 19, and they're dangerous.
That's the gift-wrapping room.
Damn, this house is big.
Look, I don't care what you think of the Powells.
They have been nothing but nice to me.
Yeah, well, the Powells are not the only reason
I want you out of here.
You should be in school making something of your life.
I can't afford school right now.
Your father and I will take care of it.
I can do it on my own.
I just need a little time.
Girls like you think you have all the time in the world, but the years fly by and then one day, you wake up and you realize it's too late to make your dreams come true.
And then, you spend the rest of your life cleaning somebody else's oven.
You're doing it again.
You're trying to control me.
Can't you get a different job...
- Something in a mall?
- No!
I work for the Powells, and that's all there is to it.
Now, please, go back to your life, and let me have mine.
Okay, guys,
I'm gonna want everything in the master bedroom.
Everything?
I mean, there's over 50 boxes in the truck.
Oh, I know.
What's all this?
The rest of my boxes arrived today.
Y-yeah, I...
I can see that.
I was gonna store some of this stuff in the hallway closet.
Oh, yeah?
Well, why didn't you?
Because it's already filled...
With Dahlia's things.
So, this little display, it's your way of asking me to move them?
I guess it was a little passive-aggressive.
Tell me, what part of this is passive?
All right, first thing tomorrow,
I'll have Ethan move Dahlia's things to the garage.
Thank you.
I didn't think you'd mind, but Opal said that I needed your permission.
You know, on second thought,
I don't want Dahlia's things in the garage.
Call goodwill tomorrow.
Have them take everything away.
Are you sure?
Dahlia's gone.
But you are here to stay.
Oh, Nick.
Hello, there.
Rosie.
You scared me.
What are you doing up?
I wanted to fix Mr. Ken's robe before he got up in the morning.
Oh.
Well...
That's a pretty dress.
I know how it looks, me hitting the clubs while Kenny's stuck in that chair, but every once in a while, I need to have a good time.
It must be hard on you, having a sick husband.
It is.
When I first met Kenny, I didn't think he was that old.
I just thought he was adorable.
And funny.
And he dressed better than any man I'd ever met...
Custom-made shirts, Italian shoes.
We had two wonderful years.
Then, one day, I found him lying on the floor.
So, what has Lucinda told you about me?
Did she call me a gold digger and a slut and a moron?
She never said moron.
Well, don't you believe a word she says.
I love Kenny.
She's just jealous 'cause that big old ass of hers has been on the market for years and no one's buying.
Mrs. Didi.
How could you live with someone you hate?
I just try to remind myself when Kenny dies, all this belongs to me.
And you should keep that in mind, too.
Mrs. Powell,
I really have to advise against this.
The man at the soup kitchen said he's seen that homeless woman around here.
If any of the other bums recognize her,
I could have my necklace back by tonight.
Well, at least let's stick together while we hand these sketches out.
Oh, that'll take hours.
Relax.
Adrian and I will be fine.
Now...
You try that alley, and, uh, we'll search over there.
Adrian?
Darling, what's wrong?
We shouldn't have come here.
- But you agreed to this.
- At home, in the living room.
Now that we're here, it's so dark.
This adolescent cowardice of yours is really getting on my nerves.
- Get out of the car.
- No!
Adrian!
Hey, little mama.
Oh!
Hello, there.
You startled me.
Oh, well, that's all right.
Perhaps you can help me.
I'm looking for a woman.
So am I.
I don't mean to s-sound rude, but... you are terrifying.
Could you stay there?
I'm warning you, my husband is in this car, and he will defend me to the death.
Isn't that right, dear?
Adrian!
Adrian, open this door!
Don't just sit there.
Do something!
Leave her alone!
Oh, my...
Not one more step!
You got pretty hair.
Are you hurt?
No.
I'm just angry.
Hey, can I talk to you about something?
Oh, God.
Are you going to ask me out?
No, but thank you for the enthusiasm.
What, then?
You know those egg thingies upstairs?
Your mom sort of took one.
What?
Yeah, I was coming out of the bathroom, and I saw her put it in her purse.
That's ridiculous.
My mother doesn't steal.
Well, does she borrow?
No.
Why would mother want an egg thingy?
I don't know why anyone would want half of the crap in this house, but if Mrs. Powell finds that it's missing, she might think that...
You stole it.
And then she'd fire me.
And just so you know, I'm gonna ask you out next week, so try to act surprised.
What are you doing with that?
Good morning to you, too, Opal.
That belongs to Dahlia.
I told you not to touch her things.
No, you said I needed permission to move her things, so I spoke to Nicholas last night.
And what did he say?
It's a bit of a surprise, actually.
I just wanted to put Dahlia's things in the garage, but he said to get rid of them entirely.
What?
The folks at goodwill sent a truck.
I guess this got left behind.
No!
Look, Opal...
- You had no right!
- Oh, for God's sake...
Those were not your things, and this is not your house!
And then she screams, "this isn't your house!"
- She didn't!
- Yeah.
I am seriously thinking about asking Nick to fire her.
Eh.
What?
How long has she been working for Nicholas?
About 20 years.
And how long have you been living there?
I see where you're going with this, but I'm not some houseguest.
I'm the future Mrs. Deering, and if I politely ask a maid to clean out a closet,
I think she should do it.
God, that is annoying.
Look, when you work in a house for 20 years, you start to think of it as your own.
Like this place...
My name may not be on the deed, but...
It's my home.
I get that.
But Opal freaked out on me, and now I have to walk on eggshells in my own home?
In that case, you should fire her.
Thank you.
If she's leaving eggshells on the floor...
A maid can be bitchy, but she's still got to clean up.
Anyway, I think you should go back to Opal and apologize.
Seriously?
!
It's a chance to clear the air, and if she doesn't start to behave, then talk to Nicholas.
I hope you're right.
I don't want to be one of these Beverly Hills divas that's always complaining about her maid.
It's already happened, hasn't it?
Mm... mm...
You never read the contract?
It's my first phony marriage!
Now, give me a break.
Just tell me, my album, my tour...
I still get all that, right, even if we're just engaged?
Hold on.
I'm reading.
How could Alejandro do this to me?
You know, promises were made, hearts were crossed.
I thought we really meant something to each other.
Why?
It's a fake relationship.
And we were gonna live a long fake life together, okay?
Mm.
Oh!
Here it is.
"The terms of this contract will not be binding
"until such time as the undersigned and the artist are legally joined."
So, what does that mean?
It means if you don't get married, you get bubkes.
No, no, no!
I'm sorry.
Why can't he just marry me and have gay sex on the weekends like every other husband in Hollywood?
Look, I know you got a lot riding on this, but it's time to start facing reality.
No.
I am Carmen luna, and I never face reality.
I just talked to my lawyer.
I told him I don't want alimony or the house, so there's no reason this thing has to get ugly.
And I'm sorry I hurt you.
I didn't mean to fall in love with Rosie.
I'm a star.
Men don't leave stars for maids.
Well, this one's going to, but I won't tell anyone why.
We'll just let people believe we're another Hollywood casualty.
If you continue seeing Rosie, trust me...
You'll be the casualty.
What exactly do you think that you can do to me?
I'm America's sweetheart, remember?
My tear-stained face will be on the cover of every tabloid.
I'll tell anyone who will listen my husband seduced the maid while our baby was asleep in the next room.
Once I'm done, you'll be the most hated man in show business.
Your career as daytime TV's nicest doctor will be over.
I don't care about that.
Do you care about our son?
Because I also plan on moving to Europe and taking Tucker with me.
I will not allow that.
I will fight you in court.
And you'll lose.
You're the scum shacking up with the maid, remember?
A judge won't let you go to Europe, not when you're about to give birth to our brand-new baby.
Joke's on you.
I'm not pregnant.
That was just a maneuver designed to save our marriage.
Oh, well.
You're a monster.
And yet I seem so nice in my films.
To recap, if you see Rosie again, even one more time,
I will destroy you.
Got it...
Mr. Spence?
Opal, I was hoping we could talk.
Did you know I'm writing a book?
It's about what I went through to get my son out of jail.
I had to work as a maid for six months, so you'd think I would remember to respect the people who do this job.
You've taken such beautiful care of Dahlia's things for all these years
I should have spoken to you before I gave them away.
I'm sorry.
I was 19 when I met Dahlia.
I was single, pregnant...
And terrified.
She offered to take me in and give me a job.
She was more than an employer.
She was my friend.
It's been 15 years since she died, and I...
I still grieve for her.
I am so sorry.
No.
I should apologize to you.
The way I've been behaving, it's... unacceptable.
So... maybe we can start over.
I would like that.
Well, well, well.
You are a difficult woman to find.
Do I know you?
No.
But I know you.
You're a thief.
Somebody gave this to me.
Well, now you're going to give it to me...
Whether you like it or not.
Mr. Kenneth, I fixed your robe.
Now we can get you ready for your birthday dinner.
I love birthdays.
My favorite part is the presents.
I wish I knew you better so I could give you something you'd like.
You know what, Mr. Kenneth?
I think I know what you'd like for your birthday.
Of getting to the bottom of this...
What in the world?
Uncle Ken?
Look at you!
Rosie, did you do this?
I thought Mr. Kenneth would like to dress up for a change.
That was very thoughtful.
Yeah!
I can't remember the last time Kenny looked this nice.
Are you done performing?
Excuse me?
!
Reggie is the executor of daddy's estate.
Every time he stops by,
Didi turns on the waterworks to impress him.
You are such a liar.
You could put daddy in a suit any time you want!
And when was the last time you did something nice for him?
I gave up my whole life for him.
Now who's performing?
Okay, ladies, please...
Rosie, go ahead and serve dinner.
No.
I want to do presents first.
Rosie, do as I say.
Rosie, this is my house.
She's just an elderly guest.
No one asked you, Ambrosia.
You work for me, remember?
No, she works for me.
You know, I'm sick of this.
Just go to hell!
Back off, bitch!
I think that means I work for him.
Hey, mija, what's up?
Whoa, whoa.
Ho... ho... hold on.
Slow down!
Your mother did what?
What the hell were you thinking?
!
I wanted her out of that house.
That's your excuse for stealing?
Do you want your daughter to be a maid, to watch while she throws her life away?
It's her life to throw!
I know what I'm talking about.
I had a chance to go to college.
I thought that scholarship would always be there...
Yeah, I know... your life didn't turn out the way you wanted.
How does that justify trying to get your own daughter fired?
!
All right!
I'm sorry!
It just happened!
I don't know what I was thinking.
I do.
You were thinking you could control everything under the sun...
The world according to Zoila...
Pablo.
Always making us jump through your hoops.
Valentina and I have been doing it for years, and we're sick of it!
I mean, we love you, but, God, you make us so unhappy!
You're unhappy?
Since when?
Since as long as I can remember.
I'm taking this back to Valentina.
Mrs. Powell?
I believe this belongs to you.
Tony!
How in the world...?
I have my ways.
Here.
Allow me.
When those men broke into our home, they stole so much more than this necklace.
They took our dignity, our sense of security...
Now I feel like I've gotten some of those things back.
I'm glad.
Oh, how can I ever repay you?
Seeing you smile is payment enough.
"ET" has just learned that longtime couple Spence and Peri Westmore are calling it quits.
Although the couple issued a statement saying the divorce will be amicable, rumors are swirling that the hunky soap star may have cheated on America's sweetheart.
And, of course, we'll always keep you updated for the latest on this story.
Rosie, what are you doing here?
I saw the TV.
They were talking about you and Mrs. Peri.
Look, I can't talk right now.
I just wanted to see if you were okay.
Not really.
Do you want to go to breakfast tomorrow, tell me what happened?
No, I don't.
As a matter of fact, uh, I can't see you again.
Why?
My family is breaking up because of you.
I'm very upset.
You have to stay away.
I'm sorry.
You know, my meetings are only during the days.
You sure you don't want to come with me?
San Francisco sounds fun, but I have a lot of writing to do.
Okay.
I guess I'm just worried about you being all alone in the house with Opal.
Well, I told you, we're good now.
By the time you get back, we're gonna be besties.
Oh, now I'm definitely worried.
See you in a week.
Okay.
_
_

Alejandro!
Where's your tie?
Well, isn't this a casual thing?
No!
No.
This is our engagement party.
We have to look nice.
Ah, geez.
I should have called the whole thing off.
What... you know, the more I think about Dario...
- You seem tense...
- The more that I'm...
While you get a tie...
I'm thinking black...
I'll get you a beverage.
Okay.
So, that's Alejandro, huh?
Keep his glass full, make every drink a double, and if he orders water, put vodka in it.
Why do you need him drunk?
You're paid to pour, not to ask questions.
When I give the cue, this is what I need you to say.
Here.
I'll give you an extra $50 if you stop judging me.
Oh!
You got the white flowers.
Perfect.
Carmen.
Why did you give the bartender money?
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.
Why do you always think I'm up to something?
Father Tomas!
I'm so glad you could come.
What's with the suitcase?
You might want to sit down.
I need some space.
I found a little apartment.
Not too expensive.
So, you're leaving me?
I'm taking a break.
A break?
Zoila, if I stay in this house, the way I'm feeling about you, we're not gonna make it.
Oh.
So, I just need to take a few months.
Trust me.
It's gonna be good for both of us.
I'll give you a call when I get settled, okay?
And I promise to eat healthy.
Hey.
How are you feeling?
Pretty hammered.
What the hell's in these drinks?
Who cares?
It's time to make our toast.
Mm.
Okay.
Hello, everyone!
Hey!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Alejandro and I are so happy to have you with us on this special night.
I wish you could all feel the passion we have for each other.
I don't feel so good.
Neither do I.
Waiting and waiting for the big day.
Are you as excited about the wedding as we are?
But I guess we have to wait a few more weeks.
- Aw!
Aw!
- Aw!
Aw!
What else can we do?
Why don't you get married now?
- Yeah!
Yeah!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Get married now?
That's crazy!
I mean, we don't have anyone here to marry us, right?
I could do it.
Oh, my God!
Father Tomas?
Who invited you?
Oh, dear God.
Wedding!
Wedding!
Wedding!
Wedding!
Wedding!
Wedding!
Aah!
What the hell's going on?
We're giving the people what they want.
Carmen, we need to talk about this.
Yeah, we'll talk on the honeymoon.
We need to talk now.
Take five, padre.
Nobody leave!
Let's do this.
Listen.
Listen.
We have to get married!
Why?
Because if we don't...
I get nothing.
What are you talking about?
Read the contract, Alejandro!
You know, my album, my tour...
If you run off with Dario, it... it all goes away.
Baby, I won't let that happen.
You won't?
I should have been clearer.
I will personally see to it that my label honors our deal...
Oh, my God.
Not just because you're an amazing friend, but because I believe in your talent.
You're a star waiting to happen, Ms. Carmen Luna.
You are the best husband I never married.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Shut up!
Get down on the ground!
Get down!
I'm not screwing around, people!
What did you do?
!
Let's go.
Let's go.
Get out of here now!
Somebody call 911, please!
Oh, my God.
You shot him!
It was an accident.
I didn't see him!
Well, do you think we should go back to see if he's okay?
Are you crazy?
The cops are gonna be here any minute.
The ambulance is on its way.
He's not saying anything, and there's so much blood.
Why?
Previously on Devious Maids...
[Shots]
If you leave now, we won't call the police.
[Grunts] I think they want our jewelry.
[Gasps]
That...
I can't take.
Too hot to handle.
This is for you, ma'am.
Wear it well.
Adrian is having a normal emotional reaction to a devastating experience.
You should consider hiring a bodyguard.
I'm Tony Bishara, and I look forward to protecting you and your husband.
I'm not coming back home.
Where do you plan on staying?
Hi, there.
I understand you're looking for a maid?
Hey.
You must be Zoila's daughter.
- You the new pool boy?
- I'm Ethan.
We will produce your album.
If I pretend to be your wife.
I'm going to propose tonight.
Will she still love you when she finds out what you did?
She better not.
Hey, there.
Hello, my darling.
Dahlia died 15 years ago.
I think Nicholas is ready to move on.
Did he mention that she committed suicide?
Ms. Falta, you are released in good faith.
- Hello, Mrs. Peri.
- I really thought you were deported.
Is Mr. Spence here?
I'd like to see him, too.
Well, you're in a good mood.
[Chuckles]
I have great news and amazing news.
Okay.
I'm all ears.
I'm pregnant.
[Laughs]
I don't understand.
Spence and I have been having sex every day.
I should be knocked up by now.
Well, I can start you on fertility drugs if you like, but what's the rush?
Let's just say it's better for my marriage if I'm pregnant.
Now...
Shoot me up with everything you got.
[Sighs]
[Door closes]
Hey!
Just had my first visit with the O.B.
Doc says I won't be showing for a while.
Lucky me.
What's wrong?
[Sighs]
I had an affair with Rosie.
It's not just a one-time thing.
I'm in love with her.
And I need to be with her.
I want a divorce.
We're having a baby, Spence.
[Sighs] Yeah, I know.
I know the timing is rotten, but the truth is, our marriage has been over for a long time, and we both deserve to be happy.
I just want to thank you.
You're doing me a huge favor.
You're helping me stay in America.
I should thank you.
[Car door closes]
And I will take wonderful care of your family.
Oh, well, mostly, you'll be taking care of my Uncle Ken.
He recently had a stroke, but I'm sure that his wife and daughter will need some help, as well.
Mm-hmm.
[Chuckles]
Good luck to you.
Aren't you going inside?
[Chuckling] Oh, no.
I'm not going in there.
Why not?
You'll see.
So, your husband doesn't talk?
Not since the stroke, and...
I'm his daughter.
I'm his wife.
Oh.
I married Kenny two years ago.
Should I call you Mrs. Miller?
[Chuckles] I'm just Didi.
But you can call her miss Miller.
She's never been married, and she's 40.
Call me Lucinda.
And you can also call her Ambrosia.
That was your name at the strip club, wasn't it...
Ambrosia?
So, Rosie, this is your little boy.
Does he speak English?
Almost.
He's learning new words every day.
Do you have kids?
Maybe once Ken gets better, but there's no rush.
I've got time.
I hope you do have a baby.
They'll never let her adopt with that arrest for drug possession.
What did the cops catch you with... ecstasy?
¿Mama, qué es ecstasy?
No, no, no.
You don't need to learn that word.
Could you show us to our room now?
Sure.
Follow me.
Hey, papito.
You know, Rosie,
Lucinda and I are not always like this.
[Chuckles] Okay.
Sometimes, we get nasty.
H-hey!
That's my breakfast.
No, that is a heart attack wrapped in a flour tortilla.
What did the doctor say about your cholesterol?
[Sighs]
You know I can't hear you when I'm looking at cheese.
[Groans]
Can you hear me now?
[Cellphone rings]
Hey, mija!
Is that Valentina?
Let me talk to her.
Hey, your mom's here.
You want to say hi?
Whatever.
Just find out where she is.
[Chuckling] Really?
You're working as a maid?
What?
!
Give me the phone.
So, you're a live-in?
That's good.
No!
That is not good!
She's supposed to be in design school!
What's that?
She says you know the people she's working for.
I do?
Evelyn and Adrian Powell?
No, no, no.
That's good.
That's good, mija.
What is going on?
Marisol asked me to help her clean out the closet.
Yeah, the rest of my stuff is being delivered tomorrow, so I'm gonna need more room.
But those are Dahlia's letters, her private things.
Look, I am being careful.
I am just moving this stuff into the garage.
That is not your decision to make.
If you want to rearrange things around here, you need permission.
From you?
From Nicholas.
It's his house, remember?
We're getting married.
I thought I had a say in where things go.
Well, you're not married yet.
[Indistinct conversations]
You should have seen it.
It was like...
Cut him in two.
Yeah.
[Chuckles]
Oh, hey, Carmen.
I want you to meet Dario.
Dario, this is Carmen.
His fiancée.
Really?
- It's a long story.
- I'd love to hear it.
Since I'm beautiful, I can't help but notice that neither of you is looking at me.
[Sighs] I'm sorry.
Um, Dario is an old friend.
We haven't seen each other in years.
And we were just catching up.
No.
What you're doing is flirting, and everyone at this party's starting to notice.
Maybe it's time to go.
Yeah, I think so.
[Chuckles]
Here's, uh, the keys to my car.
Don't wait up.
Hmm.
Anything else, Mrs. Powell?
No.
Tanya and I will call once we've finished shopping.
Well, kudos on the new bodyguard.
He is positively scrumptious.
Is he?
I hadn't noticed.
And my breasts are real, and I love my stepchildren. [Chuckles]
Are we done lying to each other now?
I admit Tony's handsome, but it's not like anything's going to happen.
Not all of us like to seduce the help.
Oh, pbht!
I shower with my plumber one time...
[Chuckles]
Evelyn, what's wrong?
Ow.
Where did you get that?
It was a gift.
Let me see it.
No!
That's my blood Ruby pendant.
No, it's mine!
No!
Evelyn, what are you doing?
- Leave me alone!
- She stole my necklace.
[Screaming]
What's going on?
They're just having a... minor disagreement.
Give it back, you bitch!
Hey.
You're hurting me!
Hey, hey.
Hey.
[Gasps]
She's getting away!
For the love of God, someone shoot her!
Alejandro.
It's 6:00 in the morning!
Can we discuss this later, please?
I am exhausted.
Well, I'm your fiancée.
You should have called.
You know, from now on, if you want to have sex with hot guys, you do it here, home, okay, so I don't worry.
Dario and I didn't have sex.
Don't tell that to the other gays.
They'll kick you out of the union.
We hadn't seen each other in 10 years.
We had some serious catching up to do.
So... is he an ex?
He was the one that got away.
When he moved to Europe, he begged me to come with him, but I couldn't because of my career.
Of course, because your career is very important.
But seeing him last night made me rethink a lot of my choices.
He said he still loves me, and he asked me to move to Spain with him.
And this time, I'm considering it.
Uh, but... but wh...
What about us?
We have the engagement party Friday.
Yeah.
I'm thinking we should wait on that.
Wait?
We're getting married in six weeks.
Maybe not.
I don't know.
Look, I need to get some rest 'cause I'm seeing Dario again tonight, and this time, we won't be talking.
[Exhales sharply]
[Mixer whirring]
Hey.
Are you baking a cake?
[Chuckles] I'm trying to.
It's daddy's birthday tomorrow.
Mm.
You're such a good daughter.
Well, I like to think so.
Have you always lived with your father?
Oh, lord, no.
After I got my master's, I lived in New York.
I was a sculptor.
Really?
I was starting to make a name for myself, but then mama died.
And daddy was so devastated,
I had to come back and take care of him.
It was really nice.
Then, one night, he goes out drinking, and he comes back with that cheap piece of Hollywood trash.
You mean Mrs. Didi?
He let that slut crawl into my mama's bed.
I will never forgive him for that.
[Spatula clatters]
Are you okay?
I really shouldn't talk about this.
It makes me want to spit.
Maybe I should finish the cake.
Good idea.
Miss Lucinda?
I'm sure Mrs. Didi loves your father.
Rosie, do me a favor.
Don't ever say anything nice about that woman.
Okay, but, uh, I just don't want to take sides.
Taking sides is part of this job, and I'm just happy to know you'll be on mine.
Hey, pool boy!
What are you doing?
If you must know, I'm looking for a bathroom.
But you're tracking in mud.
Well, that's something to remember me by.
[Chuckles]
[Doorbell rings]
[Mop clatters]
I don't want to talk to you.
Good.
I don't want to talk to you, either.
Where's your room?
Upstairs.
Why?
Mom!
What are you doing?
Mom.
That's a closet.
[Door closes]
I'm here to pack up all your stuff and take you home.
I don't want you working for the Powells.
Why not?
Because you're only 19, and they're dangerous.
That's the gift-wrapping room.
Damn, this house is big.
Look, I don't care what you think of the Powells.
They have been nothing but nice to me.
Yeah, well, the Powells are not the only reason
I want you out of here.
You should be in school making something of your life.
I can't afford school right now.
Your father and I will take care of it.
I can do it on my own.
I just need a little time.
Girls like you think you have all the time in the world, but the years fly by and then one day, you wake up and you realize it's too late to make your dreams come true.
And then, you spend the rest of your life cleaning somebody else's oven.
You're doing it again.
You're trying to control me.
Can't you get a different job...
- Something in a mall?
- No!
I work for the Powells, and that's all there is to it.
Now, please, go back to your life, and let me have mine.
Okay, guys,
I'm gonna want everything in the master bedroom.
Everything?
I mean, there's over 50 boxes in the truck.
Oh, I know.
What's all this?
The rest of my boxes arrived today.
Y-yeah, I...
I can see that.
I was gonna store some of this stuff in the hallway closet.
Oh, yeah?
Well, why didn't you?
[Sighs]
Because it's already filled...
With Dahlia's things.
Oh.
So, this little display, it's your way of asking me to move them?
I guess it was a little passive-aggressive.
Tell me, what part of this is passive?
[Chuckles]
All right, first thing tomorrow,
I'll have Ethan move Dahlia's things to the garage.
[Sighs] Thank you.
I didn't think you'd mind, but Opal said that I needed your permission.
You know, on second thought,
I don't want Dahlia's things in the garage.
Call goodwill tomorrow.
Have them take everything away.
Are you sure?
Dahlia's gone.
But you are here to stay.
[Sighs] Oh, Nick.
Mm.
[Door closes]
Hello, there.
Rosie.
You scared me.
[Chuckles]
What are you doing up?
I wanted to fix Mr. Ken's robe before he got up in the morning.
Oh. [Chuckles] Well...
That's a pretty dress.
I know how it looks, me hitting the clubs while Kenny's stuck in that chair, but every once in a while, I need to have a good time.
It must be hard on you, having a sick husband.
It is.
When I first met Kenny, I didn't think he was that old.
I just thought he was adorable.
And funny.
And he dressed better than any man I'd ever met...
Custom-made shirts, Italian shoes.
[Chuckles]
We had two wonderful years.
Then, one day, I found him lying on the floor.
So, what has Lucinda told you about me?
Did she call me a gold digger and a slut and a moron?
She never said moron.
[Chuckles]
Well, don't you believe a word she says.
I love Kenny.
She's just jealous 'cause that big old ass of hers has been on the market for years and no one's buying.
Mrs. Didi.
How could you live with someone you hate?
I just try to remind myself when Kenny dies, all this belongs to me.
And you should keep that in mind, too.
[Indistinct conversations]
Mrs. Powell,
I really have to advise against this.
The man at the soup kitchen said he's seen that homeless woman around here.
If any of the other bums recognize her,
I could have my necklace back by tonight.
Well, at least let's stick together while we hand these sketches out.
Oh, that'll take hours.
Relax.
Adrian and I will be fine.
[Sighs]
[Car door closes]
Now...
You try that alley, and, uh, we'll search over there.
[Sighs]
Adrian?
Darling, what's wrong?
We shouldn't have come here.
- But you agreed to this.
- At home, in the living room.
Now that we're here, it's so dark.
This adolescent cowardice of yours is really getting on my nerves.
- Get out of the car.
- No!
Adrian!
Hey, little mama.
Oh!
[Chuckling] Hello, there.
You startled me.
Oh, well, that's all right.
Perhaps you can help me.
I'm looking for a woman.
So am I.
I don't mean to s-sound rude, but... you are terrifying.
Could you stay there?
I'm warning you, my husband is in this car, and he will defend me to the death.
Isn't that right, dear?
Adrian!
Adrian, open this door!
Don't just sit there.
Do something!
Leave her alone!
Oh, my...
Not one more step!
You got pretty hair.
[Gasps]
[Panting]
Are you hurt?
No.
I'm just angry.
[Sighs]
Hey, can I talk to you about something?
Oh, God.
Are you going to ask me out?
[Chuckling] No, but thank you for the enthusiasm.
What, then?
You know those egg thingies upstairs?
Your mom sort of took one.
What?
Yeah, I was coming out of the bathroom, and I saw her put it in her purse.
[Scoffs] That's ridiculous.
My mother doesn't steal.
Well, does she borrow?
No.
Why would mother want an egg thingy?
I don't know why anyone would want half of the crap in this house, but if Mrs. Powell finds that it's missing, she might think that...
You stole it.
And then she'd fire me.
And just so you know, I'm gonna ask you out next week, so try to act [Chuckling] surprised.
What are you doing with that?
Good morning to you, too, Opal.
That belongs to Dahlia.
I told you not to touch her things.
No, you said I needed permission to move her things, so I spoke to Nicholas last night.
And what did he say?
It's a bit of a surprise, actually.
I just wanted to put Dahlia's things in the garage, but he said to get rid of them entirely.
What?
The folks at goodwill sent a truck.
I guess this got left behind.
[Gasps]
No!
[Gasps]
[Sobs]
Look, Opal...
- You had no right!
- Oh, for God's sake...
Those were not your things, and this is not your house!
And then she screams, "this isn't your house!"
- She didn't!
- Yeah.
[Scoffs]
I am seriously thinking about asking Nick to fire her.
Eh.
What?
How long has she been working for Nicholas?
About 20 years.
And how long have you been living there?
I see where you're going with this, but I'm not some houseguest.
I'm the future Mrs. Deering, and if I politely ask a maid to clean out a closet,
I think she should do it.
Eh.
God, that is annoying.
Look, when you work in a house for 20 years, you start to think of it as your own.
Like this place...
My name may not be on the deed, but...
It's my home.
I get that.
But Opal freaked out on me, and now I have to walk on eggshells in my own home?
In that case, you should fire her.
Thank you.
If she's leaving eggshells on the floor...
A maid can be bitchy, but she's still got to clean up.
Anyway, I think you should go back to Opal and apologize.
Seriously?
!
It's a chance to clear the air, and if she doesn't start to behave, then talk to Nicholas.
I hope you're right.
I don't want to be one of these Beverly Hills divas that's always complaining about her maid.
It's already happened, hasn't it?
Mm... mm...
[Papers thud] You never read the contract?
It's my first phony marriage!
Now, give me a break.
Just tell me, my album, my tour...
I still get all that, right, even if we're just engaged?
Hold on.
I'm reading.
How could Alejandro do this to me?
You know, promises were made, hearts were crossed.
I thought we really meant something to each other.
Why?
It's a fake relationship.
And we were gonna live a long fake life together, okay?
Mm.
Oh!
Here it is.
"The terms of this contract will not be binding
"until such time as the undersigned and the artist are legally joined."
So, what does that mean?
It means if you don't get married, you get bubkes.
No, no, no!
I'm sorry.
Why can't he just marry me and have gay sex on the weekends like every other husband in Hollywood?
Look, I know you got a lot riding on this, but it's time to start facing reality.
No.
I am Carmen luna, and I never face reality.
I just talked to my lawyer.
I told him I don't want alimony or the house, so there's no reason this thing has to get ugly.
[Tucker babbling]
And I'm sorry I hurt you.
I didn't mean to fall in love with Rosie.
[Toy clacking]
I'm a star.
Men don't leave stars for maids.
Well, this one's going to, but I won't tell anyone why.
We'll just let people believe we're another Hollywood casualty.
If you continue seeing Rosie, trust me...
You'll be the casualty.
What exactly do you think that you can do to me?
I'm America's sweetheart, remember?
My tear-stained face will be on the cover of every tabloid.
I'll tell anyone who will listen my husband seduced the maid while our baby was asleep in the next room.
Once I'm done, you'll be the most hated man in show business.
Your career as daytime TV's nicest doctor will be over.
I don't care about that.
Do you care about our son?
Because I also plan on moving to Europe and taking Tucker with me.
I will not allow that.
I will fight you in court.
And you'll lose.
You're the scum shacking up with the maid, remember?
A judge won't let you go to Europe, not when you're about to give birth to our brand-new baby.
[Chuckles]
Joke's on you.
I'm not pregnant.
That was just a maneuver designed to save our marriage.
Oh, well.
[Tucker babbles]
You're a monster.
And yet I seem so nice in my films.
[Grunts]
To recap, if you see Rosie again, even one more time,
I will destroy you.
Got it...
[As Rosie] Mr. Spence?
Opal, I was hoping we could talk.
Did you know I'm writing a book?
It's about what I went through to get my son out of jail.
I had to work as a maid for six months, so you'd think I would remember to respect the people who do this job.
You've taken such beautiful care of Dahlia's things for all these years
I should have spoken to you before I gave them away.
I'm sorry.
I was 19 when I met Dahlia.
I was single, pregnant...
And terrified.
She offered to take me in and give me a job.
She was more than an employer.
She was my friend.
It's been 15 years since she died, and I...
I still grieve for her.
I am so sorry.
[Sniffles]
[Voice breaking] No.
I should apologize to you.
The way I've been behaving, it's... unacceptable.
So... maybe we can start over.
I would like that.
[Sighs]
Well, well, well.
You are a difficult woman to find.
Do I know you?
No.
But I know you.
You're a thief.
Somebody gave this to me.
Well, now you're going to give it to me...
Whether you like it or not.
Mr. Kenneth, I fixed your robe.
Now we can get you ready for your birthday dinner.
I love birthdays.
My favorite part is the presents.
I wish I knew you better so I could give you something you'd like.
You know what, Mr. Kenneth?
I think I know what you'd like for your birthday.
[Indistinct conversation]
Of getting to the bottom of this...
What in the world?
Uncle Ken?
[Chuckles] Look at you!
Rosie, did you do this?
I thought Mr. Kenneth would like to dress up for a change.
That was very thoughtful.
Yeah!
[Voice breaking] I can't remember the last time Kenny looked this nice.
Are you done performing?
Excuse me?
!
Reggie is the executor of daddy's estate.
Every time he stops by,
Didi turns on the waterworks to impress him.
You are such a liar.
You could put daddy in a suit any time you want!
And when was the last time you did something nice for him?
I gave up my whole life for him.
Now who's performing?
Okay, ladies, please...
Rosie, go ahead and serve dinner.
No.
I want to do presents first.
Rosie, do as I say.
Rosie, this is my house.
She's just an elderly guest.
No one asked you, Ambrosia.
You work for me, remember?
No, she works for me.
You know, I'm sick of this.
Just go to hell!
Back off, bitch!
[Panting]
[Sighs]
I think that means I work for him.
[Cellphone rings]
[Cellphone beeps] Hey, mija, what's up?
Whoa, whoa.
Ho... ho... hold on.
Slow down!
Your mother did what?
What the hell were you thinking?
!
I wanted her out of that house.
That's your excuse for stealing?
Do you want your daughter to be a maid, to watch while she throws her life away?
It's her life to throw!
I know what I'm talking about.
I had a chance to go to college.
I thought that scholarship would always be there...
Yeah, I know... your life didn't turn out the way you wanted.
How does that justify trying to get your own daughter fired?
!
All right!
I'm sorry!
It just happened!
I don't know what I was thinking.
I do.
You were thinking you could control everything under the sun...
The world according to Zoila...
Pablo.
Always making us jump through your hoops.
Valentina and I have been doing it for years, and we're sick of it!
I mean, we love you, but, God, you make us so unhappy!
You're unhappy?
Since when?
Since as long as I can remember.
Oh.
[Sighs]
I'm taking this back to Valentina.
[Knock on door]
Mrs. Powell?
I believe this belongs to you.
Tony!
[Gasps]
How in the world...?
[Gasps] I have my ways.
Oh [Chuckles]
Here.
Allow me.
[Sighs]
When those men broke into our home, they stole so much more than this necklace.
They took our dignity, our sense of security...
Now I feel like I've gotten some of those things back.
I'm glad.
Oh, how can I ever repay you?
Seeing you smile is payment enough.
"ET" has just learned that longtime couple Spence and Peri Westmore are calling it quits.
Although the couple issued a statement saying the divorce will be amicable, rumors are swirling that the hunky soap star may have cheated on America's sweetheart.
And, of course, we'll always keep you updated for the latest on this story.
[Doorbell rings]
Rosie, what are you doing here?
I saw the TV.
They were talking about you and Mrs. Peri.
Look, I can't talk right now.
I just wanted to see if you were okay.
Not really.
Do you want to go to breakfast tomorrow, tell me what happened?
No, I don't.
As a matter of fact, uh, I can't see you again.
Why?
My family is breaking up because of you.
I'm very upset.
You have to stay away.
I'm sorry.
You know, my meetings are only during the days.
You sure you don't want to come with me?
San Francisco sounds fun, but I have a lot of writing to do.
Okay.
I guess I'm just worried about you being all alone in the house with Opal.
Well, I told you, we're good now.
By the time you get back, we're gonna be besties.
Oh, now I'm definitely worried.
[Both chuckle]
See you in a week.
Okay.
[Sighs]
_
_

[Speaking indistinctly]
Alejandro!
Where's your tie?
Well, isn't this a casual thing?
No!
No. [Chuckles]
This is our engagement party.
We have to look nice.
Ah, geez.
[Sighs]
I should have called the whole thing off.
What... you know, the more I think about Dario...
- You seem tense...
- The more that I'm...
While you get a tie...
I'm thinking black...
I'll get you a beverage.
Okay.
So, that's Alejandro, huh?
Keep his glass full, make every drink a double, and if he orders water, put vodka in it.
Why do you need him drunk?
You're paid to pour, not to ask questions.
When I give the cue, this is what I need you to say.
Here.
I'll give you an extra $50 if you stop judging me.
Oh!
You got the white flowers.
Perfect.
Carmen.
Why did you give the bartender money?
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.
Why do you always think I'm up to something?
[Door opens]
Father Tomas!
I'm so glad you could come.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
What's with the suitcase?
You might want to sit down.
I need some space.
I found a little apartment.
Not too expensive.
So, you're leaving me?
I'm taking a break.
A break?
Zoila, if I stay in this house, the way I'm feeling about you, we're not gonna make it.
Oh.
So, I just need to [Sighs] take a few months.
Trust me.
It's gonna be good for both of us.
I'll give you a call when I get settled, okay?
[Voice breaking] And I promise to eat healthy.
[Door closes]
[Upbeat music playing, indistinct conversations]
Hey.
How are you feeling?
Pretty hammered.
What the hell's in these drinks?
Who cares?
It's time to make our toast.
Mm.
Okay.
[Music stops] Hello, everyone!
Hey!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
[Exhales sharply]
Alejandro and I are so happy to have you with us on this special night.
I wish you could all feel the passion we have for each other.
Aww!
I don't feel so good.
Neither do I. [Chuckles]
Waiting and waiting for the big day.
Are you as excited about the wedding as we are?
[Cheers and applause]
But I guess we have to wait a few more weeks.
- Aw!
Aw!
- Aw!
Aw!
What else can we do?
Why don't you get married now?
- Yeah!
Yeah!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Get married now?
[Chuckling] That's crazy!
I mean, we don't have anyone here to marry us, right?
I could do it.
Oh, my God!
Father Tomas?
Who invited you?
[Chuckles] Oh, dear God.
Wedding!
Wedding!
[Chanting] Wedding!
Wedding!
Wedding!
Wedding!
Aah!
[Cheers and applause]
What the hell's going on?
[Crowd murmuring]
We're giving the people what they want.
[Crowd cheers]
Carmen, we need to talk about this.
Yeah, we'll talk on the honeymoon.
We need to talk now.
Take five, padre.
Nobody leave!
[Chuckles]
Let's do this.
Listen.
Listen.
We have to get married!
Why?
Because if we don't...
I get nothing.
What are you talking about?
Read the contract, Alejandro!
You know, my album, my tour...
If you run off with Dario, it... it all goes away.
[Sighing] Oh...
Baby, I won't let that happen.
You won't?
I should have been clearer.
I will personally see to it that my label honors our deal...
Oh, my God.
Not just because you're an amazing friend, but because I believe in your talent.
You're a star waiting to happen, Ms. Carmen Luna.
[Inhales sharply]
You are the best husband I never married.
[Chuckles] Thank you.
Thank you.
[Guests screaming]
[Indistinct shouting]
Shut up!
Get down on the ground!
Get down!
[Shouting continues]
I'm not screwing around, people!
[Grunts]
[Screams]
What did you do?
!
Let's go.
Let's go.
Get out of here now!
[Panting]
Oh.
[Voice breaking] Somebody call 911, please!
Oh, my God.
You shot him!
It was an accident.
I didn't see him!
Well, do you think we should go back to see if he's okay?
Are you crazy?
The cops are gonna be here any minute.
[Engine turns over]
The ambulance is on its way.
[Sobbing] He's not saying anything, and there's so much blood.
[Sobs]
Why?
[Sobbing loudly]
Previously on Devious Maids...
[Shots]
If you leave now, we won't call the police.
[Grunts] I think they want our jewelry.
[Gasps]
That...
I can't take.
Too hot to handle.
This is for you, ma'am.
Wear it well.
Adrian is having a normal emotional reaction to a devastating experience.
You should consider hiring a bodyguard.
I'm Tony Bishara, and I look forward to protecting you and your husband.
I'm not coming back home.
Where do you plan on staying?
Hi, there.
I understand you're looking for a maid?
Hey.
You must be Zoila's daughter.
- You the new pool boy?
- I'm Ethan.
We will produce your album.
If I pretend to be your wife.
I'm going to propose tonight.
Will she still love you when she finds out what you did?
She better not.
Hey, there.
Hello, my darling.
Dahlia died 15 years ago.
I think Nicholas is ready to move on.
Did he mention that she committed suicide?
Ms. Falta, you are released in good faith.
- Hello, Mrs. Peri.
- I really thought you were deported.
Is Mr. Spence here?
I'd like to see him, too.
Well, you're in a good mood.
[Chuckles]
I have great news and amazing news.
Okay.
I'm all ears.
I'm pregnant.
[Laughs]
I don't understand.
Spence and I have been having sex every day.
I should be knocked up by now.
Well, I can start you on fertility drugs if you like, but what's the rush?
Let's just say it's better for my marriage if I'm pregnant.
Now...
Shoot me up with everything you got.
[Sighs]
[Door closes]
Hey!
Just had my first visit with the O.B.
Doc says I won't be showing for a while.
Lucky me.
What's wrong?
[Sighs]
I had an affair with Rosie.
It's not just a one-time thing.
I'm in love with her.
And I need to be with her.
I want a divorce.
We're having a baby, Spence.
[Sighs] Yeah, I know.
I know the timing is rotten, but the truth is, our marriage has been over for a long time, and we both deserve to be happy.
I just want to thank you.
You're doing me a huge favor.
You're helping me stay in America.
I should thank you.
[Car door closes]
And I will take wonderful care of your family.
Oh, well, mostly, you'll be taking care of my Uncle Ken.
He recently had a stroke, but I'm sure that his wife and daughter will need some help, as well.
Mm-hmm.
[Chuckles]
Good luck to you.
Aren't you going inside?
[Chuckling] Oh, no.
I'm not going in there.
Why not?
You'll see.
So, your husband doesn't talk?
Not since the stroke, and...
I'm his daughter.
I'm his wife.
Oh.
I married Kenny two years ago.
Should I call you Mrs. Miller?
[Chuckles] I'm just Didi.
But you can call her miss Miller.
She's never been married, and she's 40.
Call me Lucinda.
And you can also call her Ambrosia.
That was your name at the strip club, wasn't it...
Ambrosia?
So, Rosie, this is your little boy.
Does he speak English?
Almost.
He's learning new words every day.
Do you have kids?
Maybe once Ken gets better, but there's no rush.
I've got time.
I hope you do have a baby.
They'll never let her adopt with that arrest for drug possession.
What did the cops catch you with... ecstasy?
¿Mama, qué es ecstasy?
No, no, no.
You don't need to learn that word.
Could you show us to our room now?
Sure.
Follow me.
Hey, papito.
You know, Rosie,
Lucinda and I are not always like this.
[Chuckles] Okay.
Sometimes, we get nasty.
H-hey!
That's my breakfast.
No, that is a heart attack wrapped in a flour tortilla.
What did the doctor say about your cholesterol?
[Sighs]
You know I can't hear you when I'm looking at cheese.
[Groans]
Can you hear me now?
[Cellphone rings]
Hey, mija!
Is that Valentina?
Let me talk to her.
Hey, your mom's here.
You want to say hi?
Whatever.
Just find out where she is.
[Chuckling] Really?
You're working as a maid?
What?
!
Give me the phone.
So, you're a live-in?
That's good.
No!
That is not good!
She's supposed to be in design school!
What's that?
She says you know the people she's working for.
I do?
Evelyn and Adrian Powell?
No, no, no.
That's good.
That's good, mija.
What is going on?
Marisol asked me to help her clean out the closet.
Yeah, the rest of my stuff is being delivered tomorrow, so I'm gonna need more room.
But those are Dahlia's letters, her private things.
Look, I am being careful.
I am just moving this stuff into the garage.
That is not your decision to make.
If you want to rearrange things around here, you need permission.
From you?
From Nicholas.
It's his house, remember?
We're getting married.
I thought I had a say in where things go.
Well, you're not married yet.
[Indistinct conversations]
You should have seen it.
It was like...
Cut him in two.
Yeah.
[Chuckles]
Oh, hey, Carmen.
I want you to meet Dario.
Dario, this is Carmen.
His fiancée.
Really?
- It's a long story.
- I'd love to hear it.
Since I'm beautiful, I can't help but notice that neither of you is looking at me.
[Sighs] I'm sorry.
Um, Dario is an old friend.
We haven't seen each other in years.
And we were just catching up.
No.
What you're doing is flirting, and everyone at this party's starting to notice.
Maybe it's time to go.
Yeah, I think so.
[Chuckles]
Here's, uh, the keys to my car.
Don't wait up.
Hmm.
Anything else, Mrs. Powell?
No.
Tanya and I will call once we've finished shopping.
Well, kudos on the new bodyguard.
He is positively scrumptious.
Is he?
I hadn't noticed.
And my breasts are real, and I love my stepchildren. [Chuckles]
Are we done lying to each other now?
I admit Tony's handsome, but it's not like anything's going to happen.
Not all of us like to seduce the help.
Oh, pbht!
I shower with my plumber one time...
[Chuckles]
Evelyn, what's wrong?
Ow.
Where did you get that?
It was a gift.
Let me see it.
No!
That's my blood Ruby pendant.
No, it's mine!
No!
Evelyn, what are you doing?
- Leave me alone!
- She stole my necklace.
[Screaming]
What's going on?
They're just having a... minor disagreement.
Give it back, you bitch!
Hey.
You're hurting me!
Hey, hey.
Hey.
[Gasps]
She's getting away!
For the love of God, someone shoot her!
Alejandro.
It's 6:00 in the morning!
Can we discuss this later, please?
I am exhausted.
Well, I'm your fiancée.
You should have called.
You know, from now on, if you want to have sex with hot guys, you do it here, home, okay, so I don't worry.
Dario and I didn't have sex.
Don't tell that to the other gays.
They'll kick you out of the union.
We hadn't seen each other in 10 years.
We had some serious catching up to do.
So... is he an ex?
He was the one that got away.
When he moved to Europe, he begged me to come with him, but I couldn't because of my career.
Of course, because your career is very important.
But seeing him last night made me rethink a lot of my choices.
He said he still loves me, and he asked me to move to Spain with him.
And this time, I'm considering it.
Uh, but... but wh...
What about us?
We have the engagement party Friday.
Yeah.
I'm thinking we should wait on that.
Wait?
We're getting married in six weeks.
Maybe not.
I don't know.
Look, I need to get some rest 'cause I'm seeing Dario again tonight, and this time, we won't be talking.
[Exhales sharply]
[Mixer whirring]
Hey.
Are you baking a cake?
[Chuckles] I'm trying to.
It's daddy's birthday tomorrow.
Mm.
You're such a good daughter.
Well, I like to think so.
Have you always lived with your father?
Oh, lord, no.
After I got my master's, I lived in New York.
I was a sculptor.
Really?
I was starting to make a name for myself, but then mama died.
And daddy was so devastated,
I had to come back and take care of him.
It was really nice.
Then, one night, he goes out drinking, and he comes back with that cheap piece of Hollywood trash.
You mean Mrs. Didi?
He let that slut crawl into my mama's bed.
I will never forgive him for that.
[Spatula clatters]
Are you okay?
I really shouldn't talk about this.
It makes me want to spit.
Maybe I should finish the cake.
Good idea.
Miss Lucinda?
I'm sure Mrs. Didi loves your father.
Rosie, do me a favor.
Don't ever say anything nice about that woman.
Okay, but, uh, I just don't want to take sides.
Taking sides is part of this job, and I'm just happy to know you'll be on mine.
Hey, pool boy!
What are you doing?
If you must know, I'm looking for a bathroom.
But you're tracking in mud.
Well, that's something to remember me by.
[Chuckles]
[Doorbell rings]
[Mop clatters]
I don't want to talk to you.
Good.
I don't want to talk to you, either.
Where's your room?
Upstairs.
Why?
Mom!
What are you doing?
Mom.
That's a closet.
[Door closes]
I'm here to pack up all your stuff and take you home.
I don't want you working for the Powells.
Why not?
Because you're only 19, and they're dangerous.
That's the gift-wrapping room.
Damn, this house is big.
Look, I don't care what you think of the Powells.
They have been nothing but nice to me.
Yeah, well, the Powells are not the only reason
I want you out of here.
You should be in school making something of your life.
I can't afford school right now.
Your father and I will take care of it.
I can do it on my own.
I just need a little time.
Girls like you think you have all the time in the world, but the years fly by and then one day, you wake up and you realize it's too late to make your dreams come true.
And then, you spend the rest of your life cleaning somebody else's oven.
You're doing it again.
You're trying to control me.
Can't you get a different job...
- Something in a mall?
- No!
I work for the Powells, and that's all there is to it.
Now, please, go back to your life, and let me have mine.
Okay, guys,
I'm gonna want everything in the master bedroom.
Everything?
I mean, there's over 50 boxes in the truck.
Oh, I know.
What's all this?
The rest of my boxes arrived today.
Y-yeah, I...
I can see that.
I was gonna store some of this stuff in the hallway closet.
Oh, yeah?
Well, why didn't you?
[Sighs]
Because it's already filled...
With Dahlia's things.
Oh.
So, this little display, it's your way of asking me to move them?
I guess it was a little passive-aggressive.
Tell me, what part of this is passive?
[Chuckles]
All right, first thing tomorrow,
I'll have Ethan move Dahlia's things to the garage.
[Sighs] Thank you.
I didn't think you'd mind, but Opal said that I needed your permission.
You know, on second thought,
I don't want Dahlia's things in the garage.
Call goodwill tomorrow.
Have them take everything away.
Are you sure?
Dahlia's gone.
But you are here to stay.
[Sighs] Oh, Nick.
Mm.
[Door closes]
Hello, there.
Rosie.
You scared me.
[Chuckles]
What are you doing up?
I wanted to fix Mr. Ken's robe before he got up in the morning.
Oh. [Chuckles] Well...
That's a pretty dress.
I know how it looks, me hitting the clubs while Kenny's stuck in that chair, but every once in a while, I need to have a good time.
It must be hard on you, having a sick husband.
It is.
When I first met Kenny, I didn't think he was that old.
I just thought he was adorable.
And funny.
And he dressed better than any man I'd ever met...
Custom-made shirts, Italian shoes.
[Chuckles]
We had two wonderful years.
Then, one day, I found him lying on the floor.
So, what has Lucinda told you about me?
Did she call me a gold digger and a slut and a moron?
She never said moron.
[Chuckles]
Well, don't you believe a word she says.
I love Kenny.
She's just jealous 'cause that big old ass of hers has been on the market for years and no one's buying.
Mrs. Didi.
How could you live with someone you hate?
I just try to remind myself when Kenny dies, all this belongs to me.
And you should keep that in mind, too.
[Indistinct conversations]
Mrs. Powell,
I really have to advise against this.
The man at the soup kitchen said he's seen that homeless woman around here.
If any of the other bums recognize her,
I could have my necklace back by tonight.
Well, at least let's stick together while we hand these sketches out.
Oh, that'll take hours.
Relax.
Adrian and I will be fine.
[Sighs]
[Car door closes]
Now...
You try that alley, and, uh, we'll search over there.
[Sighs]
Adrian?
Darling, what's wrong?
We shouldn't have come here.
- But you agreed to this.
- At home, in the living room.
Now that we're here, it's so dark.
This adolescent cowardice of yours is really getting on my nerves.
- Get out of the car.
- No!
Adrian!
Hey, little mama.
Oh!
[Chuckling] Hello, there.
You startled me.
Oh, well, that's all right.
Perhaps you can help me.
I'm looking for a woman.
So am I.
I don't mean to s-sound rude, but... you are terrifying.
Could you stay there?
I'm warning you, my husband is in this car, and he will defend me to the death.
Isn't that right, dear?
Adrian!
Adrian, open this door!
Don't just sit there.
Do something!
Leave her alone!
Oh, my...
Not one more step!
You got pretty hair.
[Gasps]
[Panting]
Are you hurt?
No.
I'm just angry.
[Sighs]
Hey, can I talk to you about something?
Oh, God.
Are you going to ask me out?
[Chuckling] No, but thank you for the enthusiasm.
What, then?
You know those egg thingies upstairs?
Your mom sort of took one.
What?
Yeah, I was coming out of the bathroom, and I saw her put it in her purse.
[Scoffs] That's ridiculous.
My mother doesn't steal.
Well, does she borrow?
No.
Why would mother want an egg thingy?
I don't know why anyone would want half of the crap in this house, but if Mrs. Powell finds that it's missing, she might think that...
You stole it.
And then she'd fire me.
And just so you know, I'm gonna ask you out next week, so try to act [Chuckling] surprised.
What are you doing with that?
Good morning to you, too, Opal.
That belongs to Dahlia.
I told you not to touch her things.
No, you said I needed permission to move her things, so I spoke to Nicholas last night.
And what did he say?
It's a bit of a surprise, actually.
I just wanted to put Dahlia's things in the garage, but he said to get rid of them entirely.
What?
The folks at goodwill sent a truck.
I guess this got left behind.
[Gasps]
No!
[Gasps]
[Sobs]
Look, Opal...
- You had no right!
- Oh, for God's sake...
Those were not your things, and this is not your house!
And then she screams, "this isn't your house!"
- She didn't!
- Yeah.
[Scoffs]
I am seriously thinking about asking Nick to fire her.
Eh.
What?
How long has she been working for Nicholas?
About 20 years.
And how long have you been living there?
I see where you're going with this, but I'm not some houseguest.
I'm the future Mrs. Deering, and if I politely ask a maid to clean out a closet,
I think she should do it.
Eh.
God, that is annoying.
Look, when you work in a house for 20 years, you start to think of it as your own.
Like this place...
My name may not be on the deed, but...
It's my home.
I get that.
But Opal freaked out on me, and now I have to walk on eggshells in my own home?
In that case, you should fire her.
Thank you.
If she's leaving eggshells on the floor...
A maid can be bitchy, but she's still got to clean up.
Anyway, I think you should go back to Opal and apologize.
Seriously?
!
It's a chance to clear the air, and if she doesn't start to behave, then talk to Nicholas.
I hope you're right.
I don't want to be one of these Beverly Hills divas that's always complaining about her maid.
It's already happened, hasn't it?
Mm... mm...
[Papers thud] You never read the contract?
It's my first phony marriage!
Now, give me a break.
Just tell me, my album, my tour...
I still get all that, right, even if we're just engaged?
Hold on.
I'm reading.
How could Alejandro do this to me?
You know, promises were made, hearts were crossed.
I thought we really meant something to each other.
Why?
It's a fake relationship.
And we were gonna live a long fake life together, okay?
Mm.
Oh!
Here it is.
"The terms of this contract will not be binding
"until such time as the undersigned and the artist are legally joined."
So, what does that mean?
It means if you don't get married, you get bubkes.
No, no, no!
I'm sorry.
Why can't he just marry me and have gay sex on the weekends like every other husband in Hollywood?
Look, I know you got a lot riding on this, but it's time to start facing reality.
No.
I am Carmen luna, and I never face reality.
I just talked to my lawyer.
I told him I don't want alimony or the house, so there's no reason this thing has to get ugly.
[Tucker babbling]
And I'm sorry I hurt you.
I didn't mean to fall in love with Rosie.
[Toy clacking]
I'm a star.
Men don't leave stars for maids.
Well, this one's going to, but I won't tell anyone why.
We'll just let people believe we're another Hollywood casualty.
If you continue seeing Rosie, trust me...
You'll be the casualty.
What exactly do you think that you can do to me?
I'm America's sweetheart, remember?
My tear-stained face will be on the cover of every tabloid.
I'll tell anyone who will listen my husband seduced the maid while our baby was asleep in the next room.
Once I'm done, you'll be the most hated man in show business.
Your career as daytime TV's nicest doctor will be over.
I don't care about that.
Do you care about our son?
Because I also plan on moving to Europe and taking Tucker with me.
I will not allow that.
I will fight you in court.
And you'll lose.
You're the scum shacking up with the maid, remember?
A judge won't let you go to Europe, not when you're about to give birth to our brand-new baby.
[Chuckles]
Joke's on you.
I'm not pregnant.
That was just a maneuver designed to save our marriage.
Oh, well.
[Tucker babbles]
You're a monster.
And yet I seem so nice in my films.
[Grunts]
To recap, if you see Rosie again, even one more time,
I will destroy you.
Got it...
[As Rosie] Mr. Spence?
Opal, I was hoping we could talk.
Did you know I'm writing a book?
It's about what I went through to get my son out of jail.
I had to work as a maid for six months, so you'd think I would remember to respect the people who do this job.
You've taken such beautiful care of Dahlia's things for all these years
I should have spoken to you before I gave them away.
I'm sorry.
I was 19 when I met Dahlia.
I was single, pregnant...
And terrified.
She offered to take me in and give me a job.
She was more than an employer.
She was my friend.
It's been 15 years since she died, and I...
I still grieve for her.
I am so sorry.
[Sniffles]
[Voice breaking] No.
I should apologize to you.
The way I've been behaving, it's... unacceptable.
So... maybe we can start over.
I would like that.
[Sighs]
Well, well, well.
You are a difficult woman to find.
Do I know you?
No.
But I know you.
You're a thief.
Somebody gave this to me.
Well, now you're going to give it to me...
Whether you like it or not.
Mr. Kenneth, I fixed your robe.
Now we can get you ready for your birthday dinner.
I love birthdays.
My favorite part is the presents.
I wish I knew you better so I could give you something you'd like.
You know what, Mr. Kenneth?
I think I know what you'd like for your birthday.
[Indistinct conversation]
Of getting to the bottom of this...
What in the world?
Uncle Ken?
[Chuckles] Look at you!
Rosie, did you do this?
I thought Mr. Kenneth would like to dress up for a change.
That was very thoughtful.
Yeah!
[Voice breaking] I can't remember the last time Kenny looked this nice.
Are you done performing?
Excuse me?
!
Reggie is the executor of daddy's estate.
Every time he stops by,
Didi turns on the waterworks to impress him.
You are such a liar.
You could put daddy in a suit any time you want!
And when was the last time you did something nice for him?
I gave up my whole life for him.
Now who's performing?
Okay, ladies, please...
Rosie, go ahead and serve dinner.
No.
I want to do presents first.
Rosie, do as I say.
Rosie, this is my house.
She's just an elderly guest.
No one asked you, Ambrosia.
You work for me, remember?
No, she works for me.
You know, I'm sick of this.
Just go to hell!
Back off, bitch!
[Panting]
[Sighs]
I think that means I work for him.
[Cellphone rings]
[Cellphone beeps] Hey, mija, what's up?
Whoa, whoa.
Ho... ho... hold on.
Slow down!
Your mother did what?
What the hell were you thinking?
!
I wanted her out of that house.
That's your excuse for stealing?
Do you want your daughter to be a maid, to watch while she throws her life away?
It's her life to throw!
I know what I'm talking about.
I had a chance to go to college.
I thought that scholarship would always be there...
Yeah, I know... your life didn't turn out the way you wanted.
How does that justify trying to get your own daughter fired?
!
All right!
I'm sorry!
It just happened!
I don't know what I was thinking.
I do.
You were thinking you could control everything under the sun...
The world according to Zoila...
Pablo.
Always making us jump through your hoops.
Valentina and I have been doing it for years, and we're sick of it!
I mean, we love you, but, God, you make us so unhappy!
You're unhappy?
Since when?
Since as long as I can remember.
Oh.
[Sighs]
I'm taking this back to Valentina.
[Knock on door]
Mrs. Powell?
I believe this belongs to you.
Tony!
[Gasps]
How in the world...?
[Gasps] I have my ways.
Oh [Chuckles]
Here.
Allow me.
[Sighs]
When those men broke into our home, they stole so much more than this necklace.
They took our dignity, our sense of security...
Now I feel like I've gotten some of those things back.
I'm glad.
Oh, how can I ever repay you?
Seeing you smile is payment enough.
"ET" has just learned that longtime couple Spence and Peri Westmore are calling it quits.
Although the couple issued a statement saying the divorce will be amicable, rumors are swirling that the hunky soap star may have cheated on America's sweetheart.
And, of course, we'll always keep you updated for the latest on this story.
[Doorbell rings]
Rosie, what are you doing here?
I saw the TV.
They were talking about you and Mrs. Peri.
Look, I can't talk right now.
I just wanted to see if you were okay.
Not really.
Do you want to go to breakfast tomorrow, tell me what happened?
No, I don't.
As a matter of fact, uh, I can't see you again.
Why?
My family is breaking up because of you.
I'm very upset.
You have to stay away.
I'm sorry.
You know, my meetings are only during the days.
You sure you don't want to come with me?
San Francisco sounds fun, but I have a lot of writing to do.
Okay.
I guess I'm just worried about you being all alone in the house with Opal.
Well, I told you, we're good now.
By the time you get back, we're gonna be besties.
Oh, now I'm definitely worried.
[Both chuckle]
See you in a week.
Okay.
[Sighs]
_
_

[Speaking indistinctly]
Alejandro!
Where's your tie?
Well, isn't this a casual thing?
No!
No. [Chuckles]
This is our engagement party.
We have to look nice.
Ah, geez.
[Sighs]
I should have called the whole thing off.
What... you know, the more I think about Dario...
- You seem tense...
- The more that I'm...
While you get a tie...
I'm thinking black...
I'll get you a beverage.
Okay.
So, that's Alejandro, huh?
Keep his glass full, make every drink a double, and if he orders water, put vodka in it.
Why do you need him drunk?
You're paid to pour, not to ask questions.
When I give the cue, this is what I need you to say.
Here.
I'll give you an extra $50 if you stop judging me.
Oh!
You got the white flowers.
Perfect.
Carmen.
Why did you give the bartender money?
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.
Why do you always think I'm up to something?
[Door opens]
Father Tomas!
I'm so glad you could come.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
What's with the suitcase?
You might want to sit down.
I need some space.
I found a little apartment.
Not too expensive.
So, you're leaving me?
I'm taking a break.
A break?
Zoila, if I stay in this house, the way I'm feeling about you, we're not gonna make it.
Oh.
So, I just need to [Sighs] take a few months.
Trust me.
It's gonna be good for both of us.
I'll give you a call when I get settled, okay?
[Voice breaking] And I promise to eat healthy.
[Door closes]
[Upbeat music playing, indistinct conversations]
Hey.
How are you feeling?
Pretty hammered.
What the hell's in these drinks?
Who cares?
It's time to make our toast.
Mm.
Okay.
[Music stops] Hello, everyone!
Hey!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
[Exhales sharply]
Alejandro and I are so happy to have you with us on this special night.
I wish you could all feel the passion we have for each other.
Aww!
I don't feel so good.
Neither do I. [Chuckles]
Waiting and waiting for the big day.
Are you as excited about the wedding as we are?
[Cheers and applause]
But I guess we have to wait a few more weeks.
- Aw!
Aw!
- Aw!
Aw!
What else can we do?
Why don't you get married now?
- Yeah!
Yeah!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Get married now?
[Chuckling] That's crazy!
I mean, we don't have anyone here to marry us, right?
I could do it.
Oh, my God!
Father Tomas?
Who invited you?
[Chuckles] Oh, dear God.
Wedding!
Wedding!
[Chanting] Wedding!
Wedding!
Wedding!
Wedding!
Aah!
[Cheers and applause]
What the hell's going on?
[Crowd murmuring]
We're giving the people what they want.
[Crowd cheers]
Carmen, we need to talk about this.
Yeah, we'll talk on the honeymoon.
We need to talk now.
Take five, padre.
Nobody leave!
[Chuckles]
Let's do this.
Listen.
Listen.
We have to get married!
Why?
Because if we don't...
I get nothing.
What are you talking about?
Read the contract, Alejandro!
You know, my album, my tour...
If you run off with Dario, it... it all goes away.
[Sighing] Oh...
Baby, I won't let that happen.
You won't?
I should have been clearer.
I will personally see to it that my label honors our deal...
Oh, my God.
Not just because you're an amazing friend, but because I believe in your talent.
You're a star waiting to happen, Ms. Carmen Luna.
[Inhales sharply]
You are the best husband I never married.
[Chuckles] Thank you.
Thank you.
[Guests screaming]
[Indistinct shouting]
Shut up!
Get down on the ground!
Get down!
[Shouting continues]
I'm not screwing around, people!
[Grunts]
[Screams]
What did you do?
!
Let's go.
Let's go.
Get out of here now!
[Panting]
Oh.
[Voice breaking] Somebody call 911, please!
Oh, my God.
You shot him!
It was an accident.
I didn't see him!
Well, do you think we should go back to see if he's okay?
Are you crazy?
The cops are gonna be here any minute.
[Engine turns over]
The ambulance is on its way.
[Sobbing] He's not saying anything, and there's so much blood.
[Sobs]
Why?
[Sobbing loudly]
Taxi!
Can I have some water, mom?
Try this biscuit.
Here.
Mom?
When is the training going to come?
It's due.
It will be here soon.
- Give it to me.
Go and ask its correct arrival time.
To know the correct time, wait for the train.
It will be here soon.
- At least find out where it is!
Where has it reached!
Call him up!
It will be here soon..
Hello?
Hi, this is Virat's sister.
Yes.
- Where has the train reached?
Actually the train has stalled due to some problem with the engine.
Is my brother close-by?
Virat..
Yes, he is playing.
Virat!

Where did sir come from?
Virat!
Come on!
- Look behind you!
Come on!
- Look behind you!
Go on!
Look behind you!
- What happened?
Captain Virat IC58664 reporting sir!
Damn!
Oh God!
Sorry, sir.
I didn't know I was standing on muck.
Let me wipe it off.
Good block, sir.
Sir..
The muck..
I, sir..
Sir, the train is signalling us.
Sir, you can clean this up in its bathroom.
Let's go, sir.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Hurry up!
Let's go!
Hurry up!
Let's go!
'Your attention please.'
'Jammu to Mumbai, Soldier Holiday Special Express..'
It's here!
- 'Train No. 12472..
...Is arriving on Platform No. 5.'
'Thank you.'
Brother..
Brother..
Everyone's here except Virat.
Where is he?
- There he is!
Look, mom!
Brother!
Hi, brother!
- Virat!
Brother!
Let's go!
- Let's go!
How are you?
- I am fine.
How about you?
Virat!
- Dad!
Hello!
Dad, they are my friends.
He's Vishal..
Virat, we don't have time.
Let's go.
Yes, let's go.
- But my friends..
We are in a hum].
- Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Listen to me..
- Where are you taking him?
I'll see you guys later!
- Hurry up!
I'll talk to you later.
- Call me.
Where are we going, dad?
Yes.
Bye.
- First let's get out of here.
Let's go.
- But what's the hum]?
Just come with us.
Get inside.
Get inside the taxi.
Let's go.
- Keep the bags there.
Yes, over here.
- Get in.
Come on.
Hit the third gear, sir.
What's the hum], dad?
Where are we going?
Don't you know?
Otherwise, why would I be asking you?
Shut up and listen.
We are going to see a bride for you.
The auspicious time ends in 23 minutes.
After 5:00pm the alignment of the stars will change.
And Shraddha period begins from tomorrow.
No one will introduce their daughter to you after that.
We need to see this girl before that.
Otherwise, you idiot will always remain single.
Mom, I'll go wearing my military outfit?
So what?
Let's go home, rest, eat, freshen up and then go.
You are not getting any younger, son.
A single day won't change my age.
Quiet, all of you.
Sorry.
- Hit the fourth gear, sir.
It's a taxi, and not an aeroplane, sir.
We've reached.
- Your destination.
They are here.
Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome.
- Welcome.
Hi.
- Hello.
Hello.
Your son didn't come with you?
He is my son.
His clothes suggest he has just returned from a battlefield.
Let's go.
- This way.
Let's go.
This way.
Please come.
Three wickets down at the door itself.
Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome.
Jai Hind.
Have a seat.
Please have a seat.
Oh.
You are late.
Look at this..
Couldn't help it.
The train got delayed.
Close the buttons at least.
- We couldn't have driven it.
Did you have any trouble finding out house?
No, not at all.
We needed to see the girl before the auspicious hour ends.
That's why we brought him here directly from the station.
Please Call her.
Yes, of course.
Call her.
Yes.
Saiba.
Saiba!
Sister!
She's Saiba?
Oh, thank God.
Thank you.
Saiba sings well.
What would you like to hear?
Any nice song will do.
Look at his clothes,
'Jana Gena Mane' sounds pefiem.
She's nice, isn't she?
Do you have her phone number?
"Her!" Already!
0226276..
- Just a minute, mom.
022..
789.
Hello?
Hi, I am Virat.
Silence!
That boy has called.
Yes, son?
Uncle, I wanted to say that your daughter is very beautiful.
Oh!
- Beautiful.
But it seems that we have different tastes.
I don't think we will make a good match.
But I pray that you find someone better than me.
Sorry for the trouble.
Stupid!
What's your problem!
Forget it!
I don't think he will never get married!
Why didn't you like her!
Give me at least one reason!
Not one, I have three reasons.
What?
- What?
- What?
She plait is a metre long and then some.
That's not an excuse.
- So what?
Girls with hair longer than 6 inches take 1V2 hours to get their hair done.
In her case, she will take six hours!
I'll have to wait the whole day to go for a party.
Did I tell you?
Did I ask you to get me married?
Did I?
!
Secondly..
She is very shy and timid.
Saw that?
She raised her hand on her father.
You should have been strict from the beginning.
"Hit papa!
Hit papa!"
You got her into this habit.
And what's the third reason?
And the third reason is that I want a stylish girl.
An impressive girl.
She looks like she has just come from a village.
Hey!
What.
What are you doing?
Hey!
Why do you need so much money?
I served coffee to six people.
This is a tip for that.
Hey..
- Bye!
According the post-modem report.
This woman committed suicide by setting herself on fire.
Impossible.
This isn't a suicide.
It's murder.
Soles of who commit suicide by setting themselves on fire never burn.
This..
- Her soles are burnt.
Someone killed her, made her lie down..
Pour an accelerant on her, started a fire and declared it as suicide.
Your case is solved.
Just find the murderer.
You started already?
When I came to know that you are coming..
I thought of taking a leave and going to Madgaon.
But my luck simply..
My leave wasn't approved.
Just say that I trouble you.
Why are you beating around the bush?
Oh really?
I should just say it?
Virat, you take a holiday and come here even] year.
Yes, I do.
You spend your days with me.
Yes, I do.
You meddle in my affairs.
Yes, I do.
Whenever I am about to get promoted to being an inspecton.
You ruin my chances and I get stuck at being a sub-inspector.
Listen..
I'll no longer meddle in your affairs.
Happy?
You won't face any problems.
Just a minute.
Here.
Solve it.
What's happening?
A sports tournament.
We're providing security for it.
Hi, Rocky!
Hi, Rocky!
Let's go.
Do you want to provide security?
Do you want to hang out with him?
Rocky is retiring tomorrow.
Today is his last day on duty.
He is very smart.
A few days back there was an article on him in the Mumbai Mirror.
What's wrong with his paw?
He broke a bone during practice.
Department doesn't need him because he has a broken bone.
So they are retiring him.
Strange, isn't it?
You are looked after only till the time you are needed.
From tomorrow he will be a street dog.
Can I take Rocky with me tomorrow?
Sure.
Fine.
I'll take him in.
Fantastic.
- Bye, Rocky.
Security is perfect?
- Yes, sir.
Don't let anyone in without proper ID.
- Okay, sir.
Mukund..
- Yes?
There's a lot of beauty here.
Control your emotions.
I'm on duty.
Yes, sir.
Not so seriously.
Control.
Beauty reminds me, we went to see a girl yesterday.
How was she?
Don't ask.
I got so bored!
Just don't ask!
Intercollegiate boxing championship is about to begin.
We first call upon, Saiba Thapar from St. Xavier's college, Mumbai!
She is very delicate.
V9"!
Shy type, you know..
You know the rules.
Box.
Come on, Saiba.
Don't give up!
Come on, Saiba!
Saiba, you can do it!
You can do it, Saiba!
- Saiba!
Come on, Saiba!
Better focus!
I don't like this girl at all!
One, two..
Three, four..
Five, six..
Seven, eight.
Nine, ten!
And the winner is, Saiba Thapar!
You should marry someone like her.
Saiba!
Saiba!
Saiba!
Right?
- She is the girl I met that day.

No!
No!
Absolutely not!
Earlier you sought three faults in her.
Now you feel that she is the moon.
Mom, how will a phone call make any difference to you?
Your son will get a chance to settle down.
Try and understand.
Just one phone call.
Happy birthday, mom,
I celebrated my birthday last month.
And you are giving me a gift today!
That too a dog!
- Please, mom.
Consider it a belated birthday gift.
Mom..
Your pencil.
Hey, make the phone call, please.
Just one call for your brother.
- No.
Please?
See.
Happy birthday-
I hate dogs!
Both of you, get out of here!
Is this a joke?
He didn't like me the other day.
Now he likes me.
Will it do if again after marriage he says he doesn't like me?
Look, you got your first proposal when you were 13.
I've been getting text messages since I was 10!
Like you, I too have rejected many.
You know, I used to get loads of text messages when I turned 18.
Then as my age progressed the number of text messages declined.
Now the only text messages I get are from customer care and call centres.
Look, you should display some attitude but then you should give in.
Got it?
Anything you say won't make any difference to me.
Oh God.
You go to buy one article and you end up buying plenty.
To go shopping with your wife..
A person gets bored to death.
Please don't get married, Virat.
I am telling you.
Hey, this..
Man] Kom..
Isn't she the same boxer?
Handsome.
He's hot.
Say hi to him.
He's the one I rejected.
What are you doing?
Look"
Hey!
I'll fall down!
This is a police bike.
I am on duty.
Hey..
Get down!
What happened?
- Get down!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay!
- How dare he!
Move aside!
Hey!
Why did you kiss me?
When did I kiss you?
I kissed my mirror.
This mirror belongs to me.
I can do anything I want to do with it.
The mirror might be yours but the face in it is mine!
Just a minute.
This mirror belongs to the government.
Hey..
- Hey!
I can do anything I want to do with this mirror.
I can love it, kiss it or break it!
Why just you?
I'll break it!
Just a minute, madam.
No violence!
This is a public road.
So?
He can kiss in the middle of the road?
And you?
You are a cop, right?
Why are you standing here quietly like a fool?
Let's go, Saiba.
- Look, ma'am, you..
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Aren't you ashamed of eve-teasing?
Let's go.
Let's go.
- I'll break your jaw!
Let's go.
- Ifl see you here again, I'll kill you!
Let's go, girl!
Let's go!
Get inside.
- Keep moving.
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
Come on!
Ask for boxer Saiba!
- Yes, we will.
Then you will know who I am.
Couldn't you have found a better place to romance?
Move on, man!
- Hey!
She has the keys to my bike!
So what?
Push it.
- Push..
If only you wouldn't have rejected her..
My bike won't have lost its mirror.
Isn't she great, Makiya?
She took the bike keys while talking to us and we didn't even realise.
Not while talking, while verbally abusing us.
Tell me what did my depanmenfs bike have to do with your quarrel?
My purse!
My purse!
Has someone seen my purse?
It contains Rs. 5000!
Has someone seen my purse?
Hey Romeo, something happening over there.
Someone has stolen it.
I had it with me.
- Come on, go ahead.
My purse..
Where is my purse?
It contained Rs. 5000 in it!
- Silence!
My purse..
Please.
Please.
- You want your purse, right?
Yes.
- You will get it.
We are with the police.
No one will move from their place.
Stop the bus.
Ask him to stop the bus.
- I'll get down from the front.
You will get your purse.
Come on.
Come on.
Come over here.
Ask everyone to get down one by one.
- Okay.
Hurry Up-
Come on everyone, get off the bus, one by one.
Everyone, get off the bus.

Is this the one?
- No.
Come on, get down.

Do I look like a thief to you?
This one?
- No.

Do one thing.
Go inside and check under the seats.
Yes, sir.
- Okay?
Go and check if it is under the seat.
Is this the one?
Look"
- No.
Come on!
Come on!
Get off from the front!
Open her bag.
- She?

You will even check ladies purses?
No, it's not there.
Who's next?

- Virat, we found the purse!
Hand him over to the police!
- Hit him!
Virat!
What's wrong, Virat?
Virat!
Hey you..
Why.. why did you need to run?
Why were you running?
Why did you run?
Why did you run?
Yes?
Why did you run?
Why are you looking over there?
Hey..
Hey!
We gathered all the information.
We knew that we would catch him one day.
Very soon I'll catch all the terrorists behind this attack.
Don't worn].
Mumbai is safe as long as I am here.
I have worked day and night and caught this terrorist.
And it's assumed, their aim wasn't to blow up just one bus.
They have a hidden agenda behind this.
And we need to find that out.
viral.
Let's go and give an interview.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Not there.
Let's go this way.
'Sir, it's often seen that the Mumbai police..'
'..has been unable to capture the terrorists behind the blasts.'
'Even if they capture them.'
Instead of questioning him, they are giving him VIP treatment.
Let me assure you, I can die for the people of this country.
He's blabbering as if he is the one who caught him.
Actually, I should've been there.
But you dragged and brought me here.
Let me assure you, I won't rest in peace till this case isn't solved.
If I would've been on TV..
First of all, my mother-in-law would've been stunned.
I would've gained a lot of respect.
I would've become an inspector.
Very soon the will be brought before the law.
'Among those who died in the bus bomb blast included women and children.'
'According to the police, the terrorist caught, Aseem Lala, is behind it.'
'They also state that there can be other terrorist organisations behind it.'
'But this has still not been confirmed.'
'Police state that the terrorists behind it won't be spared.'
'Home ministry has recommended formation of a high level investigation team.'
'And also assured that the security is being tighten up.'
'Those behind these attacks.'
Patil, I need someone at the back-street.
Okay, sir.
He is here.
What is it?
- We were waiting for you.
Let's go.
Come inside.
This is Virat's house.
Do as you have been briefed.
Okay, sir.
You are all on unofficial duty.
Set your Walkies to a different channel.
What is it, Makiya?
At this hour?
They will be here tonight, for security.
Do one thing.
Take your family somewhere tomorrow morning.
Just for a few days.
Why?
What happened?
That terrorist escaped from the hospital.
What?
Yes.
He killed a doctor and two of my cops.
But how?
I don't know.
In spite of so much security.
You got him arrested.
So he could come here and attack you.
That's why they are here.
Don't worn].
Go to sleep.
I'll make a move.
Keep YOU!
' eyes open, GUYS!
Rocky..
Yes, sir.
I have sent Tawde and Patil to Gate No. 2.
I have never seen so much security being given by police.
Hey!
Hurry up!
Catch him!
He must have gone straight ahead.
Sun/avanshi, where are you?
Wait.
I am coming.
- Okay, sir.
Hurry up!
Tambe, this way!
What wrong did those innocent kids do to you?
You know why did I sever your finger without first questioning you?
Because now I am going to ask you a question.
And if you don't answer me, you know the consequences.
One question.
One second.
If you don't answer me..
Another finger.
Someone helped you escape from the hospital.
Who was it?
ACP Ashok Gaikwad.
So simple.
Who is it?
It's me.
What do you want at this hour of the night?
Leave.
We'll talk in the morning.
I want to talk to you now.
Come on the terrace.
I told you to leave.
We'll talk in the morning.
Leave.
Look, your friend's picture.
The one you helped escape is a guest in my house.
Sorry I didn't tell you who I am.
My name is Virat.
Indian Army.
Not just that.
D.l.A.
Defence Intelligence Agency.
I am a specialist over there.
A secret agent with the army.
My friends who work with me don't know about this.
Not even my family knows about this.
Why am I telling you all this?
I am sure this is what you are thinking about.
It's because you won't live.
When we are at the border..
...our enemy shoots us and we shoot them.
This is what generally happens.
One day, in our camp, a man named Ashraf..
He was from Sholapur.
He just disappeared suddenly.
Even after searching for seven days, we couldn't find him.
We found him on the eighth day.
He was stuck at the enemy camp.
They tortured him for seven days.
They had gouged out his eyes.
They shoved a beer bottle into his rare.
And then, they broke that bottle.
They were very cruel to him.
We had taken his dead body to his house.
His mother was crying and father was wailing.
His sister was screaming, yelling..
His family was in a very bad state.
But on the tenth day, his younger brother joined the military.
We die at the border even/day.
...so that you can live peacefully with your families.
This is a locally made gun.
This is my gun.
If I shoot you,
I'll have to tell everyone why I did so.
Your family will express their disgust over your dead body.
Your kids will beg at the signal.
Your wife will sell herself on the streets at night.
And if you shoot yourself, it will be considered as on-duty suicide.
Someone from your family will get a job.
They will get the provident fund money.
Pension will reach home every month, on time.
Now you decide which gun do you wish to pick.
And yes, if the barrel of this gun points towards me then I'll shoot you.
You are challenging a very big threat.
A shot was fired.
- The sound came from the terrace.
I think from over there.
- From the terrace.
I know that you and the ACP don't know everything.
'Juhu.
Bandra.
Dharavi..'
'Dadar.
Bombay central.'
'Blasts at 12 places in Mumbai.'
When?
On 27th.
Time?
4:00pm.
Looking beautiful?
- Very beautiful.
Came from Jalandhar and made a Maharashtrian fall for her.
Really!
- She is very smart!
He is naive.
You're looking gorgeous.
Thank you so much.
- Congratulations.
Hi.
- Thank you so much.
Thanks for coming.
Listen..
Listen!
- What?
Come with me.
I have doubt.
Doubt?
Do you think this is a mathematical class?
Come with me.
I need to ask you something.
Please try to understand, I am getting married.
After some time.
Listen, my head will explode if you won't come with me.
Come with me, now!
Let's see.
I have plans but..
Excuse me.
Can you please hold this?
Let's go.
Congratulations.
What!
The college beauty contest that I won..
You lost but you were the second runner up.
Okay.
Continue.
You have Hrithik, John and Salman's posters in your hostel room.
So what?
Then why are you getting married to this baldy?
Look, there are no more than 10 film stars.
But there are 30 crores girls in India.
So think practically.
The good looking guys aren't smart
And the smart ones don't look good.
Listen..
And what about those who are smart and good looking?
Beg, plead and get married to him.
30"'!
-
Howzat!
What's troubling you, Makiya?
There's something that I cannot understand.
Try me.
I might be able to help.
In spite of being a cop, I cannot understand.
How will you understand?
Why?
I am a militan/ man.
Do you know the basic difference between a cop and a military man?
What?
As soon as someone says "Attention!"..
A military man stands stiff, like this.
When he gets shoot orders, he starts firing without thinking.
But it's not so with us.
We need to use our brains.
I mean if we need to catch a pickpocket, we need to think like one.
If we need to catch a murderer, we need to think like one.
And if we need to catch a terrorist.
You need to think like one.
No, you sometimes need to become a terrorist.
Oh, my God.
But in this case, even a cop's brain has stopped working.
Then how can you help me?
Still, try me.
I'll try to solve this to be best of my ability.
Tell me.
What's the problem?
Fine.
It goes like this.
The terrorist escaped from the hospital.
He did.
That very night a cop committed suicide in his house.
That cop was posted at the hospital from where the terrorist escaped.
Now these two incidents are related, this is what a cop thinks.
Now tell me what a military man thinks.
I think this isn't a suicide, it's a murder.
How can you say that?
Because I committed this murder.
Why did you do it?
Why did he help that terrorist escape from the hospital?
Escape from the hospital.
How do you know that?
The terrorist told me.
Where did you find the terrorist?
That day in the hospital, you..
What?
hospital.
Hey!
Hi.
What are you..
- Hi.
Can we talk...?
You don't..
Yes?
Can I marry you?
Marriage?
When did you get that idea?
This morning. 8:40am.
What happened at 8:40am?
My friend got married.
The most beautiful girl in the college.
But the guy she is getting married to is not at all good looking.
So, I asked her, why is she getting married to him?
She said sometimes some things don't match.
And you know how difficult it is to find a good guy these days.
So my friends too advised me..
And I thought that why won't we get married!
I hope you very well know that from the very beginning..
...nothing seems to match between you and me.
First I rejected you then you rejected me.
Now you are giving your consent.
- I am just saying yes.
Yes, but nothing matches.
Right?
Do you smoke cigarettes?
Smoking?
Yuck, I don't do all that.
Anyway, it's not allowed in boxing.
Saw?
But I like girls who smoke.
I like the fragrance of tobacco.
Oh yes..
It's not like I have never done it.
Sometimes, you know, girls, parties..
It happens.
Nice.
Nice.
Do you drink?
Drinks?
Alcohol?
Yes, red wine.
You know, good for the head, good for the skin.
Sometimes even vodka!
But I hate girls who drink.
I just cannot bear the sight of girls drinking.
I can't understand why do they drink?
Why are you crying?
You are saying this on purpose.
On purpose?
- I know that you love me.
Saiba..
Saiba, listen to me.
I...
I..
You..
I came here straight from the wedding.
I didn't even eat!
- I'll feed you.
I am just joking!
- Joking?
I am just joking, come on!
If you don't believe me then let's go to the temple outside and get married.
But there's a problem.
Now what's the problem?
Because I was angry with you".
I said okay to the next boy my parents introduced me to.
You said okay?
Yes, it's not a big deal to say okay and then say not okay.
But you said okay to him and then you said the same okay to me.
No, no, no.
The okay I said to you is different.
The okay I said to him is different.
He too is a military man.
A military man?
If we somehow convince him not to go ahead with this marriage..
Then our job will be done.
He'll be at the coffee shop at 12 o'clock.
Let's do one thing.
Let me accompany you.
Let's meet him.
You'll come with me?
He is going to come over here?
Yes.
Please wait here.
Okay.
Stay here, I'll go inside and talk to him.
You stay here.
I'll go and talk to him.
Come inside when I ask you to.
Excuse me..
Excuse me, the gentleman with the flower.
Please turn around.
Turn.
Yeah?
Sir!
LC58664, Captain Virat reporting, sir!
Virat!
What's going on?
You gave such a salute to me that I felt as if I am on the parade ground.
I am sorry, sir.
The girl I am going to marry is coming here to meet me.
I have never been married before.
It's my first time.
I am a little nervous.
Hi...
How are you?
Stupid!
'.
How do I say it?
Hi.
Hi.
Hi!
Come, come, come.
Sit, sit, sit.
You too like me, that's what your mother told me.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Saiba, Virat.
We are in the same battalion.
He is very junior to me.
Okay.
He keeps on making mistakes and hence keeps getting punished.
He is very scared of me.
Virat..
Sir!
- Saiba.
Hello, madam.
Madam?
I've kept a get-together at the hotel in the evening.
A small party, you see.
- Oh.
You must come.
Yeah.
Virat..
- I'll be there, sir.
Thank you.
Now, it's 12:30pm.
We were going to meet 12 o'clock.
30"'!
-
I'm very punctual.
I'm a military man, you see.
Of course.
So, we'll meet at the party in the evening?
Yes.
Virat..
- Yes, sir!
IC58..
Not in a public place.
See you in the evening.
Sorry, sir.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Virat!
Sir!
Is this how you were going to talk?
Sorry, madam, but you are going to get married to him.
He left.
Why are you addressing me as madam?
We love each other, don't we?
We broke up.
We started loving just an hour back.
Already break up?
Look madam, he is better than me in everything.
Do you know?
To complete a 400meter race I take 52 seconds.
He takes 48 seconds.
In high jump..
You know I can jump 6 feet high.
He jumps 6 feet 4 inches high.
In long jump, I hold a record of 7 meters.
He has a record of 7.4.
In weight lifting he..
Am I selecting candidates for military?
I don't like him.
That's it.
You didn't like me when we met for the first time, right?
Then you started liking me, didn't you?
You met him for the first time today, so you don't like him.
You will like him in near future.
That was different and this is different.
He is my senior and I'll have to give this sacrifice.
And I am the only thing you can sacrifice?
Your phone's ringing.
It's yours.
Smart!
Hello?
Tell me, where did you meet that terrorist?
I'll tell you that later.
We need to do something important tomorrow.
Okay?
Hey, Vi..
Strange!
What are you doing over here?
Don't you know why I am here?
Don't ever come to my room unannounced.
There's something called as privacy.
Once again I ask you, where did you meet that terrorist?
Here.
Hey..
He ran away from the hospital.
How did you catch him?
You remember we went to the hospital?
Then you went to sleep, but I stayed back.
I knew he would do something.
Hey, but..
You cannot keep him like this.
You'll have to hand him over to the police.
So that he can once again run away?
No.
But we'll find out how many people are working with him and..
Let that to me.
Why are you injecting him with this?
Say something.
Why are you untying him?
Virat!
What...?
What's going on?
You ask too many questions!
And you are answering none of them!
Will someone tell me what's happening here?
What have you injected him with?

Hello, aunty.
Hey, Virat!
You are looking very smart!
- Thank you.

So we broke it off.

Let's go.
He is calling us.

Thank you so much.
You will know once you go there?
What are you doing?
Alright, GUYS-
He's saying something.

Listen.
Virat is saying something.
It's been a long time.
Let's play a game.
What do you say?
A game?
Come on, man!
He wants to play games in the camp, when the train stops.
And now even at a wedding, he wants to play a game.
This is a real game.
Real game?
!
Yes.
Fine, then the six of us will be one team and you six be the other.
What do you say?
All of us are in one team.
All of us in one team?
- Yes.
There is no opponent?
But what are the rules?
I'll tell that later.
Fine.
But after winning, you'll give all of us a party.
Yes.
- Yes.
- You'll have to give a party.
Okay.
Okay, let's go.
Guys, pay attention.
This is a little serious game.
You will soon know who our opponents are.
Can you see my house?
Look at it very carefully.
In two minutes, a guy will come out from the backdoor.
The 12 of us will follow him.
Understood?
- Yes.
After that when he meets another person we team will get divided into two.
Six people will follow the guy who will just come outside.
And six people will follow the guy he meets.
As these people keep meeting different people, our keep will keep getting divided.
Did you all understand?
- Yes.
Very good.
Remember, your cell phones should always be on.
Don't answer anyone's call except mine.
We 12 will have a conference call and stay connected.
Okay?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Let's wait for the man now.
He'll be here soon.
Is that him?
- That's the guy.
Yeah.
This is very risky.
It will be more risky if we don't do anything.
Stan the car and follow him.
Where did he go?
- He was just here.
Where is he?
We've lost him.
Where is he?
- There he is!
Over there.
Over there.
Drive slowly.
He got into a rickshaw.
Vishal, note the number.
M I-I-O3-AA-6221 .
He's accomplice is here.
Look..
Drive slowly.
What will we do if those 12 people don't split up?
They will have to, because they a job to finish at 12 places.
Stop the car.
Come on, boys.
- Come, come, come.
You all six..
Follow him.
Let's go.
Move.
We are following him.
Keep following him.
Copy that.
Move.
Move.
Stay on the line.
He's meeting another guy.
Stay alert Stay alert
All of you split.
We are following.
Copy that.
You follow him.
How many so far?
We are following the first guy.
- We are following the second guy.
We are following the new one.
Keep following.
He's walking right in front of me.
Stay alert
- Copy that.
Virat, we are following the first guy.
Another guy has joined.
Get in the train.
We are in the train.
Virat, they are splitting up.
Stay there.
Okay.
Well done.
Virat, Goregaon Station.
Wait for the high point.
The first guy is meeting a cell phone dealer.
Now they are separate.
You follow him.
He's meeting another guy.
All of you split.
Split now!
They are splitting up.
You follow him.
Stay connected.
It's target at sight.
I'm following the new one.
There is one for each of us now.
Virat, I'm at Dockyard Road.
Masjid Bandar.
I'm getting into a fern].
I'm at Dharavi.
I'm at Matunga.
Virat, he has gotten into a bus.
He's getting inside a mall.
- Yes.
I'm right behind him.
I'm at Bandra.
I'm in a fern].
I'm at Chembur.
I'm at Kurla.
Guys, we are 12 people for those 12 guys.
The game is going to end now.
I have kept something in your bags.
Check it out.
It's a gun.
Hey, it contains a gun.
It contains a gun.
Virat, this is a gun.
No one needs to panic.
I have placed that gun there.
There's a bomb in the bag of the guy you are following.
He's not an ordinary guy.
He has killed innocent women and children in our country.
He's a damn terrorist.
We need to do what we do at the border.
To keep a bomb at four places at the same time..
To cause serial blasts in train..
We too know their technique.
We need to show them that.
There shouldn't be a difference of even a second.
Shoot them at the same time.
Ready, get set, boys.
Yes.
We will do it.
Yes.
We will do it.
Three..
Two..
One..
Shoot!
He's dead.
I've left.
We'll do that.
When are you giving us party?
- I will.
I will.
What have you done!
- Finished.
End.
The dead body found at 11 places and the one found here..
They are sleeper cells.
They are even claimed to be terrorists.
They even found bombs in their bags.
According to the police..
All the cell phones found on sleeper cells are of high technology.
Looking at the magnitude of the preparations of these sleeper cells..
...one thing is for certain that Mumbai has been saved from a major disaster.
At the moment the biggest threat to this world are the sleeper cells.
What are they?
And who are they?
Look, in a terrorist world, these sleeper cells..
...are the one whose activities are most secretive.
Like the 12 men who were killed were kind of sleeper cells..
Yet they stayed among the common man..
...and prepared themselves for an attack.
The most important question.
Do these sleeper cells belong to a particular religion?
It's not always that they are related to religion.
When a country or a group want to plan a terrorist in our country"
They find people who hold a grudge, a feeling of revenge towards the government.
These people are found and prepared to execute a terrorist attack against us..
And seek their revenge.
After the 9/11 attack, all the secret agencies had one thing in mind..
That they should rid America of sleeper cells.
And they got rid of them in such a way that after the 9/11 attack..
...no attack of that kind or magnitude took place again in America.
Navin Chandra, Age: 29, killed in a BEST Bus.
Afsar Ali, Age: 31, killed at the Mumbai Central ST Stand.
Mother, look father!
Mother!
Mother!
Look father!
Mother!
Father's photo!
Mother!
Look father!
Mother!
Look father!
Look mother, father..
Who did this?
We still don't know who did it
Even the police have no clue.
Any clues?
Police has confiscated all their things.
Just one non-tracker phone has been taken by a shooter.
Whose phone was it?
Afsar Ali, who got killed at Mumbai Central, near the ST Stand.
I don't know who you are, where you are.
You have killed 12 of my men.
One of them was my brother.
I am coming to you.
When I find you, I'll kill you.
I am waiting.
Hello.
Please come.
What's the height of this wall?
S ix feet.
They are excellent jumpers.
What was the speed of the bus?
Approximately 40km/hr.
They are good runners as well.
They can swim well too.
They have shot all the 12 people on their forehead.
A moving bus, crowded market, dark theatre..
Even from a distance of 20 meters they shot at the centre of the forehead.
They are trained shooters.
But they are not cops.
Was there anything common in these 12 people?
No.
But there was one thing common in them.
During enquin/ I found out that these 12 people were wearing suits while shooting.
What did you just say?
These 12 people were wearing suits while shooting.
This is something you should have told me sooner.
I thought it's very common to wear suits.
It's very common to wear suits in America, but not in India.
So they are people who wear suit-pants.
They can be waiters in a hotel.
Businessmen attending a board meeting.
They can be software engineers attending a seminar.
Advocates, marriage functions.
I need a list of all the seminars..
...and marriage functions that took place in Mumbai on the 27th.
The ones with dress code suit-pants.
You think you are very smart.
Instead of killing those 12 people if you would've caught them alive..
...then we would've got some information.
It's of no use.
Because they never know what the plan is.
What?
- Yes.
Those 12 people didn't even know each other.
What are you saying!
These people are called sleeper cells.
Whether you call them their heads or bosses..
Can be one, two or three..
They make the plan together.
And then they find people who are ready to sacrifice their lives.
And the ones who are ready to sacrifice their lives are called sleeper cells.
That's why it's no use capturing them.
Because they don't know anything.
So till these sleeper cells don't get orders from their boss they lead a normal life?
Exactly.
We won't even know where they are.
It can be our neighbour.
Or the one sitting next to us in a bus.
It can even be our courier boy.
It can be anyone.
So how do we destroy them?
There's one way to destroy them.
Kill their head or boss.
Once he is dead, their connection shall end.
And as the sleeper cells won't get any orders, they'll become dormant.
Just a minute!
But how will you find the head of the sleeper cells?
Who said I will find him?
He will find me.
What?
- Because of what I have done.
We killed 12 of his men..
- Yes.
He will surely attack us to seek revenge.
According to my plan, he will soon show himself.
But in a big city like Mumbai, how will he find you?
We killed his men?
Right.
We must've made some mistake.
We must've left some clue behind.
He will come out to look for the clue.
If we find out what that clue is we can capture him before he attacks.
Then get thinking about what that clue is.
Move that colourful thing..
What is it called?
Cube?
Move the cube, they will help you find out.
Right?
Because if you have left a clue behind..
You won't answer this call.
No!
Today you need to decide, friend or girlfriend.
Girlfriend.
- Good..
Hello?
Your sir has summoned us to his house.
Right away.
Okay, I am coming.
Hurry up.
- Yes, I'm coming.
Virat!
What are you doing?
Let's go inside..
Virat!
Jyoti..
Remain seated.
Sit.
She is Jyoti, my neighbour.
Hi.
She has been in love with me since childhood.
Sit.
After hearing the news that I am going to get married to you, she..
She was going to commit suicide.
We got her hospitalised.
It was a big problem.
Then I decided..
I am sorry, I will marry Jyoti.
I know..
This must've come to you as a huge shock.
I evoked love in your head, I made a mistake.
No more suicides.
Life is precious.
Now I have a question for the two of you.
Yes, sir.
You came here on a holiday, to get married.
Yes, sir.
Here..
And you wanted to marry a military man?
Yes.
Why don't the two of you get married?
But sir..
- Virat!
Don't act suspicious..
I loved her, but I never touched her.
That's by mistake.
Ask her!
Look, I can understand that it won't be easy for you to forget me.
Now what can I do?
It's not my fault that I am so handsome.
Yes, sir!
- Strange guy.
He stands up for anything I say.
Well, all the best.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Bye.
- Bye.
Thank you.
- Bye.
Come on, let's go.
Saiba..
Yeah?
Because we couldn't get married..
Never do this.
I'll m].
All the best.
Let's go.
Hurry Up-
Bye, sir.

It's still..
the song is still playing.
"Blame the night."
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
Your body temperature seems high.
Today is our first date so..
You know the rules.
According to that you need to give your boyfriend whatever he asks for.
That's why I am a little scared.
But I don't want anything.
You brought me to such a nice club.
You spent a lot of money.
I am okay.
I am happy.
Come on, let's dance.
Idiot.
Suppose if you had asked for a kiss on our first date!
I would have to kiss you, right?
Yes, you will have to kiss me.
Saw?
This is what I feared.
I want a kiss.
So, what should I do now?
Nothing, just close your eyes.
I'll do whatever needs to be done.
Damn..
Yes?
Listen..
I found the clue which he will use to find us.
What?
I'll find out everything.
Okay?
Hey..
Idiot.
But how will he know we left from the church?
There was just one similarity in the shootout of those 12 people.
And that's their dress-code.
If he is very smart, he will come straight to the church.
Of all the functions that took place on the 27th in Mumbai..
...the wedding in this church is the only event that matches with our list.
Because the one who got married is a military man.
Yes?
The name of the bridegroom is William Maﬂin Joel.
Can we get his address?
Yes.
- Please.
Yes?
Joel's residence?
- Yes.
We are from the army.
His batch mates.
Okay!
Come, come, come.
Joel is on honeymoon.
Did you contact him on his mobile?
His phone was out of reach, uncle.
Oh!
Hill station.
I am sorry.
Come.
She's Joel's mom.
She's cannot speak.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
Come, sit.
I have brought a gift for Joel.
Oh, thank you very much.
God bless you.
What will you have to drink?
No, thank you, uncle.
Uncle, can we have a look at Joel's wedding album?
Why not!
I'll just get it.
That's great, madam!
You will give the address to any stranger?
Isn't it your duty to at least call his family and inform?
This isn't the time to argue.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
What do I say about.
- Let's get going.
No one is answering the phone at their residence.
He's Joel's school teacher.
And this is Joel's cousin.
They are Joel's batch-mates.
Uncle, there are five teams in this.
Yes, so far he has been to five camps.
That's why there are five teams.
Can I have a cup of coffee?
Oh yes, sure.
I'll just get it.
We got stuck at the last stage.
How will we know which team out of these five?
I will find out.
Boys, here's your coffee.
Thank you.
You returned so soon!
I couldn't find that medicine anywhere.
They are Joel's batch-mates.
They couldn't attend the wedding.
Welcome!
Welcome!
Welcome!
I'm Noel.
Joel's brother.
- Hi.
Sit.
Dad, did you give them coffee or something?
Yes.
- Oh great.
Okay.
Thanks for coming, guys.
In which camp was Joel with you?
Kashmir.
Which year?
2005.
Joel was in Delhi in 2005.
After that he never sewed in Kashmir.
Can I see your ID cards?
Can you show me your ID cards?
Show me.
May I see your ID cards?
Dad!
You are just too much!
You just let anyone enter the house!
What happened?
I asked them about work.
They don't know anything.
I hate smart people.
Show me!
Show me!
I need to leave a message for him.
They are smarter than I thought.
Why has these people circled?
Look"
To find out which one team out of these five shot those 12 people..
...he will pick one member from each team.
And he has circled those he will pick.
He is very smart.
Hello?
Hi, I'm Captain Virat Bakshi here.
Look, I want to tell you something.
According to our intelligence report your life is in danger.
Are you safe?
Yes, I am okay.
Are you sure?
Yes, there's no problem.
Please call me back on this number if you face any problem.
Please note down this number.
Okay.
Yes, Virat.
I am fine.
Yes, I am safe.
Yes Virat, I am fine.
I'll surely call you if there is any problem.
What?
All those who were circled are safe.
That's the problem.
It's not as we thought.
That means they are planning something else.
That can be dangerous.
Virat.
Amar Singh here.
Someone has kidnapped my niece.
When?
She went to the yoga class in the morning, but still hasn't returned.
They took her saying that we have sent a car from home.
File a complaint in your area's police station immediately.
Don't worn].
Nothing will happen.
Hurry up.
Go.
Yes, Vi rat?
You cannot get any information by torturing an army man.
That's why they are kidnapping the girls in their family.
Bloody cowards.
Why?
To find out which team killed those 12 terrorists.
...they'll kidnap the girls and threaten the family on the phone.
They will blackmail them.
I'm sending you the numbers of the 5 guys..
...he had marked in the album right away.
Listen to me very carefully, Mukund.
Call them.
Ask them to give the numbers of all the girls that are not in the house.
Go to the control room..
...and check in which area are their sim cards travelling.
Okay.
Yes, tell me.
Where are you?
I'm going to the designing class.
Where are you at this ven/ moment?
Santacruz.
Why?
These five mobile numbers..
Quickly track in which area they are.
- Yes, sir.
Hello?
Virat, my sister went for jogging in the morning.
Someone forced her into a car and left.
Yeah?
This number is not showing.
This..
Yes, Virat?
I was just about to call you.
Why?
What happened?
Out of those five girls one girl's number is already deactivated.
And another number just got deactivated.
I too received a phone call 45 minutes ago.
They kidnapped another girl.
Virat, we need a big police force for it.
Their families have filed police complaints.
Please don't get confuse now.
What are you going to do?
I'll tell you.
First you tell me where did that second cell phone get deactivated?
Four kilometres from where she studied, travelling towards south-Mumbai..
Her sim card was deactivated in Byculla.
And the girl who went missing before her..
Her sim card too was deactivated in Byculla.
Okay.
Do one thing.
Leave for Byculla.
I'll meet you on the way.
Listen Virat, let's call and immediately warn the rest of the three girls..
...not to get out of the house alone.
Look, don't do anything.
Don't ruin anything.
That sleeper cells' head is more important than those five girls.
Got it?
Now quickly leave that place.
- Hello, Virat?
Shit.
Hello?
My sister went to college in the morning to attend a seminar.
The fourth girl was also taken.
Hello?
Yes!
The fifth girl was also kidnapped!
Are you a human or a sadist?
Why are you so happy?
Five girls have been kidnapped.
You are not at all worried about them?
I know what is important for you.
Sleeper cells' head should come outside so that you can kill him.
Right?
Do you know what will happen if he is caught?
All the bomb blasts and terrorist acts happening in Mumbai..
...will stop for many years to come.
Got it?
But the lives of the five girls who have been kidnapped are at stake.
Think about them.
Think about their family.
I am not concerned about anything.
Will you say the same thing if someone from your family is kidnapped?
I told you, it makes no difference to me.
Anyway, out of those five girls one girl is my sister.
Got it?
All I know is..
...that that terrorist will keep all the kidnapped girls at one place.
We need to save them and also catch that scoundrel.
No, wait a minute.
P tee"?
In those five photos one boy's name was Sarfaraz.
I sent my sister in place of his.
Where are you at this ven/ moment?
Santacruz.
Why?
Do one thing.
Go to Rizwi college.
You know my team-mate Sarfaraz?
Take his sister's Scooty and come here.
Why should I get her Scooty?
Because I am asking you to.
Go and get it right away!
There's a 40% discount at Lewis.
Will you buy me three-fourth pants?
I'll buy you two instead.
Hurry up now.
Okay.
Have you lost your mind, Virat!
I just can't think straight.
I mean being her brother how can you do this?
Nothing will happen to her.
Not just her, nothing will happen to anyone.
Stop.
Stop here.
What's Pinkie doing over here?
Brother, this..
Brother, listen..
This is Preeti's stole.
And get a maroon top for me.
There should be embroidery done over here.
And I want mirror work over here.
Okay?
Medium size.
Okay?
Bye.
See you.
Okay, Virat.
I'll go and ask my informers.
Let's see.
Go!
Untie their hands.
Project the photos one by one.
Who knows him?
Who knows him!
He's my brother.
Go over there.
My uncle..
He's my brother.
Your brother?
No.
Your brother?
Project the next photo.
He's my brother.
Go over there.
Your brother is not in these five photographs?
No.
Show the group photos one by one.
Is your brother there in this photograph?
That's him.
He?
No.
He?
Yes.
Who asked you to drive the Scooty of the girl we were going to kidnap?
My brother.
Yes?
The operation is successful.
We know the team of those 12 people.
One member of that team sent his sister in place of another.
I've discarded the sim cards from the phones of all the girls.
He has no chance of finding out where we are.
No, no, no!
He is not a fool.
If he can send his sister then he must've found a way to reach you.
He will find you.
What are you saying?
!
Kill the girls and vacate the place before he finds you.
Right away!
Tie these four girls!
Okay.
And bring this girl over here.
Hurry up!
Come on!
Come with me!
Set up the camera.
Bring them here.
Hurry up.
Make her sit!
Silence.
He is here.
He is trying to kill everyone.
Turn around.
Come on!
Come on!
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
I'll drop guys in a taxi.
If cops ask whether you saw anything say that it was too dark.
You couldn't see my face.
Understood?
Okay?
- Yes.
Come on, get into the car.
Come on, fast.
Purposely!
You got me trapped purposely, didn't you!
He was holding such a big knife over here!
A little movement and he would've severed my head!
We could catch him because we placed your life at risk!
You should have risked your own life!
Why me?
What had I done?
Why?
Can't you civilians sacrifice your lives?
Should only military and cops sacrifice theirs?
You just want to sit on your sofa and watch news channels.
And pass comments like..
"These cops should do this."
"No, the militan/ is wrong.
They should do this"
You never want to do anything on your own.
What would've happened if I would've got shot in the crossfire?
What would've happened?
You would've lost your life.
What else could've happened?
Yeah, right, I would've lost my life.
Free", when those terrorists who intend to kill thousands.
...are ready to sacrifice their lives then why can't we?
Think about it.
Now look, because of you that main guy was caught, alive.
He isn't the main terrorist.
Someone called him up and ordered.
After that he took out the knife.
What's this?
Nail cutter.
What are you doing over here?
That day you left in the middle hence I came here.
Don't ever come up from behind me and startle me again.
Why?
There could've been someone else with me in this room.
Sandbag, dumbbells..
You workout as well.
Not bad.
You know I read this in a forwarded message..
That 40 calories are burned during a deep kiss.
That's equal to 30 minutes of brisk walking.
20 minutes of swimming, 10 minutes of skipping and 5 minutes of..
You want a kiss?
Then ask for it directly.
Don't beat around the bush.
Forward message, science of construction, email..
These are vacuous things.
Anyway, I very well know how girls like you are.
You want it but you blame us for it.
"You know, you know, you know, that boy is so mean!"
"You know I just hate him."
Useless.. - "My mom.."
Now that you are here why just 40..
...let's burn 80 calories.
Or 160?
Or 240?
By morning we both will be sporting six-packs.
Not here.
Let's go over there.
Now who is concerned about the location?
I am.
Close your eyes.
If I close my eyes, you will run away.
I won't.
Who is it?
I told you!
I think mom's here!
Go and open the door, I'll go hide in this cupboard.
Not there!
Not there!
Not there!
Not there!
It contains my knickers.
Do one thing.
You hide here!
Hide in here.
Hey..
- HUT"!
UP!
Hurry..
Climb up!
Just take a deep breath.
Did you watch the television?
What's the score?
Stop the drama.
I just saw what you did.
16 people are dead.
All of them were sleeper cells.
Everyone had perfectly normal jobs.
Now the difficult job is to convince their family.
Because none of them are ready to believe that.
This is what I expected from them.
Did you find out anything about the head of the sleeper cell?
I knew it!
I was sure that you'll bring him along!
But he isn't the head.
We still haven't found him.
Oh..
Why is he coughing like a girl?
What happened?
Are you alright?
Another sleeper cell?
You aren't used to keeping books and clothes in the cupboard?
Say hi to him.
Hi.
- Hi.
You are going to marry him?
Yes.
Wonderful.
He's half mad.
You are half mad.
Kids will be fully mad.
He's feeling shy!
"My head seems a little poetic!"
"My head seems a little poetic!"
"It keeps soaring high, doesn't desire to perch."
"My head seems a little poetic!"
"lt's spoilt, doesn't desire to ameliorate."
"My head seems a little poetic!"
"It keeps searching for you."
"It keeps looking for you in my thoughts."
"It takes me whenever there's even a shadow of you."
"It keeps searching for you."
"It keeps looking for you in my desires."
"Wherever it finds you, it worships you."
"My head seems a little poetic!"
"My head seems a little poetic!"
"Sought you in the morning.."
"Called out to you in the evening."
In the evening."
"More than my own, chanted your name."
"Your name."
"You have now become, a pan of my conversations."
"It seems to be in love."
"My head seems a little poetic!"
"You are my silence."
"You are my voice too."
"My voice too."
"You are solitude."
"You are my company too."
"My company too."
"How did this happen?"
"I didn't realise it."
"It seems a little crazy."
"My head seems a little poetic!"
'Today, in Andheri West, a man's dead body was found near a gutter.'
'His fingers were abscised.'
'His body was bruised.'
'According to the police, he was tortured before he was killed.'
'His name is said to be Aasif Ali.'
This is related to the death of 12 sleeper cells.
The bomb blasts on 27th September..
He killed him because he didn't get any information.
The one you are looking for is one of these 12 people.
He is a cold-blooded murderer.
Instigate him.
Plan something big.
A powerful attack.
He will show himself.
Show him the power of sleeper cells.
Do one thing, mom.
Go ahead, I'll be there soon.
Hurry up.
- Yes, I'm coming.
Let's finish this game.
I want you.
Alive.
Call your team-mate Kapil.
He is at the R-city mall.
Tell him the building he is in is going to blast in 10 seconds.
Hey!
Listen!
Hey, Virat!
How are you?
Kapil!
Where are you?
I'm out with my family.
But where are you?
R-city mall.
Kapil, take your family and leave that place right away.
There's a bomb over there.
Chocolate.
- Get out of there.
Chocolate?
- What are you saying?
Kapil, I said, the bomb is going to blast in five seconds.
Get out of there!
There are a lot of people here.
Inform everybody and leave!
Kapil!
Kapil, don't think!
Just get out of there!
Heard that?
How was the sound?
That's not all.
I know exactly where the rest of the 11 people are.
Because each one of them is being followed by a sleeper cell.
You want to check?
Monty Baggha, Juhu Beach.
Yogesh, Hanuman Temple.
Jigar Gill, COD Mulund.
Chirag Sethi, Mithibai College.
Sarfaraz, Sea-face, Caner Road.
Vishal, PVR Kurla.
Lalit, Phoenix Mall.
Sandeep Sachdeva, Andheri Market.
Abhay Shukla, Mount Man] Church.
Virat Bakshi, Bandra Market.
And Siddhanh, Goregaon Station.
Now let me blow up the next one.
Virat Bakshi, who is at the Bandra Market.
There will be a blast over there in the next three seconds.
Three..
Two..
One!
Boom!
Got scared?
You got scared huh?
I didn't place a bomb over there.
I don't want them dead.
I want you.
I need you.
Okay.
You want me, right?
I'll come to you.
Don't harm anyone else.
Good decision.
Get ready.
How are you?
- Hello, Virat!
Great!
- See you later.
What is this place?
Who are they?
We all know those who die in border war and counter terrorism.
They are the army officers who are handicapped during war.
No one knows them.
In every field, if you work sincerely, you get promoted.
But only in army and police..
You get retirement.
And that's a shame.
Hi, Virat.
- Hi.
Even/things ready.
Hello, everyone.
Hi.
- Hi.
How are you guys?
Fine.
- Good.
- Great.
I've already spoken to all of you over the phone.
The time we have been waiting for has come.
We are going to execute an assignment together.
Tomorrow morning, I am going to meet the head.
The one who controls the sleeper cells.
At that moment no one can follow me because they'll keep an eye on me.
Before meeting him, I'm going to insert a tracking chip in my body.
That chip will indicate my movements.
And you will be communicating everything to him.
Okay?
I've very secretly called for cyclonite explosive that we use in the army.
We will get it by this evening.
With that we will make C-4 plastic explosive.
After making it you'll give it to Joel.
Joel, you'll be in touch with Mukund.
Mukund, you keep telling him where they are taking me.
I am sure they'll take me to an isolated place.
No one knows why he wants me alive.
I am sure there must be a reason behind it.
Exactly 15 minutes after I meet the sleeper cells' head..
...that bomb should explode, Joel.
It is your responsibility.
Along with me, those who order sleeper cells will also die.
After that all sleeper cells will become coma cells.
They will never receive any order.
It's like a suicide attack.
Boom!
What kind of a joke is this, Virat!
You are talking about suicide and they are applauding.
What's happening, man!
He is a very dangerous man.
Fine.
But why do you need to sacrifice your life?
You too have a family.
Think about them!
They too had a family...!
Those who were killed during the Taj attack.
They too left at night telling their kids that they'll be back by morning.
Hemant Karkare, Vijay Salaskar, Ashok Kamte..
Sandeep Unnikrishnan, Sashank Shinde, Tukaram Omble.
They too had a family.
Their dead bodies reached home.
Have you thought about their families?
He talks about family!
Here..
look at them!
Some don't have a spinal cord.
Some don't have legs.
Some don't have hands.
Some are blind.
But still, they are happy.
They too have a family.
An army man couldn't get a better opportunity.
When those terrorists who intend to kill thousands are ready..
...to sacrifice their lives then why can't we, the protectors do that?
Mukund, I came to this decision after giving it a lot of thought.
If you want to do something for me..
My family is a little naive when it comes to the ways of the world.
I have two sisters.
Whenever you can spare some time, do visit them.
There's just four days left the engagement.
And all of a sudden you don't want to go ahead with.
It doesn't need to happen now.
We'll see when I come next.
But we are getting married next year.
We were just getting engaged.
But that's not needed either.
First you said that you don't like me.
Then you said you like me.
And now, once again..
Do you even really like me?
Don't you understand?
I said no, didn't I?
Not now.
Will you be able to forget me?
I won't be able to do it.
My man is standing next to you.
Where is he?
He's clean.
Hello..
Can you see an Indigo car, 3525, across the road?
Get in it.
Straight ahead, black Honda City, 7087.
Take it to Bombay Stock Exchange.
You must be wondering..
Why haven't I still killed you?
What's my plan?
You don't know, do you?
I'll tell you.
The cars you parked..
Do you know what was in them?
I won't blow them up.
I'll inform the police.
Then the question that shall arise will be who planted them.
Then..
While the police will be looking for you..
I would've already killed you and your 10 team-mates.
Rather according to the police, to kill you..
And to defuse the time bomb at the right time.
Do you know who will take the credit of it?
Look at this.
Mr. Alwyn Dsouza.
Joint Secretary of Defence.
Not just that, the 12 sleeper cells whom you have killed..
The credit of that as well will go to the Joint Secretary of Defence.
And with that he will get promoted.
And he will become the Secretary of Defence.
Virat, there are sleeper cells all across India..
...except in the Indian army.
But with this, we will recruit sleeper cells in the Indian army as well.
Then we shall do everything we want to.
'I'll anyhow have to get out of here!
'
'I cannot die.'
'Sleeper cells in the Indian army..'
'It's like cancer for our country.'
Any death wish?
Any last wishes?
I don't want you to use your gun to kill me.
Did you hear that?
I, too, don't want to use my gun to kill you.
Hit me.
Indian army!
Uncuff my hands and then hit me.
What did you say?
Uncuff my hands and then hit me.
Listen!
You boss is hitting me while my hands are cuffed.
And when I asked him to uncuffthem, he's thinking.
You've already broken my arms and legs.
You have so many men who have weapons with them.
And yet, you are scared.
You should be scared.
You should be scared.
Now laugh!
Laugh!
Laugh now!
You are scared to uncuff my hands and then hit me, aren't you?
I like this fear.
What are you doing, brother?
Just shoot him.
Shoot him.
He's very clever.
Heed my advice, just shoot him.
You cannot defeat him.
I mean..
Uncuff him.
What is he doing, brother?
- I don't know.
They will fight each other to death, brother.
Order me to shoot.
- No!
Absolutely not!
No!
I say you shoot both of them!
Shoot them!
We don't have any other option left!
Shoot both of them.
Drop your weapons into the sea.
Hurry Up-
You..
Give me my handcuffs.
My watch..
Come on..
You are not smart
Why?
Even if you kill me..
...that ship contains all the network details to control the sleeper cells.
There are people who will continue this.
Wait.
Three..
Two..
One..
Boom!
You didn't understand, did you?
You should die in suspense.
If he would've said he liked the girl the day he had come..
...we would got them married before he left.
It's the same here.
But no one listens to us.
This boy I tell you..
Sir..
- He will never be serious in life.
Take care.
They make a superb couple, don't they, sir?
You know, the reason they are together today is me?
You, sir?
Yes.
Sir, the day we came here and his father took him away in a hurry..
That was to introduce him to this girl.
He rejected her.
Then she rejected him.
And when they both consented.
Some idiot came in the middle and confused everything.
But now everything is fine, sir.
But sir, why did you say that you are the reason they are together?
The story you told me..
Sir.
The idiot you mentioned in it..
Yes, sir.
That's 'ME'.
Come to the camp..
Yes, sir.
I'll hang the two of you upside down.
No, sir..
Truly, army is great.
For the next 11 months, on a snow-clad mountain.
Or in a desert, making your own tent, cooking your own food..
Thinking about these 40-days holiday..
Keep looking at the family photo tucked in the wallet.
This is how you'll have to live, right?
I'll miss you.
- Take care.

Listen to me..

I'll see you guys later!
- Hurry up!
I'll talk to you later.

Just come with us.
Get inside.
Get inside the taxi.
Let's go.
- Keep the bags there.
Yes, over here.
- Get in.
Come on.
Hit the third gear, sir.
What's the hum], dad?
Where are we going?
Don't you know?
Otherwise, why would I be asking you?
Shut up and listen.
We are going to see a bride for you.
The auspicious time ends in 23 minutes.
After 5:00pm the alignment of the stars will change.
And Shraddha period begins from tomorrow.
No one will introduce their daughter to you after that.
We need to see this girl before that.
Otherwise, you idiot will always remain single.
Mom, I'll go wearing my military outfit?
So what?
Let's go home, rest, eat, freshen up and then go.
You are not getting any younger, son.
A single day won't change my age.
Quiet, all of you.
Sorry.
- Hit the fourth gear, sir.
It's a taxi, and not an aeroplane, sir.
We've reached.
- Your destination.
They are here.
Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome.
- Welcome.
Hi.
- Hello.
Hello.
Your son didn't come with you?
He is my son.
His clothes suggest he has just returned from a battlefield.
Let's go.
- This way.
Let's go.
This way.
Please come.
Three wickets down at the door itself.
Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome.
Jai Hind.
Have a seat.
Please have a seat.
Oh.
You are late.
Look at this..
Couldn't help it.
The train got delayed.
Close the buttons at least.
- We couldn't have driven it.
Did you have any trouble finding out house?
No, not at all.
We needed to see the girl before the auspicious hour ends.
That's why we brought him here directly from the station.
Please Call her.
Yes, of course.
Call her.
Yes.
Saiba.
Saiba!
Sister!
She's Saiba?
Oh, thank God.
Thank you.
Saiba sings well.
What would you like to hear?
Any nice song will do.
Look at his clothes,
'Jana Gena Mane' sounds pefiem.
She's nice, isn't she?
Do you have her phone number?
"Her!" Already!
0226276..
- Just a minute, mom.
022..
789.
Hello?
Hi, I am Virat.
Silence!
That boy has called.
Yes, son?
Uncle, I wanted to say that your daughter is very beautiful.
Oh!
- Beautiful.
But it seems that we have different tastes.
I don't think we will make a good match.
But I pray that you find someone better than me.
Sorry for the trouble.
Stupid!
What's your problem!
Forget it!
I don't think he will never get married!
Why didn't you like her!
Give me at least one reason!
Not one, I have three reasons.
What?
- What?
- What?
She plait is a metre long and then some.
That's not an excuse.
- So what?
Girls with hair longer than 6 inches take 1V2 hours to get their hair done.
In her case, she will take six hours!
I'll have to wait the whole day to go for a party.
Did I tell you?
Did I ask you to get me married?
Did I?
!
Secondly..
She is very shy and timid.
Saw that?
She raised her hand on her father.
You should have been strict from the beginning.
"Hit papa!
Hit papa!"
You got her into this habit.
And what's the third reason?
And the third reason is that I want a stylish girl.
An impressive girl.
She looks like she has just come from a village.
Hey!
What.
What are you doing?
Hey!
Why do you need so much money?
I served coffee to six people.
This is a tip for that.
Hey..
- Bye!
According the post-modem report.
This woman committed suicide by setting herself on fire.
Impossible.
This isn't a suicide.
It's murder.
Soles of who commit suicide by setting themselves on fire never burn.
This..
- Her soles are burnt.
Someone killed her, made her lie down..
Pour an accelerant on her, started a fire and declared it as suicide.
Your case is solved.
Just find the murderer.
You started already?
When I came to know that you are coming..
I thought of taking a leave and going to Madgaon.
But my luck simply..
My leave wasn't approved.
Just say that I trouble you.
Why are you beating around the bush?
Oh really?
I should just say it?
Virat, you take a holiday and come here even] year.
Yes, I do.
You spend your days with me.
Yes, I do.
You meddle in my affairs.
Yes, I do.
Whenever I am about to get promoted to being an inspecton.
You ruin my chances and I get stuck at being a sub-inspector.
Listen..
I'll no longer meddle in your affairs.
Happy?
You won't face any problems.
Just a minute.
Here.
Solve it.
What's happening?
A sports tournament.
We're providing security for it.
Hi, Rocky!
Hi, Rocky!
Let's go.
Do you want to provide security?
Do you want to hang out with him?
Rocky is retiring tomorrow.
Today is his last day on duty.
He is very smart.
A few days back there was an article on him in the Mumbai Mirror.
What's wrong with his paw?
He broke a bone during practice.
Department doesn't need him because he has a broken bone.
So they are retiring him.
Strange, isn't it?
You are looked after only till the time you are needed.
From tomorrow he will be a street dog.
Can I take Rocky with me tomorrow?
Sure.
Fine.
I'll take him in.
Fantastic.
- Bye, Rocky.
Security is perfect?
- Yes, sir.
Don't let anyone in without proper ID.
- Okay, sir.
Mukund..
- Yes?
There's a lot of beauty here.
Control your emotions.
I'm on duty.
Yes, sir.
Not so seriously.
Control.
Beauty reminds me, we went to see a girl yesterday.
How was she?
Don't ask.
I got so bored!
Just don't ask!
Intercollegiate boxing championship is about to begin.
We first call upon, Saiba Thapar from St. Xavier's college, Mumbai!
She is very delicate.
V9"!
Shy type, you know..
You know the rules.
Box.
Come on, Saiba.
Don't give up!
Come on, Saiba!
Saiba, you can do it!
You can do it, Saiba!
- Saiba!
Come on, Saiba!
Better focus!
I don't like this girl at all!
One, two..
Three, four..
Five, six..
Seven, eight.
Nine, ten!
And the winner is, Saiba Thapar!
You should marry someone like her.
Saiba!
Saiba!
Saiba!
Right?
- She is the girl I met that day.

No!
No!
Absolutely not!
Earlier you sought three faults in her.
Now you feel that she is the moon.
Mom, how will a phone call make any difference to you?
Your son will get a chance to settle down.
Try and understand.
Just one phone call.
Happy birthday, mom,
I celebrated my birthday last month.
And you are giving me a gift today!
That too a dog!
- Please, mom.
Consider it a belated birthday gift.
Mom..
Your pencil.
Hey, make the phone call, please.
Just one call for your brother.
- No.
Please?
See.
Happy birthday-
I hate dogs!
Both of you, get out of here!
Is this a joke?
He didn't like me the other day.
Now he likes me.
Will it do if again after marriage he says he doesn't like me?
Look, you got your first proposal when you were 13.
I've been getting text messages since I was 10!
Like you, I too have rejected many.
You know, I used to get loads of text messages when I turned 18.
Then as my age progressed the number of text messages declined.
Now the only text messages I get are from customer care and call centres.
Look, you should display some attitude but then you should give in.
Got it?
Anything you say won't make any difference to me.
Oh God.
You go to buy one article and you end up buying plenty.
To go shopping with your wife..
A person gets bored to death.
Please don't get married, Virat.
I am telling you.
Hey, this..
Man] Kom..
Isn't she the same boxer?
Handsome.
He's hot.
Say hi to him.
He's the one I rejected.
What are you doing?
Look"
Hey!
I'll fall down!
This is a police bike.
I am on duty.
Hey..
Get down!
What happened?
- Get down!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay!
- How dare he!
Move aside!

So what?
Push it.

If only you wouldn't have rejected her..
My bike won't have lost its mirror.

Why did you run?
Yes?
Why did you run?
Why are you looking over there?
Hey..
Hey!
We gathered all the information.
We knew that we would catch him one day.
Very soon I'll catch all the terrorists behind this attack.
Don't worn].
Mumbai is safe as long as I am here.
I have worked day and night and caught this terrorist.
And it's assumed, their aim wasn't to blow up just one bus.
They have a hidden agenda behind this.
And we need to find that out.
viral.
Let's go and give an interview.
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Not there.
Let's go this way.
'Sir, it's often seen that the Mumbai police..'
'..has been unable to capture the terrorists behind the blasts.'
'Even if they capture them.'
Instead of questioning him, they are giving him VIP treatment.
Let me assure you, I can die for the people of this country.
He's blabbering as if he is the one who caught him.
Actually, I should've been there.
But you dragged and brought me here.
Let me assure you, I won't rest in peace till this case isn't solved.
If I would've been on TV..
First of all, my mother-in-law would've been stunned.
I would've gained a lot of respect.
I would've become an inspector.
Very soon the will be brought before the law.
'Among those who died in the bus bomb blast included women and children.'
'According to the police, the terrorist caught, Aseem Lala, is behind it.'
'They also state that there can be other terrorist organisations behind it.'
'But this has still not been confirmed.'
'Police state that the terrorists behind it won't be spared.'
'Home ministry has recommended formation of a high level investigation team.'
'And also assured that the security is being tighten up.'
'Those behind these attacks.'
Patil, I need someone at the back-street.
Okay, sir.
He is here.
What is it?
- We were waiting for you.
Let's go.
Come inside.
This is Virat's house.
Do as you have been briefed.
Okay, sir.
You are all on unofficial duty.
Set your Walkies to a different channel.
What is it, Makiya?
At this hour?
They will be here tonight, for security.
Do one thing.
Take your family somewhere tomorrow morning.
Just for a few days.
Why?
What happened?
That terrorist escaped from the hospital.
What?
Yes.
He killed a doctor and two of my cops.
But how?
I don't know.
In spite of so much security.
You got him arrested.
So he could come here and attack you.
That's why they are here.
Don't worn].
Go to sleep.
I'll make a move.
Keep YOU!
' eyes open, GUYS!
Rocky..
Yes, sir.
I have sent Tawde and Patil to Gate No. 2.
I have never seen so much security being given by police.
Hey!
Hurry up!
Catch him!
He must have gone straight ahead.
Sun/avanshi, where are you?
Wait.
I am coming.
- Okay, sir.
Hurry up!
Tambe, this way!
What wrong did those innocent kids do to you?
You know why did I sever your finger without first questioning you?
Because now I am going to ask you a question.
And if you don't answer me, you know the consequences.
One question.
One second.
If you don't answer me..
Another finger.
Someone helped you escape from the hospital.
Who was it?
ACP Ashok Gaikwad.
So simple.
Who is it?
It's me.
What do you want at this hour of the night?
Leave.
We'll talk in the morning.
I want to talk to you now.
Come on the terrace.
I told you to leave.
We'll talk in the morning.
Leave.
Look, your friend's picture.
The one you helped escape is a guest in my house.
Sorry I didn't tell you who I am.
My name is Virat.
Indian Army.
Not just that.
D.l.A.
Defence Intelligence Agency.
I am a specialist over there.
A secret agent with the army.
My friends who work with me don't know about this.
Not even my family knows about this.
Why am I telling you all this?
I am sure this is what you are thinking about.
It's because you won't live.
When we are at the border..
...our enemy shoots us and we shoot them.
This is what generally happens.
One day, in our camp, a man named Ashraf..
He was from Sholapur.
He just disappeared suddenly.
Even after searching for seven days, we couldn't find him.
We found him on the eighth day.
He was stuck at the enemy camp.
They tortured him for seven days.
They had gouged out his eyes.
They shoved a beer bottle into his rare.
And then, they broke that bottle.
They were very cruel to him.
We had taken his dead body to his house.
His mother was crying and father was wailing.
His sister was screaming, yelling..
His family was in a very bad state.
But on the tenth day, his younger brother joined the military.
We die at the border even/day.
...so that you can live peacefully with your families.
This is a locally made gun.
This is my gun.
If I shoot you,
I'll have to tell everyone why I did so.
Your family will express their disgust over your dead body.
Your kids will beg at the signal.
Your wife will sell herself on the streets at night.
And if you shoot yourself, it will be considered as on-duty suicide.
Someone from your family will get a job.
They will get the provident fund money.
Pension will reach home every month, on time.
Now you decide which gun do you wish to pick.
And yes, if the barrel of this gun points towards me then I'll shoot you.
You are challenging a very big threat.
A shot was fired.
- The sound came from the terrace.
I think from over there.
- From the terrace.
I know that you and the ACP don't know everything.
'Juhu.
Bandra.
Dharavi..'
'Dadar.
Bombay Central. .'
'Blasts at 12 places in Mumbai.'
When?
On 27th.
Time?
4:00pm.
Looking beautiful?
- Very beautiful.
Came from Jalandhar and made a Maharashtrian fall for her.
Really!
- She is very smart!
He is naive.
You're looking gorgeous.
Thank you so much.
- Congratulations.
Hi.
- Thank you so much.
Thanks for coming.
Listen..
Listen!
- What?
Come with me.
I have doubt.
Doubt?
Do you think this is a mathematical class?
Come with me.
I need to ask you something.
Please try to understand, I am getting married.
After some time.
Listen, my head will explode if you won't come with me.
Come with me, now!
Let's see.
I have plans but..
Excuse me.
Can you please hold this?
Let's go.
Congratulations.
What!
The college beauty contest that I won..
You lost but you were the second runner up.
Okay.
Continue.
You have Hrithik, John and Salman's posters in your hostel room.
So what?
Then why are you getting married to this baldy?
Look, there are no more than 10 film stars.
But there are 30 crores girls in India.
So think practically.
The good looking guys aren't smart
And the smart ones don't look good.
Listen..
And what about those who are smart and good looking?
Beg, plead and get married to him.
30"'!
-
Howzat!
What's troubling you, Makiya?
There's something that I cannot understand.
Try me.
I might be able to help.
In spite of being a cop, I cannot understand.
How will you understand?
Why?
I am a militan/ man.
Do you know the basic difference between a cop and a military man?
What?
As soon as someone says "Attention!"..
A military man stands stiff, like this.
When he gets shoot orders, he starts firing without thinking.
But it's not so with us.
We need to use our brains.
I mean if we need to catch a pickpocket, we need to think like one.
If we need to catch a murderer, we need to think like one.
And if we need to catch a terrorist.
You need to think like one.
No, you sometimes need to become a terrorist.
Oh, my God.
But in this case, even a cop's brain has stopped working.
Then how can you help me?
Still, try me.
I'll try to solve this to be best of my ability.
Tell me.
What's the problem?
Fine.
It goes like this.
The terrorist escaped from the hospital.
He did.
That very night a cop committed suicide in his house.
That cop was posted at the hospital from where the terrorist escaped.
Now these two incidents are related, this is what a cop thinks.
Now tell me what a military man thinks.
I think this isn't a suicide, it's a murder.
How can you say that?
Because I committed this murder.
Why did you do it?
Why did he help that terrorist escape from the hospital?
Escape from the hospital.
How do you know that?
The terrorist told me.
Where did you find the terrorist?
That day in the hospital, you..
What?
Hospital..
Hey!
Hi.
What are you..
- Hi.
Can we talk...?
You don't..
Yes?
Can I marry you?
Marriage?
When did you get that idea?
This morning. 8:40am.
What happened at 8:40am?
My friend got married.
The most beautiful girl in the college.
But the guy she is getting married to is not at all good looking.
So, I asked her, why is she getting married to him?
She said sometimes some things don't match.
And you know how difficult it is to find a good guy these days.
So my friends too advised me..
And I thought that why won't we get married!
I hope you very well know that from the very beginning..
...nothing seems to match between you and me.
First I rejected you then you rejected me.
Now you are giving your consent.
- I am just saying yes.
Yes, but nothing matches.
Right?
Do you smoke cigarettes?
Smoking?
Yuck, I don't do all that.
Anyway, it's not allowed in boxing.
Saw?
But I like girls who smoke.
I like the fragrance of tobacco.
Oh yes..
It's not like I have never done it.
Sometimes, you know, girls, parties..
It happens.
Nice.
Nice.
Do you drink?
Drinks?
Alcohol?
Yes, red wine.
You know, good for the head, good for the skin.
Sometimes even vodka!
But I hate girls who drink.
I just cannot bear the sight of girls drinking.
I can't understand why do they drink?
Why are you crying?
You are saying this on purpose.
On purpose?
- I know that you love me.
Saiba..
Saiba, listen to me.
I...
I..
You..
I came here straight from the wedding.
I didn't even eat!
- I'll feed you.
I am just joking!
- Joking?
I am just joking, come on!
If you don't believe me then let's go to the temple outside and get married.
But there's a problem.
Now what's the problem?
Because I was angry with you".
I said okay to the next boy my parents introduced me to.
You said okay?
Yes, it's not a big deal to say okay and then say not okay.
But you said okay to him and then you said the same okay to me.
No, no, no.
The okay I said to you is different.
The okay I said to him is different.
He too is a military man.
A military man?
If we somehow convince him not to go ahead with this marriage..
Then our job will be done.
He'll be at the coffee shop at 12 o'clock.
Let's do one thing.
Let me accompany you.
Let's meet him.
You'll come with me?
He is going to come over here?
Yes.
Please wait here.
Okay.
Stay here, I'll go inside and talk to him.
You stay here.
I'll go and talk to him.
Come inside when I ask you to.
Excuse me..
Excuse me, the gentleman with the flower.
Please turn around.
Turn.
Yeah?
Sir!
LC58664, Captain Virat reporting, sir!
Virat!
What's going on?
You gave such a salute to me that I felt as if I am on the parade ground.
I am sorry, sir.
The girl I am going to marry is coming here to meet me.
I have never been married before.
It's my first time.
I am a little nervous.
Hi...
How are you?
Stupid!
'.
How do I say it?
Hi.
Hi.
Hi!
Come, come, come.
Sit, sit, sit.
You too like me, that's what your mother told me.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Saiba, Virat.
We are in the same battalion.
He is very junior to me.
Okay.
He keeps on making mistakes and hence keeps getting punished.
He is very scared of me.
Virat..
Sir!
- Saiba.
Hello, madam.
Madam?
I've kept a get-together at the hotel in the evening.
A small party, you see.
- Oh.
You must come.
Yeah.
Virat..
- I'll be there, sir.
Thank you.
Now, it's 12:30pm.
We were going to meet 12 o'clock.
30"'!
-
I'm very punctual.
I'm a military man, you see.
Of course.
So, we'll meet at the party in the evening?
Yes.
Virat..
- Yes, sir!
IC58..
Not in a public place.
See you in the evening.
Sorry, sir.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Virat!
Sir!
Is this how you were going to talk?
Sorry, madam, but you are going to get married to him.
He left.
Why are you addressing me as madam?
We love each other, don't we?
We broke up.
We started loving just an hour back.
Already break up?
Look madam, he is better than me in everything.
Do you know?
To complete a 400meter race I take 52 seconds.
He takes 48 seconds.
In high jump..
You know I can jump 6 feet high.
He jumps 6 feet 4 inches high.
In long jump, I hold a record of 7 meters.
He has a record of 7.4.
In weight lifting he..
Am I selecting candidates for military?
I don't like him.
That's it.
You didn't like me when we met for the first time, right?
Then you started liking me, didn't you?
You met him for the first time today, so you don't like him.
You will like him in near future.
That was different and this is different.
He is my senior and I'll have to give this sacrifice.
And I am the only thing you can sacrifice?
Your phone's ringing.
It's yours.
Smart!
Hello?
Tell me, where did you meet that terrorist?
I'll tell you that later.
We need to do something important tomorrow.
Okay?
Hey, Vi..
Strange!
What are you doing over here?
Don't you know why I am here?
Don't ever come to my room unannounced.
There's something called as privacy.
Once again I ask you, where did you meet that terrorist?
Here.
Hey..
He ran away from the hospital.
How did you catch him?
You remember we went to the hospital?
Then you went to sleep, but I stayed back.
I knew he would do something.
Hey, but..
You cannot keep him like this.
You'll have to hand him over to the police.
So that he can once again run away?
No.
But we'll find out how many people are working with him and..
Let that to me.
Why are you injecting him with this?
Say something.
Why are you untying him?
Virat!
What...?
What's going on?
You ask too many questions!
And you are answering none of them!
Will someone tell me what's happening here?
What have you injected him with?
Nothing.
It's just Ketamine.
He will remain unconscious for two hours.
That's it.
And where are you going wearing this coat?
I'm going to attend a wedding.
Wedding f?
My batch-mate is getting married.
What will you do over here?
You are free, so come along.
Come with me.
You'll get free food.
Come with me.
But you have untied his hands and legs!
Let's go. - ls everything alright?
Yes, man.
What do I tell you!
How's everyone at home?
- Yes.
Fine.
All well.
Sister-in-law is fine too.
My son has started going to school.
Hi, guys.

We are getting late.
Hurry up.
Everyone has been waiting for you.
Hi!
Hi!
Let me first go meet uncle.
Hello, uncle.
Hello, aunty.
Hey, Virat!
You are looking very smart!
- Thank you.
- How are you?
What about your marriage?
I heard something went wrong.
Yes, there was confusion during our first meeting.
So we broke it off.
What do I say?
Who is he?
Oh, he..
I forgot.
He's my friend..

Yes, Mukund Deshmukh.
Sub-inspector of police.
Bandra East.

Guys, the bridegroom is calling you.
Come, guys.
Come and join us.
Let's go.
He is calling us.

Congratulations.
Your love story was successful.

Hi, Virat.
Hi, Siddhanh.
Let's get a group photograph clicked.
Come on.
Come on.

Thank you so much.
You will know once you go there?
What are you doing?
Alright, GUYS-
He's saying something.
- Listen.
Listen.
Virat is saying something.
It's been a long time.
Let's play a game.
What do you say?
A game?
Come on, man!
He wants to play games in the camp, when the train stops.
And now even at a wedding, he wants to play a game.
This is a real game.
Real game?
!
Yes.
Fine, then the six of us will be one team and you six be the other.
What do you say?
All of us are in one team.
All of us in one team?
- Yes.
There is no opponent?
But what are the rules?
I'll tell that later.
Fine.
But after winning, you'll give all of us a party.
Yes.
- Yes.
- You'll have to give a party.
Okay.
Okay, let's go.
Guys, pay attention.
This is a little serious game.
You will soon know who our opponents are.
Can you see my house?
Look at it very carefully.
In two minutes, a guy will come out from the backdoor.
The 12 of us will follow him.
Understood?
- Yes.
After that when he meets another person we team will get divided into two.
Six people will follow the guy who will just come outside.
And six people will follow the guy he meets.
As these people keep meeting different people, our keep will keep getting divided.
Did you all understand?
- Yes.
Very good.
Remember, your cell phones should always be on.
Don't answer anyone's call except mine.
We 12 will have a conference call and stay connected.
Okay?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Let's wait for the man now.
He'll be here soon.
Is that him?
- That's the guy.
Yeah.
This is very risky.
It will be more risky if we don't do anything.
Stan the car and follow him.
Where did he go?
- He was just here.
Where is he?
We've lost him.
Where is he?
- There he is!
Over there.
Over there.
Drive slowly.
He got into a rickshaw.
Vishal, note the number.
M I-I-O3-AA-6221 .
He's accomplice is here.
Look..
Drive slowly.
What will we do if those 12 people don't split up?
They will have to, because they a job to finish at 12 places.
Stop the car.
Come on, boys.
- Come, come, come.
You all six..
Follow him.
Let's go.
Move.
We are following him.
Keep following him.
Copy that.
Move.
Move.
Stay on the line.
He's meeting another guy.
Stay alert Stay alert
All of you split.
We are following.
Copy that.
You follow him.
How many so far?
We are following the first guy.
- We are following the second guy.
We are following the new one.
Keep following.
He's walking right in front of me.
Stay alert
- Copy that.
Virat, we are following the first guy.
Another guy has joined.
Get in the train.
We are in the train.
Virat, they are splitting up.
Stay there.
Okay.
Well done.
Virat, Goregaon Station.
Wait for the high point.
The first guy is meeting a cell phone dealer.
Now they are separate.
You follow him.
He's meeting another guy.
All of you split.
Split now!
They are splitting up.
You follow him.
Stay connected.
It's target at sight.
I'm following the new one.
There is one for each of us now.
Virat, I'm at Dockyard Road.
Masjid Bandar.
I'm getting into a fern].
I'm at Dharavi.
I'm at Matunga.
Virat, he has gotten into a bus.
He's getting inside a mall.
- Yes.
I'm right behind him.
I'm at Bandra.
I'm in a fern].
I'm at Chembur.
I'm at Kurla.
Guys, we are 12 people for those 12 guys.
The game is going to end now.
I have kept something in your bags.
Check it out.
It's a gun.
Hey, it contains a gun.
It contains a gun.
Virat, this is a gun.
No one needs to panic.
I have placed that gun there.
There's a bomb in the bag of the guy you are following.
He's not an ordinary guy.
He has killed innocent women and children in our country.
He's a damn terrorist.
We need to do what we do at the border.
To keep a bomb at four places at the same time..
To cause serial blasts in train..
We too know their technique.
We need to show them that.
There shouldn't be a difference of even a second.
Shoot them at the same time.
Ready, get set, boys.
Yes.
We will do it.
Yes.
We will do it.
Three..
Two..
One..
Shoot!
He's dead.
I've left.
We'll do that.
When are you giving us party?
- I will.
I will.
What have you done!
- Finished.
End.
The dead body found at 11 places and the one found here..
They are sleeper cells.
They are even claimed to be terrorists.
They even found bombs in their bags.
According to the police..
All the cell phones found on sleeper cells are of high technology.
Looking at the magnitude of the preparations of these sleeper cells..
...one thing is for certain that Mumbai has been saved from a major disaster.
At the moment the biggest threat to this world are the sleeper cells.
What are they?
And who are they?
Look, in a terrorist world, these sleeper cells..
...are the one whose activities are most secretive.
Like the 12 men who were killed were kind of sleeper cells..
Yet they stayed among the common man..
...and prepared themselves for an attack.
The most important question.
Do these sleeper cells belong to a particular religion?
It's not always that they are related to religion.
When a country or a group want to plan a terrorist in our country"
They find people who hold a grudge, a feeling of revenge towards the government.
These people are found and prepared to execute a terrorist attack against us..
And seek their revenge.
After the 9/11 attack, all the secret agencies had one thing in mind..
That they should rid America of sleeper cells.
And they got rid of them in such a way that after the 9/11 attack..
...no attack of that kind or magnitude took place again in America.
Navin Chandra, Age: 29, killed in a BEST Bus.
Afsar Ali, Age: 31, killed at the Mumbai Central ST Stand.

We still don't know who did it
Even the police have no clue.
Any clues?
Police has confiscated all their things.
Just one non-tracker phone has been taken by a shooter.
Whose phone was it?
Afsar Ali, who got killed at Mumbai Central, near the ST Stand.
I don't know who you are, where you are.
You have killed 12 of my men.
One of them was my brother.
I am coming to you.
When I find you, I'll kill you.
I am waiting.
Hello.
Please come.
What's the height of this wall?
S ix feet.
They are excellent jumpers.
What was the speed of the bus?
Approximately 40km/hr.
They are good runners as well.
They can swim well too.
They have shot all the 12 people on their forehead.
A moving bus, crowded market, dark theatre..
Even from a distance of 20 meters they shot at the centre of the forehead.
They are trained shooters.
But they are not cops.
Was there anything common in these 12 people?
No.
But there was one thing common in them.
During enquin/ I found out that these 12 people were wearing suits while shooting.
What did you just say?
These 12 people were wearing suits while shooting.
This is something you should have told me sooner.
I thought it's very common to wear suits.
It's very common to wear suits in America, but not in India.
So they are people who wear suit-pants.
They can be waiters in a hotel.
Businessmen attending a board meeting.
They can be software engineers attending a seminar.
Advocates, marriage functions.
I need a list of all the seminars..
...and marriage functions that took place in Mumbai on the 27th.
The ones with dress code suit-pants.
You think you are very smart.
Instead of killing those 12 people if you would've caught them alive..
...then we would've got some information.
It's of no use.
Because they never know what the plan is.
What?
- Yes.
Those 12 people didn't even know each other.
What are you saying!
These people are called sleeper cells.
Whether you call them their heads or bosses..
Can be one, two or three..
They make the plan together.
And then they find people who are ready to sacrifice their lives.
And the ones who are ready to sacrifice their lives are called sleeper cells.
That's why it's no use capturing them.
Because they don't know anything.
So till these sleeper cells don't get orders from their boss they lead a normal life?
Exactly.
We won't even know where they are.
It can be our neighbour.
Or the one sitting next to us in a bus.
It can even be our courier boy.
It can be anyone.
So how do we destroy them?
There's one way to destroy them.
Kill their head or boss.
Once he is dead, their connection shall end.
And as the sleeper cells won't get any orders, they'll become dormant.
Just a minute!
But how will you find the head of the sleeper cells?
Who said I will find him?
He will find me.
What?
- Because of what I have done.
We killed 12 of his men..
- Yes.
He will surely attack us to seek revenge.
According to my plan, he will soon show himself.
But in a big city like Mumbai, how will he find you?
We killed his men?
Right.
We must've made some mistake.
We must've left some clue behind.
He will come out to look for the clue.
If we find out what that clue is we can capture him before he attacks.
Then get thinking about what that clue is.
Move that colourful thing..
What is it called?
Cube?
Move the cube, they will help you find out.
Right?
Because if you have left a clue behind..
You won't answer this call.
No!
Today you need to decide, friend or girlfriend.
Girlfriend.
- Good..
Hello?
Your sir has summoned us to his house.
Right away.
Okay, I am coming.
Hurry up.
- Yes, I'm coming.
Virat!
What are you doing?
Let's go inside..
Virat!
Jyoti..
Remain seated.
Sit.
She is Jyoti, my neighbour.
Hi.
She has been in love with me since childhood.
Sit.
After hearing the news that I am going to get married to you, she..
She was going to commit suicide.
We got her hospitalised.
It was a big problem.
Then I decided..
I am sorry, I will marry Jyoti.
I know..
This must've come to you as a huge shock.
I evoked love in your head, I made a mistake.
No more suicides.
Life is precious.
Now I have a question for the two of you.
Yes, sir.
You came here on a holiday, to get married.
Yes, sir.
Here..
And you wanted to marry a military man?
Yes.
Why don't the two of you get married?
But sir..
- Virat!
Don't act suspicious..
I loved her, but I never touched her.
That's by mistake.
Ask her!
Look, I can understand that it won't be easy for you to forget me.
Now what can I do?
It's not my fault that I am so handsome.
Yes, sir!
- Strange guy.
He stands up for anything I say.
Well, all the best.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Bye.
- Bye.
Thank you.
- Bye.
Come on, let's go.
Saiba..
Yeah?
Because we couldn't get married..
Never do this.
I'll m].
All the best.
Let's go.
Hurry Up-
Bye, sir.

What are you doing?
What...?
Where...?
Where are you taking me?
It's still.. the song is still playing.
"Blame the night."
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
Your body temperature seems high.
Today is our first date so..
You know the rules.
According to that you need to give your boyfriend whatever he asks for.
That's why I am a little scared.
But I don't want anything.
You brought me to such a nice club.
You spent a lot of money.
I am okay.
I am happy.
Come on, let's dance.
Idiot.
Suppose if you had asked for a kiss on our first date!
I would have to kiss you, right?
Yes, you will have to kiss me.
Saw?
This is what I feared.
I want a kiss.
So, what should I do now?
Nothing, just close your eyes.
I'll do whatever needs to be done.
Damn..
Yes?
Listen..
I found the clue which he will use to find us.
What?
I'll find out everything.
Okay?
Hey..
Idiot.
But how will he know we left from the church?
There was just one similarity in the shootout of those 12 people.
And that's their dress-code.
If he is very smart, he will come straight to the church.
Of all the functions that took place on the 27th in Mumbai..
...the wedding in this church is the only event that matches with our list.
Because the one who got married is a military man.
Yes?
The name of the bridegroom is William Maﬂin Joel.
Can we get his address?
Yes.
- Please.
Yes?
Joel's residence?
- Yes.
We are from the army.
His batch mates.
Okay!
Come, come, come.
Joel is on honeymoon.
Did you contact him on his mobile?
His phone was out of reach, uncle.
Oh!
Hill station.
I am sorry.
Come.
She's Joel's mom.
She's cannot speak.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
Come, sit.
I have brought a gift for Joel.
Oh, thank you very much.
God bless you.
What will you have to drink?
No, thank you, uncle.
Uncle, can we have a look at Joel's wedding album?
Why not!
I'll just get it.
That's great, madam!
You will give the address to any stranger?
Isn't it your duty to at least call his family and inform?
This isn't the time to argue.
Let's go.
Hurry up.
What do I say about.
- Let's get going.
No one is answering the phone at their residence.
He's Joel's school teacher.
And this is Joel's cousin.
They are Joel's batch-mates.
Uncle, there are five teams in this.
Yes, so far he has been to five camps.
That's why there are five teams.
Can I have a cup of coffee?
Oh yes, sure.
I'll just get it.
We got stuck at the last stage.
How will we know which team out of these five?
I will find out.
Boys, here's your coffee.
Thank you.
You returned so soon!
I couldn't find that medicine anywhere.
They are Joel's batch-mates.
They couldn't attend the wedding.
Welcome!
Welcome!
Welcome!
I'm Noel.
Joel's brother.
- Hi.
Sit.
Dad, did you give them coffee or something?
Yes.
- Oh great.
Okay.
Thanks for coming, guys.
In which camp was Joel with you?
Kashmir.
Which year?
2005.
Joel was in Delhi in 2005.
After that he never sewed in Kashmir.
Can I see your ID cards?
Can you show me your ID cards?
Show me.
May I see your ID cards?
Dad!
You are just too much!
You just let anyone enter the house!
What happened?
I asked them about work.
They don't know anything.
I hate smart people.
Show me!
Show me!
I need to leave a message for him.
They are smarter than I thought.
Why has these people circled?
Look"
To find out which one team out of these five shot those 12 people..
...he will pick one member from each team.
And he has circled those he will pick.
He is very smart.
Hello?
Hi, I'm Captain Virat Bakshi here.
Look, I want to tell you something.
According to our intelligence report your life is in danger.
Are you safe?
Yes, I am okay.
Are you sure?
Yes, there's no problem.
Please call me back on this number if you face any problem.
Please note down this number.
Okay.
Yes, Virat.
I am fine.
Yes, I am safe.
Yes Virat, I am fine.
I'll surely call you if there is any problem.
What?
All those who were circled are safe.
That's the problem.
It's not as we thought.
That means they are planning something else.
That can be dangerous.
Virat.
Amar Singh here.
Someone has kidnapped my niece.
When?
She went to the yoga class in the morning, but still hasn't returned.
They took her saying that we have sent a car from home.
File a complaint in your area's police station immediately.
Don't worn].
Nothing will happen.
Hurry up.
Go.
Yes, Vi rat?
You cannot get any information by torturing an army man.
That's why they are kidnapping the girls in their family.
Bloody cowards.
Why?
To find out which team killed those 12 terrorists.
...they'll kidnap the girls and threaten the family on the phone.
They will blackmail them.
I'm sending you the numbers of the 5 guys..
...he had marked in the album right away.
Listen to me very carefully, Mukund.
Call them.
Ask them to give the numbers of all the girls that are not in the house.
Go to the control room..
...and check in which area are their sim cards travelling.
Okay.
Yes, tell me.
Where are you?
I'm going to the designing class.
Where are you at this ven/ moment?
Santacruz.
Why?
These five mobile numbers..
Quickly track in which area they are.
- Yes, sir.
Hello?
Virat, my sister went for jogging in the morning.
Someone forced her into a car and left.
Yeah?
This number is not showing.
This..
Yes, Virat?
I was just about to call you.
Why?
What happened?
Out of those five girls one girl's number is already deactivated.
And another number just got deactivated.
I too received a phone call 45 minutes ago.
They kidnapped another girl.
Virat, we need a big police force for it.
Their families have filed police complaints.
Please don't get confuse now.
What are you going to do?
I'll tell you.
First you tell me where did that second cell phone get deactivated?
Four kilometres from where she studied, travelling towards south-Mumbai..
Her sim card was deactivated in Byculla.
And the girl who went missing before her..
Her sim card too was deactivated in Byculla.
Okay.
Do one thing.
Leave for Byculla.
I'll meet you on the way.
Listen Virat, let's call and immediately warn the rest of the three girls..
...not to get out of the house alone.
Look, don't do anything.
Don't ruin anything.
That sleeper cells' head is more important than those five girls.
Got it?
Now quickly leave that place.
- Hello, Virat?
Shit.
Hello?
My sister went to college in the morning to attend a seminar.
The fourth girl was also taken.
Hello?
Yes!
The fifth girl was also kidnapped!
Are you a human or a sadist?
Why are you so happy?
Five girls have been kidnapped.
You are not at all worried about them?
I know what is important for you.
Sleeper cells' head should come outside so that you can kill him.
