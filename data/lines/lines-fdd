- Can't we talk?
- Lawyers.
You think it's easy?
Lawyers.
For the kid, you'll say...
Lawyers.
You and your daughter get on?
Fine.
She's a good girl.
The question is, do you get on with your daughter?
Do you have a good relationship?
Are you close?
If she had problems, could she talk to you freely?
Of course.
No problem.
You know you're here for child abuse?
Off the record, she said you plan to marry her off to a cousin back home.
That's right.
I'm her dad.
She has to marry one day.
You think you do what you want?
I'm in charge.
You did your research before you came in.
That's in no law.
Know what's gonna happen?
After your girl's married and been raped by her husband.
Because it's rape.
You force her into non-consensual sex.
And I'll be there that day.
What's your problem?
I say if there's a problem.
This is the police.
I refuse to talk to you.
- There's only me.
- Get the boss.
Hold on a second.
I'm the police, okay?
Look!
I am the police.
I ask the questions, you answer them.
Why won't you talk to me?
'Cos I'm a woman?
Shame on you.
Go home and look after your husband and kids.
Shame on me?
Don't talk to me like that!
Respect, okay?
You're sure you read the Qur'an?
Prove it.
Tell me, if you're a man and a good Muslim, tell me just where it says a father can force his daughter to marry.
Show me.
You think you can teach me the Qur'an?
Where does it say a woman isn't allowed to work?
Show me!
Call yourself Muslim?
You taint us.
The Qur'an teaches respect.
Got it?
- Is there a problem here?
- No, no problem.
There is no problem!
- You want something to drink?
- Water!
Mehdi.
My father.
Is it couscous?
A tagine.
Child Protection covers lots of things like vice and narcotics, no?
Minors get caught up in drugs.
Sure, but we mostly handle vice-related cases.
He arrests pedophiles.
Not only pedophiles.
That can't always be easy.
Isn't it tough, constant insults?
No.
Thanks.
People hate the cops.
They're never there when you need them.
Okay...
What do you dial for the police?
- 12, isn't it?
- No, it's 17.
Is it really 17?
What's Melissa like day to day?
It's not easy for me to talk about Melissa with her dad.
And it's not easy to talk about someone sitting next to you.
Granddad...
Do you like my new love?
Sure.
Do you like him?
Whatever you like, I like.
Feels great, giving you stuff.
Are you pleased or laughing at me?
It's so ugly!
I was sending a text or something.
I had my phone in my hand.
And this girl comes over, like, let me see that.
So I show her and she takes it, and I'm like...
Can you get to the...
When you met the boys.
That's what I'm telling you.
So the girl's taken your phone and you say...
They've got your phone.
After that, what happened?
I ask for it back.
She's like, sure, if you give my friends head.
I'm like, okay.
Okay to what?
To blowing them for my phone.
You really liked your phone.
No kidding.
And for a laptop?
Sorry, slipped out.
Take no notice.
It's not you...
We can't do this with those two...
Stop it!
Sorry, don't mind us.
In the police, we're not usually like this.
You don't give head for a phone.
You realize that?
It was a smartphone.
Sorry.
Sit down and let's finish up here.
You followed the whole group.
I need 20 volunteers for a special op.
- What kind?
- That's all I have.
We'll go next door.
This is chaos!
Check it out.
You never know.
Go with them and fill me in later.
Where were we?
We can talk seriously now, Caroline...
I've lost my phone.
An informer says the Emeralds will hand the Beggars stolen jewels worth 1 million euros.
The drop's tomorrow at 2 p.m., at Domus mall.
All we know is they'll come by car, most likely with wives and kids.
And armed.
Which one's Chrys's hubby?
Black shirt by the cabinet.
Over there?
We'll tail them, let the drop take place...
Not what I imagined.
We follow them to their cars and we arrest them only when they're inside the vehicles.
Look at the photos.
You'll get a list of car plate numbers.
As for the CPU,
I'll be honest, you're extras tomorrow.
Everybody in position?
Okay, Alex.
Standing by.
Martin in position in the garage.
Copy that.
Hey, kids!
We're on a mission.
Beggars in view on the escalator, Eastern Gate.
I repeat, at the Eastern Gate.
Nadine, CPU.
They just passed the desk.
Gabriel, CPU.
Beggars right in front of me.
They're looking all over, on-edge.
Iris.
They just passed by me.
We have them on visual.
Stay in position.
Emeralds arriving, opposite direction.
The drop's imminent.
Stay alert.
Meeting outside the bed store.
Outside the bed store.
What's up?
This is it.
Stay calm, act natural.
It's them.
Be discreet.
Discreet.
Be discreet, please.
Put it away.
Hands up!
Get down!
Everybody on the floor!
Take it easy!
Calm down.
Back off!
Hands behind you!
The cuffs!
We'll take over!
Fucking CPU!
What the hell happened?
Back off, I said.
We're everywhere.
Shut it!
Put your gun away!
Stop!
Where you gonna go?
Shut it!
Back up!
Stay there!
There are cops everywhere.
Back up, asshole!
He's your son!
I don't give a shit!
He's not my kid!
He's a kid, that's what counts!
Where are you going?
Stop there!
Sir!
Don't move!
Don't touch it!
My arm's numb.
Even with a vest, I still fucking get shot!
That really is dumb.
It's okay, you're not dead.
You're not dead.
- Couldn't even be an extra.
- We are the extras.
Don't worry, we did a great job.
It's okay.
Don't look at it.
Sign here.
What?
What?
Chrys!
Don't run!
Can you hear us, kid?
What?
He wants Pepitos.
- What?
- Pepitos.
I'll go.
You'll get the wrong ones.
I'll take it with.
You okay, fella?
Does it hurt?
You were starving.
Don't they feed you here?
He makes such a mess when he eats.
I'm going for a smoke.
I'll be back in 5.
You love me a bit, don't you?
2 wives, so you're polygamous?
- No.
- What do you mean?
Polygamy means several wives.
So you'd say you are...
A bigamist.
Bigamist, okay.
What's your sex-life with your wives?
I'm a romantic.
I like fellatio.
Do you?
Fellatio!
What's that?
Shit, I'll start a fire.
Keep it down.
I'm working.
Jesus!
So, fellatio, you've never heard of it?
Okay, fine.
That's it for today.
I'll talk to your daughter and be in touch.
I'll see you out.
You okay?
Not too tired?
No, I'm fine.
And you?
You think I don't see you on Facebook?
So?
Don't we have work to do?
You're my boss?
Do I report to you?
I'd no idea you're my boss!
I can discuss work.
Aren't we a team?
Okay, let's talk work.
I just saw the split vagina of an 11-month-old baby, then I saw her mother, who's suicidal because her girl's been raped for months.
Sure, let's talk work.
I'm a good cop and I do a good job even if I'm not like you.
Let me chill with my virtual friends before I move onto my next case.
Get off my back!
The lady speaks.
Something's bugging the lady.
Get off my case, Iris!
This is not the time.
It never is.
It's always the time to chat.
Shut your big mouth.
Just shut the fuck up!
Got that?
Shut it.
You get all the tough cases, I get all the "raves"?
Cut it out, Iris.
We're partners.
We can discuss our work.
We're partners?
Partners communicate with each other.
Where's the communication?
You tell me what to do and what not to do.
What I can do, what I can't do.
You grade me, you judge me...
Just get the fuck off my back and stop lecturing me!
That's the thanks I get for listening to your troubles and your little hassles with hubby.
But this is about work.
You're way off, Nadine, that's all.
I'm just saying.
You have no right to talk about my man.
Because of you, I left my husband, when I was partly to blame, too.
Just because you think men are all shits.
You can't give any love.
I'm ashamed I listened to you.
I miss my family.
I miss my children.
Can't you see that?
It's because of her, making me see him like a...
I love him.
Maybe that pisses you off because you love no one.
You're all shriveled up.
No cock could ever get inside you!
You're a piece of shit!
You don't seem in control of your faculties.
Don't fucking start on that.
Just don't start telling me what to do.
Your husband's gone.
He should've gone long ago!
I feel sorry for him.
All these years with you.
And you making yourself puke?
You think nobody knows?
We all know, you puke all day long.
It's over, got it?
Over!
Stop trying to run my life!
I'll file a report.
What do you expect?
Want me to type it?
What the hell's going on?
We can hear you downstairs!
I don't care!
What's the problem?
Sounds like ego issues.
Sure, the ego is dignity.
You've got no ego?
Ego means I can look at myself in the mirror.
I leave my ego problems at home.
Not ego problems, one ego problem!
Be quiet when I'm talking!
Shut up now.
We'll split you up in September.
For now, button it!
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
I don't give a shit!
I can leave!
Leave.
Do us all a favor!
Start with a piked somersault.
Let's go.
Reach for the mat.
That's why you fell.
Next!
Nice but concentrate on keeping it tight, to finish it off.
Let's keep going.
Very nice.
Solal, your turn.
Come on, Solal.
What are you waiting for?
Leave him, it's okay.
If you're nervous, don't jump.
Keep it coming.
Limited, but nicely done.
Who's next?
Good.
That's called a tuck jump.
Solal?
I'm really so sorry.
I'd like to apologize to him.
I hope he gets over it.
I never wanted to hurt him.
You realize now that you did?
Yes.
You didn't think about it then, but now?
We had a relationship that was like love.
I need you to sign the statement, the bottom of each page.
Where'll he go now?
Will he be okay?
He'll receive help.
He'll be well looked after.
I know other places where he can still do gymnastics.
It's important for him.
Will he go to jail because of me?
No.
He'll go to jail for what he did.
He did it to you, but you're not to blame.
He's sick.
Your teacher has a disease, you see, called pedophilia.
He's called a pedophile.
Have you heard that word before?
At school maybe?
It's a disease some adults have, which means that they do things to children they have no right to do.
We're here to catch and punish them.
Why isn't he...
Why's he going to prison and not just...
Why isn't he going to a hospital?
When someone breaks the law like that, they go to prison.
It's a punishment that serves a purpose.
Then, maybe he'll be able to do gym again one day, and not hurt any more children, you see?
I feel a bit sad.
Why are you sad?
I liked him.
He was nice to me.
Morning, everybody.
What a reception!
Nice to hear you speak as one.
I hope you enjoyed the vacation.
I see some people have been in the sun, and others... less so.
I hope school started okay for your kids...
I'll start with the new appointments and departures.
Lt. Desgranges has moved on to the Vice Squad, as anticipated.
He'll be replaced by Lt. Géron.
Capt. Beck has joined the Fraud Squad and Lt. Iris Langlois transfers to replace him as section chief.
Congratulations.
Now, I'd like to talk about my plans to restructure, as everybody expected, the Internet Section.
I believe that investing resources there will help us smoke out more pedophiles.
The pedophile at the school gates is long gone...
Can I open a window?
I'm hot.
You make it sound like fieldwork's bullshit.

ALL I CAN
Prologue AWAKENING
ALL
I
Chapter One COMMUNITY
FRESHFIELDS CANADIAN ROCKIES
Team work is everything on a trip like this, you know.
It's difficult thing to come out here, to get out in these big glaciers.
There's a lot of long lines where we would hike up as a pair.
Just watch over each other and help each other climb and ski.
To be able to work to get to the top of something with a good friend and share up moments, skiing the line with them, after them, before them, get to the bottom...
Just share up and enjoying it is incredible.
Boys, first day ever!
You should hurry up with those stands and help me with this wall.
If we were getting longer out here we wouldn't be getting anything done.
This time you are alive!
Yeah, well ideally hopefully the downclimb off the ridge is super straightforward.
You saw what we went through today.
- Everything is reasonable.
- Are you just going to take this ridge all the way over?
Yeah, like you can go around this peak and then the next peak, you can sneak the back and you get on to the ridge, it looks nice, and then you can't see the other sides.
So we don't know if we can ski down that face and then climb up or make that ridge walk.
We have to leave like, almost at like midnight or one o'clock in the morning pretty much.
The biggest unknown factor is just getting over there.
TANTALUS RANGE.
BC
Chapter Two IMMERSION
As you've gathered the weather briefing is taking place.
The total weather consideration and the case all of the weather favorable...
Weather can make or brake a test shot.
That's why you want to know up to the last moment just how you stand with the elements.
So many different kinds of snow.
It's one of the most beautiful thing on Earth.
Different every day you go up and your line is changing, snow is changing.
It's a new sensation every day.
The clouds are still light.
Seventy thousand feet now...
You have a grandstand seat here to one of the most momentous events in the history of science.
For the sake of all of us, and for the sake of our country, I hope that you'll join me in wishing this expedition well.
Storm skiing probably my favourite kind of skiing.
Just being in the woods when it's snowing is a calming feeling, I think.
Being surrounded by 100% nature and the total quietness.
Just a different feeling, you don't really get that in too many places and we are lucky to live here.
Get out of there, guy!
Get out of there!
Fracture, fracture.
This is Seb, I want you to go ahead and stay there and we are gonna continue the drop.
Chapter Three PERSEVERANCE
ALASKA
I definitely think that nature offers the ultimate testing ground for man to challenge himself.
So many options and so many variables have free skiers looking up at a line.
And it's guaranteed that each would have their own way of reading the terrain.
And it's guaranteed they would each ski differently.
Tough to really say - you are being a really environmentally conscious person if you are a skier, you know?
Last year, living in the mountains in a cabin and getting up there by your own means of ski touring or hiking.
The fact that we can get anywhere out of these valleys is only because logging and mining is there.
It's basically created access for us to get up there.
But without those roads we wanna be there.
Love doing that.
This is my whole life, exactly what I want to do.
And I got so much enjoyment out of it.
There's no way you can really say you feel bad for doing what we doing.
At the same time it would be great if we were not wrecking as much by getting this amount of enjoyment out of nature.
Chapter Four CONNECTION
Vulcan Puyehue CHILE
We came up this far-fetched plan to go down to Chile and ski the inside this crater.
But really none of us had any idea if it was even possible.
He was mention volcano opening in 1960 and he has to evacuate his family.
All this forest that we are now is just re-growing.
None of us, really, are any good at horse-back riding whatsoever.
Riding up the horse in your ski gear, knowing you're going to go skiing, is just a craziest thing you never imagined.
Day three at base-camp,one of our guys Niko woke us up at 5 in the morning.
He told us it's gonna be bluebird.
We got to the top and we weren't on just any volcano.
It was a volcano with these Alaska style spines.
And to see that, where we were going go ski, was like a dream come true.
We all ski down to the same spot, just give each other the high five, and throw our skins back on and go for another one.
Though, a year after we are at the volcano, it fully erupted.
It's pretty crazy!
I don't really know what it means in the grand scheme of things, but that place where we were is now gone.
When I found out I was coming to Greenland, I didn't really think of what the culture is could be like and that's kind of one of the biggest shocks.
I think there's something bigger about coming to place like this.
Seen how other people live.
That helps you appreciate those things in your own life and also helps you, you know, realign.
GREENLAND
The people who live here year round they pretty much are born here and die here.
What leads you to this moment?
I wonder about that all the time.
This is me, this is what i'm doing and this is where I am, and...
All the little strange things that went into making it happen.
It's kind a hard really to put into words how remote we are, but we are just basically taking care of ourselves.
It was definitely fun to be out there.
Camping at night and hiking all the lines that we ski.
You wake up, the sun was shining, you look out your tent door and just big peaks, ski-able lines everywhere.
We all hiked up this big face, and it was kind of a struggle.
And I wasn't sure, I kind of wanted to ski the face that we had climbed.
And I also wanted to ski the couloir that Callum was gonna drop.
Then I ended up skiing the face, looking up and it's just look so gnarly what Callum was dropping into.
MOROCCO
We had a couple goals on this trip.
The first one was to get to the top of mount M'Goun, which is the second highest peak in Morocco.
Looking out of the barren desert it's pretty hard not to wonder: is this a future?
The more you travel it's interesting to see how differently people live from you.
We were all connected in the same problem.
I'm privileged to have grown up in the mountains and skiing my whole life.
I wanna see my kids still, you know, do ski.
And their kids being able to ski...
It was all my son's fault, he was in grade 6 and he wanted to go ski.
And I says: "Well, If you going skiing, I'm going skiing too.
'Cause I'm not driving you to the hell and coming back home again."
This would be my 8 year of what - a hundred plus days.
If I get another 6 more in.
Who says you can't drive with ski boots on?
All girl working really hard, got a big load.
I'm Mary Woodward and I'm 75 years old.
I got free a pass this year.
I've been skiing since I was 23.
... such a free feeling.
You forget how old you are.
Feels like you can do anything.
We have the nicest snow in the countryside.
We used to get a lot more but can't help that.
We just come out and ski what's here every day.
Then over here we got Dennis.
They call me the tail gunner because I'm the last guy who comes down.
If anybody gets hurt I am the one who comes to save you.
So in that way I can go the slowest, which is nice.
I don't like to speed like they do.
Bob probably knows every tree out here by name.
- I broke a ski here couple years ago.
A guy in my ear talking right now, sorry.
- Ski good or eat wood.
But you can't hear anybody.
Make sure that earpiece is on.
And I like to hear people.
Oh, Mary is the only other person that shows up just about every day, all the others have got: "Bad legs, bad knees."
Well winter has changed over the years.
But I guess we still be skiing a long time - it's just that we are used to skiing in knee-deep powder.
- What's happening to all the snow, chef?
- Ah...
It's turning brown and moldy.
- You can't eat yellow snow.
- I know, because it's dog poo or cat pee.
- Only the freshing fresh.
- Well I eat from the ground also.
- You're just a little doggy.
- Ah...
I ski with my brother and I like it when he farts.
I guess the soul of winter is in the Kootenays for a lot of people.
They come here for that reason.
I think you can find the soul in other places too.
Yeah, my parents definitely gave me the biggest gift I could ever get.
Which is love for the mountains.
Super important to be able to pass that on.
Those skis are worth more than a truck!
You have a constituency that's out on a hill and everyone of them by virtue of what they're doing is an environmentalist.
And you are converting people every day through the beauty and natural world and the opportunity for redemption in a sense of freedom on hill.
You could just do anything and go any place.
And you do. you get to the bottom...
You just think: "Oh, ok.
Let's do it again." It's that good.
CAN
Skier's connection with the nature and the mountains is incredible.
And puts us at the forefront of what's going on with our environment.
Climate is too intangible.
It's just being called the perfect problem.
You can't see it, most people don't understand it.
And even though it's happening, it's too slow to be tangible to most people.
Every generation in history has had their own big challenge to deal with, and this one is ours.
It's money.
You have corporations funding political campaigns, and working on a quarterly profit calendars.
And it's impossible to take you eye of that.
A lot of comments I get revolve around people feeling badly.
They feel bad about the car they drive, about the life they live.
And I think that this isn't about you, it's about how we all become part of a bigger solution.
And we're all hypocrites, of course.
It's a fossil-fuel based society, but we have to all work together toward a common goal.
Skiers always scout difficult runs, think of climate changes as the same thing.
While you are scouting it and think about it and planing action.
You get increasingly nervous or I do.
And the second you drop in, you feel this incredible sense of relief.
Because you have an opportunity to succeed or fail on your own terms.
Right now.
And all the fearing, anxiety and planning is over.
The environmental crisis it's a huge puzzle.
I think it's just a matter of finding your own role as a person.
And finding our role as a society.
The common person, those are the people not the heroes.
Who solved all the globe problems for thousands of years.
And will continue too.
It's all about all the little different things that each of us can be doing.
Chapter Five IMAGINATION
Dave here is being the most influential freestyle skier in last 10 years by far.
He has innovated some of the coolest tricks you see in the park and the back-country, even now.
He was on the Salomon team when they first start to making twin-tips.
- Tell me about the new ski, man.
- I don't know but your girlfriend just flashed us.
Do it again.
All we did is made a couple of small changes to the technology already available.
Fastforward it ten years you see the trick that kids are doing today that are absolutely mind-blowing.
You can find parts of a system that need to be tweaked and that cause radical change.
And so if thinking about what's being happening before you or after you, you have to embrace the fact that it is actually happening right now.
Skiers' minds have been opened.
The general skier now is not fearing change, they are expecting change, and they are actually demanding change.
They wanna see improvements so ...
That's pretty cool.
It's about allowing yourself to see things from a different angle entirely.
For example, in my case, I can be like: "I'll never use helicopters, I'll never fly around the world any more."
Might as well not use skis anymore cause those are manufactured in factories and that's bad, and, just like, basically stop doing everything I am doing and like staying home and trying not to breathe too much.
Like if you try be less and be less, that's not progression, you know.
You are not really moving forward, you basically just slowing down.
But I don't think it's about doing less.
I think it's about doing more, it's about being more creative, it's about being more active.
We have to make a world where when you are flying an airplane it doesn't produce carbon emissions.
When you ski it doesn't produce carbon emissions.
Here we are at the base of a Blackcomb right next to the Fitzsimmons micro hydro renewable energy powerplant.
It produces annually what we ?
conceal annually as an entire ski operation?
Humans have this way of making the impossible possible.
Just like Greg Hill, he skied to a 2 million feet in one year.
The most important thing to remember is that you have to engage in your world.
The analogy is a ski slope in a back country.
You don't just ski the slope.
You have to know precisely what's going on on that aspect in that part of the world.
And that's how you have to engage society as well.
That might not be a lot of people who stop to think about it, but the time spent in the mountain is really taught us really valuable lessons.
It's almost that kind of asymmetric warfare.
The ski industry small but it's interesting.
And so it can drive change.
That parallels the environment perfectly, because there's no other choice.
We are put into the environment, we have to perform.
We seek these moments, we look for the unknown.
We look for just a little bit harder then before.
And that's why the people go, the only way to find out is to drop in and try.
Chapter Six REALIZATION
Subtitles: spaaa, alexei_suhov
You are a beautiful woman...
Teriyaki beef stick ...
Native americans used to dine on a similar treat, they called it "meat pemmican".
I'm just...
I don't feel pretty right now.
Having my friends here is great, but it's like, making my self-esteem go down really bad.
And they look so good, and they're just like, like the hottest girls in the world, and here I am just like and you're...
- Babe.
- I got to get ready.
- No, you don't.
Come here.
- That's just it.
- What?
Kendra, you are the most beautiful woman.
And don't let anybody coming around after you just had a baby, make you not feel that way, babe.
You want that?
All right, come on.
Follow me.
Kendal Strickland wasn't just the prettiest girl at Waverley Prep she was a legend.
As a junior, the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her, even though another student had recently died.
Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?
When you send something that soon, it's for the inner circle.
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the father who doesn't talk to him any more.
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I am not worked up in the slightest.
I was just trying to tell you about something that happened.
God!
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent parent.
Can you imagine still living in Mercury'?
Trapped with a wife and a kid and some crappy job?
It's like...
It's like he's a hostage.
Yup.
We're lucky we got out.
- Yes.
- We have lives.
Let me let you borrow an outfit 'cause that dress is hideous, honey.
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come with me now to the TV Guide party because who wants to go to a party by themselves?
- It's to die for.
- That is fab.
I just think that Tyler and I are like soul twins.
You know?
Right before he texts me,
- it's like I can...
- Sense it?
Yes!
Like psychically.
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
Like text chemistry.
Exactly.
Just as Kendal hit "send," a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied.
They had "textual chemistry."
So, all told, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
Why?
Long story short, I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.
Oh, my God.
Yikes.
Yeah, it was probably one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Of course.
Sure, totally.
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Dolce, take a pee.
Dolce, pee.
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Welcome to Hampton Inn.
Do you have a reservation?
No.
Mavis Gary.
- Is that a dog in your bag?
- Nope.
We actually allow small pets with a cleaning deposit.
Good, because I have a small dog, in my vehicle.
I'll put that you have a dog.
How many keys do you need?
Two, please.
Expecting company?
Hi.
YOU.
Personal.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Slade.
I can't.
There's nothing I can do for you.
I love Mason more than I love you.
Hey, Buddy, this is Mavis.
Remember?
Mavis Gary'?
I'm in town for this little real estate thing, and I...
I don't know, I just thought if you have time, and you wanna grab a drink, catch up?
Something like that.
All right, well, listen, call me and... and let me know.
All right, bye.
Fuck.
- Hey, Buddy.
- Mavis Gary.
- It's been... how long?
- I'm not sure.
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.
I am insanely busy as always.
Well, I don't know how long you're around with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
OK.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,
I could meet you at Woody's in I don't know, 15 minutes?
Spontaneous really isn't a thing these days.
I don't know if you heard, but I am a new dad.
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.
I got that announcement.
- Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
How about we meet tomorrow at this place called Champion O'Malley's?
- It's kind of fun.
- Of course, yes.
Yeah.
How does 8:00, 8:30 sound?
- 6:00 would be better.
- 6:00 is perfect.
Great, I'll see you at 6:00.
Maker's Mark.
What?
I'm sorry, but I think we went to high school together.
- At the same time?
- Yeah.
You're Mavis Gary'?
Mavis Gary-Crane now.
I'm Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually next to yours, all through high school.
Matt...
Freehauf.
Yeah.
Yeah, your locker was right there.
Right next to mine.
We didn't run in the same circles.
You were pretty popular, if I remember correctly.
You won "Best Hair."
Did I?
What did you win?
I didn't.
They usually give out, like, 15 of those, and only to the same five people.
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it was really nice seeing you...
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?
Of course not.
Gross.
No, I live in Minneapolis.
I'm just here taking care of a little real estate thing.
- I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.
Yes, I am an author.
Children's books.
Y.A. That's industry speak for "Young Adult."
It's a very popular teen series.
It's everywhere.
It's huge.
- You've probably seen it.
- Vampires?
Hey, take that, liver.
Weren't you that hate crime guy'?
Excuse me?
You totally were.
You're the hate crime guy.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?
Now I know who you are.
Matt, the hate crime guy.
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a...
When we were seniors, a bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods...
That's right.
...And hit me on the legs and dick with a crowbar.
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out that I wasn't really gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime any more.
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
Fuck.
How's your dick?
Not good.
Not good.
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.
You know, it's just kind of does a...
Hard Jacks.
Do you know who drinks these?
I don't.
Buddy Slade.
That's an interesting fact.
Come here.
Do you wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes.
I can't tell you in here.
OK, you got me out here.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together.
- And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade.
All right.
I'm pretty sure he's married with a kid on the way.
No, kid's here.
She already had it.
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.
So wait, are you not joking?
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.
They just tend to happen in slow motion.
They get divorced, they reconfigure, and society is, like, fine with that if you take your time, like an emotional glacier.
I'm 37...
Mavis, I would keep all of this to yourself.
I would find a therapist.
Talk to a professional.
- Matt.
- Oh, boy.
Don't you get it?
Love conquers all.
Have you not seen The Graduate?
Or, like, I don't know, anything?
Oh, a taxi.
Yes, we called it.
Mavis, hey!
Buddy Slade has a life.
Buddy Slade has a life.
No, he has a baby, and babies are boring!
Having spent the summer outside Waverley Prep,
Kendal looked around at her fellow students, thinking,
"Did I really get that much better, or did everyone simply get worse?
Why was Ryan spending so much time with this dumpy new girl?"
Mavis, this is Jim.
Do you even have any pages?
I'm trying to help you, but I can't if you...
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh, yeah
Oh, no, not gonna need those.
You're gonna wanna try the popcorn shrimp.
No, I'm not.
A couple of Hard Jacks, please.
OK.
Hey.
Hey, you.
- Wow.
- Great to see you.
So...
This is quite the mid-week surprise.
Hey, I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, me neither.
But I thought, just for old times' sake.
Actually, I haven't been drinking recently.
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and now that she's nursing our girl,
I thought I'd show some solidarity.
Right.
So...
- You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.
Ad sales now.
My dad's still there, so we have lunch together most days.
Yeah.
Pizza or sub sandwiches.
Awesome.
I've just been working my little butt off in the city.
You know, doing my thing.
Down there in the old Mini Apple?
God, Buddy.
Nobody calls it the Mini Apple any more.
I didn't know.
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.
Give our waitress a break.
So chivalrous.
Mavis.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You know, bookkeeping, dealing with vendors.
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?
Just catching up with a friend.
Oh, catching up with a friend.
There's Buddy Slade, acquiring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar.
You're not wasting any time, are you?
Look, it was really great hanging out with you last night.
- It was great.
- OK.
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie.
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?
Yeah.
It's so nice running into him.
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
You wanna join us for a round?
I would love to.
I would.
Sadly, I have work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied person to complete even the simplest task.
- So...
- Bummer.
I don't wanna step on your Mercury High reunion.
So...
Go, go, Injuns.
Actually, they changed the name to "Indians" back in '99, remember?
The local Fond du Lac tribe... did a whole thing with...
It sucks, what happened to Matt.
That poor guy suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.
Didn't you call him a theater fag all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.
Well, whatever.
Mercury's changed a lot since then, though.
We're way less of a hick town.
Really'?
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?
And we're getting a new Chipotle at the mall.
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.
You know, one of those Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.
That's genius.
KenTacoHut.
You sound like one of your crazy characters.
Hey, so how's Allen?
Allen is great.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's good.
We're not married any more, but...
Oh, sorry.
I didn't...
No, don't be sorry.
It's good.
It's fine.
Well, that's Allen's loss.
It sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.
She's got band practice tonight.
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.
Just something she does with the other moms.
Wow, cool.
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.
Oh, my God.
Embarrassing.
Actually, her band's playing here tomorrow night.
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow night to our house for a hang?
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.
- I would love that.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?
Sure.
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra.
She wants to be a writer someday.
Right, of course.
But you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside.
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
It's still a pretty big deal, compared to the rest of us.
It was so great seeing you.
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.
I do?
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed, you just got lucky.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.
- OK.
- Good night.
Hello?
Look, I just want you to know that what you think you saw tonight is not what it was, OK?
Oh, so you're not trying to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage.
It is way more complicated than you can possibly ever understand, OK?
Buddy Slade and I have years and years of history, and it is very rich, and very complex.
Wow, yeah, that sounds way beyond my comprehension.
Don't open a new ranch till the old one's done.
- What?
- That's my sister.
Forget it.
- Just so you know.
- I got it.
Thank you.
Do you want to get loaded, or something?
I'm Mavis.
I know.
From high school.
Right.
I made you those Rice Krispies squares that one time for your birthday.
I got your locker combination from the vice principal.
I put them in your locker?
Thank you.
- So where's Matt?
- In his cave.
Welcome to the distillery.
Are you making moonshine?
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.
You know what?
Hang on.
All right.
Check this out.
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong...
That's a limited...
There's not a lot.
- "Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.
Mos Eisley...
Star Wars thing.
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's...
Let's let that age a little longer.
And I got another in here.
OK.
Now, see if you can detect some of the new oak.
- Oh, come on.
- OK.
They're kind of hidden in there.
So when you sip...
- I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.
Let's do a little...
There you go.
Woody.
Oak.
So how'd the rest of your little date go?
- Good.
It was eye-opening.
- Yeah?
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
OK, he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
I'm thinking... it will be you.
- Aren't you a little old for G.I. Joes?
- That one's still wet.
No, it's fine.
Jesus.
- You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.
That one...
I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongul's body, so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead, and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.
I was tired and drunk.
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo.
I have to go check on something.
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.
I think this is it.
You think, or you know?
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty.
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.
You're fuckin' mentally ill.
- You see that window up there?
- Yep.
I bet Buddy is awake jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
Can I help you find something?
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.
It's not a formal occasion.
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
OK.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old flame, and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.
Let's show him what he's been missing.
No, he's seen me recently.
He knows.
But his wife hasn't seen me in a while, so...
Well, it's the end of my shift, and my son has to be picked up from school.
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.
Shawna!
Where are the Waverley Prep books?
They got their own display table right there.
Wow.
They must be really popular.
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
They were big a couple years ago, but the computer says, "Do not shelve," so...
Hey, are you writing in there?
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.
You're Jane MacMurray'?
No.
Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.
Mavis Gary-Crane.
See?
Do you know Jane MacMurray?
Yes, I know her really well.
- I wrote the book.
- OK.
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
No, that's fine.
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
We're probably not gonna sell them.
The series is done.
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
Whatever, book man.
Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off.
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
Hers was a gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However, being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan the love of her life?
- What up?
- Hey.
How are you?
- How are you?
- Good, good.
Here's that book for your niece.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There is a character in that one that's based on you.
- What?
- In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...
Hey.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.
You, too.
There it is.
Adorable.
Thank you.
You love it.
You love it.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?
Oh, just a water.
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.
It's fine.
I'll just pump and dump after the show.
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes it does.
Oh, starting to get smiles.
Cute.
She's, like, Buddy's clone.
No.
I see you in there.
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw a nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm an author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular.
I like your decor.
Is it shabby chic?
Pier One?
A little bit Goodwill.
Buddy and I used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that?
The '90s?
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.
It was just, like, the dumbest thing ever.
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.
I used to sleep in his T-shirts and boxers.
I think I still have a few.
Hey.
I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- What?
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.
What's the chart?
Beth teaches special needs kids.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
So we need to show them "this is what happy looks like,"
"this is what anxious looks like," and so on.
What about neutral?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
Oh, my God.
- Is that Mavis Gary'?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.
Shots.
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Really'?
Come on, tequila time.
Salt.
So... are they any good?
Yeah, they're all right.
I knew it.
They're horrible.
I knew it.
Well, they have a lot of fun.
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.
He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy.
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.
Think he owns any clown suits?
- Oh, my God.
You're terrible.
- Come on.
- Dark.
- No.
Hello, Mercury!
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.
We are Nipple Confusion.
Yeah.
Please be kind, as this is only our second show.
And we all have small children at home.
Our first song is a cover.
This one goes out from our drummer, Beth, to her sweetheart, Buddy.
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Still she won't be forced against her will
Says she don't do drugs, but she does the pill
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
When she's at the gig she takes her car...
Remember when we used to make out to this song?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this song was playing the first time I went down on you.
The first time I went...
I screwed up the fill so bad.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.
- You guys were namazing.
- Wait.
Did you just say "namazing"?
- I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.
Hardly.
It's so interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's so inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence on stage.
Really.
Beth, we gotta get home.
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.
I wanna stay out just a little while longer.
Yeah, Buddy, you can't have her back tonight.
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.
Really'?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.
You sure?
Have fun.
Thanks, Mavis.
Easy.
Tolerance has gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, since I knew you?
- I still know you.
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Don't you have that babysitter till 11:00?
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
I know, we can't, but time is just so precious.
For real.
- It goes so fast.
- I know.
Man, I really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know.
I can tell you're a great father.
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.
You do too much, even.
You think so?
Yes.
You're a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
I thought I saw lights.
Hi, Daniel.
Yep, I'm home.
Where's Beth?
She wanted to stay out and party all night.
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and she doesn't want her "nuk" any more.
I got it.
Good night, Buddy.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Wow.
- Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
There's some low-hanging fruit.
You are low-hanging fruit.
- Oh, no.
No.
- What?
I hate this guy over here.
That's my cousin, Mike.
Mike Moran is your cousin?
Unfortunately.
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
- Mavis?
- Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, coz, this is such a rad surprise.
Yeah, I'm in town just for a little real estate thing.
- How are you?
Yeah.
- I'm great.
Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary.
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood?
Porcelain?
- Strychnine?
- Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.
You mean rock crawling, right?
No, I'm vertical, bro, believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity.
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.
- You should try it, Matt.
- No.
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.
It's like Will Grace.
- It is.
- No, it isn't.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later.
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you got there.
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
God, he got so much attention.
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.
Please.
That dick ruined my sweet 16, same weekend.
God, you are a piece of work.
You're a piece of shit.
You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a cougar.
How I'm a cougar'?
I'm not even 30 years old.
You're a cougar.
I am turning 30 this year and I am freaked out.
It's pretty old.
Kim Kardashian channels her own inner cougar.
Fuck.
The kiss was electric, transformative, spiritual, enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
I said, "Listen, Kyle, you're everything to me.
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"
- And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.
I'm gonna have a...
Hey, you.
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
How much longer are you gonna be in town?
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?
I was just wondering if you're still in town this weekend, if you wanna come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's this little hippy thing we're doing out in the yard.
It's not religious or anything...
- I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.
- Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.
Hey, Mom.
Were you even gonna say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like.
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom.
OK?
I was planning on calling.
Why didn't you just come and stay with us?
Because I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea.
I have tons and tons of work to catch up on.
Books still selling well?
It's like I can hardly keep up.
Is that the money you used to invest in local real estate?
I heard you were here to work on some kind of real estate transaction.
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
Honey'?
- Look what I found.
- What?
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Who's this?
- This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.
- Dolce.
- Hello.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
You gotta start taking care of yourself, sweetie.
You know, a Lean Cuisine is not a meal.
Yeah, I think I might be an alcoholic.
Very funny.
- You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
You know what, Mom?
Can you please take down that photo of me and Allen?
Which picture, sweetie?
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
- Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
Actually I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy.
Oh, the old beau, huh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way, but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
The people who really know you best.
And that new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it?
Up close?
I suppose.
Is everything OK?
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.
It's just that Buddy used to say that we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
Yeah!
Sweet ride.
What is that, a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Oh, heavy.
How are they?
Horrible.
God, I've been through a lot.
- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?
Come on.
Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
- And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...
- Come on!
- Fine.
Could you walk any slower?
Our school is so ugly.
It looks like a factory.
It actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were such a slut.
I was normal.
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
How's the master plan unfolding?
Well, actually, he called me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
I don't know.
There's still so much that's unspoken, but he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man.
By all accounts, happily.
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.
He gave me his sweatshirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
You're one to talk.
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know you use this whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
"Scuffle."
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
OK?
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch they shattered my legs, bashed in my brains, mangled my cock, so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
Then they left me for dead.
You know, things aren't too great down south.
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
You know, what's done is done.
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past.
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser, trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It really is a shame that you're like this, because if you had a good personality, none of this other stuff would bother people.
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories, because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan still loved her, crystal clear.
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend, but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
Who was taking care of Kendal?
And on the subject of fair...
Was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
No.
Life wasn't fair, and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
Hi, Jan.
Oh, hi.
Wow, really been a long time.
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.
- Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?
Wow.
How are you doing?
I'm good.
- Good.
- I brought presents.
Oh, thank you.
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?
Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?
Yeah.
Are you having fun?
Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.
I think we should talk privately.
Sure, yeah.
Here, follow me.
OK.
OK, so what's going on?
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now.
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
Well, hey, she pushed it out.
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's in here and I know what's in here.
Buddy... you're my moon, my stars.
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis!
What are you doing?
OK.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
We can work this out.
You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know.
We can beat this together.
You're better than this.
I have to go.
I think you should leave.
Hey, look who's up.
Hey, let me take her.
Let me...
Come here.
There you are.
Can you do me a favor?
We need everybody outside.
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.
Those are delicious.
Hey, listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
Come on, let's go.
Mavis?
- What?
- Are you OK?
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here.
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh, my God.
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch.
Oh, my God.
You should see your face.
It's a joke.
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
I love your sweater.
I'll get you a rag.
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here.
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
You know, the funny thing is,
I could have had this party a long time ago.
This exact same party.
Yeah.
Buddy and I were together for four years, and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.
It is silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart.
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
And we were gonna keep it!
We were gonna have a little baby, and a little naming party, and a Funquarium, and all of that.
And then 12 weeks into it...
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable down south in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager, and probably even more kids, because we always found each other.
Always!
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
What the fuck?
It's a new drum set for Beth.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What is wrong with you?
Are you like one of those little kids who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?
That's enough, Mavis.
You're drunk.
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom, and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.
We all do, Mavis.
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness, some depression.
You're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying.
He's not.
Well.
What about now?
You hate me now?
'Cause it should be easy, 'cause I fucking hate you.
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?
Mavis, honey.
You know, I came back for you.
For you!
And I hate this town!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
But I came back.
I just wanted you to know that.
I screwed up.
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?
You're scaring me.
I'm crazy.
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
I ruined my dress.
I'll get you...
I'll get you a shirt.
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
Hide me.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Why Buddy'?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
You know, I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker, shaped like a heart and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me,
and I was at my best.
Good morning.
Hi.
Coffee?
Sure.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over.
It got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last one right now.
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade from school.
Yeah.
I know that Beth.
What do you think of her?
I...
I...
I don't really like her.
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is.
What happened to your dress?
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
Shit.
What's wrong?
What did I say'?
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
It's really difficult for me to be happy and then for other people, it just seems so simple.
I know.
They just grow up, and they're so... fulfilled.
I don't feel fulfilled
- Well...
- And frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
I need to change, Sandra.
- No, you don't.
- What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book, or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
I mean, you think so?
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
You know, living in the big city, all famous and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special or whatever.
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
I'll sit and think about you, living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
It seems really nice.
Yeah.
But...
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you.
I needed that.
You're right.
This place blows.
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me?
Take me with you.
You know, to the Mini Apple.
You're good here, Sandra.
Oh.
Dolce.
I'm so sorry.
My baby.
Come here.
Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class, there was an unmistakable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day, it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
Good boy.
Poor Ryan...
Lost at sea.
They don't need those back.
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
Cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future.
A new chapter.
As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss thinking, "Life, here I come. "
I'm just...
I don't feel pretty right now.
Having my friends here is great, but it's like, making my self-esteem go down really bad.
And they look so good, and they're just like, like the hottest girls in the world, and here I am just like and you're...
- Babe.
- I got to get ready.
- No, you don't.
Come here.
- That's just it.
- What?
Kendra, you are the most beautiful woman.
And don't let anybody coming around after you just had a baby, make you not feel that way, babe.
You want that?
All right, come on.
Follow me.
Kendal Strickland wasn't just the prettiest girl at Waverley Prep, she was a legend.
As a junior, the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her, even though another student had recently died.
Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?
When you send something that soon, it's for the inner circle.
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the father who doesn't talk to him anymore.
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I am not worked up in the slightest.
I was just trying to tell you about something that happened.
God!
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent parent.
Can you imagine still living in Mercury?
Trapped with a wife and a kid, and some crappy job?
It's like...
It's like he's a hostage.
Yup.
We're lucky we got out.
- Yes.
- We have lives.
Let me let you borrow an outfit 'cause that dress is hideous, honey.
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come with me now to the TV Guide party because who wants to go to a party by themselves?
- It's to die for.
- That is fab.
I just think that Tyler and I are like soul twins.
You know?
Right before he texts me,
- it's like I can...
- Sense it?
Yes!
Like psychically.
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
Like text chemistry.
Exactly.
Just as Kendal hit "send," a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied.
They had "textual chemistry."
So, all told, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
Why?
Long story short, I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.
Oh, my God.
Yikes.
Yeah, it was probably one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Of course.
Sure, totally.
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Dolce, take a pee.
Dolce, pee.
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Welcome to Hampton Inn.
Do you have a reservation?
No.
Mavis Gary.
- Is that a dog in your bag?
- Nope.
We actually allow small pets with a cleaning deposit.
Good, because I have a small dog, in my vehicle.
I'll put that you have a dog.
How many keys do you need?
Two, please.
Expecting company?
Hi.
You.
Personal.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Slade.
I can't.
There's nothing I can do for you.
I love Mason more than I love you.
Hey, Buddy, this is Mavis.
Remember?
Mavis Gary?
I'm in town for this little real estate thing, and I...
I don't know, I just thought if you have time, and you wanna grab a drink, catch up?
Something like that.
All right, well, listen, call me and... and let me know.
All right, bye.
Fuck.
- Hey, Buddy.
- Mavis Gary.
- It's been... how long?
- I'm not sure.
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.
I am insanely busy as always.
Well, I don't know how long you're around with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
OK.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,
I could meet you at Woody's in I don't know, 15 minutes?
Spontaneous really isn't a thing these days.
I don't know if you heard, but I am a new dad.
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.
I got that announcement.
- Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
How about we meet tomorrow at this place called Champion O'Malley's?
- It's kind of fun.
- Of course, yes.
Yeah.
How does 8:00, 8:30 sound?
- 6:00 would be better.
- 6:00 is perfect.
Great, I'll see you at 6:00.
Maker's Mark.
What?
I'm sorry, but I think we went to high school together.
- At the same time?
- Yeah.
You're Mavis Gary?
Mavis Gary-Crane now.
I'm Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually next to yours, all through high school.
Matt...
Freehauf.
Yeah.
Yeah, your locker was right there.
Right next to mine.
We didn't run in the same circles.
You were pretty popular, if I remember correctly.
You won "Best Hair."
Did I?
What did you win?
I didn't.
They usually give out, like, 15 of those, and only to the same five people.
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it was really nice seeing you...
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?
Of course not.
Gross.
No, I live in Minneapolis.
I'm just here taking care of a little real estate thing.
- I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.
Yes, I am an author.
Children's books.
Y.A. That's industry speak for "Young Adult."
It's a very popular teen series.
It's everywhere.
It's huge.
- You've probably seen it.
- Vampires?
Hey, take that, liver.
Weren't you that hate crime guy?
Excuse me?
You totally were.
You're the hate crime guy.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?
Now I know who you are.
Matt, the hate crime guy.
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a...
When we were seniors, a bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods...
That's right.
...and hit me on the legs and dick with a crowbar.
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out that I wasn't really gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime anymore.
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
Fuck.
How's your dick?
Not good.
Not good.
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.
You know, it's just kind of does a...
Hard Jacks.
Do you know who drinks these?
I don't.
Buddy Slade.
That's an interesting fact.
Come here.
Do you wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes.
I can't tell you in here.
OK, you got me out here.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together.
- And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade.
All right.
I'm pretty sure he's married with a kid on the way.
No, kid's here.
She already had it.
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.
So wait, are you not joking?
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.
They just tend to happen in slow motion.
They get divorced, they reconfigure, and society is, like, fine with that if you take your time, like an emotional glacier.
I'm 37...
Mavis, I would keep all of this to yourself.
I would find a therapist.
Talk to a professional.
- Matt.
- Oh, boy.
Don't you get it?
Love conquers all.
Have you not seen The Graduate?
Or, like, I don't know, anything?
Oh, a taxi.
Yes, we called it.
Mavis, hey!
Buddy Slade has a life.
Buddy Slade has a life.
No, he has a baby, and babies are boring!
Having spent the summer outside Waverley Prep,
Kendal looked around at her fellow students, thinking,
"Did I really get that much better, or did everyone simply get worse?
Why was Ryan spending so much time with this dumpy new girl?"
Mavis, this is Jim.
Do you even have any pages?
I'm trying to help you, but I can't if you...
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh, yeah
Oh, no, not gonna need those.
You're gonna wanna try the popcorn shrimp.
No, I'm not.
A couple of Hard Jacks, please.
OK.
Hey.
Hey, you.
- Wow.
- Great to see you.
So...
This is quite the mid-week surprise.
Hey, I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, me neither.
But I thought, just for old times' sake.
Actually, I haven't been drinking recently.
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and now that she's nursing our girl,
I thought I'd show some solidarity.
Right.
So...
- You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.
Ad sales now.
My dad's still there, so we have lunch together most days.
Yeah.
Pizza or sub sandwiches.
Awesome.
I've just been working my little butt off in the city.
You know, doing my thing.
Down there in the old Mini Apple?
God, Buddy.
Nobody calls it the Mini Apple anymore.
I didn't know.
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.
Give our waitress a break.
So chivalrous.
Mavis.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You know, bookkeeping, dealing with vendors.
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?
Just catching up with a friend.
Oh, catching up with a friend.
There's Buddy Slade, acquiring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar.
You're not wasting any time, are you?
Look, it was really great hanging out with you last night.
- It was great.
- OK.
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie.
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?
Yeah.
It's so nice running into him.
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
You wanna join us for a round?
I would love to.
I would.
Sadly, I have work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied person to complete even the simplest task.
- So...
- Bummer.
I don't wanna step on your Mercury High reunion.
So...
Go, go, Injuns.
Actually, they changed the name to "Indians" back in '99, remember?
The local Fond du Lac tribe... did a whole thing with...
It sucks, what happened to Matt.
That poor guy suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.
Didn't you call him a theater fag all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.
Well, whatever.
Mercury's changed a lot since then, though.
We're way less of a hick town.
Really?
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?
And we're getting a new Chipotle at the mall.
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.
You know, one of those Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.
That's genius.
KenTacoHut.
You sound like one of your crazy characters.
Hey, so how's Allen?
Allen is great.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's good.
We're not married anymore, but...
Oh, sorry.
I didn't...
No, don't be sorry.
It's good.
It's fine.
Well, that's Allen's loss.
It sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.
She's got band practice tonight.
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.
Just something she does with the other moms.
Wow, cool.
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.
Oh, my God.
Embarrassing.
Actually, her band's playing here tomorrow night.
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow night to our house for a hang?
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.
- I would love that.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?
Sure.
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra.
She wants to be a writer someday.
Right, of course.
But you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside.
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
It's still a pretty big deal, compared to the rest of us.
It was so great seeing you.
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.
I do?
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed, you just got lucky.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.
- OK.
- Good night.
Hello?
Look, I just want you to know that what you think you saw tonight is not what it was, OK?
Oh, so you're not trying to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage.
It is way more complicated than you can possibly ever understand, OK?
Buddy Slade and I have years and years of history, and it is very rich, and very complex.
Wow, yeah, that sounds way beyond my comprehension.
Don't open a new ranch till the old one's done.
- What?
- That's my sister.
Forget it.
- Just so you know.
- I got it.
Thank you.
Do you want to get loaded, or something?
I'm Mavis.
I know.
From high school.
Right.
I made you those Rice Krispies squares that one time for your birthday.
I got your locker combination from the vice principal.
I put them in your locker?
Thank you.
- So where's Matt?
- In his cave.
Welcome to the distillery.
Are you making moonshine?
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.
You know what?
Hang on.
All right.
Check this out.
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong...
That's a limited...
There's not a lot.
- "Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.
Mos Eisley...
Star Wars thing.
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's...
Let's let that age a little longer.
And I got another in here.
OK.
Now, see if you can detect some of the new oak.
- Oh, come on.
- OK.
They're kind of hidden in there.
So when you sip...
- I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.
Let's do a little...
There you go.
Woody.
Oak.
So how'd the rest of your little date go?
- Good.
It was eye-opening.
- Yeah?
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
OK, he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
I'm thinking... it will be you.
- Aren't you a little old for G. I. Joes?
- That one's still wet.
No, it's fine.
Jesus.
- You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.
That one...
I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongul's body, so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead, and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.
I was tired and drunk.
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo.
I have to go check on something.
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.
I think this is it.
You think, or you know?
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty.
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.
You're fuckin' mentally ill.
- You see that window up there?
- Yep.
I bet Buddy is awake jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
Can I help you find something?
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.
It's not a formal occasion.
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
OK.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old flame, and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.
Let's show him what he's been missing.
No, he's seen me recently.
He knows.
But his wife hasn't seen me in a while, so...
Well, it's the end of my shift, and my son has to be picked up from school.
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.
Shawna!
Where are the Waverley Prep books?
They got their own display table right there.
Wow.
They must be really popular.
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
They were big a couple years ago, but the computer says, "Do not shelve," so...
Hey, are you writing in there?
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.
You're Jane MacMurray?
No.
Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.
Mavis Gary-Crane.
See?
Do you know Jane MacMurray?
Yes, I know her really well.
- I wrote the book.
- OK.
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
No, that's fine.
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
We're probably not gonna sell them.
The series is done.
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
Whatever, book man.
Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off.
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
Hers was a gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However, being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan the love of her life?
- What up?
- Hey.
How are you?
- How are you?
- Good, good.
Here's that book for your niece.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There is a character in that one that's based on you.
- What?
- In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...
Hey.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.
You, too.
There it is.
Adorable.
Thank you.
You love it.
You love it.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?
Oh, just a water.
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.
It's fine.
I'll just pump and dump after the show.
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes it does.
Oh, starting to get smiles.
Cute.
She's, like, Buddy's clone.
No.
I see you in there.
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw a nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm an author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular.
I like your decor.
Is it shabby chic?
Pier One?
A little bit Goodwill.
Buddy and I used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that?
The '90s?
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.
It was just, like, the dumbest thing ever.
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.
I used to sleep in his T-shirts and boxers.
I think I still have a few.
Hey.
I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- What?
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.
What's the chart?
Beth teaches special needs kids.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
So we need to show them "this is what happy looks like,"
"this is what anxious looks like," and so on.
What about neutral?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
Oh, my God.
- Is that Mavis Gary?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.
Shots.
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Really?
Come on, tequila time.
Salt.
So... are they any good?
Yeah, they're all right.
I knew it.
They're horrible.
I knew it.
Well, they have a lot of fun.
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.
He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy.
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.
Think he owns any clown suits?
- Oh, my God.
You're terrible.
- Come on.
- Dark.
- No.
Hello, Mercury!
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.
We are Nipple Confusion.
Yeah.
Please be kind, as this is only our second show.
And we all have small children at home.
Our first song is a cover.
This one goes out from our drummer, Beth, to her sweetheart, Buddy.
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh, yeah
Still she won't be forced against her will
Says she don't do drugs, but she does the pill
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh, yeah
When she's at the gig she takes her car...
Remember when we used to make out to this song?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this song was playing the first time I went down on you.
The first time I went...
I screwed up the fill so bad.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.
- You guys were namazing.
- Wait.
Did you just say "namazing"?
- I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.
Hardly.
It's so interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's so inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence on stage.
Really.
Beth, we gotta get home.
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.
I wanna stay out just a little while longer.
Yeah, Buddy, you can't have her back tonight.
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.
Really?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.
You sure?
Have fun.
Thanks, Mavis.
Easy.
Tolerance has gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, since I knew you?
- I still know you.
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Don't you have that babysitter till 11:00?
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
I know, we can't, but time is just so precious.
For real.
- It goes so fast.
- I know.
Man, I really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know.
I can tell you're a great father.
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.
You do too much, even.
You think so?
Yes.
You're a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
I thought I saw lights.
Hi, Daniel.
Yep, I'm home.
Where's Beth?
She wanted to stay out and party all night.
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and she doesn't want her "nuk" anymore.
I got it.
Good night, Buddy.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Wow.
- Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
There's some low-hanging fruit.
You are low-hanging fruit.
- Oh, no.
No.
- What?
I hate this guy over here.
That's my cousin, Mike.
Mike Moran is your cousin?
Unfortunately.
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
- Mavis?
- Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, coz, this is such a rad surprise.
Yeah, I'm in town just for a little real estate thing.
- How are you?
Yeah.
- I'm great.
Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary.
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood?
Porcelain?
- Strychnine?
- Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.
You mean rock crawling, right?
No, I'm vertical, bro, believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity.
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.
- You should try it, Matt.
- No.
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.
It's like Will Grace.
- It is.
- No, it isn't.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later.
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you got there.
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
God, he got so much attention.
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.
Please.
That dick ruined my sweet 16, same weekend.
God, you are a piece of work.
You're a piece of shit.
You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a cougar.
How I'm a cougar?
I'm not even 30 years old.
You're a cougar.
I am turning 30 this year and I am freaked out.
It's pretty old.
Kim Kardashian channels her own inner cougar.
Fuck.
The kiss was electric, transformative, spiritual, enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
I said, "Listen, Kyle, you're everything to me.
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"
- And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.
I'm gonna have a...
Hey, you.
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
How much longer are you gonna be in town?
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?
I was just wondering if you're still in town this weekend, if you wanna come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's this little hippy thing we're doing out in the yard.
It's not religious or anything...
- I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.
- Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.
Hey, Mom.
Were you even gonna say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like.
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom.
OK?
I was planning on calling.
Why didn't you just come and stay with us?
Because I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea.
I have tons and tons of work to catch up on.
Books still selling well?
It's like I can hardly keep up.
Is that the money you used to invest in local real estate?
I heard you were here to work on some kind of real estate transaction.
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
Honey?
- Look what I found.
- What?
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Who's this?
- This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.
- Dolce.
- Hello.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
You gotta start taking care of yourself, sweetie.
You know, a Lean Cuisine is not a meal.
Yeah, I think I might be an alcoholic.
Very funny.
- You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
You know what, Mom?
Can you please take down that photo of me and Allen?
Which picture, sweetie?
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
- Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
Actually I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy.
Oh, the old beau, huh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way, but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
The people who really know you best.
And that new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it?
Up close?
I suppose.
Is everything OK?
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.
It's just that Buddy used to say that we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
Yeah!
Sweet ride.
What is that, a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Oh, heavy.
How are they?
Horrible.
God, I've been through a lot.
- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?
Come on.
Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
- And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...
- Come on!
- Fine.
Could you walk any slower?
Our school is so ugly.
It looks like a factory.
It actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were such a slut.
I was normal.
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
How's the master plan unfolding?
Well, actually, he called me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
I don't know.
There's still so much that's unspoken, but he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man.
By all accounts, happily.
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.
He gave me his sweatshirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
You're one to talk.
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know you use this whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
"Scuffle."
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
OK?
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch they shattered my legs, bashed in my brains, mangled my cock, so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
Then they left me for dead.
You know, things aren't too great down south.
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
You know, what's done is done.
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past.
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser, trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It really is a shame that you're like this, because if you had a good personality, none of this other stuff would bother people.
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories, because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan still loved her, crystal clear.
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend, but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
Who was taking care of Kendal?
And on the subject of fair...
Was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
No.
Life wasn't fair, and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
Hi, Jan.
Oh, hi.
Wow, really been a long time.
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.
- Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?
Wow.
How are you doing?
I'm good.
- Good.
- I brought presents.
Oh, thank you.
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?
Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?
Yeah.
Are you having fun?
Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.
I think we should talk privately.
Sure, yeah.
Here, follow me.
OK.
OK, so what's going on?
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now.
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
Well, hey, she pushed it out.
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's in here and I know what's in here.
Buddy... you're my moon, my stars.
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis!
What are you doing?
OK.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
We can work this out.
You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know.
We can beat this together.
You're better than this.
I have to go.
I think you should leave.
Hey, look who's up.
Hey, let me take her.
Let me...
Come here.
There you are.
Can you do me a favor?
We need everybody outside.
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.
Those are delicious.
Hey, listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
Come on, let's go.
Mavis?
- What?
- Are you OK?
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here.
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh, my God.
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch.
Oh, my God.
You should see your face.
It's a joke.
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
I love your sweater.
I'll get you a rag.
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here.
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
You know, the funny thing is,
I could have had this party a long time ago.
This exact same party.
Yeah.
Buddy and I were together for four years, and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.
It is silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart.
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
And we were gonna keep it!
We were gonna have a little baby, and a little naming party, and a Funquarium, and all of that.
And then 12 weeks into it...
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable down south in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager, and probably even more kids, because we always found each other.
Always!
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
What the fuck?
It's a new drum set for Beth.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What is wrong with you?
Are you like one of those little kids who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?
That's enough, Mavis.
You're drunk.
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom, and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.
We all do, Mavis.
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness, some depression.
You're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying.
He's not.
Well.
What about now?
You hate me now?
'Cause it should be easy, 'cause I fucking hate you.
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?
Mavis, honey.
You know, I came back for you.
For you!
And I hate this town!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
But I came back.
I just wanted you to know that.
I screwed up.
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?
You're scaring me.
I'm crazy.
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
I ruined my dress.
I'll get you...
I'll get you a shirt.
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
Hide me.
It's OK.
Why Buddy?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
You know, I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker, shaped like a heart and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me,
and I was at my best.
Good morning.
Hi.
Coffee?
Sure.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over.
It got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last one right now.
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade from school.
Yeah.
I know that Beth.
What do you think of her?
I...
I...
I don't really like her.
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is.
What happened to your dress?
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
Shit.
What's wrong?
What did I say?
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
It's really difficult for me to be happy and then for other people, it just seems so simple.
I know.
They just grow up, and they're so... fulfilled.
I don't feel fulfilled.
- Well...
- And frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
I need to change, Sandra.
- No, you don't.
- What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book, or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
I mean, you think so?
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
You know, living in the big city, all famous and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special or whatever.
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
I'll sit and think about you, living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
It seems really nice.
Yeah.
But...
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you.
I needed that.
You're right.
This place blows.
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me?
Take me with you.
You know, to the Mini Apple.
You're good here, Sandra.
Oh.
Dolce.
I'm so sorry.
My baby.
Come here.
Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class, there was an unmistakable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day, it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
Good boy.
Poor Ryan...
Lost at sea.
They don't need those back.
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
Cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future.
A new chapter.
As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss thinking, "Life, here I come."
I'm just...
I don't feel pretty right now.
Having my friends here is great, but it's like, making my self-esteem go down really bad.
And they look so good, and they're just like, like the hottest girls in the world, and here I am just like and you're...
- Babe.
- I got to get ready.
- No, you don't.
Come here.
- That's just it.
- What?
Kendra, you are the most beautiful woman.
And don't let anybody coming around after you just had a baby, make you not feel that way, babe.
You want that?
All right, come on.
Follow me.
Kendal Strickland wasn't just the prettiest girl at Waverley Prep, she was a legend.
As a junior, the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her, even though another student had recently died.
Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?
When you send something that soon, it's for the inner circle.
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the father who doesn't talk to him anymore.
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I am not worked up in the slightest.
I was just trying to tell you about something that happened.
God!
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent parent.
Can you imagine still living in Mercury?
Trapped with a wife and a kid, and some crappy job?
It's like...
It's like he's a hostage.
Yup.
We're lucky we got out.
- Yes.
- We have lives.
Let me let you borrow an outfit 'cause that dress is hideous, honey.
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come with me now to the TV Guide party because who wants to go to a party by themselves?
- It's to die for.
- That is fab.
I just think that Tyler and I are like soul twins.
You know?
Right before he texts me,
- it's like I can...
- Sense it?
Yes!
Like psychically.
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
Like text chemistry.
Exactly.
Just as Kendal hit "send," a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied.
They had "textual chemistry."
So, all told, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
Why?
Long story short, I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.
Oh, my God.
Yikes.
Yeah, it was probably one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Of course.
Sure, totally.
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Dolce, take a pee.
Dolce, pee.
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Welcome to Hampton Inn.
Do you have a reservation?
No.
Mavis Gary.
- Is that a dog in your bag?
- Nope.
We actually allow small pets with a cleaning deposit.
Good, because I have a small dog, in my vehicle.
I'll put that you have a dog.
How many keys do you need?
Two, please.
Expecting company?
Hi.
You.
Personal.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Slade.
I can't.
There's nothing I can do for you.
I love Mason more than I love you.
Hey, Buddy, this is Mavis.
Remember?
Mavis Gary?
I'm in town for this little real estate thing, and I...
I don't know, I just thought if you have time, and you wanna grab a drink, catch up?
Something like that.
All right, well, listen, call me and... and let me know.
All right, bye.
Fuck.
- Hey, Buddy.
- Mavis Gary.
- It's been... how long?
- I'm not sure.
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.
I am insanely busy as always.
Well, I don't know how long you're around with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
OK.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,
I could meet you at Woody's in I don't know, 15 minutes?
Spontaneous really isn't a thing these days.
I don't know if you heard, but I am a new dad.
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.
I got that announcement.
- Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
How about we meet tomorrow at this place called Champion O'Malley's?
- It's kind of fun.
- Of course, yes.
Yeah.
How does 8:00, 8:30 sound?
- 6:00 would be better.
- 6:00 is perfect.
Great, I'll see you at 6:00.
Maker's Mark.
What?
I'm sorry, but I think we went to high school together.
- At the same time?
- Yeah.
You're Mavis Gary?
Mavis Gary-Crane now.
I'm Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually next to yours, all through high school.
Matt...
Freehauf.
Yeah.
Yeah, your locker was right there.
Right next to mine.
We didn't run in the same circles.
You were pretty popular, if I remember correctly.
You won "Best Hair."
Did I?
What did you win?
I didn't.
They usually give out, like, 15 of those, and only to the same five people.
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it was really nice seeing you...
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?
Of course not.
Gross.
No, I live in Minneapolis.
I'm just here taking care of a little real estate thing.
- I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.
Yes, I am an author.
Children's books.
Y.A. That's industry speak for "Young Adult."
It's a very popular teen series.
It's everywhere.
It's huge.
- You've probably seen it.
- Vampires?
Hey, take that, liver.
Weren't you that hate crime guy?
Excuse me?
You totally were.
You're the hate crime guy.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?
Now I know who you are.
Matt, the hate crime guy.
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a...
When we were seniors, a bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods...
That's right.
...and hit me on the legs and dick with a crowbar.
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out that I wasn't really gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime anymore.
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
Fuck.
How's your dick?
Not good.
Not good.
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.
You know, it's just kind of does a...
Hard Jacks.
Do you know who drinks these?
I don't.
Buddy Slade.
That's an interesting fact.
Come here.
Do you wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes.
I can't tell you in here.
OK, you got me out here.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together.
- And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade.
All right.
I'm pretty sure he's married with a kid on the way.
No, kid's here.
She already had it.
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.
So wait, are you not joking?
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.
They just tend to happen in slow motion.
They get divorced, they reconfigure, and society is, like, fine with that if you take your time, like an emotional glacier.
I'm 37...
Mavis, I would keep all of this to yourself.
I would find a therapist.
Talk to a professional.
- Matt.
- Oh, boy.
Don't you get it?
Love conquers all.
Have you not seen The Graduate?
Or, like, I don't know, anything?
Oh, a taxi.
Yes, we called it.
Mavis, hey!
Buddy Slade has a life.
Buddy Slade has a life.
No, he has a baby, and babies are boring!
Having spent the summer outside Waverley Prep,
Kendal looked around at her fellow students, thinking,
"Did I really get that much better, or did everyone simply get worse?
Why was Ryan spending so much time with this dumpy new girl?"
Mavis, this is Jim.
Do you even have any pages?
I'm trying to help you, but I can't if you...
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh, yeah
Oh, no, not gonna need those.
You're gonna wanna try the popcorn shrimp.
No, I'm not.
A couple of Hard Jacks, please.
OK.
Hey.
Hey, you.
- Wow.
- Great to see you.
So...
This is quite the mid-week surprise.
Hey, I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, me neither.
But I thought, just for old times' sake.
Actually, I haven't been drinking recently.
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and now that she's nursing our girl,
I thought I'd show some solidarity.
Right.
So...
- You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.
Ad sales now.
My dad's still there, so we have lunch together most days.
Yeah.
Pizza or sub sandwiches.
Awesome.
I've just been working my little butt off in the city.
You know, doing my thing.
Down there in the old Mini Apple?
God, Buddy.
Nobody calls it the Mini Apple anymore.
I didn't know.
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.
Give our waitress a break.
So chivalrous.
Mavis.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You know, bookkeeping, dealing with vendors.
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?
Just catching up with a friend.
Oh, catching up with a friend.
There's Buddy Slade, acquiring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar.
You're not wasting any time, are you?
Look, it was really great hanging out with you last night.
- It was great.
- OK.
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie.
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?
Yeah.
It's so nice running into him.
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
You wanna join us for a round?
I would love to.
I would.
Sadly, I have work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied person to complete even the simplest task.
- So...
- Bummer.
I don't wanna step on your Mercury High reunion.
So...
Go, go, Injuns.
Actually, they changed the name to "Indians" back in '99, remember?
The local Fond du Lac tribe... did a whole thing with...
It sucks, what happened to Matt.
That poor guy suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.
Didn't you call him a theater fag all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.
Well, whatever.
Mercury's changed a lot since then, though.
We're way less of a hick town.
Really?
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?
And we're getting a new Chipotle at the mall.
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.
You know, one of those Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.
That's genius.
KenTacoHut.
You sound like one of your crazy characters.
Hey, so how's Allen?
Allen is great.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's good.
We're not married anymore, but...
Oh, sorry.
I didn't...
No, don't be sorry.
It's good.
It's fine.
Well, that's Allen's loss.
It sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.
She's got band practice tonight.
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.
Just something she does with the other moms.
Wow, cool.
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.
Oh, my God.
Embarrassing.
Actually, her band's playing here tomorrow night.
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow night to our house for a hang?
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.
- I would love that.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?
Sure.
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra.
She wants to be a writer someday.
Right, of course.
But you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside.
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
It's still a pretty big deal, compared to the rest of us.
It was so great seeing you.
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.
I do?
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed, you just got lucky.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.
- OK.
- Good night.
Hello?
Look, I just want you to know that what you think you saw tonight is not what it was, OK?
Oh, so you're not trying to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage.
It is way more complicated than you can possibly ever understand, OK?
Buddy Slade and I have years and years of history, and it is very rich, and very complex.
Wow, yeah, that sounds way beyond my comprehension.
Don't open a new ranch till the old one's done.
- What?
- That's my sister.
Forget it.
- Just so you know.
- I got it.
Thank you.
Do you want to get loaded, or something?
I'm Mavis.
I know.
From high school.
Right.
I made you those Rice Krispies squares that one time for your birthday.
I got your locker combination from the vice principal.
I put them in your locker?
Thank you.
- So where's Matt?
- In his cave.
Welcome to the distillery.
Are you making moonshine?
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.
You know what?
Hang on.
All right.
Check this out.
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong...
That's a limited...
There's not a lot.
- "Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.
Mos Eisley...
Star Wars thing.
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's...
Let's let that age a little longer.
And I got another in here.
OK.
Now, see if you can detect some of the new oak.
- Oh, come on.
- OK.
They're kind of hidden in there.
So when you sip...
- I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.
Let's do a little...
There you go.
Woody.
Oak.
So how'd the rest of your little date go?
- Good.
It was eye-opening.
- Yeah?
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
OK, he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
I'm thinking... it will be you.
- Aren't you a little old for G. I. Joes?
- That one's still wet.
No, it's fine.
Jesus.
- You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.
That one...
I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongul's body, so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead, and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.
I was tired and drunk.
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo.
I have to go check on something.
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.
I think this is it.
You think, or you know?
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty.
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.
You're fuckin' mentally ill.
- You see that window up there?
- Yep.
I bet Buddy is awake jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
Can I help you find something?
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.
It's not a formal occasion.
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
OK.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old flame, and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.
Let's show him what he's been missing.
No, he's seen me recently.
He knows.
But his wife hasn't seen me in a while, so...
Well, it's the end of my shift, and my son has to be picked up from school.
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.
Shawna!
Where are the Waverley Prep books?
They got their own display table right there.
Wow.
They must be really popular.
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
They were big a couple years ago, but the computer says, "Do not shelve," so...
Hey, are you writing in there?
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.
You're Jane MacMurray?
No.
Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.
Mavis Gary-Crane.
See?
Do you know Jane MacMurray?
Yes, I know her really well.
- I wrote the book.
- OK.
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
No, that's fine.
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
We're probably not gonna sell them.
The series is done.
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
Whatever, book man.
Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off.
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
Hers was a gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However, being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan the love of her life?
- What up?
- Hey.
How are you?
- How are you?
- Good, good.
Here's that book for your niece.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There is a character in that one that's based on you.
- What?
- In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...
Hey.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.
You, too.
There it is.
Adorable.
Thank you.
You love it.
You love it.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?
Oh, just a water.
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.
It's fine.
I'll just pump and dump after the show.
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes it does.
Oh, starting to get smiles.
Cute.
She's, like, Buddy's clone.
No.
I see you in there.
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw a nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm an author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular.
I like your decor.
Is it shabby chic?
Pier One?
A little bit Goodwill.
Buddy and I used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that?
The '90s?
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.
It was just, like, the dumbest thing ever.
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.
I used to sleep in his T-shirts and boxers.
I think I still have a few.
Hey.
I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- What?
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.
What's the chart?
Beth teaches special needs kids.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
So we need to show them "this is what happy looks like,"
"this is what anxious looks like," and so on.
What about neutral?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
Oh, my God.
- Is that Mavis Gary?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.
Shots.
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Really?
Come on, tequila time.
Salt.
So... are they any good?
Yeah, they're all right.
I knew it.
They're horrible.
I knew it.
Well, they have a lot of fun.
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.
He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy.
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.
Think he owns any clown suits?
- Oh, my God.
You're terrible.
- Come on.
- Dark.
- No.
Hello, Mercury!
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.
We are Nipple Confusion.
Yeah.
Please be kind, as this is only our second show.
And we all have small children at home.
Our first song is a cover.
This one goes out from our drummer, Beth, to her sweetheart, Buddy.
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh, yeah
Still she won't be forced against her will
Says she don't do drugs, but she does the pill
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh, yeah
When she's at the gig she takes her car...
Remember when we used to make out to this song?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this song was playing the first time I went down on you.
The first time I went...
I screwed up the fill so bad.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.
- You guys were namazing.
- Wait.
Did you just say "namazing"?
- I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.
Hardly.
It's so interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's so inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence on stage.
Really.
Beth, we gotta get home.
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.
I wanna stay out just a little while longer.
Yeah, Buddy, you can't have her back tonight.
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.
Really?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.
You sure?
Have fun.
Thanks, Mavis.
Easy.
Tolerance has gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, since I knew you?
- I still know you.
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Don't you have that babysitter till 11:00?
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
I know, we can't, but time is just so precious.
For real.
- It goes so fast.
- I know.
Man, I really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know.
I can tell you're a great father.
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.
You do too much, even.
You think so?
Yes.
You're a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
I thought I saw lights.
Hi, Daniel.
Yep, I'm home.
Where's Beth?
She wanted to stay out and party all night.
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and she doesn't want her "nuk" anymore.
I got it.
Good night, Buddy.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Wow.
- Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
There's some low-hanging fruit.
You are low-hanging fruit.
- Oh, no.
No.
- What?
I hate this guy over here.
That's my cousin, Mike.
Mike Moran is your cousin?
Unfortunately.
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
- Mavis?
- Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, coz, this is such a rad surprise.
Yeah, I'm in town just for a little real estate thing.
- How are you?
Yeah.
- I'm great.
Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary.
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood?
Porcelain?
- Strychnine?
- Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.
You mean rock crawling, right?
No, I'm vertical, bro, believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity.
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.
- You should try it, Matt.
- No.
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.
It's like Will Grace.
- It is.
- No, it isn't.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later.
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you got there.
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
God, he got so much attention.
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.
Please.
That dick ruined my sweet 16, same weekend.
God, you are a piece of work.
You're a piece of shit.
You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a cougar.
How I'm a cougar?
I'm not even 30 years old.
You're a cougar.
I am turning 30 this year and I am freaked out.
It's pretty old.
Kim Kardashian channels her own inner cougar.
Fuck.
The kiss was electric, transformative, spiritual, enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
I said, "Listen, Kyle, you're everything to me.
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"
- And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.
I'm gonna have a...
Hey, you.
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
How much longer are you gonna be in town?
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?
I was just wondering if you're still in town this weekend, if you wanna come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's this little hippy thing we're doing out in the yard.
It's not religious or anything...
- I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.
- Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.
Hey, Mom.
Were you even gonna say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like.
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom.
OK?
I was planning on calling.
Why didn't you just come and stay with us?
Because I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea.
I have tons and tons of work to catch up on.
Books still selling well?
It's like I can hardly keep up.
Is that the money you used to invest in local real estate?
I heard you were here to work on some kind of real estate transaction.
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
Honey?
- Look what I found.
- What?
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Who's this?
- This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.
- Dolce.
- Hello.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
You gotta start taking care of yourself, sweetie.
You know, a Lean Cuisine is not a meal.
Yeah, I think I might be an alcoholic.
Very funny.
- You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
You know what, Mom?
Can you please take down that photo of me and Allen?
Which picture, sweetie?
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
- Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
Actually I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy.
Oh, the old beau, huh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way, but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
The people who really know you best.
And that new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it?
Up close?
I suppose.
Is everything OK?
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.
It's just that Buddy used to say that we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
Yeah!
Sweet ride.
What is that, a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Oh, heavy.
How are they?
Horrible.
God, I've been through a lot.
- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?
Come on.
Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
- And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...
- Come on!
- Fine.
Could you walk any slower?
Our school is so ugly.
It looks like a factory.
It actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were such a slut.
I was normal.
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
How's the master plan unfolding?
Well, actually, he called me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
I don't know.
There's still so much that's unspoken, but he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man.
By all accounts, happily.
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.
He gave me his sweatshirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
You're one to talk.
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know you use this whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
"Scuffle."
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
OK?
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch they shattered my legs, bashed in my brains, mangled my cock, so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
Then they left me for dead.
You know, things aren't too great down south.
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
You know, what's done is done.
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past.
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser, trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It really is a shame that you're like this, because if you had a good personality, none of this other stuff would bother people.
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories, because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan still loved her, crystal clear.
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend, but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
Who was taking care of Kendal?
And on the subject of fair...
Was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
No.
Life wasn't fair, and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
Hi, Jan.
Oh, hi.
Wow, really been a long time.
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.
- Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?
Wow.
How are you doing?
I'm good.
- Good.
- I brought presents.
Oh, thank you.
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?
Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?
Yeah.
Are you having fun?
Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.
I think we should talk privately.
Sure, yeah.
Here, follow me.
OK.
OK, so what's going on?
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now.
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
Well, hey, she pushed it out.
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's in here and I know what's in here.
Buddy... you're my moon, my stars.
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis!
What are you doing?
OK.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
We can work this out.
You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know.
We can beat this together.
You're better than this.
I have to go.
I think you should leave.
Hey, look who's up.
Hey, let me take her.
Let me...
Come here.
There you are.
Can you do me a favor?
We need everybody outside.
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.
Those are delicious.
Hey, listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
Come on, let's go.
Mavis?
- What?
- Are you OK?
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here.
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh, my God.
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch.
Oh, my God.
You should see your face.
It's a joke.
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
I love your sweater.
I'll get you a rag.
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here.
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
You know, the funny thing is,
I could have had this party a long time ago.
This exact same party.
Yeah.
Buddy and I were together for four years, and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.
It is silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart.
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
And we were gonna keep it!
We were gonna have a little baby, and a little naming party, and a Funquarium, and all of that.
And then 12 weeks into it...
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable down south in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager, and probably even more kids, because we always found each other.
Always!
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
What the fuck?
It's a new drum set for Beth.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What is wrong with you?
Are you like one of those little kids who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?
That's enough, Mavis.
You're drunk.
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom, and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.
We all do, Mavis.
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness, some depression.
You're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying.
He's not.
Well.
What about now?
You hate me now?
'Cause it should be easy, 'cause I fucking hate you.
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?
Mavis, honey.
You know, I came back for you.
For you!
And I hate this town!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
But I came back.
I just wanted you to know that.
I screwed up.
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?
You're scaring me.
I'm crazy.
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
I ruined my dress.
I'll get you...
I'll get you a shirt.
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
Hide me.
It's OK.
Why Buddy?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
You know, I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker, shaped like a heart and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me,
and I was at my best.
Good morning.
Hi.
Coffee?
Sure.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over.
It got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last one right now.
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade from school.
Yeah.
I know that Beth.
What do you think of her?
I...
I...
I don't really like her.
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is.
What happened to your dress?
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
Shit.
What's wrong?
What did I say?
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
It's really difficult for me to be happy and then for other people, it just seems so simple.
I know.
They just grow up, and they're so... fulfilled.
I don't feel fulfilled.
- Well...
- And frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
I need to change, Sandra.
- No, you don't.
- What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book, or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
I mean, you think so?
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
You know, living in the big city, all famous and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special or whatever.
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
I'll sit and think about you, living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
It seems really nice.
Yeah.
But...
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you.
I needed that.
You're right.
This place blows.
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me?
Take me with you.
You know, to the Mini Apple.
You're good here, Sandra.
Oh.
Dolce.
I'm so sorry.
My baby.
Come here.
Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class, there was an unmistakable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day, it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
Good boy.
Poor Ryan...
Lost at sea.
They don't need those back.
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
Cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future.
A new chapter.
As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss thinking, "Life, here I come."
I'm just...
I don't feel pretty right now.
Having my friends here is great, but it's like, making my self-esteem go down really bad.
And they look so good, and they're just like, like the hottest girls in the world, and here I am just like and you're...
- Babe.
I got to get ready.
- No, you don't.
Come here.
That's just it.
- What?
Kendra, you are the most beautiful woman.
And don't let anybody coming around after you just had a baby, make you not feel that way, babe.
You want that?
All right, come on.
Follow me.
Kendal Strickland wasn't just the prettiest girl at Waverley Prep, she was a legend.
As a junior, the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her, even though another student had recently died.
Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?
When you send something that soon, it's for the inner circle.
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the father who doesn't talk to him anymore.
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I am not worked up in the slightest.
I was just trying to tell you about something that happened.
God!
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent parent.
Can you imagine still living in Mercury?
Trapped with a wife and a kid, and some crappy job?
It's like...
It's like he's a hostage.
Yup.
We're lucky we got out.
Yes.
- We have lives.
Let me let you borrow an outfit 'cause that dress is hideous, honey.
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come with me now to the TV Guide party because who wants to go to a party by themselves?
It's to die for.
- That is fab.
I just think that Tyler and I are like soul twins.
You know?
Right before he texts me, it's like I can...
- Sense it?
Yes!
Like psychically.
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
Like text chemistry.
Exactly.
Just as Kendal hit "send," a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied.
They had "textual chemistry."
So, all told, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
Why?
Long story short, I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.
Oh, my God.
Yikes.
Yeah, it was probably one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Of course.
Sure, totally.
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Dolce, take a pee.
Dolce, pee.
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Welcome to Hampton Inn.
Do you have a reservation?
No.
Mavis Gary.
Is that a dog in your bag?
- Nope.
We actually allow small pets with a cleaning deposit.
Good, because I have a small dog, in my vehicle.
I'll put that you have a dog.
How many keys do you need?
Two, please.
Expecting company?
Hi.
You.
Personal.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Slade.
I can't.
There's nothing I can do for you.
I love Mason more than I love you.
Hey, Buddy, this is Mavis.
Remember?
Mavis Gary?
I'm in town for this little real estate thing, and I...
I don't know, I just thought if you have time, and you wanna grab a drink, catch up?
Something like that.
All right, well, listen, call me and... and let me know.
All right, bye.
Fuck.
Hey, Buddy.
- Mavis Gary.
It's been... how long?
- I'm not sure.
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.
I am insanely busy as always.
Well, I don't know how long you're around with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
OK.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,
I could meet you at Woody's in I don't know, 15 minutes?
Spontaneous really isn't a thing these days.
I don't know if you heard, but I am a new dad.
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.
I got that announcement.
Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
How about we meet tomorrow at this place called Champion O'Malley's?
It's kind of fun.
- Of course, yes.
Yeah.
How does 8:00, 8:30 sound?
6:00 would be better.
- 6:00 is perfect.
Great, I'll see you at 6:00.
Maker's Mark.
What?
I'm sorry, but I think we went to high school together.
At the same time?
- Yeah.
You're Mavis Gary?
Mavis Gary-Crane now.
I'm Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually next to yours, all through high school.
Matt...
Freehauf.
Yeah.
Yeah, your locker was right there.
Right next to mine.
We didn't run in the same circles.
You were pretty popular, if I remember correctly.
You won "Best Hair."
Did I?
What did you win?
I didn't.
They usually give out, like, 15 of those, and only to the same five people.
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it was really nice seeing you...
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?
Of course not.
Gross.
No, I live in Minneapolis.
I'm just here taking care of a little real estate thing.
I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.
Yes, I am an author.
Children's books.
Y.A. That's industry speak for "Young Adult."
It's a very popular teen series.
It's everywhere.
It's huge.
You've probably seen it.
- Vampires?
Hey, take that, liver.
Weren't you that hate crime guy?
Excuse me?
You totally were.
You're the hate crime guy.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?
Now I know who you are.
Matt, the hate crime guy.
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a...
When we were seniors, a bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods...
That's right.
...and hit me on the legs and dick with a crowbar.
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out that I wasn't really gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime anymore.
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
Fuck.
How's your dick?
Not good.
Not good.
Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.
You know, it's just kind of does a...
Hard Jacks.
Do you know who drinks these?
I don't.
Buddy Slade.
That's an interesting fact.
Come here.
Do you wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes.
I can't tell you in here.
OK, you got me out here.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together.
And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade.
All right.
I'm pretty sure he's married with a kid on the way.
No, kid's here.
She already had it.
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.
So wait, are you not joking?
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.
They just tend to happen in slow motion.
They get divorced, they reconfigure, and society is, like, fine with that if you take your time, like an emotional glacier.
I'm 37...
Mavis, I would keep all of this to yourself.
I would find a therapist.
Talk to a professional.
Matt.
- Oh, boy.
Don't you get it?
Love conquers all.
Have you not seen The Graduate?
Or, like, I don't know, anything?
Oh, a taxi.
Yes, we called it.
Mavis, hey!
Buddy Slade has a life.
Buddy Slade has a life.
No, he has a baby, and babies are boring!
Having spent the summer outside Waverley Prep,
Kendal looked around at her fellow students, thinking,
"Did I really get that much better, or did everyone simply get worse?
Why was Ryan spending so much time with this dumpy new girl?"
Mavis, this is Jim.
Do you even have any pages?
I'm trying to help you, but I can't if you...
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh, yeah
Oh, no, not gonna need those.
You're gonna wanna try the popcorn shrimp.
No, I'm not.
A couple of Hard Jacks, please.
OK.
Hey.
Hey, you.
Wow.
- Great to see you.
So...
This is quite the mid-week surprise.
Hey, I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, me neither.
But I thought, just for old times' sake.
Actually, I haven't been drinking recently.
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and now that she's nursing our girl,
I thought I'd show some solidarity.
Right.
So...
You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.
Ad sales now.
My dad's still there, so we have lunch together most days.
Yeah.
Pizza or sub sandwiches.
Awesome.
I've just been working my little butt off in the city.
You know, doing my thing.
Down there in the old Mini Apple?
God, Buddy.
Nobody calls it the Mini Apple anymore.
I didn't know.
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.
Give our waitress a break.
So chivalrous.
Mavis.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You know, bookkeeping, dealing with vendors.
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?
Just catching up with a friend.
Oh, catching up with a friend.
There's Buddy Slade, acquiring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar.
You're not wasting any time, are you?
Look, it was really great hanging out with you last night.
It was great.
- OK.
Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.
What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.
Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie.
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?
Yeah.
It's so nice running into him.
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
You wanna join us for a round?
I would love to.
I would.
Sadly, I have work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied person to complete even the simplest task.
So...
- Bummer.
I don't wanna step on your Mercury High reunion.
So...
Go, go, Injuns.
Actually, they changed the name to "Indians" back in '99, remember?
The local Fond du Lac tribe... did a whole thing with...
It sucks, what happened to Matt.
That poor guy suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.
Didn't you call him a theater fag all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.
Well, whatever.
Mercury's changed a lot since then, though.
We're way less of a hick town.
Really?
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?
And we're getting a new Chipotle at the mall.
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.
You know, one of those Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...
Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.
That's genius.
KenTacoHut.
You sound like one of your crazy characters.
Hey, so how's Allen?
Allen is great.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's good.
We're not married anymore, but...
Oh, sorry.
I didn't...
No, don't be sorry.
It's good.
It's fine.
Well, that's Allen's loss.
It sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.
She's got band practice tonight.
Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.
Just something she does with the other moms.
Wow, cool.
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.
Oh, my God.
Embarrassing.
Actually, her band's playing here tomorrow night.
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow night to our house for a hang?
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.
I would love that.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?
Sure.
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra.
She wants to be a writer someday.
Right, of course.
But you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside.
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
It's still a pretty big deal, compared to the rest of us.
It was so great seeing you.
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.
I do?
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed, you just got lucky.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.
OK.
- Good night.
Hello?
Look, I just want you to know that what you think you saw tonight is not what it was, OK?
Oh, so you're not trying to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage.
It is way more complicated than you can possibly ever understand, OK?
Buddy Slade and I have years and years of history, and it is very rich, and very complex.
Wow, yeah, that sounds way beyond my comprehension.
Don't open a new ranch till the old one's done.
What?
- That's my sister.
Forget it.
Just so you know.
- I got it.
Thank you.
Do you want to get loaded, or something?
I'm Mavis.
I know.
From high school.
Right.
I made you those Rice Krispies squares that one time for your birthday.
I got your locker combination from the vice principal.
I put them in your locker?
Thank you.
So where's Matt?
- In his cave.
Welcome to the distillery.
Are you making moonshine?
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.
You know what?
Hang on.
All right.
Check this out.
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong...
That's a limited...
There's not a lot.
"Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.
Mos Eisley...
Star Wars thing.
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's...
Let's let that age a little longer.
And I got another in here.
OK.
Now, see if you can detect some of the new oak.
Oh, come on.
- OK.
They're kind of hidden in there.
So when you sip...
I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.
Let's do a little...
There you go.
Woody.
Oak.
So how'd the rest of your little date go?
Good.
It was eye-opening.
- Yeah?
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
OK, he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
I'm thinking... it will be you.
Aren't you a little old for G. I. Joes?
- That one's still wet.
No, it's fine.
Jesus.
You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.
That one...
I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongul's body, so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead, and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.
I was tired and drunk.
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo.
I have to go check on something.
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.
I think this is it.
You think, or you know?
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty.
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.
You're fuckin' mentally ill.
You see that window up there?
- Yep.
I bet Buddy is awake jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
Can I help you find something?
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.
It's not a formal occasion.
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
OK.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old flame, and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.
Let's show him what he's been missing.
No, he's seen me recently.
He knows.
But his wife hasn't seen me in a while, so...
Well, it's the end of my shift, and my son has to be picked up from school.
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.
Shawna!
Where are the Waverley Prep books?
They got their own display table right there.
Wow.
They must be really popular.
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
They were big a couple years ago, but the computer says, "Do not shelve," so...
Hey, are you writing in there?
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.
You're Jane MacMurray?
No.
Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.
Mavis Gary-Crane.
See?
Do you know Jane MacMurray?
Yes, I know her really well.
I wrote the book.
- OK.
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
No, that's fine.
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
We're probably not gonna sell them.
The series is done.
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
Whatever, book man.
Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off.
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
Hers was a gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However, being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan the love of her life?
What up?
- Hey.
How are you?
How are you?
- Good, good.
Here's that book for your niece.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There is a character in that one that's based on you.
What?
- In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...
Hey.
Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.
You, too.
There it is.
Adorable.
Thank you.
You love it.
You love it.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?
Oh, just a water.
Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.
It's fine.
I'll just pump and dump after the show.
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes it does.
Oh, starting to get smiles.
Cute.
She's, like, Buddy's clone.
No.
I see you in there.
Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.
Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.
Thank you.
- Here you go.
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw a nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm an author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular.
I like your decor.
Is it shabby chic?
Pier One?
A little bit Goodwill.
Buddy and I used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that?
The '90s?
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.
It was just, like, the dumbest thing ever.
The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.
I used to sleep in his T-shirts and boxers.
I think I still have a few.
Hey.
I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- What?
Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.
What's the chart?
Beth teaches special needs kids.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
So we need to show them "this is what happy looks like,"
"this is what anxious looks like," and so on.
What about neutral?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
Oh, my God.
Is that Mavis Gary?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.
Shots.
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Really?
Come on, tequila time.
Salt.
So... are they any good?
Yeah, they're all right.
I knew it.
They're horrible.
I knew it.
Well, they have a lot of fun.
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.
He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy.
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.
Think he owns any clown suits?
Oh, my God.
You're terrible.
- Come on.
Dark.
- No.
Hello, Mercury!
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.
We are Nipple Confusion.
Yeah.
Please be kind, as this is only our second show.
And we all have small children at home.
Our first song is a cover.
This one goes out from our drummer, Beth, to her sweetheart, Buddy.
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh, yeah
Still she won't be forced against her will
Says she don't do drugs, but she does the pill
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh, yeah
When she's at the gig she takes her car...
Remember when we used to make out to this song?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this song was playing the first time I went down on you.
The first time I went...
I screwed up the fill so bad.
Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.
You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?
That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.
You guys were namazing.
- Wait.
Did you just say "namazing"?
I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.
Hardly.
It's so interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's so inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence on stage.
Really.
Beth, we gotta get home.
We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.
I wanna stay out just a little while longer.
Yeah, Buddy, you can't have her back tonight.
Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.
Really?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.
You sure?
Have fun.
Thanks, Mavis.
Easy.
Tolerance has gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, since I knew you?
I still know you.
Come here.
- Yeah.
Wait.
- What?
Don't you have that babysitter till 11:00?
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
I know, we can't, but time is just so precious.
For real.
It goes so fast.
- I know.
Man, I really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know.
I can tell you're a great father.
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.
You do too much, even.
You think so?
Yes.
You're a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
I thought I saw lights.
Hi, Daniel.
Yep, I'm home.
Where's Beth?
She wanted to stay out and party all night.
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and she doesn't want her "nuk" anymore.
I got it.
Good night, Buddy.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Wow.
Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
There's some low-hanging fruit.
You are low-hanging fruit.
Oh, no.
No.
- What?
I hate this guy over here.
That's my cousin, Mike.
Mike Moran is your cousin?
Unfortunately.
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
Mavis?
- Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, coz, this is such a rad surprise.
Yeah, I'm in town just for a little real estate thing.
How are you?
Yeah.
- I'm great.
Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary.
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood?
Porcelain?
Strychnine?
- Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.
You mean rock crawling, right?
No, I'm vertical, bro, believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity.
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.
You should try it, Matt.
- No.
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.
It's like Will Grace.
It is.
- No, it isn't.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later.
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you got there.
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
God, he got so much attention.
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.
Please.
That dick ruined my sweet 16, same weekend.
God, you are a piece of work.
You're a piece of shit.
You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a cougar.
How I'm a cougar?
I'm not even 30 years old.
You're a cougar.
I am turning 30 this year and I am freaked out.
It's pretty old.
Kim Kardashian channels her own inner cougar.
Fuck.
The kiss was electric, transformative, spiritual, enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
I said, "Listen, Kyle, you're everything to me.
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"
And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.
I'm gonna have a...
Hey, you.
Hey, how are you?
- I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
How much longer are you gonna be in town?
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?
I was just wondering if you're still in town this weekend, if you wanna come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's this little hippy thing we're doing out in the yard.
It's not religious or anything...
I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.
Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.
Hey, Mom.
Were you even gonna say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like.
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom.
OK?
I was planning on calling.
Why didn't you just come and stay with us?
Because I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea.
I have tons and tons of work to catch up on.
Books still selling well?
It's like I can hardly keep up.
Is that the money you used to invest in local real estate?
I heard you were here to work on some kind of real estate transaction.
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
Honey?
Look what I found.
- What?
Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Who's this?
This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.
Dolce.
- Hello.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
You gotta start taking care of yourself, sweetie.
You know, a Lean Cuisine is not a meal.
Yeah, I think I might be an alcoholic.
Very funny.
You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
You know what, Mom?
Can you please take down that photo of me and Allen?
Which picture, sweetie?
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
Actually I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy.
Oh, the old beau, huh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way, but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
The people who really know you best.
And that new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it?
Up close?
I suppose.
Is everything OK?
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.
It's just that Buddy used to say that we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
Yeah!
Sweet ride.
What is that, a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Oh, heavy.
How are they?
Horrible.
God, I've been through a lot.
Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?
Come on.
Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...
Come on!
- Fine.
Could you walk any slower?
Our school is so ugly.
It looks like a factory.
It actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were such a slut.
I was normal.
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
How's the master plan unfolding?
Well, actually, he called me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
I don't know.
There's still so much that's unspoken, but he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man.
By all accounts, happily.
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.
He gave me his sweatshirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
You're one to talk.
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know you use this whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
"Scuffle."
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
OK?
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch they shattered my legs, bashed in my brains, mangled my cock, so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
Then they left me for dead.
You know, things aren't too great down south.
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
You know, what's done is done.
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past.
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser, trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It really is a shame that you're like this, because if you had a good personality, none of this other stuff would bother people.
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories, because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan still loved her, crystal clear.
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend, but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
Who was taking care of Kendal?
And on the subject of fair...
Was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
No.
Life wasn't fair, and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
Hi, Jan.
Oh, hi.
Wow, really been a long time.
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.
Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
Hi!
- Hey, how are you?
Wow.
How are you doing?
I'm good.
Good.
- I brought presents.
Oh, thank you.
Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.
Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?
Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?
Yeah.
Are you having fun?
Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.
I think we should talk privately.
Sure, yeah.
Here, follow me.
OK.
OK, so what's going on?
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now.
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
Well, hey, she pushed it out.
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's in here and I know what's in here.
Buddy... you're my moon, my stars.
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis!
What are you doing?
OK.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
We can work this out.
You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.
Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know.
We can beat this together.
You're better than this.
I have to go.
I think you should leave.
Hey, look who's up.
Hey, let me take her.
Let me...
Come here.
There you are.
Can you do me a favor?
We need everybody outside.
I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.
Those are delicious.
Hey, listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
Come on, let's go.
Mavis?
What?
- Are you OK?
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here.
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh, my God.
I'll get some...
- Fuck you.
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch.
Oh, my God.
You should see your face.
It's a joke.
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
I love your sweater.
I'll get you a rag.
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here.
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
You know, the funny thing is,
I could have had this party a long time ago.
This exact same party.
Yeah.
Buddy and I were together for four years, and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.
It is silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart.
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
And we were gonna keep it!
We were gonna have a little baby, and a little naming party, and a Funquarium, and all of that.
And then 12 weeks into it...
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable down south in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager, and probably even more kids, because we always found each other.
Always!
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
What the fuck?
It's a new drum set for Beth.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What is wrong with you?
Are you like one of those little kids who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?
That's enough, Mavis.
You're drunk.
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom, and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.
We all do, Mavis.
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness, some depression.
You're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying.
He's not.
Well.
What about now?
You hate me now?
'Cause it should be easy, 'cause I fucking hate you.
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?
Mavis, honey.
You know, I came back for you.
For you!
And I hate this town!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
But I came back.
I just wanted you to know that.
I screwed up.
I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?
You're scaring me.
I'm crazy.
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
I ruined my dress.
I'll get you...
I'll get you a shirt.
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
Hide me.
It's OK.
Why Buddy?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
You know, I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker, shaped like a heart and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me, and I was at my best.
Good morning.
Hi.
Coffee?
Sure.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over.
It got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last one right now.
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade from school.
Yeah.
I know that Beth.
What do you think of her?
I...
I...
I don't really like her.
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is.
What happened to your dress?
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
Shit.
What's wrong?
What did I say?
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
It's really difficult for me to be happy and then for other people, it just seems so simple.
I know.
They just grow up, and they're so... fulfilled.
I don't feel fulfilled.
Well...
- And frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
I need to change, Sandra.
No, you don't.
- What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book, or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
I mean, you think so?
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
You know, living in the big city, all famous and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special or whatever.
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
I'll sit and think about you, living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
It seems really nice.
Yeah.
But...
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you.
I needed that.
You're right.
This place blows.
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me?
Take me with you.
You know, to the Mini Apple.
You're good here, Sandra.
Oh.
Dolce.
I'm so sorry.
My baby.
Come here.
Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class, there was an unmistakable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day, it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
Good boy.
Poor Ryan...
Lost at sea.
They don't need those back.
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
Cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future.
A new chapter.
As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss thinking, "Life, here I come."
I'm just...
I don't feel pretty right now.
Having my friends here is great, but it's like making my self-esteem go down really bad.
And they look so good, and they're just like, like the hottest girls in the world, and here I am just like...
- ... and you're...
- Babe.
- I got to get ready.
- No, you don't.
Come here.
- That's just it.
- What?
Kendra, you are the most beautiful woman.
And don't let anybody coming around after you just had a baby, make you not feel that way, babe.
Ow!
You want that?
All right, come on.
Follow me.
Kendal Strickland wasn't just the prettiest girl at Waverley Prep, she was a legend.
As a junior, the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her, even though another student had recently died.
Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?
When you send something that soon, it's for the inner circle.
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the father who doesn't talk to him any more.
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I am not worked up in the slightest.
I was just trying to tell you about something that happened.
God!
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent parent.
Can you imagine still living in Mercury'?
Trapped with a wife and a kid and some crappy job?
It's like...
It's like he's a hostage.
Yup.
We're lucky we got out.
- Yes.
- We have lives.
Let me let you borrow an outfit 'cause that dress is hideous, honey.
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come with me now to the TV Guide party because who wants to go to a party by themselves?
- It's to die for.
- That is fab.
I just think that Tyler and I are like soul twins.
You know?
Right before he texts me,
- it's like I can...
- Sense it?
Yes!
Like psychically.
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
Like text chemistry.
- 'Exactly.
Just as Kendal hit "send," a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied.
They had "textual chemistry."
So, all told, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
- Why?
- Uh...
Long story short, I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.
Oh, my God.
Yikes.
Yeah, it was probably one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Of course.
Sure, totally.

Welcome to Hampton Inn.
Do you have a reservation?
No.
Mavis Gary.
- Is that a dog in your bag?
- Nope.
We actually allow small pets with a cleaning deposit.
Good, because I have a small dog, in my vehicle.
I'll put that you have a dog.
How many keys do you need?
Two, please.
Expecting company?
Oh!
Hi.
YOU.
Personal.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Slade.
I can't.
There's nothing I can do for you.
I love Mason more than I love you.
Hey, Buddy, this is Mavis.
Remember?
Mavis Gary'?
I'm in town for this little real estate thing, and I, um...
I don't know, I just thought if you have time, and you wanna grab a drink, catch up?
Something like that.
Um...
All right, well, listen, call me and, um...
and let me know.
All right, bye.
Fuck.
- Hey, Buddy.
- Mavis Gary.
- It's been, uh... how long?
- I'm not sure.
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.
I am insanely busy as always.
Well, I don't know how long you're around with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
OK.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,
I could meet you at, uh, Woody's in I don't know, 15 minutes?
Spontaneous really isn't a thing these days.
I don't know if you heard, but I am a new dad.
Duh!
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.
I got that, uh, announcement.
- Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
How about we meet tomorrow at this place called Champion O'Malley's?
- It's kind of fun.
- Of course, yes.
Yeah.
How, um...
how does 8:00, 8:30 sound?
- 6:00 would be better.
- 6:00 is perfect.
Great, I'll see you at 6:00.
"Achin' To Be"
Maker's Mark.
What?
I'm sorry, but I think we went to high school together.
- At the same time?
- Yeah.
You're Mavis Gary'?
Mavis Gary-Crane now.
I'm Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually next to yours, all through high school.
Matt...
Freehauf.
Yeah.
Yeah, your locker was right there.
Right next to mine.
We didn't run in the same circles.
You were pretty popular, if I remember correctly.
You won "Best Hair."
Did I?
What did you win?
I didn't.
Uh, they usually give out, like, 15 of those, and only to the same five people.
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it was really nice seeing you...
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?
Of course not.
Gross.
- No, I live in Minneapolis.
- Oh.
I'm just here taking care of a little real estate thing.
- I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.
Yes, I am an author.
Children's books.
Y.A. That's industry speak for "Young Adult."
It's a very popular teen series.
It's everywhere.
It's huge.
- You've probably seen it.
- Uh, vampires?
"It's A Shame About Ray"
Hey, take that, liver.
Weren't you that hate crime guy'?
Excuse me?
You totally were.
You're the hate crime guy.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?
Now I know who you are.
Matt, the hate crime guy.
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a...
When we were seniors, a bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods...
That's right.
...and hit me on the legs and dick with a crowbar.
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out that I wasn't really gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime any more.
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
Fuck.
How's your dick?
Not good.
Not good.
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.
You know, it's just kind of does a...
Hard Jacks.
Do you know who drinks these?
I don't.
Buddy Slade.
That's an interesting fact.
Come here.
Do you wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes.
I can't tell you in here.
OK, you got me out here.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together.
- And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade.
All right.
I'm pretty sure he's married with a kid on the way.
No, kid's here.
She already had it.
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.
So wait, are you not joking?
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.
They just tend to happen in slow motion.
They get divorced, they reconfigure, and society is, like, fine with that if you take your time, like an emotional glacier.
I'm 37...
Mavis, I would keep all of this to yourself.
I would find a therapist.
Talk to a professional.
- Matt.
- Oh, boy.
Don't you get it?
Love conquers all.
Have you not seen The Graduate?
Or, like, I don't know, anything?
Oh, a taxi.
Yes, we called it.
Ma...
Mavis, hey!
Buddy Slade has a life.
Buddy Slade has a life.
No, he has a baby, and babies are boring!
Having spent the summer outside Waverley Prep,
Kendal looked around at her fellow students, thinking,
"Did I really get that much better, or did everyone simply get worse?
Why was Ryan spending so much time with this dumpy new girl?"
Mavis, this is Jim.
Do you even have any pages?
I'm trying to help you, but I can't if you...
♪ Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
♪ Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
♪ Oh, yeah
Oh, no, not gonna need those.
Oh.
You're gonna wanna try the popcorn shrimp.
No, I'm not.
A couple of Hard Jacks, please.
OK.
Hey.
Hey, you.
- Wow.
- Great to see you.
Mm...
So...
This is, uh, quite the mid-week surprise.
Hey, I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, me neither.
But I thought, you know, just for old times' sake.
Actually, I haven't been drinking recently.
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and now that she's nursing our girl,
I thought I'd show some solidarity.
Right.
So...
- You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.
Ad sales now.
My dad's still there, so we have lunch together most days.
Yeah.
Pizza or sub sandwiches.
Awesome.
I've just been working my little butt off in the city.
You know, doing my thing.
Down there in the old Mini Apple?
God, Buddy.
Nobody calls it the Mini Apple any more.
I didn't know.
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.
Give our waitress a break.
So chivalrous.
Mavis.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You know, bookkeeping, dealing with vendors.
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?
Just catching up with a friend.
Oh, catching up with a friend.
There's Buddy Slade, acquiring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar.
You're not wasting any time, are you?
Look, it was really great hanging out with you last night.
- It was great.
- OK.
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie.
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
It's so nice running into him.
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
You wanna join us for a round?
I would love to.
I would.
Sadly, I have work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied person to complete even the simplest task.
- So...
- Bummer.
I don't wanna step on your Mercury High reunion.
So...
Go, go, Injuns.
Actually, uh, they changed the name to "indians" back in '99, remember?
The local Fond du Lac tribe did a whole thing with...
It sucks, what happened to Matt.
That poor guy suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.
Didn't you call him a theater fag all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.
Well, whatever.
Mercury's changed a lot since then, though.
We're way less of a hick town.
- Really?
- Mm.
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?
And we're getting a new Chipotle at the mall.
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.
You know, one of those Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.
That's genius.
KenTacoHut.
You sound like one of your crazy characters.
Hey, so how's Allen?
- Allen is great.
Yeah.
- Mmmm.
Yeah, he's good.
We're not married any more, but...
Oh, sorry.
I didn't...
No, don't be sorry.
It's good.
It's fine.
Well, that's Allen's loss.
It sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.
She's got band practice tonight.
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.
Just something she does with the other moms.
Wow, cool.
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.
Oh, my God.
Embarrassing.
Ah...
Actually, her band's playing here tomorrow night.
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow night to our house for a hang?
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.
- I would love that.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?
Sure.
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra.
She wants to be a writer someday.
Right, of course.
Um, but you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside.
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
It's still a pretty big deal, compared to the rest of us.
It was so great seeing you.
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.
I do?
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed, you just got lucky.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.
- OK.
- Good night.
Hello?
Look, I just want you to know that what you think you saw tonight is not what it was, OK?
Oh, so you're not trying to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage.
It is way more complicated than you can possibly ever understand, OK?
Buddy Slade and I have years and years of history, and it is very rich, and very complex.
Wow, yeah, that sounds way beyond my comprehension.
Don't open a new ranch till the old one's done.
- What?
- That's my sister.
Forget it.
- Just so you know.
- I got it.
Thank you.
Do you want to get loaded, or something?
I'm Mavis.
I know.
From high school.
Right.
I made you those Rice Krispies squares that one time for your birthday.
I got your locker combination from the vice principal.
I put them in your locker?
Thank you.
- So where's Matt?
- In his cave.
"Pledge Your Allegiance"
Welcome to the distillery.
Are you making moonshine?
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.
You know what?
Hang on.
All right.
Check this out.
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong...
That's a limited...
There's not a lot.
- "Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.
Mos Eisley...
Star Wars thing.
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's...
Let's let that age a little longer.
And I got another in here.
OK.
Now, see if you can detect some of the new oak.
- Oh, come on.
- OK.
They're kind of hidden in there.
So when you sip...
- I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.
Let's do a little...
There you go.
Mm.
Woody.
Oak.
So how'd the rest of your little date go?
- Good.
It was eye-opening.
- Yeah?
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
OK, he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
I'm thinking... it will be you.
Hm...
- Aren't you a little old for G.I. Joes?
- That one's still wet.
No, it's fine.
Jesus.
- You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.
That one...
I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongul's body, so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead, and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.
I was tired and drunk.
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo.
I have to go check on something.
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.
I think this is it.
You think, or you know?
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty.
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.
You're fuckin' mentally ill.
- You see that window up there?
- Yep.
I bet Buddy is awake jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
Can I help you find something?
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.
It's not a formal occasion.
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
OK.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old friend, and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.
Let's show him what he's been missing.
No, he's seen me recently.
He knows.
But his wife hasn't seen me in a while, so...
Well, it's the end of my shift, and my son has to be picked up from school.
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.
Shawna!
Where are the Waverley Prep books?
They got their own display table right there.
Wow.
They must be really popular.
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
They were big a couple years ago, but the computer says, "Do not shelve," so...
Hey, are you writing in there?
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.
You're Jane MacMurray'?
No.
Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.
Mavis Gary-Crane.
See?
Do you know Jane MacMurray?
Yes, I know her really well.
- I wrote the book.
- OK.
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
No, that's fine.
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
We're probably not gonna sell them.
The series is done.
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
Whatever, book man.
Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off.
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
Hers was a gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However, being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan the love of her life?
- What up?
- Hey.
How are you?
- Ooh.
How are you?
- Good, good.
Here's that book for your niece.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There is a character in that one that's based on you.
- What?
- In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...
Hey.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.
You, too.
Oh...
There it is.
Adorable.
Thank you.
Aw...
You love it.
You love it.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?
Oh, just a water.
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.
It's fine.
I'll just pump and dump after the show.
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes it does.
Oh, starting to get smiles.
Cute.
She's, like, Buddy's clone.
No.
I see you in there.
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw a nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm an author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular.
I like your decor.
Is it shabby chic?
Pier One?
A little bit Goodwill.
Buddy and I used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that?
The '90s?
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.
It was just, like, the dumbest thing ever.
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.
I used to sleep in his T- shirts and boxers.
I think I still have a few.
Hey.
I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- What?
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.
What's the chart?
Uh...
Oh.
- Beth teaches special needs kids.
- Oh.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
So we need to show them "this is what happy looks like,"
"this is what anxious looks like," and so on.
What about neutral?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
Oh, my God.
- Is that Mavis Gary'?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.
Shots.
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Really'?
Come on, tequila time.
Salt.
So... are they any good?
Yeah, they're all right.
Mm-hm.
I knew it.
They're horrible.
I knew it.
- Well, they have a lot of fun.
- Hm...
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.
He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy.
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.
Think he owns any clown suits?
- Oh, my God.
You're terrible.
- Come on.
- Dark.
- No.
Hello, Mercury!
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.
We are Nipple Confusion.
Yeah.
Please be kind, as this is, um, only our second show.
And we all have small children at home.
Our first song is a cover.
This one goes out from our drummer, Beth, to her sweetheart, Buddy.
♪ She wears denim wherever she goes
♪ Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Still she won't be forced against her will
♪ Says she don't do drugs but she does the pill
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ I didn't want to hurt you
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ I didn't want to hurt you
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
♪ Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ When she's at the gig she takes her car...
Remember when we used to make out to this song?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this song was playing the first time I went down on you.
- Huh?
- The first time I went...
Uh-huh.
Oh!
Wow.
I screwed up the fill so bad.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.
- You guys were namazing.
- Wait.
Did you just say "namazing"?
- I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.
Hardly.
It's so interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's so inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence on stage.
Really.
Beth, we gotta get home.
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.
I wanna stay out just a little while longer.
Yeah, Buddy, you can't have her back tonight.
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.
Really'?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.
- You sure?
- Mmmm.
Have fun.
Thanks, Mavis.
Whoa!
Easy.
Tolerance has gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, since I knew you?
- I still know you.
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Don't you have that babysitter till 11:00?
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
I know, we can't, but time is just so precious.
For real.
- It goes so fast.
- I know.
Man, I really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know.
I can tell you're a great father.
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.
You do too much, even.
You think so?
Yes.
You're a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
I thought I saw lights.
Hi, Daniel.
Yep, I'm home.
Where's Beth?
She wanted to stay out and party all night.
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and she doesn't want her "nuk" any more.
I got it.
Good night, Buddy.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Wow.
- Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
There's some low-hanging fruit.
You are low-hanging fruit.
- Oh, no.
No.
- What?
I hate this guy over here.
That's my cousin, Mike.
Mike Moran is your cousin?
Unfortunately.
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
- Mavis?
- Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, coz, this is such a rad surprise.
Yeah, I'm in town just for a little real estate thing.
- How are you?
Yeah.
- I'm great.
Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary.
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood?
Porcelain?
- Strychnine?
- Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.
You mean rock crawling, right?
No, I'm vertical, bro, believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity.
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.
- You should try it, Matt.
- No.
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.
It's like Will Grace.
- Aw, it is.
- No, it isn't.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later.
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you got there.
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
God, he got so much attention.
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.
Please.
That dick ruined my sweet 16, same weekend.
God, you are a piece of work.
You're a piece of shit.
You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a cougar.
How I'm a cougar?
- I'm not even 30 years old.
- You're a cougar.
I am turning 30 this year and I am freaked out.
It's pretty old.
Kim Kardashian channels her own inner cougar.
Fuck.
The kiss was electric, transformative, spiritual, enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
I said, "Listen, Kyle, you're everything to me."
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"
- And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.
I'm gonna have a...
Hey, you.
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
Um, how much longer are you gonna be in town?
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?
I was just wondering if you're still in town this weekend, if you wanna come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's this little hippy thing we're doing out in the yard.
It's not religious or anything...
- I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.
Um...
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.
- Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.
Hey, Mom.
Were you even gonna say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like.
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom.
OK?
I was planning on calling.
Why didn't you just come and stay with us?
Because I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea.
I have tons and tons of work to catch up on.
Books still selling well?
It's like I can hardly keep up.
Is that the money you used to invest in local real estate?
Huh?
I heard you were here to work on some kind of real estate transaction.
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
- Honey?
- Huh?
- Look what I found.
- What?
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Who's this?
- This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.
- Dolce.
- Hello.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
You gotta start taking care of yourself, sweetie.
You know, a Lean Cuisine is not a meal.
Yeah, I think I might be an alcoholic.
Very funny.
- You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
You know what, Mom?
Can you please take down that photo of me and Allen?
Which picture, sweetie?
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
- Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
Actually I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy.
Oh, the old beau, huh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way, but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
The people who really know you best.
Mmmm.
And that new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it?
Up close?
I suppose.
Is everything OK?
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.
It's just that Buddy used to say that we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
Yeah!
Sweet ride.
What is that, a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Oh, heavy.
How are they?
Horrible.
God, I've been through a lot.
- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?
Come on.
Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
- And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...
- Come on!
- Fine.
Could you walk any slower?
Our school is so ugly.
It looks like a factory.
It actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were such a slut.
I was normal.
Uh...
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
How's the master plan unfolding?
Well, actually, he called me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
I don't know.
There's still so much that's unspoken, but he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man.
By all accounts, happily.
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.
He gave me his sweatshirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
You're one to talk.
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know you use this whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
"Scuffle."
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
OK?
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch they shattered my legs, bashed in my brains, mangled my cock, so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
Then they left me for dead.
You know, things aren't too great down south.
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
You know, what's done is done.
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past.
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser, trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It really is a shame that you're like this, because if you had a good personality, none of this other stuff would bother people.
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories, because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan still loved her, crystal clear.
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend, but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
Who was taking care of Kendal?
And on the subject of fair...
Was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
No.
Life wasn't fair, and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
"Pressure Drop"
Hi, Jan.
Oh, hi.
Wow, really been a long time.
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.
- Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?
Wow.
How are you doing?
Mm.
I'm good.
- Good.
- I brought presents.
Oh, thank you.
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?
Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?
Uh, yeah.
Ooh!
Are you having fun?
Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.
I think we should talk privately.
Sure, yeah.
Um...
Here, follow me.
OK.
OK, so what's going on?
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now.
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
Well, hey, she pushed it out.
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's in here and I know what's in here.
Buddy...
you're my moon, my stars.
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis!
What are you doing?
OK.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
We can work this out.
You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know.
We can beat this together.
You're better than this.
I have to go.
I think you should leave.
Hey, look who's up.
Hey, let me take her.
Let me...
Come here.
There you are.
There you are.
Oh...
Can you do me a favor?
We need everybody outside.
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.
Those are delicious.
Hey, listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
Come on, let's go.
Mavis?
- What?
- Are you OK?
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here.
Uh...
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh, my God.
Uh...
I'll...
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch.
Oh, my God.
You should see your face.
It's a joke.
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
I love your sweater.
I'll get you a rag.
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here.
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
You know, the funny thing is,
I could have had this party a long time ago.
This exact same party.
Yeah.
Buddy and I were together for four years, and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.
It is silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart.
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
And we were gonna keep it!
Mm-hm.
We were gonna have a little baby, and a little naming party, and a Funquarium, and all of that.
And then 12 weeks into it...
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable down south in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager, and probably even more kids, because we always found each other.
Always!
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
What the fuck?
It's a new drum set for Beth.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What is wrong with you?
Are you like one of those little kids who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?
That's enough, Mavis.
You're drunk.
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom, and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.
We all do, Mavis.
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness, some depression.
You're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying.
He's not.
Well.
What about now?
You hate me now?
Hm?
'Cause it should be easy, 'cause I fucking hate you.
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?
Mavis, honey.
You know, I came back for you.
For you!
And I hate this town!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
But I came back.
I just wanted you to know that.
I screwed up.
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?
You're scaring me.
I'm crazy.
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
I ruined my dress.
Um...
I'll get you...
I'll get you a shirt.
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
Hide me.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Why Buddy'?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
You know, I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker, shaped like a heart and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me,
and I was at my best.
Good morning.
Hi.
Coffee?
Sure.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over.
It got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last one right now.
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade from school.
Um, yeah.
I know that Beth.
What do you think of her?
Um...
I...
I...
I don't really like her.
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is.
What happened to your dress?
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
Shit.
What's wrong?
What did I say'?
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
It's really difficult for me to be happy and then for other people, it just seems so simple.
I know.
They just grow up, and they're so...
fulfilled.
I don't feel fulfilled.
- Well...
- And frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
I need to change, Sandra.
- No, you don't.
- What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book, or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
I mean, you think so?
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
You know, living in the big city, all famous and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special or whatever.
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
I'll sit and think about you, living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
It seems really nice.
Yeah.
But...
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you.
I needed that.
You're right.
This place blows.
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me?
Take me with you.
You know, to the Mini Apple.
You're good here, Sandra.
Oh.
Dolce.
I'm so sorry.
My baby.
Come here.
Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class, there was an unmistakable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day, it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
Good boy.
Poor Ryan...
Lost at sea.
They don't need those back.
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
Cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future.
A new chapter.
As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss thinking, "Life, here I come."

I'm just...
I don't feel pretty right now.
Having my friends here is great, but it's like making my self-esteem go down really bad.
And they look so good, and they're just like, like the hottest girls in the world, and here I am just like...
- ...and you're...
- Babe.
I got to get ready.
No, you don't.
Come here.
- That's just it.
- What?
Kendra, you are the most beautiful woman.
And don't let anybody coming around after you just had a baby, make you not feel that way, babe.
Ow!
You want that?
All right, come on.
Follow me.
Kendal Strickland wasn't just the prettiest girl at Waverley Prep, she was a legend.
As a junior, the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her, even though another student had recently died.
Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?
When you send something that soon, it's for the inner circle.
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the father who doesn't talk to him any more.
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I am not worked up in the slightest.
I was just trying to tell you about something that happened.
God!
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent parent.
Can you imagine still living in Mercury'?
Trapped with a wife and a kid and some crappy job?
It's like...
It's like he's a hostage.
Yup.
We're lucky we got out.
- Yes.
- We have lives.
Let me let you borrow an outfit 'cause that dress is hideous, honey.
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come with me now to the TV Guide party because who wants to go to a party by themselves?
It's to die for.
That is fab.
I just think that Tyler and I are like soul twins.
You know?
Right before he texts me,
- it's like I can...
- Sense it?
Yes!
Like psychically.
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
Like text chemistry.
- 'Exactly.
Just as Kendal hit "send," a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied.
They had "textual chemistry."
So, all told, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
- Why?
- Uh...
Long story short, I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.
Oh, my God.
Yikes.
Yeah, it was probably one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Of course.
Sure, totally.

Welcome to Hampton Inn.
Do you have a reservation?
No.
Mavis Gary.
- Is that a dog in your bag?
- Nope.
We actually allow small pets with a cleaning deposit.
Good, because I have a small dog, in my vehicle.
I'll put that you have a dog.
How many keys do you need?
Two, please.
Expecting company?
Oh!
Hi.
YOU.
Personal.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Slade.
I can't.
There's nothing I can do for you.
I love Mason more than I love you.
Hey, Buddy, this is Mavis.
Remember?
Mavis Gary'?
I'm in town for this little real estate thing, and I, um...
I don't know, I just thought if you have time, and you wanna grab a drink, catch up?
Something like that.
Um...
All right, well, listen, call me and, um...
and let me know.
All right, bye.
Fuck.
- Hey, Buddy.
- Mavis Gary.
It's been, uh... how long?
I'm not sure.
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.
I am insanely busy as always.
Well, I don't know how long you're around with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
OK.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,
I could meet you at, uh, Woody's in I don't know, 15 minutes?
Spontaneous really isn't a thing these days.
I don't know if you heard, but I am a new dad.
Duh!
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.
I got that, uh, announcement.
Thanks for that, by the way.
You're welcome, you're welcome.
How about we meet tomorrow at this place called Champion O'Malley's?
It's kind of fun.
Of course, yes.
Yeah.
How, um...
how does 8:00, 8:30 sound?
- 6:00 would be better.
- 6:00 is perfect.
Great, I'll see you at 6:00.
"Achin' To Be"
Maker's Mark.
What?
I'm sorry, but I think we went to high school together.
- At the same time?
- Yeah.
You're Mavis Gary'?
Mavis Gary-Crane now.
I'm Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually next to yours, all through high school.
Matt...
Freehauf.
Yeah.
Yeah, your locker was right there.
Right next to mine.
We didn't run in the same circles.
You were pretty popular, if I remember correctly.
You won "Best Hair."
Did I?
What did you win?
I didn't.
Uh, they usually give out, like, 15 of those, and only to the same five people.
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it was really nice seeing you...
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?
Of course not.
Gross.
- No, I live in Minneapolis.
- Oh.
I'm just here taking care of a little real estate thing.
I own some property...
I read in the Sun you're a writer.
Yes, I am an author.
Children's books.
Y.A. That's industry speak for "Young Adult."
It's a very popular teen series.
It's everywhere.
It's huge.
- You've probably seen it.
- Uh, vampires?
"It's A Shame About Ray"
Hey, take that, liver.
Weren't you that hate crime guy'?
Excuse me?
You totally were.
You're the hate crime guy.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?
Now I know who you are.
Matt, the hate crime guy.
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a...
When we were seniors, a bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods...
That's right.
...and hit me on the legs and dick with a crowbar.
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out that I wasn't really gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime any more.
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
Fuck.
How's your dick?
Not good.
Not good.
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.
You know, it's just kind of does a...
Hard Jacks.
Do you know who drinks these?
I don't.
Buddy Slade.
That's an interesting fact.
Come here.
Do you wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes.
I can't tell you in here.
OK, you got me out here.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together.
And I'm here to get him back.
Buddy Slade.
All right.
I'm pretty sure he's married with a kid on the way.
No, kid's here.
She already had it.
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.
So wait, are you not joking?
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.
They just tend to happen in slow motion.
They get divorced, they reconfigure, and society is, like, fine with that if you take your time, like an emotional glacier.
I'm 37...
Mavis, I would keep all of this to yourself.
I would find a therapist.
Talk to a professional.
- Matt.
- Oh, boy.
Don't you get it?
Love conquers all.
Have you not seen The Graduate?
Or, like, I don't know, anything?
Oh, a taxi.
Yes, we called it.
Ma...
Mavis, hey!
Buddy Slade has a life.
Buddy Slade has a life.
No, he has a baby, and babies are boring!
Having spent the summer outside Waverley Prep,
Kendal looked around at her fellow students, thinking,
"Did I really get that much better, or did everyone simply get worse?
Why was Ryan spending so much time with this dumpy new girl?"
Mavis, this is Jim.
Do you even have any pages?
I'm trying to help you, but I can't if you...
♪ Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
♪ Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
♪ Oh, yeah
Oh, no, not gonna need those.
Oh.
You're gonna wanna try the popcorn shrimp.
No, I'm not.
A couple of Hard Jacks, please.
OK.
Hey.
Hey, you.
- Wow.
- Great to see you.
Mm...
So...
This is, uh, quite the mid-week surprise.
Hey, I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, me neither.
But I thought, you know, just for old times' sake.
Actually, I haven't been drinking recently.
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and now that she's nursing our girl,
I thought I'd show some solidarity.
Right.
So...
- You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.
Ad sales now.
My dad's still there, so we have lunch together most days.
Yeah.
Pizza or sub sandwiches.
Awesome.
I've just been working my little butt off in the city.
You know, doing my thing.
Down there in the old Mini Apple?
God, Buddy.
Nobody calls it the Mini Apple any more.
I didn't know.
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.
Give our waitress a break.
So chivalrous.
Mavis.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You know, bookkeeping, dealing with vendors.
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?
Just catching up with a friend.
Oh, catching up with a friend.
There's Buddy Slade, acquiring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar.
You're not wasting any time, are you?
Look, it was really great hanging out with you last night.
- It was great.
- OK.
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie.
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
It's so nice running into him.
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
You wanna join us for a round?
I would love to.
I would.
Sadly, I have work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied person to complete even the simplest task.
- So...
- Bummer.
I don't wanna step on your Mercury High reunion.
So...
Go, go, lnjuns.
Actually, uh, they changed the name to "indians" back in '99, remember?
The local Fond du Lac tribe did a whole thing with...
It sucks, what happened to Matt.
That poor guy suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.
Didn't you call him a theater fag all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.
Well, whatever.
Mercury's changed a lot since then, though.
We're way less of a hick town.
- Really?
- Mm.
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?
And we're getting a new Chipotle at the mall.
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.
You know, one of those Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.
That's genius.
KenTacoHut.
You sound like one of your crazy characters.
Hey, so how's Allen?
- Allen is great.
Yeah.
- Mmmm.
Yeah, he's good.
We're not married any more, but...
Oh, sorry.
I didn't...
No, don't be sorry.
It's good.
It's fine.
Well, that's Allen's loss.
It sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.
She's got band practice tonight.
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.
Just something she does with the other moms.
Wow, cool.
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.
Oh, my God.
Embarrassing.
Ah...
Actually, her band's playing here tomorrow night.
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow night to our house for a hang?
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.
- I would love that.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?
Sure.
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra.
She wants to be a writer someday.
Right, of course.
Um, but you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside.
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
It's still a pretty big deal, compared to the rest of us.
It was so great seeing you.
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.
I do?
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed, you just got lucky.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.
- OK.
- Good night.

Hello?
Look, I just want you to know that what you think you saw tonight is not what it was, OK?
Oh, so you're not trying to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage.
It is way more complicated than you can possibly ever understand, OK?
Buddy Slade and I have years and years of history, and it is very rich, and very complex.
Wow, yeah, that sounds way beyond my comprehension.
Don't open a new ranch till the old one's done.
- What?
- That's my sister.
Forget it.
Just so you know.
I got it.
Thank you.
Do you want to get loaded, or something?
I'm Mavis.
I know.
From high school.
Right.
I made you those Rice Krispies squares that one time for your birthday.
I got your locker combination from the vice principal.
I put them in your locker?
Thank you.
- So where's Matt?
- In his cave.
"Pledge Your Allegiance"
Welcome to the distillery.
Are you making moonshine?
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.
You know what?
Hang on.
All right.
Check this out.
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong...
That's a limited...
There's not a lot.
- "Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.
Mos Eisley...
Star Wars thing.
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's...
Let's let that age a little longer.
And I got another in here.
OK.
Now, see if you can detect some of the new oak.
- Oh, come on.
- OK.
They're kind of hidden in there.
So when you sip...
- I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.
Let's do a little...
There you go.
Mm.
Woody.
Oak.
So how'd the rest of your little date go?
- Good.
It was eye-opening.
- Yeah?
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
OK, he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
I'm thinking... it will be you.
Hm...
Aren't you a little old for G.l. Joes?
That one's still wet.
No, it's fine.
Jesus.
You make these?
I combine them, mix and match.
That one...
I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongul's body, so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead, and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.
I was tired and drunk.
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo.
I have to go check on something.
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.
I think this is it.
You think, or you know?
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty.
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.
You're fuckin' mentally ill.
- You see that window up there?
- Yep.
I bet Buddy is awake jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
Can I help you find something?
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
Is this something for work?
No, it's a special occasion.
It's not a formal occasion.
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
OK.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
No, I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old ﬂame, and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.
Let's show him what he's been missing.
No, he's seen me recently.
He knows.
But his wife hasn't seen me in a while, so...
Well, it's the end of my shift, and my son has to be picked up from school.
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.
Shawna!
Where are the Waverley Prep books?
They got their own display table right there.
Wow.
They must be really popular.
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
They were big a couple years ago, but the computer says, "Do not shelve," so...
Hey, are you writing in there?
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.
You're Jane MacMurray'?
No.
Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.
Mavis Gary-Crane.
See?
Do you know Jane MacMurray?
Yes, I know her really well.
- I wrote the book.
- OK.
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
No, that's fine.
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
We're probably not gonna sell them.
The series is done.
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
Whatever, book man.
Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off.
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
Hers was a gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However, being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan the love of her life?
- What up?
- Hey.
How are you?
- Ooh.
How are you?
- Good, good.
Here's that book for your niece.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There is a character in that one that's based on you.
- What?
- In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
When you read it, it'll be obvious.
Hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...
Hey.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.
You, too.
Oh...
There it is.
Adorable.
Thank you.
Aw...
You love it.
You love it.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?
Oh, just a water.
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.
It's fine.
I'll just pump and dump after the show.
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes it does.
Oh, starting to get smiles.
Cute.
She's, like, Buddy's clone.
No.
I see you in there.
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw a nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm an author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular.
I like your decor.
Is it shabby chic?
Pier One?
A little bit Goodwill.
Buddy and I used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that?
The '90s?
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.
It was just, like, the dumbest thing ever.
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.
I used to sleep in his T-shirts and boxers.
I think I still have a few.
Hey.
I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- What?
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.
What's the chart?
Uh...
Oh.
- Beth teaches special needs kids.
- Oh.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
So we need to show them "this is what happy looks like,"
"this is what anxious looks like," and so on.
What about neutral?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
Oh, my God.
- Is that Mavis Gary'?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.
Shots.
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Really'?
Come on, tequila time.
Salt.
So... are they any good?
Yeah, they're all right.
Mm-hm.
I knew it.
They're horrible.
I knew it.
- Well, they have a lot of fun.
- Hm...
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.
He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy.
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.
Think he owns any clown suits?
- Oh, my God.
You're terrible.
- Come on.
- Dark.
- No.
Hello, Mercury!
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.
We are Nipple Confusion.
Yeah.
Please be kind, as this is, um, only our second show.
And we all have small children at home.
Our first song is a cover.
This one goes out from our drummer, Beth, to her sweetheart, Buddy.
♪ She wears denim wherever she goes
♪ Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Still she won't be forced against her will
♪ Says she don't do drugs but she does the pill
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ I didn't want to hurt you
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ I didn't want to hurt you
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
♪ Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ When she's at the gig she takes her car...
Remember when we used to make out to this song?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this song was playing the first time I went down on you.
- Huh?
- The first time I went...
Uh-huh.
Oh!
Wow.
I screwed up the fill so bad.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.
You guys were namazing.
Wait.
Did you just say "namazing"?
I think someone's had a few too many.
That's not fair.
Hardly.
It's so interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's so inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence on stage.
Really.
Beth, we gotta get home.
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.
I wanna stay out just a little while longer.
Yeah, Buddy, you can't have her back tonight.
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.
Really'?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.
- You sure?
- Mmmm.
Have fun.
Thanks, Mavis.
Whoa!
Easy.
Tolerance has gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, since I knew you?
- I still know you.
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Don't you have that babysitter till 11:00?
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
I know, we can't, but time is just so precious.
For real.
- It goes so fast.
- I know.
Man, I really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know.
I can tell you're a great father.
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.
You do too much, even.
You think so?
Yes.
You're a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
I thought I saw lights.
Hi, Daniel.
Yep, I'm home.
Where's Beth?
She wanted to stay out and party all night.
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and she doesn't want her "nuk" any more.
I got it.
Good night, Buddy.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Wow.
Take it easy there, killer.
I have depression.
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
There's some low-hanging fruit.
You are low-hanging fruit.
- Oh, no.
No.
- What?
I hate this guy over here.
That's my cousin, Mike.
Mike Moran is your cousin?
Unfortunately.
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
- Mavis?
- Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, coz, this is such a rad surprise.
Yeah, I'm in town just for a little real estate thing.
- How are you?
Yeah.
- I'm great.
Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary.
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood?
Porcelain?
- Strychnine?
- Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.
You mean rock crawling, right?
No, I'm vertical, bro, believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity.
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.
- You should try it, Matt.
- No.
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.
It's like Will Grace.
- Aw, it is.
- No, it isn't.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later.
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you got there.
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
God, he got so much attention.
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.
Please.
That dick ruined my sweet 16, same weekend.
God, you are a piece of work.
You're a piece of shit.
You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a cougar.
How I'm a cougar?
I'm not even 30 years old.
You're a cougar.
I am turning 30 this year and I am freaked out.
It's pretty old.
Kim Kardashian channels her own inner cougar.
Fuck.
The kiss was electric, transformative, spiritual, enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
I said, "Listen, Kyle, you're everything to me."
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"
- And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.
I'm gonna have a...
Hey, you.
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
Um, how much longer are you gonna be in town?
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?
I was just wondering if you're still in town this weekend, if you wanna come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's this little hippy thing we're doing out in the yard.
It's not religious or anything...
- I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.
Um...
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.
- Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.
Hey, Mom.
Were you even gonna say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like.
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom.
OK?
I was planning on calling.
Why didn't you just come and stay with us?
Because I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea.
I have tons and tons of work to catch up on.
Books still selling well?
It's like I can hardly keep up.
Is that the money you used to invest in local real estate?
Huh?
I heard you were here to work on some kind of real estate transaction.
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
- Honey?
- Huh?
- Look what I found.
- What?
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Who's this?
- This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.
- Dolce.
- Hello.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
You gotta start taking care of yourself, sweetie.
You know, a Lean Cuisine is not a meal.
Yeah, I think I might be an alcoholic.
Very funny.

- You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
You know what, Mom?
Can you please take down that photo of me and Allen?
Which picture, sweetie?
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
Remember the tiramisu?
I liked that Allen.
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
Actually I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy.
Oh, the old beau, huh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way, but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
The people who really know you best.
Mmmm.
And that new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it?
Up close?
I suppose.
Is everything OK?
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.
It's just that Buddy used to say that we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?

Yeah!
Sweet ride.
What is that, a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Oh, heavy.
How are they?
Horrible.
God, I've been through a lot.
Wanna get hammered?
Why do you think I'm here?
Come on.
Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
- And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...
- Come on!
- Fine.
Could you walk any slower?
Our school is so ugly.
It looks like a factory.
It actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were such a slut.
I was normal.
Uh...
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
How's the master plan unfolding?
Well, actually, he called me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
I don't know.
There's still so much that's unspoken, but he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man.
By all accounts, happily.
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
He did not make out with you.
You weren't there.
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.
He gave me his sweatshirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
You're one to talk.
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know you use this whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
"Scuffle."
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
OK?
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch they shattered my legs, bashed in my brains, mangled my cock, so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
Then they left me for dead.
You know, things aren't too great down south.
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
You know, what's done is done.
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past.
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser, trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It really is a shame that you're like this, because if you had a good personality, none of this other stuff would bother people.
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories, because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan still loved her, crystal clear.
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend, but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
Who was taking care of Kendal?
And on the subject of fair...
Was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
No.
Life wasn't fair, and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
"Pressure Drop"
Hi, Jan.
Oh, hi.
Wow, really been a long time.
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.
Finally a grandmother.
Oh, speak of the devil.
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?
Wow.
How are you doing?
Mm.
I'm good.
- Good.
- I brought presents.
Oh, thank you.
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?
Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?
Uh, yeah.
Ooh!
Are you having fun?
Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.
I think we should talk privately.
Sure, yeah.
Um...
Here, follow me.
OK.
OK, so what's going on?
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now.
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
Well, hey, she pushed it out.
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's in here and I know what's in here.
Buddy...
you're my moon, my stars.
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis!
What are you doing?
OK.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
We can work this out.
You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.
Mavis, I'm a married man.
I know.
We can beat this together.
You're better than this.
I have to go.
I think you should leave.
Hey, look who's up.
Hey, let me take her.
Let me...
Come here.
There you are.
There you are.
Oh...
Can you do me a favor?
We need everybody outside.
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.
Those are delicious.
Hey, listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
Come on, let's go.
Mavis?
- What?
- Are you OK?
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here.
Uh...
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh, my God.
Uh...
I'll...
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch.
Oh, my God.
You should see your face.
It's a joke.
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
I love your sweater.
I'll get you a rag.
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here.
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
You know, the funny thing is,
I could have had this party a long time ago.
This exact same party.
Yeah.
Buddy and I were together for four years, and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
You want to clean up?
No, don't bother.
It is silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart.
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
And we were gonna keep it!
Mm-hm.
We were gonna have a little baby, and a little naming party, and a Funquarium, and all of that.
And then 12 weeks into it...
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable down south in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager, and probably even more kids, because we always found each other.
Always!
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
What the fuck?
It's a new drum set for Beth.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What is wrong with you?
Are you like one of those little kids who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?
That's enough, Mavis.
You're drunk.
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom, and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
Mavis, what the hell is going on?
Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.
We all do, Mavis.
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness, some depression.
You're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying.
He's not.
Well.
What about now?
You hate me now?
Hm?
'Cause it should be easy, 'cause I fucking hate you.
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?
Mavis, honey.
You know, I came back for you.
For you!
And I hate this town!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
But I came back.
I just wanted you to know that.
I screwed up.
I screwed up so bad.
Where have you been?
You're scaring me.
I'm crazy.
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
I ruined my dress.
Um...
I'll get you...
I'll get you a shirt.
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
Hide me.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Why Buddy'?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
You know, I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker, shaped like a heart and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me,
and I was at my best.
Good morning.
Hi.
Coffee?
Sure.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over.
It got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last one right now.
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade from school.
Um, yeah.
I know that Beth.
What do you think of her?
Um...
I...
I...
I don't really like her.
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is.
What happened to your dress?
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
Shit.
What's wrong?
What did I say'?
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
It's really difficult for me to be happy and then for other people, it just seems so simple.
I know.
They just grow up, and they're so...
fulfilled.
I don't feel fulfilled.
- Well...
- And frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
I need to change, Sandra.
- No, you don't.
- What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book, or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
I mean, you think so?
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
You know, living in the big city, all famous and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special or whatever.
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
I'll sit and think about you, living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
It seems really nice.
Yeah.
But...
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you.
I needed that.
You're right.
This place blows.
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me?
Take me with you.
You know, to the Mini Apple.
You're good here, Sandra.
Oh.
Dolce.
I'm so sorry.
My baby.
Come here.
Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class, there was an unmistakable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day, it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
Good boy.
Poor Ryan...
Lost at sea.
They don't need those back.
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
Cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future.
A new chapter.
As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss thinking, "Life, here I come."

[woman] Kendal Strickland wasn't just the prettiest girl at Waverley Prep, she was a legend.
As a junior, the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her, even though another student had recently died.
[cell phone vibrates]
[man] Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?
When you send something that soon, it's for the inner circle.
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the father who doesn't talk to him any more.
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I am not worked up in the slightest.
I was just trying to tell you about something that happened.
God!
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent parent.
Can you imagine still living in Mercury'?
Trapped with a wife and a kid and some crappy job?
It's like...
It's like he's a hostage.
Yup.
We're lucky we got out.
- Yes.
- We have lives.
Let me let you borrow an outfit 'cause that dress is hideous, honey.
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come with me now to the TV Guide party because who wants to go to a party by themselves?
- It's to die for.
- That is fab.
I just think that Tyler and I are like soul twins.
You know?
Right before he texts me,
- it's like I can...
- [girl 2] Sense it?
[girl 1] Yes!
Like psychically.
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
[girl 2] Like text chemistry.
- [girls laugh] ' [girl 1] Exactly.
[Mavis] Just as Kendal hit "send," a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied.
They had "textual chemistry."
[man] So, all told, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
- Why?
- Uh...
Long story short, I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.
Oh, my God.
Yikes.
Yeah, it was probably one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Of course. [chuckles]
Sure, totally.

- [Mavis] I'm not sure.
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town, huh?
[Mavis] Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.
I am insanely busy as always.
Well, I don't know how long you're around with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
OK.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,
I could meet you at, uh, Woody's in I don't know, 15 minutes?
[laughs] Spontaneous really isn't a thing these days.
I don't know if you heard, but I am a new dad.
Duh!
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.
I got that, uh, announcement.
- Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
How about we meet tomorrow at this place called Champion O'Malley's?
- It's kind of fun.
- Of course, yes.
Yeah.

I'm Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually next to yours, all through high school.
Matt...
Freehauf.
Yeah.
Yeah, your locker was right there.
Right next to mine.
[laughs] We didn't run in the same circles.
You were pretty popular, if I remember correctly.
You won "Best Hair."
Did I?
What did you win?
I didn't.
Uh, they usually give out, like, 15 of those, and only to the same five people.
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it was really nice seeing you...
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?
Of course not.
Gross.
- No, I live in Minneapolis.
- Oh.
I'm just here taking care of a little real estate thing.
- I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.
Yes, I am an author.

Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?
Now I know who you are.
Matt, the hate crime guy.
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a...
When we were seniors, a bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods...
That's right.
...and hit me on the legs and dick with a crowbar.
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out that I wasn't really gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime any more.
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
Fuck.
How's your dick?
[laughs]
Not good.
Not good.
- [whispers] Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.
You know, it's just kind of does a...

Do you know who drinks these?
I don't.
Buddy Slade.
That's an interesting fact.
[whispers] Come here.
Do you wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes.
[whispers] I can't tell you in here.
OK, you got me out here.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together.
- And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade.
All right.
I'm pretty sure he's married with a kid on the way.
No, kid's here.
She already had it.
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.
So wait, are you not joking?
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.
They just tend to happen in slow motion.
They get divorced, they reconfigure, and society is, like, fine with that if you take your time, like an emotional glacier.
I'm 37...
Mavis, I would keep all of this to yourself.
I would find a therapist.
- [snickers]
- Talk to a professional.
- Matt.
- Oh, boy.
Don't you get it?
Love conquers all.
Have you not seen The Graduate?
Or, like, I don't know, anything?
Oh, a taxi.
Yes, we called it.

- Buddy Slade has a life.

Buddy Slade has a life.
No, he has a baby, and babies are boring!

Hey.
Hey, you.
- Wow.
- Great to see you.
Mm... [laughs]
So...
This is, uh, quite the mid-week surprise.
Hey, I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
[laughs]
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, me neither.
But I thought, you know, just for old times' sake.
Actually, I haven't been drinking recently.
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and now that she's nursing our girl,
I thought I'd show some solidarity.
Right.
So...
- You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.
Ad sales now.
My dad's still there, so we have lunch together most days.
Yeah.
Pizza or sub sandwiches.
Awesome.
I've just been working my little butt off in the city.
You know, doing my thing.
Down there in the old Mini Apple?
God, Buddy.
Nobody calls it the Mini Apple any more.
- [both laugh]
- I didn't know.
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.
Give our waitress a break.
So chivalrous.
[Matt] Mavis.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You know, bookkeeping, dealing with vendors.
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?
Just catching up with a friend.
Oh, catching up with a friend.
There's Buddy Slade, acquiring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar.
You're not wasting any time, are you?
Look, it was really great hanging out with you last night.
- It was great.
- OK.
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?
- [laughs]
- Sometimes I feel like a zombie.
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?
- Yeah.
- [Mavis] Oh.
It's so nice running into him.
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
- You wanna join us for a round?
- [all laugh]
I would love to.
I would.
Sadly, I have work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied person to complete even the simplest task.
- So...
- Bummer.
[scoffs] I don't wanna step on your Mercury High reunion.
So...
Go, go, lnjuns.
Actually, uh, they changed the name to "indians" back in '99, remember?
The local Fond du Lac tribe did a whole thing with...
It sucks, what happened to Matt.
That poor guy suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.
Didn't you call him a theater fag all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.
Well, whatever. [laughs]
Mercury's changed a lot since then, though.
We're way less of a hick town.
- Really?
- Mm.
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?
And we're getting a new Chipotle at the mall.
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.
You know, one of those Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.
That's genius.
KenTacoHut. [laughs]
You sound like one of your crazy characters.
Hey, so how's Allen?
- Allen is great.
Yeah.
- Mmmm.
Yeah, he's good.
We're not married any more, but...
Oh, sorry.
I didn't...
No, don't be sorry.
It's good.
It's fine.
Well, that's Allen's loss.
It sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.
She's got band practice tonight.
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.
Just something she does with the other moms.
Wow, cool.
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.
Oh, my God.
Embarrassing.
Ah...
Actually, her band's playing here tomorrow night. [laughs]
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow night to our house for a hang?
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.
- I would love that.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?
Sure.
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra.
She wants to be a writer someday.
Right, of course.
Um, but you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside.
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
It's still a pretty big deal, compared to the rest of us.
It was so great seeing you.
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
[whispers] Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.
I do?
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed, you just got lucky.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.
- OK.
- Good night.
[car starts]
["We've Only Just Begun" plays on TV]
[phone rings]
Hello?
Look, I just want you to know that what you think you saw tonight is not what it was, OK?
Oh, so you're not trying to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage.
It is way more complicated than you can possibly ever understand, OK?
Buddy Slade and I have years and years of history, and it is very rich, and very complex.
Wow, yeah, that sounds way beyond my comprehension.
Don't open a new ranch till the old one's done.
- What?
- That's my sister.
Forget it.
- Just so you know.
- I got it.
Thank you.
Do you want to get loaded, or something?
[car alarm chirps]
[doorbell rings]
I'm Mavis.
I know.
From high school.
Right.
I made you those Rice Krispies squares that one time for your birthday.
I got your locker combination from the vice principal.
I put them in your locker?
Thank you.
- So where's Matt?
- In his cave.
[♪ Suicidal Tendencies:
"Pledge Your Allegiance"]
[Matt] Welcome to the distillery.
Are you making moonshine?
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.
You know what?
Hang on.
All right.
Check this out.
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong...
That's a limited...
There's not a lot.
[coughs]
- "Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.
Mos Eisley...
Star Wars thing.
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's...
Let's let that age a little longer.
And I got another in here.
OK.
Now, see if you can detect some of the new oak.
- Oh, come on.
- OK.
They're kind of hidden in there.
So when you sip...
- I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.
Let's do a little...
There you go.
Mm.
Woody.
Oak.
[Matt] So how'd the rest of your little date go?
- [Mavis] Good.
It was eye-opening.
- [Matt] Yeah?
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
[laughs] OK, he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
[laughs] I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
[sniffs]
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
I'm thinking... it will be you.
Hm...
- Aren't you a little old for G.l. Joes?
- That one's still wet.
No, it's fine.
Jesus.
[Matt sighs]
- You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.
That one...
I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongul's body, so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead, and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.
I was tired and drunk.
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo.
I have to go check on something.
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.
I think this is it.
You think, or you know?
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty.
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.
[laughs loudly] [laughing] You're fuckin' mentally ill.
- [Mavis] You see that window up there?
- [Matt] Yep.
I bet Buddy is awake jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
Can I help you find something?
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.
It's not a formal occasion.
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
OK.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old ﬂame, and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.
Let's show him what he's been missing.
No, he's seen me recently.
He knows.
But his wife hasn't seen me in a while, so...
Well, it's the end of my shift, and my son has to be picked up from school.
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.
Shawna!
Where are the Waverley Prep books?
They got their own display table right there.
Wow.
They must be really popular.
[man] Actually, we just got a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
They were big a couple years ago, but the computer says, "Do not shelve," so...
Hey, are you writing in there?
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.
You're Jane MacMurray'?
No.
Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.
Mavis Gary-Crane.
See?
Do you know Jane MacMurray?
Yes, I know her really well.
- I wrote the book.
- OK.
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
No, that's fine.
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
We're probably not gonna sell them.
The series is done.
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
Whatever, book man.
[Mavis] Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off.
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
Hers was a gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However, being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan the love of her life?
- What up?
- Hey.
How are you?
- Ooh.
How are you?
- Good, good.
Here's that book for your niece.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There is a character in that one that's based on you.
- What?
- In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...
Hey.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.
You, too.
Oh... [laughs]
There it is.
Adorable.
Thank you.
- [baby coos] - [Buddy, Beth] Aw...
- [Beth] You love it.
You love it.
- [cradle playing soft music]
[Buddy sighs]
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?
Oh, just a water.
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.
It's fine.
I'll just pump and dump after the show.
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes it does. [chuckles]
Oh, starting to get smiles.
Cute.
She's, like, Buddy's clone.
No.
I see you in there.
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw a nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm an author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular.
[chuckles]
I like your decor.
Is it shabby chic?
Pier One?
A little bit Goodwill.
Buddy and I used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that?
The '90s?
[chuckling]
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.
It was just, like, the dumbest thing ever.
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.
I used to sleep in his T-shirts and boxers.
I think I still have a few.
Hey.
I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- [Buddy] What?
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.
[Beth laughs]
What's the chart?
Uh...
Oh.
- Beth teaches special needs kids.
- Oh.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
So we need to show them "this is what happy looks like,"
"this is what anxious looks like," and so on.
What about neutral?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
[guitar tuning]
[woman] Oh, my God.
- Is that Mavis Gary'?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.
Shots. [laughs]
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Really'?
Come on, tequila time.
Salt.
So... are they any good?
Yeah, they're all right.
Mm-hm.
I knew it.
They're horrible.
I knew it.
- Well, they have a lot of fun.
- Hm...
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.
[Mavis] He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy.
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.
- Think he owns any clown suits?
- [Mavis laughs]
- Oh, my God.
You're terrible.
- Come on.
- Dark.
- No.
Hello, Mercury!
[cheering]
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.
We are Nipple Confusion.
Yeah.
Please be kind, as this is, um, only our second show.
And we all have small children at home.
Our first song is a cover.
This one goes out from our drummer, Beth, to her sweetheart, Buddy.
♪ She wears denim wherever she goes
♪ Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Still she won't be forced against her will
♪ Says she don't do drugs but she does the pill
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ I didn't want to hurt you
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ I didn't want to hurt you
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
♪ Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ When she's at the gig she takes her car...
Remember when we used to make out to this song?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this song was playing the first time I went down on you.
- Huh?
- The first time I went... [mouthing words]
Uh-huh.
[vocalizing]
- [laughter] - [woman] Oh!
Wow.
[Beth] I screwed up the fill so bad.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.
- You guys were namazing.
- Wait.
Did you just say "namazing"?
- I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.
Hardly.
It's so interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's so inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence on stage.
Really.
Beth, we gotta get home.
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.
I wanna stay out just a little while longer.
[woman] Yeah, Buddy, you can't have her back tonight.
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.
Really'?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.
- You sure?
- Mmmm.
Have fun.
[Beth] Thanks, Mavis.
[Buddy groans]
Whoa!
[laughs]
Easy.
Tolerance has gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, since I knew you?
- I still know you.
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Don't you have that babysitter till 11:00?
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
I know, we can't, but time is just so precious.
For real.
- It goes so fast.
- I know.
Man, I really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know.
I can tell you're a great father.
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.
You do too much, even.
You think so?
Yes.
You're a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
[door opens]
I thought I saw lights.
Hi, Daniel.
Yep, I'm home.
[Daniel] Where's Beth?
She wanted to stay out and party all night.
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and she doesn't want her "nuk" any more.
I got it.
Good night, Buddy.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yeah.
[♪ Cracker: "Low"]
Wow.
- Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
There's some low-hanging fruit.
- You are low-hanging fruit.
- [chuckles]
- Oh, no.
No.
- What?
I hate this guy over here.
[sighs]
That's my cousin, Mike.
Mike Moran is your cousin?
Unfortunately.
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
- Mavis?
- Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, coz, this is such a rad surprise.
Yeah, I'm in town just for a little real estate thing.
- How are you?
Yeah.
- I'm great.
Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary.
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood?
Porcelain?
- Strychnine?
- [Mike] Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.
You mean rock crawling, right?
No, I'm vertical, bro, believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity.
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.
- You should try it, Matt.
- No.
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.
It's like Will Grace.
- Aw, it is.
- No, it isn't.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later.
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you got there.
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
God, he got so much attention.
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.
Please.
That dick ruined my sweet 16, same weekend.
God, you are a piece of work.
You're a piece of shit.
[Veruca Salt singing "Seether" over car stereo]
[clattering]
[TV plays indistinctly] [woman] You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a cougar.
- [woman 2] How I'm a cougar?
- [Mavis groans]
- [woman 2] I'm not even 30 years old.
- [woman 1] You're a cougar.
[woman 2] I am turning 30 this year and I am freaked out.
It's pretty old.
Kim Kardashian channels her own inner cougar.
[sighs]
Fuck.
[Mavis] The kiss was electric, transformative, spiritual, enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
[girl] I said, "Listen, Kyle, you're everything to me."
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"
- And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.
I'm gonna have a... [cell phone vibrates]
Hey, you.
- Hey, how are you?
- [Mavis] I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
Um, how much longer are you gonna be in town?
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?
I was just wondering if you're still in town this weekend, if you wanna come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's this little hippy thing we're doing out in the yard.
It's not religious or anything...
- I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.
Um...
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.
- Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.
Hey, Mom.
[mother] Were you even gonna say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like.
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom.
OK?
I was planning on calling.
Why didn't you just come and stay with us?
Because I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea.
I have tons and tons of work to catch up on.
Books still selling well?
It's like I can hardly keep up.
Is that the money you used to invest in local real estate?
Huh?
I heard you were here to work on some kind of real estate transaction.
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
- Honey?
- [man] Huh?
- Look what I found.
- [man] What?
- [laughs] Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Who's this?
- This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.
- Dolce.
- Hello.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
You gotta start taking care of yourself, sweetie.
You know, a Lean Cuisine is not a meal.
Yeah, I think I might be an alcoholic.
[laughs] Very funny.
- You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
You know what, Mom?
Can you please take down that photo of me and Allen?
Which picture, sweetie?
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
- Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
Actually I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy.
Oh, the old beau, huh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way, but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
The people who really know you best.
Mmmm.
And that new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it?
Up close?
[mother] I suppose.
Is everything OK?
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.
It's just that Buddy used to say that we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
[engine rumbling]
Yeah!
Sweet ride.
What is that, a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Oh, heavy.
How are they?
Horrible.
God, I've been through a lot.
- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?
Come on.
Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
- And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...
- Come on!
- Fine.
Could you walk any slower?
[Mavis groans] Our school is so ugly.
It looks like a factory.
[Matt] It actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
[Mavis] You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were such a slut.
I was normal.
Uh...
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
How's the master plan unfolding?
Well, actually, he called me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
I don't know.
There's still so much that's unspoken, but he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man.
By all accounts, happily.
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.
He gave me his sweatshirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
You're one to talk.
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know you use this whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
"Scuffle."
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
OK?
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch they shattered my legs, bashed in my brains, mangled my cock, so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
Then they left me for dead.
You know, things aren't too great down south.
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
You know, what's done is done.
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past.
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser, trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It really is a shame that you're like this, because if you had a good personality, none of this other stuff would bother people.
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories, because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
[Mavis] It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan still loved her, crystal clear.
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend, but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
Who was taking care of Kendal?
And on the subject of fair...
Was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
No.
Life wasn't fair, and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
[indistinct chatter]
[♪ Toots The Maytals:
"Pressure Drop"]
Hi, Jan.
Oh, hi. [laughs]
Wow, really been a long time.
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.
- Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?
[laughs] Wow.
How are you doing?
Mm.
I'm good.
- Good.
- I brought presents.
Oh, thank you.
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?
Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?
Uh, yeah.
Ooh!
[laughs]
Are you having fun?
Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.
I think we should talk privately.
Sure, yeah.
Um...
Here, follow me.
OK.
OK, so what's going on?
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now.
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
Well, hey, she pushed it out.
[chuckles]
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's in here and I know what's in here.
Buddy...
you're my moon, my stars.
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis!
What are you doing?
[scoffs]
OK.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
We can work this out.
You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know.
We can beat this together.
[sighs]
You're better than this.
I have to go.
I think you should leave.
Hey, look who's up.
Hey, let me take her.
Let me...
Come here.
There you are.
There you are.
Oh...
[Buddy chuckles]
Can you do me a favor?
We need everybody outside.
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.
[woman] Those are delicious.
[Jan] Hey, listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
Come on, let's go.
Mavis?
- What?
- Are you OK?
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here.
Uh...
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh, my God.
[Beth] Uh...
I'll...
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch.
[laughing] Oh, my God.
You should see your face.
It's a joke.
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
I love your sweater.
I'll get you a rag.
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here.
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
You know, the funny thing is,
I could have had this party a long time ago.
This exact same party.
Yeah.
Buddy and I were together for four years, and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.
It is silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart.
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
And we were gonna keep it!
Mm-hm.
We were gonna have a little baby, and a little naming party, and a Funquarium, and all of that.
And then 12 weeks into it...
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable down south in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager, and probably even more kids, because we always found each other.
Always!
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
What the fuck?
[drums playing]
It's a new drum set for Beth.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What is wrong with you?
Are you like one of those little kids who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?
That's enough, Mavis.
You're drunk.
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom, and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.
We all do, Mavis.
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness, some depression.
You're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying.
He's not.
Well.
What about now?
You hate me now?
Hm?
'Cause it should be easy, 'cause I fucking hate you.
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?
Mavis, honey.
You know, I came back for you.
For you!
And I hate this town!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
But I came back.
I just wanted you to know that.
[knocking on door]
I screwed up.
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?
You're scaring me.
I'm crazy.
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
[sobbing] I ruined my dress.
[sniffles]
Um...
I'll get you...
I'll get you a shirt.
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
[whispers] Hide me.
[Matt] It's OK.
It's OK.
Why Buddy'?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
[sighs]
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
You know, I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker, shaped like a heart and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me,
and I was at my best.
[breathes deeply]
Good morning.
Hi.
Coffee?
Sure.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over.
It got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last one right now.
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade from school.
Um, yeah.
I know that Beth.
What do you think of her?
Um...
I...
I...
I don't really like her.
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is.
What happened to your dress?
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
Shit.
What's wrong?
What did I say'?
[sniffles]
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
It's really difficult for me to be happy and then for other people, it just seems so simple.
I know.
They just grow up, and they're so...
fulfilled.
I don't feel fulfilled.
- Well...
- And frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
I need to change, Sandra.
- No, you don't.
- What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book, or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
I mean, you think so?
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
You know, living in the big city, all famous and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special or whatever.
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
I'll sit and think about you, living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
It seems really nice.
Yeah.
But...
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you.
[chuckles] I needed that.
You're right.
This place blows.
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me?
Take me with you.
You know, to the Mini Apple.
You're good here, Sandra.
Oh.
[lock beeps]
Dolce.
I'm so sorry.
My baby.
Come here.
[Mavis] Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class, there was an unmistakable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day, it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
Good boy.
Poor Ryan...
Lost at sea.
They don't need those back.
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
[tires screech]
[Mavis] Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
Cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future.
A new chapter.
As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss... [alarm chirps] ...thinking, "Life, here I come.
"
[Woman panting, sobbing]
[sobbing continues] [woman] I'm just...
I don't feel pretty right now.
Having my friends here is great, but it's like... [sniffles] ...making my self-esteem go down really bad.
[Sobbing] And they look so good, and they're just like, like the hottest girls in the world, and here I am just like and you're...
- [man] Babe.
- [Woman] I got to get ready.
- [man] No, you don't.
Come here.
- That's just it.
- [woman] What?
[Man] Kendra, you are the most beautiful woman.
And don't let anybody coming around after you just had a baby, make you not feel that way, babe.
[TV continues indistinctly]
[groaning] Ow!

You want that?
All right, come on.
Follow me.

[woman] Kendal Strickland wasn't just the prettiest girl at Waverley Prep, she was a legend.
As a junior; the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her;
Even though another student had recently died.
[Cell phone vibrates]
[man] Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?
When you send something that soon, it's for the inner circle.
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the father who doesn't talk to him any more.
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I am not worked up in the slightest.
I was just trying to tell you about something that happened.
God!
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent parent.
Can you imagine still living in Mercury?
Trapped with a wife and a kid, and some crappy job?
It's like...
It's like he's a hostage.
Yup.
We're lucky we got out.
- Yes.
- We have lives.
Let me let you borrow an outfit 'cause that dress is hideous, honey.
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come with me now to the TV Guide party because who wants to go to a party by themselves?
- It's to die for
- That is fab.
I just think that Tyler and I are like soul twins.
You know?
Right before he texts me,
- it's like I can...
- [girl 2] Sense it?
[Girl 1] Yes!
Like psychically.
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
[Girl 2] Like text chemistry.
- [Girls laugh] - [girl 1] Exactly.
[Mavis] Just as Kendal hit "send," a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied.
They had "textual chemistry."
[man] So, all told, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
- Why?
- Uh...
Long story short, I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.
Oh, my God.
Yikes.
Yeah, it was probably one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Of course. [Chuckles]
Sure, totally.

- [Mavis] I'm not sure.
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town, huh?
[Mavis] Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.
I am insanely busy as always.
Well, I don't know how long you're around with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
OK.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,
I could meet you at, uh, Woody's in I don't know, 15 minutes?
[laughs] Spontaneous really isn't a thing these days.
I don't know if you heard, but I am a new dad.
Duh!
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.
I got that, uh, announcement.
- Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
How about we meet tomorrow at this place called Champion O'Malley's?
- It's kind of fun.
- Of course, yes.
Yeah.
How, um... how does 8:00, 8:30 sound?

I'm Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually next to yours, all through high school.
Matt...
Freehauf.
Yeah.
Yeah, your locker was right there.
Right next to mine.
[laughs] We didn't run in the same circles.
You were pretty popular, if I remember correctly.
You won "Best Hair."
Did I?
What did you win?
I didn't.
Uh, they usually give out, like, 15 of those, and only to the same five people.
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it was really nice seeing you...
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?
Of course not.
Gross.
- No, I live in Minneapolis.
- Oh.
I'm just here taking care of a little real estate thing.
- I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.

You're the hate crime guy.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?
Now I know who you are.
Matt, the hate crime guy.
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a...
When we were seniors, a bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods...
That's right.
...And hit me on the legs and dick with a crowbar.
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out that I wasn't really gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime any more.
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
Fuck.
How's your dick?

Not good.
Not good.

I don't.
Buddy Slade.
That's an interesting fact.
[Whispers] Come here.
Do you wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes.
[Whispers] I can't tell you in here.
OK, you got me out here.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together.
- And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade.
All right.
I'm pretty sure he's married with a kid on the way.
No, kid's here.
She already had it.
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.
So wait, are you not joking?
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.
They just tend to happen in slow motion.
They get divorced, they reconfigure, and society is, like, time with that.-.
...If you take your time, like an emotional glacier.
I'm 37...

I would find a therapist.

- Great to see you.
Mm... [laughs]
So...
This is, uh, quite the mid-week surprise.
Hey, I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
[laughs]
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, me neither.
But I thought, you know, just for old times' sake.
Actually, I haven't been drinking recently.
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and now that she's nursing our girl,
I thought I'd show some solidarity.
Right.
So...
- You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.
Ad sales now.
My dad's still there, so we have lunch together most days.
Yeah.
Pizza or sub sandwiches.
Awesome.
I've just been working my little butt off in the city.
You know, doing my thing.
Down there in the old Mini Apple?
God, Buddy.
Nobody calls it the Mini Apple any more.

I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.

What are you doing here?
I work here.
You know, bookkeeping, dealing with vendors.
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?
Just catching up with a friend.
Oh, catching up with a friend.
There's Buddy Slade, acquiring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar.
You're not wasting any time, are you?
Look, it was really great hanging out with you last night.
- It was great.
- OK.
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?

But hey, it's so rewarding, right?

Yeah.

It's so nice running into him.
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
- You wanna join us for a round?

I would.
Sadly, I have work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied person to complete even the simplest task.

- Bummer.
[Scoffs] I don't wanna step on your Mercury High reunion.
So...
Go, go, Injuns.
Actually, uh, they changed the name to "Indians" back in '99, remember?
The local Fond du Lac tribe did a whole thing with...
It sucks, what happened to Matt.
That poor guy suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.
Didn't you call him a theater fag all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.
Well, whatever. [Laughs]
Mercury's changed a lot since then, though.
We're way less of a hick town.
- Really?
- Mm.
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?
And we're getting a new Chipotle at the mall.
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.
You know, one of those Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.
That's genius.

You sound like one of your crazy characters.
Hey, so how's Allen?
- Allen is great.
Yeah.

Oh, sorry.
I didn't...
No, don't be sorry.
It's good.
It's fine.
Well, that's Allen's loss.
It sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't stay any longer.

Ah...
Actually, her band's playing here tomorrow night. [Laughs]
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow night to our house for a hang?
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.
- I would love that.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?
Sure.
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra.
She wants to be a writer someday.
Right, of course.
Um, but you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside.
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
It's still a pretty big deal, compared to the rest of us.
It was so great seeing you.
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
[Whispers] Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.

[Matt] So how'd the rest of your little date go?
- [Mavis] Good.
It was eye-opening.
- [Matt] Yeah?
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
[laughs] OK, he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
[laughs] I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
[Sniffs]
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
I'm thinking... it will be you.
Hm...
- Aren't you a little old for G.I. Joes?
- That one's still wet.
No, it's fine.
Jesus.
[Matt sighs]
- You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.
That one...
I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongul's body, so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead, and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.
I was tired and drunk.
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo.
I have to go check on something.
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.
I think this is it.
You think, or you know?
This is definitely it.

That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.
[laughs loudly] [laughing] You're fuckin' mentally ill.
- [Mavis] You see that window up there?
- [Matt] Yep.
I bet Buddy is awake jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
Can I help you End something?
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.
It's not a formal occasion.
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
OK.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old flame, and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.

Well, it's the end of my shift, and my son has to be picked up from school.
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.

Where are the Waverley Prep books?
They got their own display table right there.
Wow.

Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.
Mavis Gary-Crane.
See?
Do you know Jane MacMurray?
Yes, I know her really well.
- I wrote the book.
- OK.
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
No, that's fine.
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
We're probably not gonna sell them.
The series is done.
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
Whatever, book man.
[Mavis] Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
Hers was a gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However; being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan the love of her life?
- What up?
- Hey.
How are you?
- Ooh.
How are you?
- Good, good.
Here's that book for your niece.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There is a character in that one that's based on you.
- What?
- In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...
Hey.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.
You, too...
Oh... [laughs]
There it is.
Adorable.
Thank you.
- [Baby coos] - [Buddy, Beth] Aw...
- [Beth] You love it.
You love it.
- [cradle playing soft music]
[Buddy sighs]
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?
Oh, just a water.
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.
It's fine.
I'll just pump and dump after the show.
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes it does. [Chuckles]
Oh, starting to get smiles.
Cute.
She's, like, Buddy's clone.
No.
I see you in there.
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw a nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm an author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular.
[Chuckles]
I like your decor.
Is it shabby chic?
Pier One?
A little bit Goodwill.
Buddy and I used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that?
The '90s?
[Chuckling]
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.
It was just, like, the dumbest thing ever...
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.
I used to sleep in his T-shirts and boxers.
I think I still have a few.
Hey.
I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- [Buddy] What?
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.
[Beth laughs]
What's the chart?
Uh...
Oh.
- Beth teaches special needs kids.
- Oh.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
So we need to show them "this is what happy looks like,"
"this is what anxious looks like," and so on.
What about neutral?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
[Guitar tuning]
[woman] Oh, my God.
- Is that Mavis Gary?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.
Shots. [Laughs]
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Really?
Come on, tequila time.
Salt.
So... are they any good?
Yeah, they're all right.
Mm-hm.
I knew it.
They're horrible.
I knew it.
- Well, they have a lot of fun.
- Hm...
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.
[Mavis] He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy.
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.
- Think he owns any clown suits?
- [Mavis laughs]
- Oh, my God.
You're terrible.
- Come on.
- Dark.
- No.
Hello, Mercury!
[Cheering]
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.
We are Nipple Confusion.
Yeah.
Please be kind, as this is, um, only our second show.
And we all have small children at home.
Our first song is a cover.
This one goes out from our drummer, Beth, to her sweetheart, Buddy.
♫ She wears denim wherever she goes
♫ Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
♫ Oh, yeah
♫ Oh, yeah
♫ Still she won't be forced against her will
♫ Says she don't do drugs but she does the pill
♫ Oh, yeah
♫ Oh, yeah
♫ I didn't want to hurt you
♫ Oh, yeah
♫ I didn't want to hurt you
♫ Oh, yeah
♫ Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
♫ Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
♫ Oh, yeah
♫ Oh, yeah
♫ When she's at the gig she takes her can..
Remember when we used to make out to this song?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this song was playing the first time I went down on you.
- Huh?
- The first time I went... [mouthing words]
Uh-huh.
[Vocalizing]
- [laughter] - [woman] Oh!
Wow.
[Beth] I screwed up the fill so bad.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.
- You guys were namazing.
- Wait.
Did you just say "namazing"?
- I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.
Hardly.
It's so interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's so inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence on stage.
Really.
Beth, we gotta get home.
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.
I wanna stay out just a little while longer.
[Woman] Yeah, Buddy, you can't have her back tonight.
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.
Really?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.
Have fun.
[Beth] Thanks, Mavis.
[Buddy groans]
Whoa!
[Laughs]
Easy.
Tolerance has gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, since I knew you?
- I still know you.
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Don't you have that babysitter till 11:00?
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
I know, we can't, but time is just so precious.
For real.
- It goes so fast.
- I know.
Man, I really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know.
I can tell you're a great father.
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.
You do too much, even.
You think so?
Yes.
You're a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
[Door opens]
I thought I saw lights.
Hi, Daniel.
Yep, I'm home.
[Daniel] Where's Beth?
She wanted to stay out and party all night.
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and she doesn't want her "nuk" any more.
I got it.
Good night, Buddy.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yeah.
[♫ Cracker: "Low"]
Wow.
- Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
There's some low-hanging fruit.
- You are low-hanging fruit.
- [chuckles]
- Ch, no.
No.
- What?
I hate this guy over here.
[Sighs]
That's my cousin, Mike.
Mike Moran is your cousin?
Unfortunately.
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
- Mavis?
- Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, coz, this is such a rad surprise.
Yeah, I'm in town just for a little real estate thing.
- How are you?
Yeah.
- I'm great.
Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary.
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood?
Porcelain?
- Strychnine?
- [Mike] Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.
You mean rock crawling, right?
No, I'm vertical, bro, believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity.
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.
- You should try it, Matt.
- No.
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.
It's like Will Grace.
- Aw, it is.
- No, it isn't.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later.
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you got there.
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
God, he got so much attention.
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.
Please.
That dick ruined my sweet 16, same weekend.
God, you are a piece of work.
You're a piece of shit.
[Veruca Salt singing "Seether" over car stereo]
[clattering]
[TV plays indistinctly] [woman] You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a Cougar.
- [Woman 2] How I'm a cougar?
- [Mavis groans]
- [woman 2] I'm not even 30 years old.
- [woman 1] You're a Cougar.
[Woman 2] I am turning 30 this year and I am freaked out.
It's pretty old.
Kim Kardashian channels her own inner Cougar.
[Sighs]
Fuck.
[Mavis] The kiss was electric, transformative, spiritual, enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
[Girl] I said, "Listen, Kyle, you're everything to me.
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"
- And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.
I'm gonna have a... [cell phone vibrates]
Hey, you.
- Hey, how are you?
- [Mavis] I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
Um, how much longer are you gonna be in town?
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?
I was just wondering if you're still in town this weekend, if you wanna come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's this little hippy thing we 're doing out in the yard.
It's not religious or anything...
- I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.
Um...
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.
- Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.
Hey, Mom.
[Mother] Were you even gonna say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like.
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom.
OK?
I was planning on calling.
Why didn't you just come and stay with us?
Because I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea.
I have tons and tons of work to catch up on.
Books still selling well?
It's like I can hardly keep up.
Is that the money you used to invest in local real estate?
Huh?
I heard you were here to work on some kind of real estate transaction.
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
- Honey?
- [man] Huh?
- Look what I found.
- [man] What?
- [laughs] Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Who's this?
- This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.
- Dolce.
- Hello.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
You gotta start taking care of yourself, sweetie.
You know, a Lean Cuisine is not a meal.
Yeah, I think I might be an alcoholic.
[laughs] Very funny.
- You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
You know what, Mom?
Can you please take down that photo of me and Allen?
Which picture, sweetie?
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
- Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
Actually I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy.
Oh, the old beau, huh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way, but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
The people who really know you best.
Mm-hm.
And that new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it?
Up close?
[Mother] I suppose.
Is everything OK?
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.
It's just that Buddy used to say that we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
[Engine rumbling]
Yeah!
Sweet ride.
What is that, a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Oh, heavy.
How are they?
Horrible.
God, I've been through a lot.
- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?
Come on.
Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
- And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...
- Come on!
- Fine.
Could you walk any slower?
[Mavis groans] Our school is so ugly.
It looks like a factory.
[Matt] it actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
[Mavis] You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were such a slut.
I was normal.
Uh...
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
How's the master plan unfolding?
Well, actually, he called me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
I don't know.
There's still so much that's unspoken, but he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man.
By all accounts, happily.
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.
He gave me his sweatshirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
You're one to talk.
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know you use this whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
"Scuffle."
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
OK?
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch they shattered my legs, bashed in my brains, mangled my cock, so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
Then they left me for dead.
You know, things aren't too great down south.
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
You know, what's done is done.
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past.
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser, trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It really is a shame that you're like this, because if you had a good personality, none of this other stuff would bother people.
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories, because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
[Mavis] It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan still loved hen crystal clean
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend, but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
Who was taking care of Kendal?
And on the subject of fain..
Was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
No.
Life wasn't fain and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
[Indistinct chatter]
[♫ Toots The Maytals:
"Pressure Drop"]
Hi, Jan.
Oh, hi. [Laughs]
Wow, really been a long time.
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.
- Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?
[laughs] Wow.
How are you doing?
Mm.
I'm good.
- Good.
- I brought presents.
Oh, thank you.
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?
Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?
Uh, yeah.
Ooh!
[Laughs]
Are you having fun?
Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.
I think we should talk privately.
Sure, yeah.
Um...
Here, follow me.
OK.
OK, so what's going on?
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now.
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
Well, hey, she pushed it out. [Chuckles]
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's in here and I know what's in here.
Buddy... you're my moon, my stars.
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis!
What are you doing?
[Scoffs]
OK.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
We can work this out.
You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know.
We can beat this together.
[Sighs]
You're better than this.
I have to go.
I think you should leave.
Hey, look who's up.
Hey, let me take her.
Let me...
Come here.
There you are.
There you are.
Oh...
[Buddy chuckles]
Can you do me a favor?
We need everybody outside.
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.
[Woman] Those are delicious.
[Jan] Hey, listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
Come on, let's go.
Mavis?
- What?
- Are you OK?
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here.
Uh...
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh, my God.
[Beth] uh...
I'll...
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch.
[laughing] Oh, my God.
You should see your face.
It's a joke.
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
I love your sweater.
I'll get you a rag.
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here.
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
You know, the funny thing is,
I could have had this party a long time ago.
This exact same party.
Yeah.
Buddy and I were together for four years, and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.
It is silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart.
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
And we were gonna keep it!
Mm-hm.
We were gonna have a little baby, and a little naming party, and a Funquarium, and all of that.
And then 12 weeks into it...
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable down south in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager, and probably even more kids, because we always found each other.
Always!
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
What the fuck?
[Drums playing]
It's a new drum set for Beth.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What is wrong with you?
Are you like one of those little kids who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?
That's enough, Mavis.
You're drunk.
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom, and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.
We all do, Mavis.
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness, some depression.
You're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying.
He's not.
Well.
What about now?
You hate me now?
Hm?
'Cause it should be easy, 'cause I fucking hate you.
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?
Mavis, honey.
You know, I came back for you.
For you!
And I hate this town!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
But I came back.
I just wanted you to know that.
[Knocking on door]
I screwed up.
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?
You're scaring me.
I'm crazy.
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
[Sobbing] I ruined my dress.
[Sniffles]
Um...
I'll get you...
I'll get you a shirt.
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
[Whispers] Hide me.
[Matt] It's OK.
It's OK.
Why Buddy?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
[Sighs]
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
You know, I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker, shaped like a heart and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me,
and I was at my best.
[Breathes deeply]
Good morning.
Hi.
Coffee?
Sure.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over.
It got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last one right now.
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade from school.
Um, yeah.
I know that Beth.
What do you think of her?
Um...
I don't really like her.
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is.
What happened to your dress?
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
Shit.
What's wrong?
What did I say?
[Sniffles]
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
It's really difficult for me to be happy and then for other people, it just seems so simple.
I know.
They just grow up, and they're so... fulfilled.
I don't feel fulfilled.
- Well...
- And frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
I need to change, Sandra.
- No, you don't.
- What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book, or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
I mean, you think so?
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
You know, living in the big city, all famous and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special or whatever.
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
I'll sit and think about you, living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
It seems really nice.
Yeah.
But...
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you.
[Chuckles] I needed that.
You're right.
This place blows.
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me?
Take me with you.
You know, to the Mini Apple.
You're good here, Sandra.
Oh.
[Lock beeps]
Dolce.
I'm so sorry.
My baby.
Come here.
[Mavis] Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class, there was an unmistakable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day, it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
Good boy.
Poor Ryan...
Lost at sea.
They don't need those back.
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
[Tires screech]
[Mavis] Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
Cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of hen
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future.
A new chapter.
As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss... [alarm chirps] ...thinking, "Life, here I come."
I'm just.-. I don't fee/ pretty right now.
Having my friends here is great, but it's like, making my self-esteem go down really bad.
And they look so good, and they're just like, like the hottest girls in the world, and here I am just like...
- ...and you're...
- Babe.
- I got to get ready.
- No, you don't.
Come here.
- That's just it.
- What?
Kendra, you are the most beautiful woman.
And don 't let anybody coming around...
-..after you just had a baby, make you not feel that way, babe.
You want that?
All right, come on.
Follow me.
Kendal Strickland vvasrft just the prettiest girl at I/Veverley Prep, she was a legend.
As a junior; the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her;
even though another student had recently died.
Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just ca/lin' to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?
When you send something that soon, it's for the inner circle.
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the father who doesn't talk to him any more-
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I am not worked up in the slightest.
I was just trying to tell you about something that happened.
God!
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent parent.
Can you imagine still living in Mercury?
Trapped with a wife and a kid, and some crappy job?
It's like..-
It's like he's a hostage-
Yup
- We're lucky we got out-
- Yes.
- We have lives.
Let me let you borrow an outfit 'cause that dress is hideous, honey.
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come with me now to the TV Guide party because who wants to go to a party by themselves?
- lt's to die for
- That is fab.
I just think that Tyler and I are like soul twins.
You know?
Right before he texts me,
- it's like I can...
- Sense it?
Yes!
Like psychically.
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
Like text chemistry.
Exactly.
Just as Kendal hit "send," a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied.
They had "textual chemistry. "
So, all told, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
Why?
Long story short, I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.
Oh, my God.
Yikes.
Yeah, it was probably one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Of course.
Sure, totally.
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Dolce, take a pee.
Dolce, pee.
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Welcome to Hampton Inn.
Do you have a reservation?
No.
Mavis Gary.
- Is that a dog in your bag?
- Nope.
We actually allow small pets with a cleaning deposit.
Good, because I have a small dog, in my vehicle.
I'll put that you have a dog-
How many keys do you need?
Two, please.
Expecting company?
Hi.
You.
Personal.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Slade.
I can't.
There 'S nothing I can do for you.
I love Mason more than I love you.
Hey, Buddy, this is Mavis.
Remember?
Mavis Gary?
I'm in town for this little real estate thing, and I...
I don't know, I just thought if you have time, and you wanna grab a drink, catch up?
Something like that.
All right, well, listen, call me and... and let me know.
All right, bye.
Fuck.
- Hey, Buddy.
- Mavis Gary.
- It's been..- how long?
- I'm not sure.
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.
I am insanely busy as always.
Well, I don't know how long you're around with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
OK.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,
I could meet you at Woody's in I don't know, 15 minutes?
Spontaneous really isn't a thing these days-
I don't know if you heard, but I am a new dad-
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.
I got that announcement.
- Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
How about we meet tomorrow at this place called Champion O'Malley's?
- It's kind of fun.
- Of course, yes.
Yeah-
How does 8:00, 8:30 sound?
- 6:00 would be better.
- 6:00 is perfect.
Great, I'll see you at 6:00.
Maker's Mark.
What?
I'm sorry, but I think we went to high school together-
- At the same time?
- Yeah.
You're Mavis Gary?
Mavis Gary-Crane now.
I'm Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually next to yours, all through high school.
Matt...
Freehauf.
Yeah.
Yeah, your locker was right there.
Right next to mine.
We didn't run in the same circles-
You were pretty popular, if I remember correctly.
You won "Best Hair."
Did I?
What did you win?
I didn't.
They usually give out, like, 15 of those, and only to the same tive people.
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it was really nice seeing you...
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?
Of course not.
Gross.
No, I live in Minneapolis.
I'm just here taking care of a little real estate thing.
- I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.
Yes, I am an author.
Children's books.
Y.A
- That's industry speak for "Young Adult-"
It's a very popular teen series- it's everywhere.
It's huge.
- You've probably seen it.
- Vampires?
Hey, take that, liver.
Weren't you that hate crime guy?
Excuse me?
You totally were.
You're the hate crime guy.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?
Now I know who you are.
Matt, the hate crime guy.
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a..-
When we were seniors, a bunch of jocks who thought I was gayjumped me in the woods..-
That's right- ...and hit me on the legs and dick with a crowbar.
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out that I wasn't really gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime any more-
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
Fuck.
How's your dick?
Not good.
Not good.
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.
You know, it's just kind of does a...
Hard Jacks.
Do you know who drinks these?
I don't.
Buddy Slade.
That's an interesting fact.
Come here.
Do you wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes-
I can't tell you in here.
OK, you got me out here.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together.
- And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade.
All right.
I'm pretty sure he's married with a kid on the way.
No, kid's here.
She already had it.
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too-
So wait, are you not joking?
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.
They just tend to happen in slow motion.
They get divorced, they reconfigure, and society is, like, time with that.-.
..
-If you take your time, like an emotional glacier
- I'm 37..-
Mavis, I would keep all of this to yourself.
I would find a therapist.
Talk to a professional.
- Matt.
- Oh, boy.
Don't you get it?
Love conquers all.
Have you not seen The Graduate?
Or, like, I don't Know, anything?
Oh, a taxi.
Yes, we called it.
Mavis, hey!
Buddy Slade has a life.
Buddy Slade has a life.
No, he has a baby, and babies are boring!
Having spent the summer outside Waverley Prep,
Kendal looked around at her fellow students, thinking,
"Did I really get that much better;
or did everyone simply get worse?
Why was Ryan spending so much time with this dumpy new girl?"
Mavis, this is Jim.
Do you even have any pages?
I'm trying to help you, but I can?
ffyou...
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh, yeah
Oh, no, not gonna need those.
You're gonna wanna try the popcorn shrimp.
No, I'm not.
A couple of Hard Jacks, please.
OK.
Hey.
Hey, you.
- Wow.
- Great to see you.
So...
This is quite the mid-week surprise.
Hey, I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, me neither.
But I thought, just for old times' sake.
Actually, I haven't been drinking recently.
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and now that she's nursing our girl,
I thought I'd show some solidarity-
Right.
So...
- You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.
Ad sales now.
My dad's still there, so we have lunch together most days.
Yeah.
Pizza or sub sandwiches.
Awesome.
I've just been working my little butt off in the city.
You know, doing my thing.
Down there in the old Mini Apple?
God, Buddy.
Nobody calls it the Mini Apple anymore.
I didn't know.
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.
Give our waitress a break.
So chivalrous.
Mavis.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You know, bookkeeping, dealing with vendors.
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?
Just catching up with a friend.
Oh, catching up with a friend.
There's Buddy Slade, acquiring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar.
You're not wasting any time, are you?
Look, it was really great hanging out with you last night.
- It was great.
- OK.
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie.
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?
Yeah.
It's so nice running into him.
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
You wanna join us for a round?
I would love to.
I would-
Sadly, I have work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied person to complete even the simplest task.
- So...
- Bummer.
I don't wanna step on your Mercury High reunion.
So...
Go, go, Injuns.
Actually, they changed the name to "Indians" back in '99, remember?
The local Fond du Lac tribe... did a whole thing with...
It sucks, what happened to Matt.
That poor guy suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is-
- No.
Didn't you call him a theater fag all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.
Well, whatever.
Mercury's changed a lot since then, though.
We're way less of a hick town.
Really?
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?
And we're getting a new Chipotle at the mall.
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.
You know, one of those Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.
That's genius.
KenTacoHut.
You sound like one of your crazy characters.
Hey, so how's Allen?
Allen is great.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's good-
We're not married anymore, but...
Oh, sorry.
I didn't...
No, don't be sorry.
It's good.
It's fine.
Well, that's A|
Ien's loss.
It sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.
She's got band practice tonight.
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.
Just something she does with the other moms.
Wow, cool.
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.
Oh, my God.
Embarrassing.
Actually, her band's playing here tomorrow night.
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow night to our house for a hang?
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.
- I would love that.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?
Sure.
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra-
She wants to be a writer someday.
Right, of course.
But you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside.
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
It's still a pretty big deal, compared to the rest of us.
It was so great seeing you.
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.
I do?
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed, you just got lucky.
- I'll see you tomorrow-
- Yeah, great-
- OK.
- Good night.
Hello?
Look, I just want you to know that what you think you saw tonight is not what it was, OK?
Oh, so you're not trying to destroy Buddy SIade's marriage.
It is way more complicated than you can possibly ever understand, OK?
Buddy Slade and I have years and years of history, and it is very rich, and very complex.
Wow, yeah, that sounds way beyond my comprehension.
Don't open a new ranch till the old one's done.
- What?
- That's my sister.
Forget it.
- Just so you know.
- I got it.
Thank you.
Do you want to get loaded, or something?
I'm Mavis-
I know.
From high school.
Right.
I made you those Rice Krispies squares that one time for your birthday.
I got your locker combination from the vice principal.
I put them in your locker?
Thank you.
- So where's Matt?
- In his cave.
Welcome to the distillery.
Are you making moonshine?
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.
You know what?
Hang on.
All right.
Check this out.
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong..-
That's a limited...
There's not a lot.
- "Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.
Mos Eisley...
Star Wars thing.
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's.-.
Let's let that age a little longer.
And I got another in here.
OK.
Now, see if you can detect some of the new oak.
- Oh, come on.
- OK.
They're kind of hidden in there.
So when you sip...
- I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.
Let's do a little...
There you go.
Woody.
Oak.
So how'd the rest of your little date go?
- Good.
It was eye-opening.
- Yeah?
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
OK, he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
I'm thinking... it will be you.
- Aren't you a little old for G.I. Joes?
- That one's still wet.
No, it's fine.
Jesus.
- You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.
That one...
I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongu|'s body, so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead, and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl-
I was tired and drunk.
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo-
I have to go check on something.
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.
I think this is it.
You think, or you know?
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty-
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.
You're fuckin' mentally ill.
- You see that window up there?
- Yep.
I bet Buddy is awake jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
Can I help you End something?
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.
It's not a formal occasion.
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
OK.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old flame, and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.
Let's show him what he's been missing-
No, he's seen me recently.
He knows.
But his wife hasn't seen me in a while, so...
Well, it's the end of my shift, and my son has to be picked up from school.
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.
Shawna!
Where are the Waverley Prep books?
They got their own display table right there.
Wow.
They must be really popular.
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
They were big a couple years ago, but the computer says, "Do not shelve," so...
Hey, are you writing in there?
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it-
You're Jane MacMurray?
No.
Jane MacMurrayjust created the series.
I wrote the book.
Mavis Gary-Crane.
See?
Do you know Jane MacMurray?
Yes, I know her really well.
- I wrote the book.
- OK.
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
No, that's fine.
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
We're probably not gonna sell them.
The series is done.
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
Whatever, book man.
Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
Hers was e gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However; being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wou/dn't scare away Ryan the love of her life?
- What up?
- Hey.
How are you?
- How are you?
- Good, good.
Here's that book for your niece.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There is a character in that one that's based on you.
- What?
- In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
- When you read it, it'|
I be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...
Hey.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.
You, too-
There it is.
Adorable.
Thank you.
You love it.
You love it.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?
Oh, just a water.
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.
It's fine.
I'll just pump and dump after the show-
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes it does.
Oh, starting to get smiles.
Cute.
She's, like, Buddy's clone.
No.
I see you in there.
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw a nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm an author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular-
I like your decor.
Is it shabby chic?
Pier One?
A little bit Goodwill.
Buddy and I used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that?
The '90s?
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.
It was just, like, the dumbest thing ever-
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.
I used to sleep in his T-shirts and boxers.
I think I still have a few.
Hey.
I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- What?
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you-
What's the chart?
Beth teaches special needs kids.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
So we need to show them "this is what happy looks like,"
"this is what anxious looks like," and so on.
What about neutral?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
Oh, my God.
- Is that Mavis Gary?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.
Shots.
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Really?
Come on, tequila time.
Salt.
So... are they any good?
Yeah, they're all right.
I knew it.
They're horrible.
I knew it.
Well, they have a lot of fun.
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.
He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy.
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer-
Think he owns any clown suits?
- Oh, my God.
You're terrible.
- Come on.
- Dark.
- No.
Hello, Mercury!
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.
We are Nipple Confusion.
Yeah.
Please be kind, as this is only our second show.
And we all have small children at home.
Our first song is a cover-
This one goes out from our drummer, Beth, to her sweetheart, Buddy.
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Still she won't be forced against her will
Says she don't do drugs, but she does the pill
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
When she's at the gig she takes her can..
Remember when we used to make out to this song?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this song was playing the first time I went down on you.
The first time I went...
I screwed up the fill so bad.
- Oh, my God-
- I'm sorry, guys-
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.
- You guys were namazing_
- Wait.
Did you just say "namazing"?
- I think someone's had a few too many-
- That's not fair.
Hardly.
It's so interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's so inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence on stage-
Reany.
Beth, we gotta get home.
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.
I wanna stay out just a little while longer.
Yeah, Buddy, you can't have her back tonight.
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home-
Really?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.
You sure?
Have fun.
Thanks, Mavis.
Easy.
Tolerance has gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, since I knew you?
- I still know you.
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Don't you have that babysitter till 11:00?
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
I know, we can't, but time is just so precious.
For real.
- It goes so fast.
- I know.
Man, I really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know.
I can tell you're a great father-
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.
You do too much, even.
You think so?
Yes-
You're a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
I thought I saw lights.
Hi, Daniel.
Yep, I'm home.
Where's Beth?
She wanted to stay out and party all night.
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and she doesn't want her "nuk" any more-
I got it.
Good night, Buddy.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Wow.
- Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
There's some low-hanging fruit.
You are low-hanging fruit.
- Ch, no.
No.
- What?
I hate this guy over here.
That's my cousin, Mike.
Mike Moran is your cousin?
Unfortunately.
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
- Mavis?
- Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, coz, this is such a rad surprise.
Yeah, I'm in town just for a little real estate thing.
- How are you?
Yeah.
- I'm great.
Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary.
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood?
Porcelain?
- Strychnine?
- Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.
You mean rock crawling, right?
No, I'm vertical, bro, believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity.
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.
- You should try it, Matt.
- No.
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.
|t's like Will Grace.
- It is.
- No, it isn't.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later.
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you got there.
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
God, he got so much attention.
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.
Please.
That dick ruined my sweet 16, same weekend.
God, you are a piece of work.
You're a piece of shit.
You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a Cougar.
How I'm a Cougar?
I'm not even 30 years old.
You're a Cougar.
I am turning 30 this year and I am freaked out.
It's pretty old.
Kim Kardashfan channels her own inner Cougar.
Fuck.
The kiss was electric, transformative, spiritual, enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
I said, "Listen, Kyle, you're everything to me.
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"
- And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.
I'm gonna have a...
Hey, you.
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
How much longer are you gonna be in town?
I'm here for you- How long do you need?
I was just wondering if you're still in town this weekend, if you wanna come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's this little hippy thing we 're doing out in the yard.
It's not religious or anything..-
- I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.
- Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.
Hey, Mom.
Were you even gonna say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like-
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom.
OK?
I was planning on calling.
Why didn't you just come and stay with us?
Because I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea.
I have tons and tons of work to catch up on.
Books still selling well?
It's like I can hardly keep up.
Is that the money you used to invest in local real estate?
I heard you were here to work on some kind of real estate transaction.
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
Honey?
- Look what I found.
- What?
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Who's this?
- This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.
- Dolce.
- Hello.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
You gotta start taking care of yourself, sweetie.
You know, a Lean Cuisine is not a meal.
Yeah, I think I might be an alcoholic.
Very funny.
- You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
You know what, Mom?
Can you please take down that photo of me and Allen?
Which picture, sweetie?
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
- Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams-
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
Actually I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy-
Oh, the old beau, huh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way, but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
The people who really know you best.
And that new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it?
Up close?
I suppose.
Is everything OK?
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell-
it's just that Buddy used to say that we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
Yeah!
Sweet ride.
What is that, a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Oh, heavy.
How are they?
Horrible
- God, I've been through a lot-
- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?
Come on.
Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
- And grab some of that Star I/Varsjuice-
- That's a limited..-
- Come on!
- Fine.
Could you walk any slower?
Our school is so ugly.
It looks like a factory.
It actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were such a slut.
I was normal.
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
How's the master plan unfolding?
Well, actually, he called me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
I don't know.
There's still so much that's unspoken, but... .-.he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man.
By all accounts, happily.
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.
He gave me his sweatshirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
You're one to talk.
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know you use this whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
"Scuffle."
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
OK?
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch they shattered my legs, bashed in my brains, mangled my cock, so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
Then they left me for dead.
You know, things aren't too great down south-
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
You know, what's done is done.
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past.
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser, trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that-
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It really is a shame that you're like this, because if you had a good personality, none of this other stuff would bother people.
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories, because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan stil/ loved hen crystal clean
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend, but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
Who was taking care of Kendal?
And on the subject of fain..
Was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
No.
Life wasn't fain and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
Hi, Jan.
Oh, hi.
Wow, really been a long time.
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.
- Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?
Wow.
How are you doing?
I'm good-
- Good.
- I brought presents.
Oh, thank you.
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?
Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?
Yeah.
Are you having fun?
Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.
I think we should talk privately.
Sure, yeah.
Here, follow me.
OK.
OK, so what's going on?
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now-
I gotta get Beth's gift ready- I got her a drum set.
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
Well, hey, she pushed it out.
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's in here..- ...and I know what's in here.
Buddy.-. you're my moon, my stars.
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis!
What are you doing?
OK.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
We can work this out.
You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know.
We can beat this together-
You're better than this.
I have to go.
I think you should leave.
Hey, look who's up.
Hey, let me take her.
Let me...
Come here.
There you are.
Can you do me a favor?
We need everybody outside.
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.
Those are delicious.
Hey, listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
Come on, let's go-
Mavis?
- What?
- Are you OK?
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here.
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh, my God.
- I'll get some..-
- Fuck you.
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch.
Oh, my God.
You should see your face.
It's a joke-
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
I love your sweater.
I'll get you a rag-
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here.
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
You know, the funny thing is,
I could have had this party a long time ago.
This exact same party.
Yeah.
Buddy and I were together for four years, and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.
It is silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart.
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
And we were gonna keep it!
We were gonna have a little baby, and a little naming party, and a Funquarium, and all of that.
And then 12 weeks into it...
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone-
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable down south in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager, and probably even more kids, because we always found each other.
Always!
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
What the fuck?
It's a new drum set for Beth.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What is wrong with you?
Are you like one of those little kids who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?
That's enough, Mavis
- You're drunk-
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom, and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.
We all do, Mavis.
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness, some depression.
You're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying.
He's not.
Well.
What about now?
You hate me now?
'Cause it should be easy, 'cause I fucking hate you.
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?
Mavis, honey.
You know, I came back for you.
For you!
And I hate this town!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
But I came back.
I just wanted you to know that.
I screwed up.
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?
You're scaring me.
I'm crazy-
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
I ruined my dress.
I'll get you..-
I'll get you a shirt-
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
Hide me.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Why Buddy?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
You know, I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker, shaped like a heart and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me,
and I was at my best.
Good morning.
Hi.
Coffee?
Sure.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over.
It got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last one right now-
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade from school.
Yeah.
I know that Beth.
What do you think of her? I don't really like her.
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is.
What happened to your dress?
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
Shit.
What's wrong?
What did I say?
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
It's really difficult for me to be happy and then for other people, it just seems so simple-
I know.
They just grow up, and they're so... fulfilled-
I d0n't feel fulfilled.
- Well...
- And frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
I need to change, Sandra.
- No, you don't.
- What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book, or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
I mean, you think so?
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
You know, living in the big city, all famous and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special or whatever.
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
I'll sit and think about you, living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
It seems really nice.
Yeah.
But...
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you.
I needed that.
You're right.
This place blows.
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me?
Take me with you.
You know, to the Mini Apple.
You're good here, Sandra.
Oh.
Dolce.
I'm so sorry.
My baby.
Come here.
Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the va/edictorian of her class, there was an unmistakable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day, it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
Good boy.
Poor Ryan...
Lost at sea.
They don't need those back.
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
Cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future.
A new chapter.
As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss thinking, "Life, here I come. "
I'm just...
I don't feel pretty right now.
Having my friends here is great, but it's like, making my self-esteem go down really bad.
And they look so good, and they're just like, like the hottest girls in the world, and here I am just like...
- and you're...
- Babe.
- I got to get ready.
- No, you don't.
Come here.
- That's just it.
- What?
Kendra, you are the most beautiful woman.
And don't let anybody coming around, after you just had a baby, make you not feel that way, babe.
You want that?
All right, come on.
Follow me.
Kendal Strickland wasn't just the prettiest girl at Waverley Prep, she was a legend.
As a junior, the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her, even though another student had recently died.
Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?
When you send something that soon, it's for the inner circle.
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the father who doesn't talk to him anymore.
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I am not worked up in the slightest.
I was just trying to tell you about something that happened.
God!
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent parent.
Can you imagine still living in Mercury?
Trapped with a wife and a kid, and some crappy job?
It's like...
It's like he's a hostage.
Yup.
We're lucky we got out.
- Yes.
- We have lives.
Let me let you borrow an outfit 'cause that dress is hideous, honey.
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come with me now to the TV Guide party because who wants to go to a party by themselves?
- It's to die for.
- That is fab.
I just think that Tyler and I are like soul twins.
You know?
It is like, right before he texts me,
- it's like I can...
- Sense it?
Yes!
Like psychically.
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
Like text chemistry.
Exactly.
Just as Kendal hit "send," a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied.
They had "textual chemistry."
So, all told, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
Why?
Long story short, I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.
Oh, my God.
Yikes.
Yeah, it was probably one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Of course.
Sure, totally.
# I didn't want to hurt you #
Dolce, take a pee.
Dolce, pee.
# She wears denim wherever she goes #
# Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo #
# Oh, yeah #
# I didn't want to hurt you #
# Oh, yeah #
Welcome to Hampton Inn.
Do you have a reservation?
No.
Mavis...
Gary.
- Is that a dog in your bag?
- Nope.
We actually allow small pets with a cleaning deposit.
Good, because I have a small dog, in my vehicle.
I'll put that you have a dog.
How many keys do you need?
Two, please.
Expecting company?
Hi.
You.
Personal.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Slade.
Hey, Buddy, this is Mavis.
Remember?
Mavis Gary?
I'm in town for this little real estate thing, and I...
I don't know, I just thought, you know, if you have time, and you wanna grab a drink, catch up?
Something like that.
All right, well, listen, call me and... and let me know.
All right, bye.
Fuck.
- Hey, Buddy.
- Mavis Gary.
- It's been... how long?
- I'm not sure.
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.
I am insanely busy as always.
Well, I don't know how long you're around with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
OK.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,
I could meet you at Woody's in...
I don't know, 15 minutes?
Spontaneous really isn't a thing these days.
I don't know if you heard, but I am a new dad.
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.
I got that announcement.
- Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
How about we meet tomorrow at this place called Champion O'Malley's?
- It's kind of fun.
- Of course, yes.
Yeah.
How does 8:00, 8:30 sound?
- 6:00 would be better. - 6:00 is perfect.
Great, I'll see you at 6:00.
Maker's Mark.
What?
I'm sorry, but I think we went to high school together.
- At the same time?
- Yeah.
You're Mavis Gary?
Mavis Gary-Crane now.
I'm Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually next to yours, all through high school.
Matt...
Freehauf.
Yeah.
Yeah, your locker was right there.
Right next to mine.
We didn't run in the same circles.
You were pretty popular, if I remember correctly.
You won "Best Hair."
Did I?
What did you win?
I didn't.
They usually give out, like, 15 of those, and only to the same five people.
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it was really nice seeing you...
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?
Of course not.
Gross.
No, I live in Minneapolis.
I'm just here taking care of a little real estate thing.
- I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.
Yes, I am an author.
Children's books.
Y.A. That's industry speak for "Young Adult."
It's a very popular teen series.
It's everywhere.
It's huge.
- You've probably seen it.
- Vampires?
Hey, take that, liver.
Weren't you that hate crime guy?
Excuse me?
You totally were.
You're the hate crime guy.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?
Now I know who you are.
Matt, the hate crime guy.
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a...
When we were seniors, a bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods...
That's right.
and hit me on the legs and dick with a crowbar.
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out that I wasn't really gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime anymore.
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
Fuck.
How's your dick?
Not good.
Not good.
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.
You know, it's just kind of does a...
Hard Jacks.
Do you know who drinks these?
I don't.
Buddy Slade.
Buddy Slade.
That's an interesting fact.
Come here.
Do you wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes.
I can't tell you in here.
OK, you got me out here.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together.
- And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade.
All right.
I'm pretty sure he's married with a kid on the way.
No, kid's here.
She already had it.
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.
So wait, are you not joking?
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.
They just tend to happen in slow motion.
They get divorced, they reconfigure, and society is, like, fine with that... if you take your time, like an emotional glacier.
I'm 37...
Mavis, I would keep all of this to yourself.
I would find a therapist.
Talk to a professional.
- Matt.
- Oh, boy.
Don't you get it?
Love conquers all.
Have you not seen The Graduate?
Or, like, I don't know, anything?
Oh, a taxi.
Yes, we called it.
Mavis, hey!
Buddy Slade has a life.
Buddy Slade has a life.
No, he has a baby, and babies are boring!
Having spent the summer outside Waverley Prep,
Kendal looked around at her fellow students, thinking,
"Did I really get that much better, or did everyone simply get worse?
Why was Ryan spending so much time with this dumpy new girl?"
Mavis, this is Jim.
Do you even have any pages?
I'm trying to help you, but I can't if you...
# Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back #
# Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack #
# Oh, yeah #
Oh, no, not gonna need those.
You're gonna wanna try the popcorn shrimp.
No, I'm not.
A couple of Hard Jacks, please.
OK.
Hey.
Hey, you.
- Wow.
- Great to see you.
So...
This is quite the mid-week surprise.
Hey, I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, me neither.
But I thought, just for old times' sake.
Actually, I haven't been drinking recently.
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and now that she's nursing our girl,
I thought I'd show some solidarity.
Right.
So...
- You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.
Ad sales now.
My dad's still there, so we have lunch together most days.
Yeah.
Pizza or sub sandwiches.
Awesome.
I've just been working my little butt off in the city.
You know, doing my thing.
Down there in the old Mini Apple?
God, Buddy.
Nobody calls it the Mini Apple anymore.
I didn't know.
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.
Give our waitress a break.
So chivalrous.
Mavis.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You know, bookkeeping, dealing with vendors.
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?
Just catching up with a friend.
Oh, catching up with a friend.
There's Buddy Slade, acquiring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar.
You're not wasting any time, are you?
Look, it was really great hanging out with you last night.
- It was great.
- OK.
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie.
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?
Yeah.
It's so nice running into him.
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
You wanna join us for a round?
I would love to.
I would.
Sadly, I have work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied person to complete even the simplest task.
- So...
- Bummer.
I don't wanna step on your Mercury High reunion.
So...
Go, go, Injuns.
Actually, they changed the name to "Indians" back in '99, remember?
The local Fond du Lac tribe did a whole thing with...
It sucks, what happened to Matt.
That poor guy suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.
Didn't you call him a theater fag all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.
Well, whatever.
Mercury's changed a lot since then, though.
We're way less of a hick town.
Really?
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?
And we're getting a new Chipotle at the mall.
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.
You know, one of those Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.
That's genius.
KenTacoHut.
You sound like one of your crazy characters.
Hey, so how's Allen?
Allen is great.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's good.
We're not married anymore, but...
Oh, sorry.
I didn't...
No, don't be sorry.
It's good.
It's fine.
Well, that's Allen's loss.
It sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.
She's got band practice tonight.
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.
Just something she does with the other moms.
Wow, cool.
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.
Oh, my God.
Embarrassing.
Actually, her band's playing here tomorrow night.
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow night to our house for a hang?
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.
- I would love that.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?
Sure.
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra.
She wants to be a writer someday.
Right, of course.
But you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside.
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
It's still a pretty big deal, compared to the rest of us.
It was so great seeing you.
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.
I do?
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed, you just got lucky.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.
- OK.
- Good night.
Hello?
Look, I just want you to know that what you think you saw tonight is not what it was, OK?
Oh, so you're not trying to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage.
It is way more complicated than you can possibly ever understand, OK?
Buddy Slade and I have years and years of history, and it is very rich, and very complex.
Wow, yeah, that sounds way beyond my comprehension.
Don't open a new ranch till the old one's done.
- What?
- That's my sister.
Forget it.
- Just so you know.
- I got it.
Thank you.
Do you want to get loaded, or something?
I'm Mavis.
I know.
From high school.
Right.
I made you those Rice Krispies squares that one time for your birthday.
I got your locker combination from the vice principal.
I put them in your locker?
Thank you.
- So where's Matt?
- In his cave.
Welcome to the distillery.
Are you making moonshine?
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.
You know what?
Hang on.
All right.
Check this out.
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong...
That's a limited...
There's not a lot.
- "Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.
Mos Eisley...
Star Wars thing.
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's...
Let's let that age a little longer.
And I got another in here.
OK.
Now, see if you can detect... some of the new oak.
- Oh, come on.
- OK.
They're kind of hidden in there.
So when you sip...
- I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.
Let's do a little...
There you go.
Woody.
Oak.
So how'd the rest of your little date go?
- Good.
It was eye-opening.
- Yeah?
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
OK, he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
I'm thinking... it will be you.
- Aren't you a little old for G. I. Joes?
- That one's still wet.
No, it's fine.
Jesus.
- You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.
That one...
I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongul's body, so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead, and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.
I was tired and drunk.
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo.
I have to go check on something.
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.
I think this is it.
You think, or you know?
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty.
That's ironic... because he has no liberty.
You're fuckin' mentally ill.
- You see that window up there?
- Yep.
I bet Buddy is awake... jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
Can I help you find something?
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.
It's not a formal occasion.
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
OK.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old flame, and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.
Let's show him what he's been missing.
No, he's seen me recently.
He knows.
But his wife hasn't seen me in a while, so...
Well, it's the end of my shift, and my son has to be picked up from school.
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.
Shawna!
Where are the Waverley Prep books?
They got their own display table right there.
Wow.
They must be really popular.
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
They were big a couple years ago, but the computer says, "Do not shelve," so...
Hey, are you writing in there?
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.
You're Jane MacMurray?
No.
Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.
Mavis Gary-Crane.
See?
Do you know Jane MacMurray?
Yes, I know her really well.
- I wrote the book.
- OK.
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
No, that's fine.
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
We're probably not gonna sell them.
The series is done.
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
Whatever, book man.
Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off.
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen... of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
Hers was a gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However, being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan... the love of her life?
- What up?
- Hey.
How are you?
- How are you?
- Good, good.
Here's that book for your niece.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There is a character in that one that's based on you.
- What?
- In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...
Hey.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.
You, too.
There it is.
Adorable.
Thank you.
You love it.
You love it.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?
Oh, just a water.
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.
It's fine.
I'll just pump and dump after the show.
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes it does.
Oh, starting to get smiles.
Cute.
She's, like, Buddy's clone.
No.
I see you in there.
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw a nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm an author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular.
I like your decor.
Is it shabby chic?
Pier One?
A little bit Goodwill.
Buddy and I used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that?
The '90s?
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.
It was just, like, the dumbest thing ever.
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.
I used to sleep in his T-shirts and boxers.
I think I still have a few.
Hey.
I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- What?
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.
What's the chart?
Beth teaches special needs kids.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
So we need to show them "this is what happy looks like,"
"this is what anxious looks like," and so on.
What about neutral?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
Oh, my God.
- Is that Mavis Gary?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.
Shots.
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Really?
Come on, tequila time.
Salt.
So... are they any good?
Yeah, they're all right.
I knew it.
They're horrible.
I knew it.
Well, they have a lot of fun.
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.
He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy.
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.
Think he owns any clown suits?
- Oh, my God.
You're terrible.
- Come on.
- Dark.
- No.
Hello, Mercury!
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.
We are Nipple Confusion.
Yeah.
Please be kind, as this is only our second show.
And we all have small children at home.
Our first song is a cover.
This one goes out from our drummer, Beth, to her sweetheart, Buddy.
# She wears denim wherever she goes #
# Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo #
# Oh, yeah #
# Still she won't be forced against her will #
# Says she don't do drugs, but she does the pill #
# Oh, yeah #
# I didn't want to hurt you #
# Oh, yeah #
# I didn't want to hurt you #
# Oh, yeah #
# Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back #
# Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack #
# Oh, yeah #
# When she's at the gig she takes her car... #
Remember when we used to make out to this song?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this song was playing the first time I went down on you.
The first time I went...
I screwed up the fill so bad.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.
- You guys were amazing.
- Wait.
Did you just say "amazing"?
- I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.
Hardly.
It's so interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's so inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence on stage.
Really.
Beth, we gotta get home.
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.
I wanna stay out just a little while longer.
Yeah, Buddy, you can't have her back tonight.
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.
Really?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.
You sure?
Have fun.
Thanks, Mavis.
Easy.
Tolerance has gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, since I knew you?
- I still know you.
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Don't you have that babysitter till 11:00?
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
I know, we can't, but time is just so precious.
For real.
- It goes so fast.
- I know.
Man, I really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know.
I can tell you're a great father.
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.
You do too much, even.
You think so?
Yes.
You're a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
I thought I saw lights.
Hi, Daniel.
Yep, I'm home.
Where's Beth?
She wanted to stay out and party all night.
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and she doesn't want her "nuk" anymore.
I got it.
Good night, Buddy.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Wow.
- Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
There's some low-hanging fruit.
You are low-hanging fruit.
- Oh, no.
No.
- What?
I hate this guy over here.
That's my cousin, Mike.
Mike Moran is your cousin?
Unfortunately.
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
- Mavis?
- Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, coz, this is such a rad surprise.
Yeah, I'm in town just for a little real estate thing.
- How are you?
- I'm great.
Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary.
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood?
Porcelain?
- Strychnine?
- Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.
You mean rock crawling, right?
No, I'm vertical, bro, believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity.
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.
- You should try it, Matt.
- No.
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.
It's like Will Grace.
- Oh, it is.
- No, it isn't.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later.
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you got there.
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
God, he got so much attention.
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.
Please.
That dick ruined my sweet 16, same weekend.
God, you are a piece of work.
You're a piece of shit.
You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a cougar.
How I'm a cougar?
I'm not even 30 years old.
You're a cougar.
I am turning 30 this year and I am freaked out.
It's pretty old.
Kim Kardashian channels her own inner cougar.
Fuck.
The kiss was electric, transformative, spiritual, enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
I said, "Listen, Kyle, you're everything to me.
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"
- And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.
I'm gonna have a...
Hey, you.
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
How much longer are you gonna be in town?
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?
I was just wondering if you're still in town this weekend, if you wanna come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's this little hippy thing we're doing out in the yard.
It's not religious or anything...
- Buddy, I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.
- Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.
Hey, Mom.
Were you even gonna say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like.
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom.
OK?
I was planning on calling.
Why didn't you just come and stay with us?
Because I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea.
I have tons and tons of work to catch up on.
Books still selling well?
It's like I can hardly keep up.
Is that the money you used to invest in local real estate?
I heard you were here to work on some kind of real estate transaction.
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
Honey?
- Look what I found.
- What?
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Who's this?
- This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.
- Dolce.
- Hello.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
You gotta start taking care of yourself, sweetie.
You know, a Lean Cuisine is not a meal.
Yeah, I think I might be an alcoholic.
Very funny.
- You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
You know what, Mom?
Can you please take down that photo of me and Allen?
Which picture, sweetie?
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
- Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
Actually...
I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy.
Oh, the old beau, huh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way, but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
The people who really know you best.
And that new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it?
Up close?
I suppose.
Is everything OK?
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.
It's just that Buddy used to say that... we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
Yeah!
Sweet ride.
What is that, a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Oh, heavy.
How are they?
Horrible.
God, I've been through a lot.
- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?
Come on.
Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...
- Come on!
- Fine.
Could you walk any slower?
Our school is so ugly.
It looks like a factory.
It actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were such a slut.
I was normal.
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
How's the master plan unfolding?
Well, actually, he called me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
I don't know.
There's still so much that's unspoken, but... he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man.
By all accounts, happily.
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.
He gave me his sweatshirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
You don't want to talk.
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know you use this whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
"Scuffle."
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
OK?
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch... they shattered my legs, bashed in my brains, mangled my cock, so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
Then they left me for dead.
You know, things aren't too great down south.
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
You know, what's done is done.
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past.
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser, trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It really is a shame that you're like this, because if you had a good personality, none of this other stuff would bother people.
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories, because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan still loved her, crystal clear.
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend, but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
Who was taking care of Kendal?
And on the subject of fair... was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
No.
Life wasn't fair, and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
Hi, Jan.
Oh, hi.
Wow, really been a long time.
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.
- Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?
Wow.
How are you doing?
I'm good.
- Good.
- I brought presents.
Oh, thank you.
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?
Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?
Yeah.
Are you having fun?
Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.
I think we should talk privately.
Sure, yeah.
Here, follow me.
OK.
OK, so what's going on?
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now.
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
Well, hey, she pushed it out.
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's in here... and I know what's in here.
Buddy... you're my moon, my stars.
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis!
What are you doing?
OK.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
We can work this out.
You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know.
We can beat this together.
You're better than this.
I have to go.
I think you should leave.
Hey, look who's up.
Hey, let me take her.
Let me...
Come here.
There you are.
Can you do me a favor?
We need everybody outside.
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.
Those are delicious.
Hey, listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
Come on, let's go.
Mavis?
- What?
- Are you OK?
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here.
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh, my God.
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch!
Oh, my God.
You should see your face.
It's a joke.
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
I love your sweater.
I'll get you a rag.
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here.
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
You know, the funny thing is?
I could have had this party a long time ago.
This exact same party.
Yeah.
Buddy and I were together for four years, and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.
It is silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart.
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
And we were gonna keep it!
We were gonna have a little baby, and a little naming party, and a Fun aquarium, and all of that.
And then 12 weeks into it...
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable down south in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager, and probably even more kids, because we always found each other.
Always!
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
What the fuck?
It's a new drum set for Beth.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- No... what do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What is wrong with you?
Are you like one of those little kids who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?
That's enough, Mavis.
You're drunk.
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom, and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.
We all do, Mavis.
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness, some depression.
You're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying.
He's not.
Well.
What about now?
You hate me now?
'Cause it should be easy, 'cause I fucking hate you.
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?
Mavis, honey.
You know, I came back for you.
For you!
And I hate this town!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
But I came back.
I just wanted you to know that.
I screwed up.
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?
You're scaring me.
I'm crazy.
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me... are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
I ruined my dress.
I'll get you...
I'll get you a shirt.
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
Hide me.
It's OK.
Why Buddy?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
You know, I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker, shaped like a heart... and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me, and I was at my best.
Good morning.
Hi.
Coffee?
Sure.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over.
It got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last one right now.
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade from school.
Yeah.
I know that Beth.
What do you think of her?
I...
I...
I don't really like her.
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is.
What happened to your dress?
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
Shit.
What's wrong?
What did I say?
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
It's really difficult for me to be happy... and then for other people, it just seems so simple.
I know.
They just grow up, and they're so... fulfilled.
I don't feel fulfilled.
- Well...
- And frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
I need to change, Sandra.
- No, you don't.
- What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book, or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
I mean, you think so?
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
You know, living in the big city, all famous and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special or whatever.
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
I'll sit and think about you, living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
It seems really nice.
Yeah.
But...
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you.
I needed that.
You're right.
This place blows.
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me?
Take me with you.
You know, to the Minneapolis.
You're good here, Sandra.
Oh.
Dolce.
I'm so sorry.
My baby.
Come here.
Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class, there was an unmistakable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day, it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
Good boy.
Poor Ryan...
Lost at sea.
They don't need those back.
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
Cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future.
A new chapter.
As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss... thinking, "Life, here I come."
I'm just...
I don't feel pretty right now.
Having my friends here is great, but it's like, making my self-esteem go down really bad.
And they look so good, and they're just like, like the hottest girls in the world, and here I am just like...
- ...and you're...
- Babe.
- I got to get ready.
- No, you don't.
Come here.
- That's just it.
- What?
Kendra, you are the most beautiful woman.
And don't let anybody coming around after you just had a baby, make you not feel that way, babe.
You want that?
All right, come on.
Follow me.
Kendal Strickland wasn't just the prettiest girl at Waverley Prep she was a legend.
As a junior, the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her, even though another student had recently died.
Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?
When you send something that soon, it's for the inner circle.
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the father who doesn't talk to him anymore.
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I am not worked up in the slightest.
I was just trying to tell you about something that happened.
God!
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent parent.
Can you imagine still living in Mercury?
Trapped with a wife and a kid and some crappy job?
It's like...
It's like he's a hostage.
Yup.
We're lucky we got out.
- Yes.
- We have lives.
Let me let you borrow an outfit 'cause that dress is hideous, honey.
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come with me now to the TV Guide party because who wants to go to a party by themselves?
- It's to die for.
- That is fab.
I just think that Tyler and I are like soul twins.
You know?
Right before he texts me,
- it's like I can...
- Sense it?
Yes!
Like psychically.
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
Like text chemistry.
Exactly.
Just as Kendal hit "send," a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied.
They had "textual chemistry."
So, all told, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
Why?
Long story short, I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.
Oh, my God.
Yikes.
Yeah, it was probably one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Of course.
Sure, totally.
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Dolce, take a pee.
Dolce, pee.
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Welcome to Hampton Inn.
Do you have a reservation?
No.
Mavis Gary.
- Is that a dog in your bag?
- Nope.
We actually allow small pets with a cleaning deposit.
Good, because I have a small dog, in my vehicle.
I'll put that you have a dog.
How many keys do you need?
Two, please.
Expecting company?
Hi.
YOU.
Personal.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Slade.
I can't.
There's nothing I can do for you.
I love Mason more than I love you.
Hey, Buddy, this is Mavis.
Remember?
Mavis Gary?
I'm in town for this little real estate thing, and I...
I don't know, I just thought if you have time, and you wanna grab a drink, catch up?
Something like that.
All right, well, listen, call me and... and let me know.
All right, bye.
Fuck.
- Hey, Buddy.
- Mavis Gary.
- It's been... how long?
- I'm not sure.
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.
I am insanely busy as always.
Well, I don't know how long you're around with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
OK.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,
I could meet you at Woody's in...
I don't know, 15 minutes?
Spontaneous really isn't a thing these days.
I don't know if you heard, but I am a new dad.
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.
I got that announcement.
- Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome
How about we meet tomorrow at this place called Champion O'Malley's?
- It's kind of fun.
- Of course, yes.
Yeah.
How does 8:00, 8:30 sound?
- 6:00 would be better.
- 6:00 is perfect.
Great, I'll see you at 6:00.
Maker's Mark.
What?
I'm sorry, but I think we went to high school together.
- At the same time?
- Yeah.
You're Mavis Gary?
Mavis Gary-Crane now.
I'm Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually next to yours, all through high school.
Matt...
Freehauf.
Yeah.
Yeah, your locker was right there.
Right next to mine.
We didn't run in the same circles.
You were pretty popular, if I remember correctly.
You won "Best Hair."
Did I?
What did you win?
I didn't.
They usually give out, like, 15 of those, and only to the same five people
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it was really nice seeing you...
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?
Of course not.
Gross.
No, I live in Minneapolis.
I'm just here taking care of a little real estate thing.
- I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.
Yes, I am an author.
Children's books.
Y.A
- That's industry speak for "Young Adult-"
It's a very popular teen series.
It's everywhere.
It's huge.
- You've probably seen it.
- Vampires?
Hey, take that, liver.
Weren't you that hate crime guy?
Excuse me?
You totally were.
You're the hate crime guy.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?
Now I know who you are.
Matt, the hate crime guy.
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a
When we were seniors, a bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods
That's right.
...and hit me on the legs and dick with a crowbar.
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out that I wasn't really gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime anymore.
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
Fuck.
How's your dick?
Not good.
Not good.
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.
You know, it's just kind of does a...
Hard Jacks.
Do you know who drinks these?
I don't.
Buddy Slade.
That's an interesting fact.
Come here.
Do you wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes.
I can't tell you in here.
OK, you got me out here.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together.
- And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade.
All right.
I'm pretty sure he's married with a kid on the way.
No, kid's here.
She already had it.
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.
So wait, are you not joking?
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.
They just tend to happen in slow motion
They get divorced, they reconfigure and society is, like, fine with that.-.
...if you take your time, like an emotional glacier.
I'm 37...
Mavis, I would keep all of this to yourself.
I would find a therapist.
Talk to a professional.
- Matt.
- Oh, boy.
Don't you get it?
Love conquers all.
Have you not seen The Graduate?
Or, like, I don't know, anything?
Oh, a taxi.
Yes, we called it.
Mavis, hey!
Buddy Slade has a life.
Buddy Slade has a life.
No, he has a baby, and babies are boring!
Having spent the summer outside Waverley Prep,
Kendal looked around at her fellow students, thinking,
"Did I really get that much better, or did everyone simply get worse?
Why was Ryan spending so much time with this dumpy new girl?"
Mavis, this is Jim.
Do you even have any pages?
I'm trying to help you, but I can't if you...
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'ca use we pull in the slack
Oh, yeah
Oh, no, not gonna need those.
You're gonna wanna try the popcorn shrimp.
No, I'm not.
A couple of Hard Jacks, please.
OK.
Hey.
Hey, you.
- Wow.
- Great to see you.
So...
This is quite the mid-week surprise.
Hey, I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, me neither.
But I thought, just for old times' sake
Actually, I haven't been drinking recently.
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and now that she's nursing our girl,
I thought I'd show some solidarity.
Right.
So...
- You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.
Ad sales now.
My dad's still there, so we have lunch together most days.
Yeah.
Pizza or sub sandwiches.
Awesome.
I've just been working my little butt off in the city.
You know, doing my thing.
Down there in the old Mini Apple?
God, Buddy.
Nobody calls it the Mini Apple anymore.
I didn't know.
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.
Give our waitress a break.
So chivalrous.
Mavis.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You know, bookkeeping, dealing with vendors.
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?
Just catching up with a friend.
Oh, catching up with a friend.
There's Buddy Slade, acquiring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar.
You're not wasting any time, are you?
Look, it was really great hanging out with you last night.
- It was great.
- OK.
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie.
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?
Yeah.
It's so nice running into him.
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
You wanna join us for a round?
I would love to
- I would
Sadly, I have work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied person to complete even the simplest task.
- So...
- Bummer.
I don't wanna step on your Mercury High reunion.
So...
Go, go, Injuns.
Actually, they changed the name to "Indians" back in '99, remember?
The local Fond du Lac tribe... did a whole thing with...
It sucks, what happened to Matt.
That poor guy suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.
Didn't you call him a theater fag all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.
Well, whatever.
Mercury's changed a lot since then, though.
We're way less of a hick town.
Really?
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?
And we're getting a new Chipotle at the mall.
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.
You know, one of those Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.
That's genius.
KenTacoHut.
You sound like one of your crazy characters.
Hey, so how's Allen?
Allen is great.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's good.
We're not married anymore, but...
Oh, sorry.
I didn't...
No, don't be sorry.
It's good.
It's fine.
Well, that's Allen's loss.
It sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.
She's got band practice tonight.
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.
Just something she does with the other moms.
Wow, cool.
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.
Oh, my God.
Embarrassing.
Actually, her band's playing here tomorrow night.
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow night to our house for a hang?
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.
- I would love that.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?
Sure.
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra.
She wants to be a writer someday.
Right, of course.
But you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside.
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
It's still a pretty big deal, compared to the rest of us.
It was so great seeing you.
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.
I do?
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed, you just got lucky.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.
- OK.
- Good night.
Hello?
Look, I just want you to know that what you think you saw tonight is not what it was, OK?
Oh, so you're not trying to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage
It is way more complicated than you can possibly ever understand, OK?
Buddy Slade and I have years and years of history, and it is very rich, and very complex.
Wow, yeah, that sounds way beyond my comprehension.
Don't open a new ranch till the old one's done.
- What?
- That's my sister.
Forget it.
- Just so you know.
- I got it.
Thank you.
Do you want to get loaded, or something?
I'm Mavis.
I know.
From high school.
Right.
I made you those Rice Krispies squares that one time for your birthday.
I got your locker combination from the vice principal.
I put them in your locker?
Thank you.
- So where's Matt?
- In his cave.
Welcome to the distillery.
Are you making moonshine?
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.
You know what?
Hang on.
All right.
Check this out.
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong...
That's a limited...
There's not a lot.
- "Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.
Mos Eisley...
Star Wars thing.
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's...
Let's let that age a little longer.
And I got another in here.
OK.
Now, see if you can detect some of the new oak.
- Oh, come on.
- OK.
They're kind of hidden in there.
So when you sip...
- I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.
Let's do a little...
There you go.
Woody.
Oak.
So how'd the rest of your little date go?
- Good.
It was eye-opening.
- Yeah?
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
OK, he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
I'm thinking... it will be you.
- Aren't you a little old for G.I. Joes?
- That one's still wet.
No, it's fine.
Jesus.
- You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.
That one...
I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongul's body, so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead, and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.
I was tired and drunk.
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo.
I have to go check on something.
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.
I think this is it.
You think, or you know?
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.
You're fuckin' mentally ill.
- You see that window up there?
- Yep.
I bet Buddy is awake jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
Can I help you find something?
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.
It's not a formal occasion.
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
OK.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old flame, and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.
Let's show him what he's been missing.
No, he's seen me recently.
He knows.
But his wife hasn't seen me in a while, so...
Well, it's the end of my shift, and my son has to be picked up from school.
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.
Shawna!
Where are the Waverley Prep books?
They got their own display table right there.
Wow.
They must be really popular.
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
They were big a couple years ago, but the computer says, "Do not shelve," so...
Hey, are you writing in there?
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.
You're Jane MacMurray?
No.
Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.
Mavis Gary-Crane.
See?
Do you know Jane MacMurray?
Yes, I know her really well.
- I wrote the book.
- OK.
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
No, that's fine
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
We're probably not gonna sell them.
The series is done.
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
Whatever, book man.
Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off.
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
Hers was a gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However, being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan the love of her life?
- What up?
- Hey.
How are you?
- How are you?
- Good, good.
Here's that book for your niece.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There is a character in that one that's based on you.
- What?
- In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...
Hey.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.
You, too.
There it is.
Adorable.
Thank you.
You love it.
You love it.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?
Oh, just a water.
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.
It's fine.
I'll just pump and dump after the show.
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes it does.
Oh, starting to get smiles.
Cute.
She's, like, Buddy's clone.
No.
I see you in there.
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw a nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm an author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular.
I like your decor.
Is it shabby chic?
Pier One?
A little bit Goodwill.
Buddy and I used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that?
The '90s?
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.
It was just, like, the dumbest thing ever
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.
I used to sleep in his T-shirts and boxers.
I think I still have a few.
Hey.
I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- What?
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.
What's the chart?
Beth teaches special needs kids.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
So we need to show them 'this is what happy looks like 'this is what anxious looks like and so on.
What about neutral?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
Oh, my God.
- Is that Mavis Gary?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.
Shots.
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Really?
Come on, tequila time.
Salt.
So... are they any good?
Yeah, they're all right.
I knew it.
They're horrible.
I knew it.
Well, they have a lot of fun.
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.
He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy.
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.
Think he owns any clown suits?
- Oh, my God.
You're terrible.
- Come on.
- Dark.
- No.
Hello, Mercury!
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.
We are Nipple Confusion.
Yeah.
Please be kind, as this is only our second show.
And we all have small children at home.
Our first song is a cover
This one goes out from our drummer, Beth, to her sweetheart, Buddy.
She wears denim wherever she goes
Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Still she won't be forced against her will
Says she don't do drugs but she does the pill
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
I didn't want to hurt you
Oh, yeah
Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
Says she likes the group 'ca use we pull in the slack
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
When she's at the gig she takes her car...
Remember when we used to make out to this song?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this song was playing the first time I went down on you.
The first time I went...
I screwed up the fill so bad.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.
- You guys were namazing.
- Wait.
Did you just say "namazing"?
- I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.
Hardly.
It's so interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's so inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence on stage.
Really.
Beth, we gotta get home.
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.
I wanna stay out just a little while longer.
Yeah, Buddy, you can't have her back tonight.
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.
Really?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.
You sure?
Have fun.
Thanks, Mavis.
Easy.
Tolerance has gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, since I knew you?
- I still know you.
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Don't you have that babysitter till 11:00?
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
I know, we can't, but time is just so precious.
For real.
- It goes so fast.
- I know.
Man, I really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know.
I can tell you're a great father.
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.
You do too much, even.
You think so?
Yes.
You're a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
I thought I saw lights.
Hi, Daniel.
Yep, I'm home.
Where's Beth?
She wanted to stay out and party all night.
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and she doesn't want her "nuk" anymore.
I got it.
Good night, Buddy.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Wow.
- Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
There's some low-hanging fruit.
You are low-hanging fruit.
- Oh, no.
No.
- What?
I hate this guy over here.
That's my cousin, Mike.
Mike Moran is your cousin?
Unfortunately.
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
- Mavis?
- Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, coz, this is such a rad surprise.
Yeah, I'm in town just for a little real estate thing.
- How are you?
Yeah.
- I'm great.
Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood?
Porcelain?
- Strychnine?
- Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.
You mean rock crawling, right?
No, I'm vertical, bro, believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity.
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.
- You should try it, Matt.
- No.
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.
It's like Will Grace.
- It is.
- No, it isn't.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later.
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you got there.
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
God, he got so much attention.
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.
Please.
That dick ruined my sweet 16, same weekend.
God, you are a piece of work.
You're a piece of shit.
You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a cougar.
How I'm a cougar?
I'm not even 30 years old.
You're a cougar.
I am turning 30 this year and I am freaked out.
It's pretty old.
Kim Kardashian channels her own inner cougar.
Fuck.
The kiss was electric, transformative, spiritual, enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
I said, "Listen, Kyle, you're everything to me.
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"
- And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.
I'm gonna have a...
Hey, you.
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
How much longer are you gonna be in town?
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?
I was just wondering if you're still in town this weekend, if you wanna come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's this little hippy thing we're doing out in the yard.
It's not religious or anything...
- I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.
- Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.
Hey, Mom.
Were you even gonna say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like.
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom.
OK?
I was planning on calling.
Why didn't you just come and stay with us?
Because I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea.
I have tons and tons of work to catch up on.
Books still selling well?
It's like I can hardly keep up.
Is that the money you used to invest in local real estate?
I heard you were here to work on some kind of real estate transaction.
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
Honey?
- Look what I found.
- What?
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Who's this?
- This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.
- Dolce.
- Hello.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
You gotta start taking care of yourself, sweetie.
You know, a Lean Cuisine is not a meal.
Yeah, I think I might be an alcoholic.
very funny.
- You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
You know what, Mom?
Can you please take down that photo of me and Allen?
Which picture, sweetie?
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
- Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
Actually... .-.I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy
Oh, the old beau, huh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way, but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
The people who really know you best.
And that new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it?
Up close?
I suppose.
Is everything OK?
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.
It's just that Buddy used to say that we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
Yeah!
Sweet ride.
What is that, a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Oh, heavy.
How are they?
Horrible.
God, I've been through a lot.
- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?
Come on.
Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
- And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...
- Come on!
- Fine.
Could you walk any slower?
Our school is so ugly.
It looks like a factory.
It actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were such a slut.
I was normal.
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
How's the master plan unfolding?
Well, actually, he called me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
I don't know.
There's still so much that's unspoken, but he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man.
By all accounts, happily.
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.
He gave me his sweatshirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
You're one to talk.
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know you use this whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
Scuffle
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
OK?
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch they shattered my legs, bashed in my brains, mangled my cock, so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
Then they left me for dead.
You know, things aren't too great down south.
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
You know, what's done is done.
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past.
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser, trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It really is a shame that you're like this, because if you had a good personality, none of this other stuff would bother people.
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories, because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan still loved her, crystal clear.
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend, but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
Who was taking care of Kendal?
And on the subject of fair...
Was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
No.
Life wasn't fair, and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
Hi, Jan.
Oh, hi.
Wow, really been a long time.
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.
- Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?
Wow.
How are you doing?
I'm good.
- Good.
- I brought presents.
Oh, thank you.
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?
Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?
Yeah.
Are you having fun?
Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.
I think we should talk privately.
Sure, yeah.
Here, follow me.
OK.
OK, so what's going on?
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now.
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
Well, hey, she pushed it out.
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's in here and I know what's in here.
Buddy... you're my moon, my stars.
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis!
What are you doing?
OK.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
We can work this out.
You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know.
We can beat this together.
You're better than this.
I have to go.
I think you should leave.
Hey, look who's up.
Hey, let me take her.
Let me...
Come here.
There you are.
Can you do me a favor?
We need everybody outside.
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.
Those are delicious.
Hey, listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
Come on, let's go.
Mavis?
- What?
- Are you OK?
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh, my God.
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch.
Oh, my God.
You should see your face.
It's a joke.
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
I love your sweater.
I'll get you a rag.
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
You know, the funny thing is,
I could have had this party a long time ago.
This exact same party.
Yeah.
Buddy and I were together for four years, and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.
It is silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart.
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
And we were gonna keep it!
We were gonna have a little baby, and a little naming party, and a Funquarium, and all of that.
And then 12 weeks into it...
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable down south in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager, and probably even more kids, because we always found each other.
Always!
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
What the fuck?
It's a new drum set for Beth.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What is wrong with you?
Are you like one of those little kids who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?
That's enough, Mavis.
You're drunk.
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom, and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.
We all do, Mavis.
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness, some depression.
You're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying.
He's not.
Well.
What about now?
You hate me now?
Cause it should be easy cause I fucking hate you
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?
Mavis, honey.
You know, I came back for you.
For you!
And I hate this town!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
But I came back.
I just wanted you to know that.
I screwed up.
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?
You're scaring me.
I'm crazy.
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
I ruined my dress.
I'll get you...
I'll get you a shirt.
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
Hide me.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Why Buddy?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
You know, I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker, shaped like a heart and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me,
and I was at my best.
Good morning.
Hi.
Coffee?
Sure.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over.
It got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last one right now.
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade from school.
Yeah.
I know that Beth.
What do you think of her?
I...
I...
I don't really like her.
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is
What happened to your dress?
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
Shit.
What's wrong?
What did I say?
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
It's really difficult for me to be happy and then for other people, it just seems so simple
I know.
They just grow up, and they're so.-. fulfilled
I don't feel fulfilled
- Well...
- And frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
I need to change, Sandra.
- No, you don't.
- What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book, or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
I mean, you think so?
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
You know, living in the big city, all famous and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special or whatever.
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
I'll sit and think about you, living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
It seems really nice.
Yeah.
But...
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you.
I needed that.
You're right.
This place blows.
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me?
Take me with you.
You know, to the Mini Apple.
You're good here, Sandra.
Oh.
Dolce.
I'm so sorry.
My baby.
Come here.
Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class, there was an unmistakable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day, it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
Good boy.
Poor Ryan...
Lost at sea.
They don't need those back.
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
Cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future.
A new chapter.
As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss thinking, "Life, here I come. "
I'm just...
I don't feel pretty right now.
Having my friends here is great, but it's like making my self-esteem go down really bad.
And they look so good, and they're just like, like the hottest girls in the world, and here I am just like...
- ...and you're...
- Babe.
- I got to get ready.
- No, you don't.
Come here.
- That's just it.
- What?
Kendra, you are the most beautiful woman.
And don't let anybody coming around after you just had a baby, make you not feel that way, babe.
Ow!
You want that?
All right, come on.
Follow me.
Kendal Strickland wasn't just the prettiest girl at Waverley Prep, she was a legend.
As a junior, the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her, even though another student had recently died.
Hey, Mavis, it's Jim again.
Just callin' to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough.
Last one, sweetheart.
I know you can do it.
Hopefully by Friday?
When you send something that soon, it's for the inner circle.
It's not for the ex-girlfriend of the father who doesn't talk to him any more.
Frankly, that's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I am not worked up in the slightest.
I was just trying to tell you about something that happened.
God!
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent parent.
Can you imagine still living in Mercury'?
Trapped with a wife and a kid and some crappy job?
It's like...
It's like he's a hostage.
Yup.
We're lucky we got out.
- Yes.
- We have lives.
Let me let you borrow an outfit 'cause that dress is hideous, honey.
I'm excited that Kourtney is gonna come with me now to the TV Guide party because who wants to go to a party by themselves?
- It's to die for.
- That is fab.
I just think that Tyler and I are like soul twins.
You know?
Right before he texts me,
- it's like I can...
- Sense it?
Yes!
Like psychically.
It's like we have chemistry, even over our phones.
Like text chemistry.
- 'Exactly.
Just as Kendal hit "send," a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied.
They had "textual chemistry."
So, all told, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
- Why?
- Uh...
Long story short, I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Penh.
Oh, my God.
Yikes.
Yeah, it was probably one of the most rewarding things I've ever done.
Of course.
Sure, totally.

Welcome to Hampton Inn.
Do you have a reservation?
No.
Mavis Gary.
- Is that a dog in your bag?
- Nope.
We actually allow small pets with a cleaning deposit.
Good, because I have a small dog, in my vehicle.
I'll put that you have a dog.
How many keys do you need?
Two, please.
Expecting company?
Oh!
Hi.
YOU.
Personal.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Slade.
I can't.
There's nothing I can do for you.
I love Mason more than I love you.
Hey, Buddy, this is Mavis.
Remember?
Mavis Gary'?
I'm in town for this little real estate thing, and I, um...
I don't know, I just thought if you have time, and you wanna grab a drink, catch up?
Something like that.
Um...
All right, well, listen, call me and, um...
and let me know.
All right, bye.
Fuck.
- Hey, Buddy.
- Mavis Gary.
- It's been, uh... how long?
- I'm not sure.
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town, huh?
Yeah, well, I'm just passing through.
I am insanely busy as always.
Well, I don't know how long you're around with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
OK.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous,
I could meet you at, uh, Woody's in I don't know, 15 minutes?
Spontaneous really isn't a thing these days.
I don't know if you heard, but I am a new dad.
Duh!
Everyone knows.
Yeah, the whole gang.
I got that, uh, announcement.
- Thanks for that, by the way.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
How about we meet tomorrow at this place called Champion O'Malley's?
- It's kind of fun.
- Of course, yes.
Yeah.
How, um...
how does 8:00, 8:30 sound?
- 6:00 would be better.
- 6:00 is perfect.
Great, I'll see you at 6:00.
"Achin' To Be"
Maker's Mark.
What?
I'm sorry, but I think we went to high school together.
- At the same time?
- Yeah.
You're Mavis Gary'?
Mavis Gary-Crane now.
I'm Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually next to yours, all through high school.
Matt...
Freehauf.
Yeah.
Yeah, your locker was right there.
Right next to mine.
We didn't run in the same circles.
You were pretty popular, if I remember correctly.
You won "Best Hair."
Did I?
What did you win?
I didn't.
Uh, they usually give out, like, 15 of those, and only to the same five people.
Yeah, well, listen, Matt, it was really nice seeing you...
What are you doing back in Mercury?
You move back?
Of course not.
Gross.
- No, I live in Minneapolis.
- Oh.
I'm just here taking care of a little real estate thing.
- I own some property...
- I read in the Sun you're a writer.
Yes, I am an author.
Children's books.
Y.A. That's industry speak for "Young Adult."
It's a very popular teen series.
It's everywhere.
It's huge.
- You've probably seen it.
- Uh, vampires?
"It's A Shame About Ray"
Hey, take that, liver.
Weren't you that hate crime guy'?
Excuse me?
You totally were.
You're the hate crime guy.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just say that?
Now I know who you are.
Matt, the hate crime guy.
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a...
When we were seniors, a bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods...
That's right.
...and hit me on the legs and dick with a crowbar.
With a crowbar.
I totally remember that.
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out that I wasn't really gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime any more.
It was a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes, I got to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
Fuck.
How's your dick?
Not good.
Not good.
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it works.
You know, it's just kind of does a...
Hard Jacks.
Do you know who drinks these?
I don't.
Buddy Slade.
That's an interesting fact.
Come here.
Do you wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes.
I can't tell you in here.
OK, you got me out here.
All right.
Here's the deal.
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together.
- And I'm here to get him back.
- Buddy Slade.
All right.
I'm pretty sure he's married with a kid on the way.
No, kid's here.
She already had it.
I'm cool with it.
I mean, I've got baggage too.
So wait, are you not joking?
Oh, God, Matt, I get it.
People won't understand.
But you know, these things happen.
In real life, they actually happen.
They just tend to happen in slow motion.
They get divorced, they reconfigure, and society is, like, fine with that if you take your time, like an emotional glacier.
I'm 37...
Mavis, I would keep all of this to yourself.
I would find a therapist.
Talk to a professional.
- Matt.
- Oh, boy.
Don't you get it?
Love conquers all.
Have you not seen The Graduate?
Or, like, I don't know, anything?
Oh, a taxi.
Yes, we called it.
Ma...
Mavis, hey!
Buddy Slade has a life.
Buddy Slade has a life.
No, he has a baby, and babies are boring!
Having spent the summer outside Waverley Prep,
Kendal looked around at her fellow students, thinking,
"Did I really get that much better, or did everyone simply get worse?
Why was Ryan spending so much time with this dumpy new girl?"
Mavis, this is Jim.
Do you even have any pages?
I'm trying to help you, but I can't if you...
♪ Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
♪ Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
♪ Oh, yeah
Oh, no, not gonna need those.
Oh.
You're gonna wanna try the popcorn shrimp.
No, I'm not.
A couple of Hard Jacks, please.
OK.
Hey.
Hey, you.
- Wow.
- Great to see you.
Mm...
So...
This is, uh, quite the mid-week surprise.
Hey, I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, me neither.
But I thought, you know, just for old times' sake.
Actually, I haven't been drinking recently.
Because during Beth's pregnancy, and now that she's nursing our girl,
I thought I'd show some solidarity.
Right.
So...
- You still at General Mills?
- Yeah.
Ad sales now.
My dad's still there, so we have lunch together most days.
Yeah.
Pizza or sub sandwiches.
Awesome.
I've just been working my little butt off in the city.
You know, doing my thing.
Down there in the old Mini Apple?
God, Buddy.
Nobody calls it the Mini Apple any more.
I didn't know.
I'll go grab those Hard Jacks.
Give our waitress a break.
So chivalrous.
Mavis.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
You know, bookkeeping, dealing with vendors.
Here's the better question.
What are you doing here?
Just catching up with a friend.
Oh, catching up with a friend.
There's Buddy Slade, acquiring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar.
You're not wasting any time, are you?
Look, it was really great hanging out with you last night.
- It was great.
- OK.
- Yep.
- Hey, Freehauf.
- What's up, man?
- Hey, hey.
- Congrats on the little one.
- Oh, thanks.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
A ton of work though.
Almost no sleep, right?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie.
But hey, it's so rewarding, right?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
It's so nice running into him.
Thanks for stopping by, Matt.
Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.
You wanna join us for a round?
I would love to.
I would.
Sadly, I have work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied person to complete even the simplest task.
- So...
- Bummer.
I don't wanna step on your Mercury High reunion.
So...
Go, go, lnjuns.
Actually, uh, they changed the name to "indians" back in '99, remember?
The local Fond du Lac tribe did a whole thing with...
It sucks, what happened to Matt.
That poor guy suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.
- No.
Didn't you call him a theater fag all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression, Buddy.
Well, whatever.
Mercury's changed a lot since then, though.
We're way less of a hick town.
- Really?
- Mm.
Yeah, we've got this place.
It beats Woody's, right?
And we're getting a new Chipotle at the mall.
And I noticed you got a KenTacoHut.
You know, one of those Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell...
- Pizza Hut.
- Yeah.
That's genius.
KenTacoHut.
You sound like one of your crazy characters.
Hey, so how's Allen?
- Allen is great.
Yeah.
- Mmmm.
Yeah, he's good.
We're not married any more, but...
Oh, sorry.
I didn't...
No, don't be sorry.
It's good.
It's fine.
Well, that's Allen's loss.
It sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't stay any longer.
I gotta go relieve Beth.
She's got band practice tonight.
- Beth's in a band?
- Yeah.
Just something she does with the other moms.
Wow, cool.
Yeah, Beth's the drummer.
Oh, my God.
Embarrassing.
Ah...
Actually, her band's playing here tomorrow night.
Hey, why don't you come over tomorrow night to our house for a hang?
We can have dinner, and then come here and see Beth's show.
- I would love that.
- Yeah.
Oh, this is kind of silly, but would you mind signing one of those Waverley Place books for me?
Sure.
I mean, it's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra.
She wants to be a writer someday.
Right, of course.
Um, but you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside.
But I'm basically a ghostwriter.
It's still a pretty big deal, compared to the rest of us.
It was so great seeing you.
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.
I do?
Yeah, it's like the rest of us changed, you just got lucky.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.
- OK.
- Good night.
Hello?
Look, I just want you to know that what you think you saw tonight is not what it was, OK?
Oh, so you're not trying to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage.
It is way more complicated than you can possibly ever understand, OK?
Buddy Slade and I have years and years of history, and it is very rich, and very complex.
Wow, yeah, that sounds way beyond my comprehension.
Don't open a new ranch till the old one's done.
- What?
- That's my sister.
Forget it.
- Just so you know.
- I got it.
Thank you.
Do you want to get loaded, or something?
I'm Mavis.
I know.
From high school.
Right.
I made you those Rice Krispies squares that one time for your birthday.
I got your locker combination from the vice principal.
I put them in your locker?
Thank you.
- So where's Matt?
- In his cave.
"Pledge Your Allegiance"
Welcome to the distillery.
Are you making moonshine?
Screw you, hillbilly.
This is aged bourbon.
You know what?
Hang on.
All right.
Check this out.
This is an eight-year, all right?
Now take a sniff.
Not too deep, though.
It's got a really strong...
That's a limited...
There's not a lot.
- "Mos Easily Special Reserve."
- Eisley.
Mos Eisley...
Star Wars thing.
You know, the Cantina?
You know, let's...
Let's let that age a little longer.
And I got another in here.
OK.
Now, see if you can detect some of the new oak.
- Oh, come on.
- OK.
They're kind of hidden in there.
So when you sip...
- I was supposed to sip it?
- Yeah.
Let's do a little...
There you go.
Mm.
Woody.
Oak.
So how'd the rest of your little date go?
- Good.
It was eye-opening.
- Yeah?
I mean, Buddy's clearly not happy.
OK, he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell, he's totally suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
You know he told me he feels like a zombie.
I was there, all right?
I suspect he was being flip.
That's a pretty strong statement to make.
I mean, a zombie is a dead person, not...
Mavis, I'm a fat geek, all right?
I know what a zombie is.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
The question is, who's gonna make the first move?
I'm thinking... it will be you.
Hm...
- Aren't you a little old for G.l. Joes?
- That one's still wet.
No, it's fine.
Jesus.
- You make these?
- I combine them, mix and match.
That one...
I took Copperhead's face, and I put it on Mongul's body, so it's like a beefed-up Copperhead, and then I added Doctor Mid-Nite's owl.
I was tired and drunk.
You ever make, like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo.
I have to go check on something.
Oh, OK.
No, no, no.
You need to come with me.
I think this is it.
You think, or you know?
This is definitely it.
He drives a Jeep Liberty.
That's ironic...
because he has no liberty.
You're fuckin' mentally ill.
- You see that window up there?
- Yep.
I bet Buddy is awake jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
Can I help you find something?
Sure, I'm not having a ton of luck here.
- Is this something for work?
- No, it's a special occasion.
It's not a formal occasion.
I'm looking for something chic, clean, but also a bit edgy.
OK.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
- Yeah, do you have Marc Jacobs?
- No, I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old ﬂame, and I think there is a chance we may reconnect.
Let's show him what he's been missing.
No, he's seen me recently.
He knows.
But his wife hasn't seen me in a while, so...
Well, it's the end of my shift, and my son has to be picked up from school.
So I'm just gonna send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.
Shawna!
Where are the Waverley Prep books?
They got their own display table right there.
Wow.
They must be really popular.
Actually, we just got a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
They were big a couple years ago, but the computer says, "Do not shelve," so...
Hey, are you writing in there?
I'm the author.
I'm just signing it.
You're Jane MacMurray'?
No.
Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.
Mavis Gary-Crane.
See?
Do you know Jane MacMurray?
Yes, I know her really well.
- I wrote the book.
- OK.
Do you want a signed copy for your store?
No, that's fine.
I can sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but once merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you be sending it back to the publisher?
We're probably not gonna sell them.
The series is done.
Come on, I told you you can't write in the...
Whatever, book man.
Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way.
She wasn't the type to show off.
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was nominated homecoming queen of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive.
That was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures, not Kendal.
Hers was a gracious, effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However, being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan the love of her life?
- What up?
- Hey.
How are you?
- Ooh.
How are you?
- Good, good.
Here's that book for your niece.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There is a character in that one that's based on you.
- What?
- In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
- When you read it, it'll be obvious.
- Hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible...
Hey.
- Nice to see you again.
- Hey, babe.
You, too.
Oh...
There it is.
Adorable.
Thank you.
Aw...
You love it.
You love it.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
You want a drink?
Oh, just a water.
- Can you get me another summer ale?
- Sure.
It's fine.
I'll just pump and dump after the show.
Don't worry.
I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah, yes.
The Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, yes it does.
Oh, starting to get smiles.
Cute.
She's, like, Buddy's clone.
No.
I see you in there.
- Really?
- A lot of you, in fact.
- Thanks.
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.
- Here you go.
So how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw a nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm an author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular.
I like your decor.
Is it shabby chic?
Pier One?
A little bit Goodwill.
Buddy and I used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that?
The '90s?
Oh, my God, Beth.
We had this huge silly T-shirt collection.
It was just, like, the dumbest thing ever.
- The '90s were awesome.
- Yeah.
I used to sleep in his T-shirts and boxers.
I think I still have a few.
Hey.
I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
- I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
- What?
- Which one?
- Like I'd tell you.
What's the chart?
Uh...
Oh.
- Beth teaches special needs kids.
- Oh.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you and me.
So we need to show them "this is what happy looks like,"
"this is what anxious looks like," and so on.
What about neutral?
I mean, like, what if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time.
So, yeah, don't need to teach it.
Oh, my God.
- Is that Mavis Gary'?
- Yeah.
Can you believe it?
She came here with Beth and Buddy.
Shots.
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Really'?
Come on, tequila time.
Salt.
So... are they any good?
Yeah, they're all right.
Mm-hm.
I knew it.
They're horrible.
I knew it.
- Well, they have a lot of fun.
- Hm...
Hey, look.
Freehauf's over there.
He's just always lurking, isn't he?
So creepy.
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He's like a murderer.
Think he owns any clown suits?
- Oh, my God.
You're terrible.
- Come on.
- Dark.
- No.
Hello, Mercury!
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski.
We are Nipple Confusion.
Yeah.
Please be kind, as this is, um, only our second show.
And we all have small children at home.
Our first song is a cover.
This one goes out from our drummer, Beth, to her sweetheart, Buddy.
♪ She wears denim wherever she goes
♪ Says she's gonna get some records by the Status Quo
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Still she won't be forced against her will
♪ Says she don't do drugs but she does the pill
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ I didn't want to hurt you
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ I didn't want to hurt you
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Says she likes my hair 'cause it's down my back
♪ Says she likes the group 'cause we pull in the slack
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ Oh, yeah
♪ When she's at the gig she takes her car...
Remember when we used to make out to this song?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think this song was playing the first time I went down on you.
- Huh?
- The first time I went...
Uh-huh.
Oh!
Wow.
I screwed up the fill so bad.
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry, guys.
- You did suck a little bit.
- Which one?
- That's OK, we still love you.
- Guess.
- You guys were namazing.
- Wait.
Did you just say "namazing"?
- I think someone's had a few too many.
- That's not fair.
Hardly.
It's so interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's so inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence on stage.
Really.
Beth, we gotta get home.
- We gotta relieve the babysitter.
- No.
I wanna stay out just a little while longer.
Yeah, Buddy, you can't have her back tonight.
- Sorry.
- I'll drive him home.
Really'?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay out and celebrate.
- You sure?
- Mmmm.
Have fun.
Thanks, Mavis.
Whoa!
Easy.
Tolerance has gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, since I knew you?
- I still know you.
Come here.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
- What?
Don't you have that babysitter till 11:00?
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
I know, we can't, but time is just so precious.
For real.
- It goes so fast.
- I know.
Man, I really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know.
I can tell you're a great father.
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You stepped up to the plate, Buddy.
You do too much, even.
You think so?
Yes.
You're a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
I thought I saw lights.
Hi, Daniel.
Yep, I'm home.
Where's Beth?
She wanted to stay out and party all night.
Well, we're all out of breast milk, and she doesn't want her "nuk" any more.
I got it.
Good night, Buddy.
Good night.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Wow.
- Take it easy there, killer.
- I have depression.
OK, well, then, get some exercise.
Take that poor dog of yours on a walk.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
There's some low-hanging fruit.
You are low-hanging fruit.
- Oh, no.
No.
- What?
I hate this guy over here.
That's my cousin, Mike.
Mike Moran is your cousin?
Unfortunately.
Oh, here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
- Mavis?
- Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, coz, this is such a rad surprise.
Yeah, I'm in town just for a little real estate thing.
- How are you?
Yeah.
- I'm great.
Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary.
Whoa, six years.
What is that, wood?
Porcelain?
- Strychnine?
- Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard too.
I've been doing a lot of rock climbing.
You mean rock crawling, right?
No, I'm vertical, bro, believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity.
You know what I'm saying?
You should try it, Matt.
- You should try it, Matt.
- No.
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "No."
I'm so glad you guys are buds.
I can totally see it.
It's like Will Grace.
- Aw, it is.
- No, it isn't.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later.
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you got there.
Love this place.
Total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
God, he got so much attention.
Yeah, he was the popular cripple.
Practically ruined high school for me.
Please.
That dick ruined my sweet 16, same weekend.
God, you are a piece of work.
You're a piece of shit.
You know there's stuff all over the Internet about how you're a cougar.
How I'm a cougar?
- I'm not even 30 years old.
- You're a cougar.
I am turning 30 this year and I am freaked out.
It's pretty old.
Kim Kardashian channels her own inner cougar.
Fuck.
The kiss was electric, transformative, spiritual, enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
I said, "Listen, Kyle, you're everything to me."
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy.
When are you going to get this?"
- And he's just not getting it, right?
- Right.
I'm gonna have a...
Hey, you.
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
Um, how much longer are you gonna be in town?
I'm here for you.
How long do you need?
I was just wondering if you're still in town this weekend, if you wanna come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's this little hippy thing we're doing out in the yard.
It's not religious or anything...
- I would love to come.
- Cool, all right.
Um...
Saturday at the house, around 1:00.
- Great, I can't wait to see you.
- Great.
Hey, Mom.
Were you even gonna say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like.
I wasn't avoiding you, Mom.
OK?
I was planning on calling.
Why didn't you just come and stay with us?
Because I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea.
I have tons and tons of work to catch up on.
Books still selling well?
It's like I can hardly keep up.
Is that the money you used to invest in local real estate?
Huh?
I heard you were here to work on some kind of real estate transaction.
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
- Honey?
- Huh?
- Look what I found.
- What?
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
Our little real estate tycoon, huh?
Oh, I don't know about that.
Who's this?
- This is Dolchie.
- Oh, OK.
- Dolce.
- Hello.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
You gotta start taking care of yourself, sweetie.
You know, a Lean Cuisine is not a meal.
Yeah, I think I might be an alcoholic.
Very funny.
- You're not still pulling it, are you?
- Stop, Dad.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
You know what, Mom?
Can you please take down that photo of me and Allen?
Which picture, sweetie?
The wedding photo.
We are divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
Well, the wedding wasn't a failure.
- Remember the tiramisu?
- I liked that Allen.
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy, that's all.
I didn't know there were teams.
Have you seen any old friends on this visit?
Actually I've been seeing quite a bit of Buddy.
Oh, the old beau, huh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can be so right, you know?
I mean, you make all these mistakes along the way, but the world will make sure you end up with the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
The people who really know you best.
Mmmm.
And that new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it?
Up close?
I suppose.
Is everything OK?
I'm sure it will be fine.
It's probably too soon to tell.
It's just that Buddy used to say that we would make the cutest little babies, ever.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
Yeah!
Sweet ride.
What is that, a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Oh, heavy.
How are they?
Horrible.
God, I've been through a lot.
- Wanna get hammered?
- Why do you think I'm here?
Come on.
Let's hit the woods in the back of the school.
- And grab some of that Star Wars juice.
- That's a limited...
- Come on!
- Fine.
Could you walk any slower?
Our school is so ugly.
It looks like a factory.
It actually used to be a rubber fabrication plant back in the '20s.
You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being back here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were such a slut.
I was normal.
Uh...
So how are things with old Buddy, huh?
How's the master plan unfolding?
Well, actually, he called me today and asked me if I wanted to participate in his baby's naming ceremony.
I don't know.
There's still so much that's unspoken, but he's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man.
By all accounts, happily.
Yeah, happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately, and they make out with them on porches.
- He did not make out with you.
- You weren't there.
We made out.
It was intense and passionate.
He gave me his sweatshirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, but you need to move on.
You're one to talk.
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch, and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know you use this whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing with your life.
"Scuffle."
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
OK?
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch they shattered my legs, bashed in my brains, mangled my cock, so that I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life.
Then they left me for dead.
You know, things aren't too great down south.
I can barely get off by myself, let alone with another person.
You know, what's done is done.
You can't keep dwelling on the past, Matt.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past.
Here you are back in Mercury, like a loser, trying to score with a happily married man.
Buddy's not happy, OK?
So just stop saying that.
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It really is a shame that you're like this, because if you had a good personality, none of this other stuff would bother people.
Why don't you use my crutch again as a metaphor?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
Or no, save it for your little teenage stories, because God knows you don't know shit about being an adult!
It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
Sure, but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan still loved her, crystal clear.
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend, but Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
Who was taking care of Kendal?
And on the subject of fair...
Was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair everyone thought her life was so easy, when it was anything but?
No.
Life wasn't fair, and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
"Pressure Drop"
Hi, Jan.
Oh, hi.
Wow, really been a long time.
I know.
I've been a really busy girl.
Yeah, I've heard that.
Buddy's been very busy, and Bethie.
- Finally a grandmother.
- Oh, speak of the devil.
- Hi!
- Hey, how are you?
Wow.
How are you doing?
Mm.
I'm good.
- Good.
- I brought presents.
Oh, thank you.
- Burp cloths.
- Can't have enough pukers.
- Oh, hey, Mom?
- Yes?
Can you help Beth with that endive thing?
- Yeah, Grandma to the rescue.
- Can we talk?
Uh, yeah.
Ooh!
Are you having fun?
Are you having fun?
Get out of here, Carter-bug.
I think we should talk privately.
Sure, yeah.
Um...
Here, follow me.
OK.
OK, so what's going on?
There are so many things I know we both wanna say.
OK, well, we don't have to say them all now.
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.
You're so thoughtful, even during all this.
Well, hey, she pushed it out.
I just want you to know that I'm feeling everything that you're feeling.
Buddy, these last few days have been some of the best in my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend.
I know what's in here and I know what's in here.
Buddy...
you're my moon, my stars.
You're my whole galaxy.
Mavis!
What are you doing?
OK.
You don't have to be afraid.
It's OK.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
We can work this out.
You know we can.
We can handle this like adults.
- Mavis, I'm a married man.
- I know.
We can beat this together.
You're better than this.
I have to go.
I think you should leave.
Hey, look who's up.
Hey, let me take her.
Let me...
Come here.
There you are.
There you are.
Oh...
Can you do me a favor?
We need everybody outside.
- I wanna get Beth's gift ready.
- Yeah.
Those are delicious.
Hey, listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you could all just come outside and gather around the garage.
Come on, let's go.
Mavis?
- What?
- Are you OK?
I'll be fine if I can get a real drink around here.
Uh...
There's some right here.
Thanks, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh, my God.
Uh...
I'll...
- I'll get some...
- Fuck you.
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch.
Oh, my God.
You should see your face.
It's a joke.
Are you just gonna stand there like a big lump?
I love your sweater.
I'll get you a rag.
Go get me a rag, 'cause you got so many of those lying around here.
Fuckin' burp cloths, whatever.
You know, the funny thing is,
I could have had this party a long time ago.
This exact same party.
Yeah.
Buddy and I were together for four years, and we were inseparable.
Jan knows.
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
- You want to clean up?
- No, don't bother.
It is silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart.
Mother, I'm trying to tell a story here.
Yeah, Buddy got me pregnant at 20.
And we were gonna keep it!
Mm-hm.
We were gonna have a little baby, and a little naming party, and a Funquarium, and all of that.
And then 12 weeks into it...
Well, I had Buddy's miscarriage.
Which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
Maybe if things were just a little bit more hospitable down south in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now with a teenager, and probably even more kids, because we always found each other.
Always!
Right, Jan?
Tell them!
What the fuck?
It's a new drum set for Beth.
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What is wrong with you?
Are you like one of those little kids who need a fucking chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself!
Why are you covering for me?
That's enough, Mavis.
You're drunk.
Oh, I've been drunk since I've been back, Mom, and nobody gave two shits until this one got all bent out of shape.
- Mavis, what the hell is going on?
- Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you.
We all do, Mavis.
It's obvious you're having some mental sickness, some depression.
You're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you here, even though I knew it was a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying.
He's not.
Well.
What about now?
You hate me now?
Hm?
'Cause it should be easy, 'cause I fucking hate you.
Look at you.
What is wrong with you people?
Mavis, honey.
You know, I came back for you.
For you!
And I hate this town!
It's a hick, lake town that smells of fish shit!
But I came back.
I just wanted you to know that.
I screwed up.
- I screwed up so bad.
- Where have you been?
You're scaring me.
I'm crazy.
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
I ruined my dress.
Um...
I'll get you...
I'll get you a shirt.
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
Hide me.
It's OK.
It's OK.
Why Buddy'?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
You know, I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker, shaped like a heart and you looked in that mirror more than you ever looked at me,
and I was at my best.
Good morning.
Hi.
Coffee?
Sure.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over.
It got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last one right now.
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know this girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade from school.
Um, yeah.
I know that Beth.
What do you think of her?
Um...
I...
I...
I don't really like her.
I mean, I think that you're way prettier than she is.
What happened to your dress?
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?
Shit.
What's wrong?
What did I say'?
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
It's really difficult for me to be happy and then for other people, it just seems so simple.
I know.
They just grow up, and they're so...
fulfilled.
I don't feel fulfilled.
- Well...
- And frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff that you have...
I need to change, Sandra.
- No, you don't.
- What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book, or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of other people who could...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
I mean, you think so?
Everyone wishes that they could be like you.
You know, living in the big city, all famous and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special or whatever.
I mean, some days, when I have a slow shift at work,
I'll sit and think about you, living in your cool apartment, going out and stuff.
It seems really nice.
Yeah.
But...
Most people here seem so happy with so little.
It's like they don't even seem to care what happens to them.
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you.
I needed that.
You're right.
This place blows.
I need to get back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me?
Take me with you.
You know, to the Mini Apple.
You're good here, Sandra.
Oh.
Dolce.
I'm so sorry.
My baby.
Come here.
Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class, there was an unmistakable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day, it would be the last time anyone ever saw them?
Good boy.
Poor Ryan...
Lost at sea.
They don't need those back.
You can put them in a scrapbook, or whatever.
Just so you know, those doughnuts are for Honors Members only.
Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverley from time to time.
Cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future.
A new chapter.
As she boarded the train for Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss thinking, "Life, here I come."
Young Adult subtitle by Amir_T6262
Do you want that?
Allright.
C'mon Follow me.
Kendal Strickland wasn't just the prettiest girl at Waverly Prep.
She was a legend.
As a junior, the student council voted to dedicate the yearbook to her, even though another student had recently died.
look who's arrived
Hey Mavis, it's me again.
Just calling to bug you.
We need that draft of Waverley 178.
We can work with something rough...
Last one, honey.
I know you can do it...hopefully by Friday when you send something that soon, isn't it just for the inner circle?
Not for the ex-girlfriend of the father, who doesn't even talk to him anymore.
Frankly, it's a slap in the face.
Right?
You seem a little overly worked up about this.
I'm not worked up in the slightest.
I just wanted to tell you about something that happened.
God.
Well, good for them, right?
Buddy seems like he'd be a decent father.
But can you imagine still living in Mercury?
Trapped with a wife and a kid and some crappy job?
It's like he's...
It's like he's a hostage.
Yup.
We're lucky we got out.
Yes
We have lives.
I just think me and Tyler are like, soul twins.
You know?
- Like, right before he texts me, it's like I can...
- Sense it.
Yes!
Like psychically.
And it's like we have chemistry even over our phones.
- Chemistry messages.
- Like, textual chemistry.
Exactly.
Just as Kendal hit send, a message from Ryan popped up like magic.
It couldn't be denied ... they had textual chemistry.
So, I spent a year in Southeast Asia.
Why?
I ended up a volunteer teacher in Phnom Pehn.
Oh my God.
Yikes.
Mm, yeah, it was probably the most rewarding thing I've ever done...
Of course.
Sure.
Totally.
Mad Love, Buddy.

Dolce, take a pee.
Dolce, pee.
Welcome to Hampton Inn.
Do you have a reservation?
No.
Mavis ...
Gary ...
Is that a dog in your bag?
-Nope.
We actually allow small pets with a cleaning deposit.
Well, because I have a small dog, in my car.
Okay.
I'll put that you have a dog.
- How many keys do you need?
- Two, please.
Expecting company?
Hi!
Personal.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Mercury, Minnesota.
Slade.
Hi Buddy.
This is Mavis. remember Mavis Gary.
I'm in town taking care of a real estate thing.
I don't know, I've just thought if you have time and you want to grab a drink catch up.
some like that allright listen call me and ... and let me know Okay, bye.
-Hey, Buddy!
- Mavis Gary.
It's been... how long?
I'm not sure!
Gosh.
Wow.
So you're actually back in town.
Wow.
Oh, I'm just passing through.
I'm insanely busy.
As always.
Well, I don't know how long you're in town with your real estate thing, but I'd love to grab a drink.
Okay.
Well, if you're feeling spontaneous, I can be at Woody's in,
I don't know, 15 minutes?
Spontaneous isn't really a thing these days.
I don't know if you heard, but I'm a new dad.
No duh!
Everyone knows, the whole gang.
Yeah.
I got the announcement.
Thanks for that, by the way.
Hey, you're welcome.
So, uh, how about we meet at Champion O'Malley's tomorrow?
Kind of fun.
Of course.
Yes.
-How about 8:30?
-6 would be better.
At six is perfect.
Great.
See you at six.
Maker's Mark.
What?
I'm sorry.
I believe we attended high school together.
At the same time?
Yes.
You're Mavis Gary
- Mavis Gary-Crane now.
- Matt Freehauf.
My locker was actually right next to yours.
For all of high school.
Matt Freehauf. yeah
Your locker was right there, by mine.
It's not like we ran in the same circles.
You were pretty popular, if I recall.
You won "Best Hair."
Really?
What did you win?
I didn't.
They only give out like 15 of those, and generally to the same five people.
Yes ...
Well, I was glad to see you, Matt.
What are you even doing back in Mercury?
You move back
Of course not!
Gross.
I live in Minneapolis.
I'm just here taking care of this real estate thing.
I have some property, so.
I read the "Sun" that you writer
Yes, I'm an author.
-Children's books, right?
No.
Y.A. That's industry speak for "young adult."
I write a very successful teen series.
You've probably seen it everywhere.
Vampires?
Take that, liver
Weren't you the hate crime guy?
excuse me
You totally were!
you're the hate crime guy!
My God!
Why did not you say?
Now I understand who you are.
Matt!
The hate crime guy!
Yes, Mavis.
When I was a senior-- when we were seniors a bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods that's right!
and hit my legs and dick with a crowbar.
with a crowbar.
I totally remember that
It was national news.
I mean, until people found out I wasn't actually gay.
Then it wasn't a hate crime.
It was just a fat guy getting his ass beat.
Didn't you get to miss a bunch of school?
Yes.
I "got" to miss about six months.
It was awesome.
fuck!
How's your dick?
Not good.
Does it work?
Yes, it works ...
Just ...
Hard Jack.
See?
This is what Buddy Slade drinks!
I do not know.
-The Buddy Slade.
-The Buddy Slade!
Interesting fact
Come here.
Wanna know why I'm really in town?
Yes.
I can't tell you in here
All right.
They took me out here.
allright. here's the deal
Buddy Slade and I are meant to be together and I'm here to get him back.
Buddy Slade allright
I'm pretty sure Buddy's married.
With a kid on the way.
No, the kid's here.
She already had it
I don't care though.
I have baggage, too, you know?
Wait, are you not joking?
My God, man, I get it people won't understand,
But, you know, but things like this happen.
In real life happens ...
Usually they happen in slow-motion.
They get divorced, they reconfigure.
Society's okay with that if you take your time like a emotional glacier.
-I am 37 years old!
-Mavis ...
I would keep all this to yourself.
I would find a therapist a professional.
-Matt ...
- oh boy ...
Do not you get it?
love conquers all.
Haven't you seen The Graduate?
Or, I don't know, anything?
Oh.
A taxi.
Yeah, we called it Mavis, hey?
The Buddy Slade has life.
A life?
Ha.
No, he has a baby, and babies is boring.
Having spent the summer outside the bubble of waverly prep,
Kendal looked around at her fellow students, thinking:
did I really get that much better, or did everyone simply get worse?
why was Ryan spending so much time with this dumpy new girl?
Mavis, I'm Jim.
do you have any pages?
I trying to help you, but I ...
Oh!
No, no!
I don't need those
-Oh, you're going to want to try the popcorn shrimp!
- No, I'm not.
Two Hard Jack ciders Please.
Hey you!
Wow.
Great to see you.
So!
This is a midweek surprise.
I ordered us a couple of Hard Jacks.
I haven't had one of those since college.
I know, too.
But I thought to drink to remember the old days.
Basically I do not drink recently ...
During the pregnancy of Beth ...
Beth's nursing our girl, so I thought I'd, you know, show some solidarity.
Right.
So are you still at General Mills?
-Yeah, Ad sales now.
My dad is still there, so ... so we have lunch together most days.
We get pizza.
Sub sandwiches...
I see.
I'm just working my butt off my city, Doing my thing in the city.
Right, down there in the "Mini Apple."
Nobody calls it the "Mini Apple," Buddy, God!
I did not know.
Hey, I'm just gonna grab those ciders.
Save our lady a trip.
How chivalrous.
Mavis?
What are you doing here?
I work here.
Bookkeeping, dealing with vendors
A better question:
What are you doing here?
-Just catching up with a friend.
-Oh catching up with a friend.
Here is the Buddy Slade!
there procuring a couple of mind-erasers at the bar
You're not wasting any time, huh?
It was nice talking to you yesterday evening.
-It was nice.
-Okay.
-Hey, Freehauf, what's up man?
-Hey!
-Congratulations on the little one.
-Thank you.
What a wonderful, permanent commitment to make.
It's a ton of work, though, and on almost no sleep.
I'm like a zombie these days.
But so rewarding, right?
Nice to see you here, Matt.
Thanks for stopping by.
Please....
You wanna join us for a round?
I would love to.
But sadly, I've got work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied man
- to complete even the simplest task.
- Bummer.
And I do not want to invade ...
... Meeting of your school, so ... go Injuns
Actually, they changed their name to the Indians in '99.
the local Fon du Lac tribe and...
I go.
Sucks what happened to Matt.
the poor guy has suffered so much just for being gay.
He's not actually gay.
-I am sure it is.
-No.
Didn't you call him "that theater fag" all the time in high school?
"Theater fag" is an expression.
Well, whatever.
Mercury's changed a lot since that happened.
It's way less of a hick town.
Really?
Well, we have this place.
Beats Woody's, right?
And I heard they might be putting in a Chipotle at the mall.
I saw you got a "KenTacoHut."
You know.
One of those combination Kentucky Fried, Taco Bell...
-Pizza Hut!
-Yeah.
Brilliant!
Kentacohut!
You sound like one of your crazy characters.
How is Alan?
Allen is great!
He's good.
Yes ... yes, well.
We're not married anymore
-But ...
-Sorry, no ...
Do not feel sorry, okay.
Well, that's Allen's loss.
Sucks to be Allen.
Sorry I can't hang out longer, but I've got to relieve Beth.
She has band practice tonight.
-Beth is in a band?
Yes.
Yeah, it's just something she does with some other moms.
Wow.
Cool.
Beth's the drummer
Oh my God.
Embarrassing.
Actually, Beth's band's playing here tomorrow night
Why don't you stop by our house for a hang tomorrow?
We'll have dinner, and then we can all go to Beth's show.
I would love that.
This is kind of silly, but could you sign one of those
Waverley Place books for me?
sure
It's not for me, obviously.
It's for my niece, Kendra.
She wants to be a writer someday.
All right.
Of course.
But you know, my name isn't actually on the books.
I mean, it's on the title page if you check inside, but I'm basically a ghostwriter.
Still a pretty big deal compared to the rest of us.
It's so great to see you
I always feel like we can pick up right where we left off.
Exactly.
You know what?
You look the same.
I do?
Yeah.
It's like the rest of us changed and you just got lucky.
-See you tomorrow.
Yes, nice.
All right.
Hello?
I just want you to know that what you saw today wasn't ... what you think it was.
Okay?
Oh.
You're not trying to destroy Buddy Slade's marriage?
It's way more complicated than you could possibly ever understand.
Buddy and I have years of history between us, and it's very rich and complex.
Yeah, sounds like it's definitely beyond my comprehension.
Don't open a new ranch until the old one is done.
What¿
Sorry...my sister.
Forget it.
Just so you know.
I got it, thanks!
Want to Get loaded or something?
I'm Mavis.
I know.
From high school.
Right.
I made you Rice Krispies squares that one time, for your birthday.
I got your locker combination from the vice principal and put them in your locker.
Thank you.
-Where is Matt?
He's in his cave
Welcome to the distillery.
Are you making moonshine?
Screw you.
This is aged bourbon.
You know what?
Wait.
Well, try this.
It is 8 years old.
Take a breath, but not very deep, because it is very possible ... ...
It is limited ... not ...
- Mos Eisley Special Reserve?
- "More isolated".
It's a Star Wars thing...
Cantina...
You know, let's leave that to mature a bit more And I have another one here ...
See if you can discern.
It's oak.
- oak.
Come on now ...
-Well.
Like hiding, there, so when you drink a sip ...
-I was supposed to sip it.
Yes.
Here you are.
Woody.
Oak.
So how'd the rest of your little "date" go yesterday?
Good, good.
It was eye-opening
Buddy... he's clearly not happy.
he actually said that?
He implied it.
You can tell he's suffering.
He looks completely exhausted.
He told me he feels like a zombie.
I was there, and I suspect he was being flip.
It's a pretty strong statement to make.
A zombie is a dead person, Matt.
I'm a fat geek.
I know what zombies are.
I think Buddy and I are having very similar feelings.
The question is, who's going to make the first move?
I'm thinking it will be you.
Aren't you a little old for GI Joes?
-still be wet
-It's fine.
Jesus
You make these?
I combine them, mix and match.
I'm taking Copperhead and attaching Mongol's body...
What was this thing.
I did it late at night, I was tired and drunk.
Do you ever make like, girl dolls?
I'm not a weirdo.
-I need to go check on something.
-Okay.
No, no.
You must come with me.
I think this is it.
You think or you know
This is definitely his house.
He drives a Jeep Liberty.
That's ironic.
Right?
Because he has no liberty.
You're mentally ill.
-You see this window there?
Yes.
I bet Buddy's awake and secretly jerking off or something.
Or perhaps he's caring for his infant daughter.
The baby, the baby.
The problem that has no name.
-Can I help you find something?
Sure.
I'm not having a ton of luck.
Is this something for work?
No, it's for a special occasion.
Not a formal occasion.
Something chic and clean, but also a little bit edgy.
Okay.
We have some adorable new dresses that just came in.
Do you carry Marc Jacobs?
I don't think we have that one.
I'm going to a rock concert with an old flame, and I think there's a chance we may reconnect.
Let's show him what he's been missing.
He's seen me recently, so he knows.
But his wife is seeing me in a while...
Well.
It's the end of my shift, and my son needs to be picked up at school, so I'm just going to send over another associate.
She's up on all the trends.
Shona!
Do you have the Waverley Prep books?
Yeah, they've got their own display table over there.
Wow.
They must be really popular.
Actually we just have a lot of surplus stock we're trying to clear out.
They were a big thing a couple of years ago,
And the computer says "Do Not Shelve," so...
Are you writing in there?
I'm the author.
I'm signing it.
You're Jane MacMurray?
No.
Jane MacMurray just created the series.
I wrote the book.
I'm Mavis Gary.
Crane.
See?
do you know Jane Mcmurray?
Yes, I know her very well...
Look, I wrote this book.
Okay.
Would you like a signed copy for the store?
No, that's fine.
I'll sign as many as you want.
It adds value to your stock.
Yeah, but when merchandise is signed, we can't send it back to the publisher.
Why would you send these back to the publisher?
!
we're probably not going to sell them.
The series is done.
Come, I said, you can not ...
Whatever bookman!

Kendal Strickland never felt threatened.
If anything, she felt a deep sense of pity for this rebound girl.
Not in a competitive way she wasn't the type to show off.
That said, she couldn't help her own popularity.
It wasn't her fault that one year she was voted homecoming queen of a neighboring high school.
Yes, Kendal Strickland was attractive;
that was obvious.
Other girls were so insecure, stressing about their faces and their figures.
Not Kendal.
Hers was an effortless beauty that glowed from within.
However, being that beautiful could also be intimidating.
Some guys went for girls who were more ordinary.
How could Kendal make sure her own perfection wouldn't scare away Ryan, the love of her life?
What's up?
-What are you doing?
-Well.
Here's that book for your niece
Oh yeah.
Thanks for remembering.
I'll send it to her.
There's a character in this one that I based on you.
-what?
In the book.
I mean, I named him Ashby, but it's so blatantly you.
When you read it, it'll be obvious.
I hope he's cool.
We're not even supposed to do that.
We're supposed to stick to this character bible
-Hey!
Nice to see you again.
- You too.
Wow, there it is...
-Adorable.
-Thank you.
Do you guys want drinks?
just water
- Can you bring me another Summer Ale?
- sure
It's fine, I'll just pump and dump after the show.
Don't worry, I'm not trying to get my kid hammered.
Wow, look at that.
Ah yes, the Funquarium.
Always chills her out.
-We're starting to get smiles.
-Cute.
She's like Buddy's clone.
I can see you in there.
-Really?
-A lot of you, in fact.
- Thank you.
- Ladies?
So, how's it going?
I know you're a writer.
I saw that nice article about you in the Sun.
Yes, I'm the author of a young adult series.
It's disturbingly popular.
I like your decor, what is this, shabby chic?
- Pier one.
-And a little bit Goodwill.
Me and Buddy used to go thrifting all the time.
Remember that in the '90s,
We had a huge stupid T-shirt collection.
Just the dumbest things.
-The 90s were awesome.
Yes.
Yes, I used to sleep in Buddy's shirts.
And boxers.
I still have a few, I think.
Hey, I still have one of my ex-boyfriend's T-shirts.
-I can't bring myself to get rid of it.
-What?
What?
I can not tell you.
What is this painting?
Beth teaches special needs kids.
A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively.
It doesn't come naturally to them the way it does for you or me.
So we need to show them:
This is what happy looks like.
This is what anxious looks like.
And so on.
How about, like, neutral?
What if you don't feel anything?
That's kind of how they are a lot of the time, so.
Yeah.
Don't need to teach it.
Oh my God.
Is that Mavis Gary?
Yeah, can you believe it?
She came with Beth and Buddy.
Psychotic prom queen bitch.
Come time for tequila.
Salt.
-So are they any good?
Yes, it's fine.
I know this look.
It's terrible.
I knew it.
But they have fun.
Hey, look, Freehauf's over there.
he's always just lurking around, isn't he?
So creepy!
Look at his face.
He's so doughy.
He looks like a murderer.
he looks like he might own a few clown suits.
My God, you're awful!
-Dark.
-No.
Hello, Mercury!
I'm Mary Ellen Trantowski and we are Nipple Confusion!
Please be kind, as this is only our second show and we all have small children at home.
Our first song's a cover.
This one goes out from our drummer Beth to her sweetheart Buddy.
She wears denim wherever she goes...
Hey, do you remember we used to make out to this song?
This song was playing the first time I went down on you.
The first time I went down on you.
Yeah, you guys were amazing.
Yeah, you guys were namazing.
I think someone's had a few too many.
Oh, hardly...
It's interesting to see you hanging around again, Mavis.
Mary Ellen, you were great tonight.
It's inspiring to see a single mother with so much confidence onstage.
really we gotta get home.
Relieve the babysitter.
I want to stay out just a little while longer.
I'll drive him home.
Really?
Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK?
I'm gonna stay and celebrate.
Sure.
Have fun.
Thanks, Mavis!
Easy.
My tolerance has really gone down since you knew me.
What do you mean, "since I knew you"?
I still know you.
Come here.
Wait.
Don't you have that baby-sitter until 11?
Yeah.
But we can't go anywhere.
I know, We can't.
but ...
But time is just so precious.
For real.
It goes so fast.
Whoosh.
I know ...
Man.
I just really love my daughter, you know?
I know, I know ...
I can tell you're a great father.
You're already going above and beyond in so many ways.
You've stepped up to the plate.
You do too much, even.
-You think so?
Yes.
You're such a good, good man, Buddy.
Don't ever shortchange yourself.
I thought I saw lights.
Yeah, um, Daniel.
I'm home.
-Where's Beth?
-Beth wanted to stay out all night and party.
Well, we're all out of breastmilk and she doesn't want the nuk anymore.
I got it
-Goodnight, Buddy.
-Good night.
-Easy, great!
-I depression.
Then do exercise
Take your poor dog for a walk for once.
Why don't you walk, fat ass?
Oh, there's some low-hanging fruit You are low-hanging fruit.
No!
I hate this guy over here.
Ugh.
My cousin Mike.
-Mike Moran is your cousin
-Unfortunately.
Here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
-Mavis?
-Mike.
What is up, girly-friend?
Holy shit, cuz, this is such a rad surprise!
I'm just in town taking care of a real estate thing.
-How are you?
-I'm great.
You know, Kim and I just had our six-year anniversary.
Six years, what is that, wood?
Porcelain?
Strychnine?
Anyway, the kids are great.
Work is a trip, but I play hard, too.
doing a lot of rock-climbing.
What, like, rock-crawling, you mean?
Nahh, I'm vertical, bro.
Believe it or not.
We can do anything a normal can do.
Probably more, because we've had to reboot for extra positivity, know what I'm saying?
-You should try it!
-You should try it!
No!
I love the way this guy talks.
He's like, "no."
I'm so glad you guys are buds, I can totally see it.
It's like Will and Grace.
-It is!
No, it is not.
Look, I'm gonna roll back to my boys, but we should chat later!
I'll buy you a scotch or whatever you've got there.
I love this place total time capsule, right?
When did he get that chair?
Sophomore year?
Junior.
Car wreck.
He got so much attention.
Yes,he was the "popular cripple."
Practically ruined high school for me.
well he ruined my Sweet Sixteen.
same weekend!
You're a piece of work
You're a piece of shit.
Damn it.
The kiss was electric.
Transformative.
Spiritual.
Enchanted.
It was like their first kiss all over again, except now they knew exactly what they were doing.
So I said, like, listen, Kyle.
You're everything to me.
You're my sun, my moon, my galaxy;
when are you going to get this?
-And he was like, not getting it...
-Right!
-Hey!
-Hi, how are you?
I'm great.
Last night was amazing.
How much longer are you going to be in town?
I'm here for you.
How... how long do you need?
I was just wondering, if you're still around this weekend, if you'd like to come to the baby's naming ceremony.
It's just a little hippie thing out in the yard.
Not religious or anything.
-Buddy, I would love to come.
-cool. allright
Saturday, at the house, around one.
Perfect, I can not wait to see.
Great.
Hi, Mom.
you would not want to say hello?
It's been so long, I almost forgot what you look like.
I wasn't avoiding you.
I was planning to call.
Why didn't you just come stay with us?
I needed a quiet place to write.
You have no idea I have tons of work to catch up on.
Are the books still selling well?
I can hardly keep up.
This is the money invested to purchase the property?
I heard you were back here to work on some kind of real estate transaction?
I was just surprised you didn't use Aunt Lena as your broker.
She's a little hurt.
Honey?
Look what I found!
-Welcome!
-Thank you.
-Be a real estate tycoon.
-I do not know that.
-What is this?
-The Dolce.
I hope you're eating enough in the city.
It's important to take care of yourself, sweetie.
Lean Cuisine is not a meal
I think I might be an alcoholic.
Very funny.
You're not still pulling it, are you?
Stop it.
It's just that your hair is so beautiful.
Mom?
Can you please take down that picture of me and Allen?
Which photo, sweetie?
Our wedding picture?
We're divorced.
We just thought it was a nice memory.
Of my failed marriage?
The wedding wasn't a failure.
Remember that tiramisu?
I like that Allen
Dad, he's my ex-husband.
You're supposed to be on my team.
He's a nice guy.
That's all.
I didn't know there were teams.
Have you seen any old friends on this visit¿
Actually, I've seen quite a bit of Buddy.
The old beau, eh?
I remember you kids were so cute in high school.
It's funny how those initial instincts can often be so right.
You can make mistakes along the way, but the world has a way of bringing you back to the person you're meant to be with.
It's good to keep those people in your life.
People that really know you best.
That new baby of his is just darling.
Have you seen it up close?
I suppose.
Is everything okay?
I am sure he will be okay, is too early to tell.
Buddy always said we'd make pretty cute kids.
... In the world.
Hey, did you guys ever sell my Cabriolet?
Yes!
sweet ride
What is it?
Is that a drop-top?
I just saw my mother and father.
Heavy.
What are they like?
Horrible.
God.
I've been through a lot.
Want to become lioma?
Why do you think I'm here?
Let's go drink in the woods behind the school.
-It is a little ...
-Come on!
Well.
You can not walk more slowly?
Our school is so ugly.
It looks just like a factory.
It used to be a rubber fabrication plant in the '20s.
You know everything.
These woods were like Hump City back in the day.
I remember being out here with a few different guys.
I never knew you were a slut.
I was normal.
So what's going on with old Buddy?
How's the master plan unfolding?
He called me today and asked me if I would participate in his daughter's naming ceremony on Saturday.
I do not know ... there's still so much that's unspoken,
but He's involving me in his child's life.
Buddy is a married man By all accounts, happily
Yes.
happily married men go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time.
They call them privately.
They make out with them on the porch...
He did not make out with you
You were not there.
Kissed.
It was really intense and passionate.
He gave me the shirt.
Yes, I noticed.
They probably noticed in space.
And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it.
Look, I don't know exactly what Buddy's doing with you, or what you think he's doing with you, you need to move on.
You're one to talk
All they care about
All you care about is some scuffle that happened 20 years ago.
You lean on that crutch and you lean on excuses, and you and I both know that you've used the whole thing as an excuse to do absolutely nothing in your life
A scuffle?
You don't know shit about what happened to me.
Those jocks you used to blow during lunch they shattered my legs they bashed in my brain
mangled my cock so I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life,
and they left me for dead.
You know, Things aren't so great "down south."
I can barely get off by myself let alone with another person.
You know, What's done is done.
You can't dwell on the past.
Are you fucking kidding?
Talk about dwelling in the past. here you are, back in Mercury like a loser, trying to score with a guy who's happily married man
Buddy is not happy!
Okay?
Stop saying that!
You're hardly the authority on happiness, Sylvia.
You know what, Matt?
It's really a shame that you're like this.
Because If you had a good personality, none of the other stuff would matter to people.
why don't you use my crutch as a metaphor again?
That was brilliant.
That was masterful.
save it for your little teenage stories.
God knows you don't know anything about being an adult.
It wasn't the first time Kendal Strickland was let down.
For all the good they did, beauty and popularity didn't inspire much loyalty.
Would it be nice to have peers?
Friends she could respect?
sure.
but Kendal knew the lone march of being special a little too well.
She was used to blazing her own trail.
It was obvious that Ryan still loved her.
Crystal clear.
And perhaps that was unfair to his new girlfriend.
But Kendal Strickland was going to think about herself for a change.
"Who was taking care of Kendal?"
And on the subject of fair was it fair that people misjudged Kendal's intelligence just because she was so beautiful?
Was it fair that everyone thought her life was so easy when it was anything but?
No!
Life wasn't fair, and it was up to Kendal to step in and make things right.
Sometimes, in order to heal, a few people have to get hurt.
-Hi, Jan.
-Hi.
Well!
It's been a very long time
I've been a busy girl.
Yes, I heard.
Buddy's been very busy, ha ha!
And Bethie.
I'm finally a grandma.
speaking of devil!
-Hey!
-Hi, how are you?
How you doing?
Well.
I brought gifts.
-Thank you.
-They're just burp cloths.
Great, we always need more pukers.
Hey Mom, I think Beth needs help with the endive thing.
-Can we talk?
-Yes ...
Having fun?
are you having fun?
Bravo!
I think we should to talk privately.
Sure.
From here, follow me.
Good.
So what's going on?
Ugh.
There's so many things I know we both want to say.
Okay?
Let's not say all of them.
I gotta get Beth's gift ready.
I got her a drum set.
You are so thoughtful.
Even during all this.
Hey, she pushed it out.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm feeling everything you're feeling.
Buddy, These past few days have been some of the best of my life.
They have?
You don't have to pretend
And I know what's in here.
And I know what's here.
Buddy ... you're my moon.
My stars.
You're my whole galaxy...
-Mavis!
what are you doing?
Okay ...
You don't have to be afraid.
It's okay.
You can come to the city with me, like we always planned.
What the hell are you talking about?
!
We can work it out.
You know that we ...
We'll handle it like adults.
-Mavis, I'm a married man.
-I know.
We can beat this thing together.
You're better than this.
I have to go.
You should leave.
Look who's up!
'Me to get, leave me.
Come here.
Do me a favor.
Will you get everyone to go outside?
I want to prepare the gift of Beth.
Listen up, everyone!
I think Buddy has a little surprise for Beth, so if you'll just direct your attention to the garage...
Come on, let's go.
-Mavis?
-What?
Are you okay?
I would be if I could get a drink.
There's some right here.
Thank you, Uncle Bob.
You know what?
Oh my God.
-I will bring something ...
-Fuck you!
Fuck you!
You fucking bitch!
God, you should see your face.
It's a joke!
You're just standing there like a big lump.
I love your sweater.
I'll go get a rag
You guys sure have a lot of rags around here.
... Fucking Burp cloths, whatever.
You know what funny thing is,?
I actually could have had this party a long time ago.
this very same party.
Buddy and I were together for four years.
... And we were inseparable.
JAN knows.
right Jan?
Tell them.
No, don't worry.
It's silk.
It's fucked.
Mavis, sweetheart ...
Mother, I'm trying to say a story here.
Buddy got me pregnant when I was 20,
We were going to keep it we were going to have a baby and a naming party and a Funquarium and all that.
And twelve weeks into it well, I had Buddy's miscarriage, which I wouldn't wish for anyone.
Maybe if things had been a little bit more hospitable, down south, in my broken body,
Buddy and I would be here right now.
With a teenager, and probably even more kids.
We always came back to each other.
Right Jen Tell them.
What the fuck?
it's a new drum kit for Beth.
What's wrong?
-Nothing ...
-What do you mean, nothing?
My God!
What's wrong with you?
Are you one of those kids who needs a chart to learn feelings?
Stand up for yourself, Why does it cover?
That's enough, Mavis!
You're drunk!
I've been drunk since I've been back and nobody gave two shits until this one got bent out of shape
Mavis,What the hell are you doing?
Why did you invite me?
I didn't invite you.
My wife did.
Beth practically forced me to call you.
She feels sorry for you; we all do.
It's obvious you've been having some...mental, uh, sickness, some depression, and you're very lonely and confused.
So Beth made me invite you even though
I knew it would be a mistake.
I knew it.
You're lying
He's not.
well...
What about now?
Do you hate me now?
It is easy because I hate you.
What the hell is wrong with you people?
-Mavis, honey...
-Do you know ...
I came back for you.
For you.
And I hate this town.
It's a hick lake town that smells like fish shit.
But I came back.
I just want you to know that.
I screwed up
-I screwed up so bad!
-Where have you been?
you're scaring me
I'm crazy.
And no one loves me.
You don't love me.
Guys like me are born loving women like you.
I went to Buddy's house.
What happened?
My dress is ruined.
I will bring ...
I'll get ...
Let me get you a shirt...
No, I want yours.
You want the shirt I'm wearing?
Hug me.
Why Buddy?
He's a good man.
He's kind.
Are other men unkind?
He knew me when I was at my best.
You weren't at your best then, Mavis.
Not then.
I saw you every day.
You had this little mirror in your locker.
It was shaped like a heart, and you looked at that mirror more than you ever looked at me.
And I was at my best.
Good morning.
Hi.
-Coffee?
Yes.
Do you still write those books?
No.
The series is over. got cancelled.
I'm actually writing the last book right now.
What happens?
I don't know.
Hey, do you know a girl named Beth?
She married Buddy Slade, from school?
Umm...
Yeah, I know that Beth.
What do you think of her?
I ...
I ...
I don't really like her.
And I think you're way prettier than her.
What happened to your dress?
Sorry.
I said something wrong?
Shit.
What's the matter What did I say?
I have a lot of problems.
Can't you get a new dress?
I...
It's very difficult for me to be happy.
And other people... it's so simple for them.
I know.
They just grow up.
They're so... fulfilled.
-I don't feel fulfilled.
-Well and frankly, if you don't feel fulfilled with all the stuff you have...
Sandra, I need to change.
No, you don't.
What?
You're the only person in Mercury who could write a book or wear a dress like that.
I'm sure there's plenty of people...
Everyone here is fat and dumb.
Don't say that.
Do you really think so?
Yes.
Everyone wishes they could be like you.
You know, living in a big city, famous, and beautiful and all that.
I'm not really famous.
Well, you know, special... or whatever.
Some days, during a slow shift,
I'll just think about you living in your cool apartment...
Going out and stuff it seems really nice.
Yes ... but ...
Most here seem so happy with so little ...
They don't even seem to care what happens to them
That's because it doesn't matter what happens to them.
They're nothing.
Might as well die.
Fuck Mercury.
Thank you
I needed that.
You're right;
this place blows.
I need to head back to Minneapolis.
Take me with you.
Excuse me¿
Take me with you.
You know, to the Mini Apple.
You're good here
Dolce.
I'm sorry.
oh baby come here
Graduation turned out to be a bittersweet ceremony for Kendal.
While honored to be the valedictorian of her class, there was an unmistakeable air of sadness over the sudden death of Ryan Ashby.
Who could have imagined when Ryan and his girlfriend set sail that day that it would be the last time anyone ever saw them.
Poor Ryan, lost at sea.
They don't need these back.
You can put them in a scrapbook or whatever
Just so you know, those donuts are for a honors members.
Kendal felt the weight of her high school years lifting off of her as she emptied out her locker.
Sure, she'd think about Waverly from time to time;
cheer squad, the debate team, sneaking into the woods for a drink after class.
But her best years were still ahead of her.
Kendal Strickland was ready for the world.
It was time to look to the future A new chapter.
As she boarded the train to Cambridge, she took one last look at her small town and blew it a kiss, thinking:
Life, here I come subtitle by Amir_T6262
You have to buy it if you want to read it.
Lord Kang, the conquest of the 21st century has begun.
# Our world's about to break # # tormented and upset # # the loss from when wake # # with no way to go back #
# I'm standing on my own # # but now I'm not alone #
# always we will fight as one # # till the battle's won # # with evil on the run # # we never come undone # # assemble, we are strong # # forever fight as one #
# assemble, we are strong # # forever fight as one #
Report!
Sir, the Helicarrier is taking fire from multiple unknown contacts.
Shielding is ineffective.
I just got this boat back in the air,
I'm not about to let her go down again.
Director Fury, this isn't just an attack on SHIELD.
The United Nations is under attack.
We're getting distress calls from all over.
Sir, what are your orders?
So one get me the Avengers.
Avengers assemble!
So much destruction.
Why would someone do this?
Why?
I'm still working on "What?"
What are these things?
Aliens?
Unlikely, given the Egyptian styling to them.
More likely this is Kang.
Launch the second wave of scarabs.
Truly, this is a battle the likes of which Midgard has never seen.
How fare thee, Wasp?
Ugh, I need bigger stingers.
This is crazy.
Do we have a plan?
Where is Iron Man?
Return fire!
Sir, all weapon's systems are offline.
We can't...
Sir, incoming!
What took you so long?
Hey, traffic's worse than normal.
The Helicarrier is a sitting duck out here, Fury, you need to get clear of the city.
The Avengers can handle this.
Yeah, you want to tell me how you intend to do that?
Sure, once I figure it out myself.
The Hulk boasted that he would smash more machines than I.
He is sorely mistaken.
You could at least act like you're a little worried about this, Thor.
Sadly, I have faced such odds before in the defense of Asgard.
Jarvis, isolate one of these things and analyze.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
I kid thee not.
No, these robots, the ships, I know this tech.
This is all...
Did you really think that you had defeated me?
Kang.
I told you Avengers that I would save this world.
Under my rule, Earth will be strong.
It will survive the coming onslaught.
I've been learning the strengths and weaknesses of your era's defenses.
And now the true conquest begins.
Uh-oh.
They're regenerating.
They're self-repairing, this was all an act... we never even made a dent.
Hawkeye, Panther fire at will.
Hulk, free Giant Man.
Move!
Oh, come on.
We've got a big problem here, old man.
They're corralling us.
I know.
We need to set a rally point and regroup.
How many explosive arrows do you have left?
None.
I could throw rocks if you want.
I found bigger stingers.
You boys might want to duck.
Is everyone okay?
We don't have time not to be.
These things are moving through the city, block by block.
- We need to divert them.
- It's Kang.
The ships, robots, everything.
It's all Kang.
He's invading the city.
No exactly Iron Man.
Tactical targets are being hit all along the Eastern seaboard.
Well, why New York then?
They're no tactical targets in the city.
The Avengers are a tactical target.
There's more.
This isn't just happening here.
It's happening all over the world.
Kang isn't just invading New York, he's taking over the entire planet.
Every major city in the world is under attack by Kang's forces.
Several have already fallen.
Even more are surrendering.
If we're going to turn this around, we don't have much time.
This is... this is madness.
How are we supposed to fight this?
Nick, have you had any luck with those flying discs I saw up in the sky?
Conventional weapons aren't making a dent.
We were hoping Stark might have some ideas.
There was a back door in Kang's tech that I was able to exploit when we first met him, but he's closed it off.
I'm still analyzing the data I got.
Your people need their king.
You should go.
What?
That's not your call, Cap, we need all the...
Right.
T'Challa, take one of the Quinjets.
We'll be there to help as soon as we can.
Thank you, my friends.
You have to do something.
We're hopelessly outnumbered here.
Are forces are barely holding out.
We have to find Kang.
Take the fight to him.
He's right.
We stop Kang, we end this invasion.
Do we have any idea where he is?
No.
My tech couldn't trace his communication.
He could be on any one of those ships, anywhere on the planet.
The Avengers have to get back out there.
People need our help.
We'll buy you as much time as we can.
Find Kang.
You're the only one who can do it, Tony.
I hate him.
You know, when he's right.
That's how the rest of us feel about you.
Good luck, Tony.
There's more heading for the bridge.
- You ready, jade jaws?
- I'm always ready.
Goldilocks thought he'd smash more robots than me.
Stupid hammer man.
Hey, you want to focus here, green?
We have to hold out until the bridge evacuates.
And I've taken down more of these things than both you and Thor combined.
All right, I'll take...
I'll take them all.
You just rest, big guy.
Hm, maybe I will rest now.
Good luck.
Great, now I have to save the Hulk.
That's just...
Whoa!
So what now?
Well, I think there's only 700 million left.
Tony, it's Hank.
Any luck?
If I'd found him, Hank, I'd have given you a ring.
I'm connected to every satellite in the world right now,
I can't detect Kang anywhere!
All of this technology is useless!
- Uh, he's still working on it.
- Oh, well, that's wonderful.
Maybe Kang will let us call a time out until we find him.
Cap?
This is war... and we need an army.
I know where you can find an army.
What do you call these things?
Ultron.
I'll just say it again for the record.
I'm not comfortable with this.
The Ultrons have built-in weapons systems that Iron Man designed, but I've disabled everything except a simple stun blast.
People's lives are at stake, Doctor Pym.
If you have a better idea, I'm open to it.
But as it stands, these robots of yours are our only chance to even the odds.
The world is counting on us.
What are you doing?
I'm teaching Ultron the concept of violence.
Programming accepted.
Tony, it's...
- Not there yet, Hank.
- Tony, listen.
Cap's got a plan for dealing with Kang's forces, but it's all moot if we can't find Kang and take down the Armada ship.
I don't know where he is, okay?
I just can't...
Argh.
Keep at it, soldier.
You are safe now.
Everything is going to be all right.
Do you need medical attention?
Take them down, Avengers.
Wasp, Ant-Man, you know the plan.
We're good to go, Cap.
You seem way too excited about all this.
- I'm a extremely positive person.
- Well, that makes one of us.
See?
Everything according to plan.
You know those Quinjets cost Tony about $20 million apiece, right?
Well, it wasn't my plan.
Hi.
This is of similar design to portions of Kang's time chair.
Iron Man and I theorized that Kang's equipment must have some kind of temporal stasis device, something that allows it to remain in this era, like an anchor.
If we destroy that anchor, the ship theoretically would return to its own time.
Ugh, I'm gonna blast it now.
Oh!
Lord Kang, one of the Armada ships has lost its connection to the timeline.
It's... it's gone.
Cap, this is Ant-Man.
Tell the others it worked.
They're clear to proceed.
You heard the man, Avengers.
Armada ship 795 to Damocles.
I am under attack!
I repeat, I am under a...
Time to smash.
And that's how you free New York from an invasion of time traveling robots.
This was just a battle.
There are hundreds of ships, all over the world.
Thousands of robots.
The war will never end until we find Kang.
Nothing.
All my technology, and I got nothing.
Where on Earth are you?
Earth?
What if he's not on Earth?
Jarvis, get me all scans of space in the last 24 hours, full spectrum analysis.
Focus on geo-synchronous orbit over North America.
This Iron Man to the Avengers.
You have to buy it if you want to read it.
Lord Kang, the conquest of the 21st century has begun.

Report!
Sir, the Helicarrier is taking fire from multiple unknown contacts.
Shielding is ineffective.
I just got this boat back in the air,
I'm not about to let her go down again.
Director Fury, this isn't just an attack on SHIELD.
The United Nations is under attack.
We're getting distress calls from all over.
Sir, what are your orders?
So one get me the Avengers.
Avengers assemble!
So much destruction.
Why would someone do this?
Why?
I'm still working on "What?"
What are these things?
Aliens?
Unlikely, given the Egyptian styling to them.
More likely this is Kang.
Launch the second wave of scarabs.
Truly, this is a battle the likes of which Midgard has never seen.
How fare thee, Wasp?
Ugh, I need bigger stingers.
This is crazy.
Do we have a plan?
Where is Iron Man?
Return fire!
Sir, all weapon's systems are offline.
We can't...
Sir, incoming!
What took you so long?
Hey, traffic's worse than normal.
The Helicarrier is a sitting duck out here, Fury, you need to get clear of the city.
The Avengers can handle this.
Yeah, you want to tell me how you intend to do that?
Sure, once I figure it out myself.
The Hulk boasted that he would smash more machines than I.
He is sorely mistaken.
You could at least act like you're a little worried about this, Thor.
Sadly, I have faced such odds before in the defense of Asgard.
Jarvis, isolate one of these things and analyze.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
I kid thee not.
No, these robots, the ships, I know this tech.
This is all...
Did you really think that you had defeated me?
Kang.
I told you Avengers that I would save this world.
Under my rule, Earth will be strong.
It will survive the coming onslaught.
I've been learning the strengths and weaknesses of your era's defenses.
And now the true conquest begins.
Uh-oh.
They're regenerating.
They're self-repairing, this was all an act... we never even made a dent.
Hawkeye, Panther fire at will.
Hulk, free Giant Man.
Move!
Oh, come on.
We've got a big problem here, old man.
They're corralling us.
I know.
We need to set a rally point and regroup.
How many explosive arrows do you have left?
None.
I could throw rocks if you want.
I found bigger stingers.
You boys might want to duck.
Is everyone okay?
We don't have time not to be.
These things are moving through the city, block by block.
- We need to divert them.
- It's Kang.
The ships, robots, everything.
It's all Kang.
He's invading the city.
No exactly Iron Man.
Tactical targets are being hit all along the Eastern seaboard.
Well, why New York then?
They're no tactical targets in the city.
The Avengers are a tactical target.
There's more.
This isn't just happening here.
It's happening all over the world.
Kang isn't just invading New York, he's taking over the entire planet.
Every major city in the world is under attack by Kang's forces.
Several have already fallen.
Even more are surrendering.
If we're going to turn this around, we don't have much time.
This is... this is madness.
How are we supposed to fight this?
Nick, have you had any luck with those flying discs I saw up in the sky?
Conventional weapons aren't making a dent.
We were hoping Stark might have some ideas.
There was a back door in Kang's tech that I was able to exploit when we first met him, but he's closed it off.
I'm still analyzing the data I got.
Your people need their king.
You should go.
What?
That's not your call, Cap, we need all the...
Right.
T'Challa, take one of the Quinjets.
We'll be there to help as soon as we can.
Thank you, my friends.
You have to do something.
We're hopelessly outnumbered here.
Are forces are barely holding out.
We have to find Kang.
Take the fight to him.
He's right.
We stop Kang, we end this invasion.
Do we have any idea where he is?
No.
My tech couldn't trace his communication.
He could be on any one of those ships, anywhere on the planet.
The Avengers have to get back out there.
People need our help.
We'll buy you as much time as we can.
Find Kang.
You're the only one who can do it, Tony.
I hate him.
You know, when he's right.
That's how the rest of us feel about you.
Good luck, Tony.
There's more heading for the bridge.
- You ready, jade jaws?
- I'm always ready.
Goldilocks thought he'd smash more robots than me.
Stupid hammer man.
Hey, you want to focus here, green?
We have to hold out until the bridge evacuates.
And I've taken down more of these things than both you and Thor combined.
All right, I'll take...
I'll take them all.
You just rest, big guy.
Hm, maybe I will rest now.
Good luck.
Great, now I have to save the Hulk.
That's just...
Whoa!
So what now?
Well, I think there's only 700 million left.
Tony, it's Hank.
Any luck?
If I'd found him, Hank, I'd have given you a ring.
I'm connected to every satellite in the world right now,
I can't detect Kang anywhere!
All of this technology is useless!
- Uh, he's still working on it.
- Oh, well, that's wonderful.
Maybe Kang will let us call a time out until we find him.
Cap?
This is war... and we need an army.
I know where you can find an army.
What do you call these things?
Ultron.
I'll just say it again for the record.
I'm not comfortable with this.
The Ultrons have built-in weapons systems that Iron Man designed, but I've disabled everything except a simple stun blast.
People's lives are at stake, Doctor Pym.
If you have a better idea, I'm open to it.
But as it stands, these robots of yours are our only chance to even the odds.
The world is counting on us.
What are you doing?
I'm teaching Ultron the concept of violence.
Programming accepted.
Tony, it's...
- Not there yet, Hank.
- Tony, listen.
Cap's got a plan for dealing with Kang's forces, but it's all moot if we can't find Kang and take down the Armada ship.
I don't know where he is, okay?
I just can't...
Argh.
Keep at it, soldier.
You are safe now.
Everything is going to be all right.
Do you need medical attention?
Take them down, Avengers.
Wasp, Ant-Man, you know the plan.
We're good to go, Cap.
You seem way too excited about all this.
- I'm a extremely positive person.
- Well, that makes one of us.
See?
Everything according to plan.
You know those Quinjets cost Tony about $20 million apiece, right?
Well, it wasn't my plan.
Hi.

You got to know the secret hand signal to get a drink in here.
It's like I'm invisible.
Well, I see you.
What can I get you?
Hi, I'm Neal.
Okay, Neal.
You thirsty?
Oh, uh...
Mojito.
You got it.
You know that rum sales have grown 12% in England because the Mojito is so popular?
I'm... sorry.
I can get a little Rain Man;
I see numbers in everything.
Oh...
I'm an accountant.
You're not a regular in here.
It's that obvious?
Uh, my brother asked me to meet him here.
And he's late, as usual.
Okay.
Oh...
I'm so sorry.
You clumsy cow.
Hey, buddy, she said she was sorry.
I'm not your buddy.
Look, let me get you a towel.
How about you get me your manager?
Because you just lost your job.
Hey!
You bumped into her.

Everybody go back to your drinks.

I couldn't tell.
Did you see that punch I landed?
Your one, his ten.
Yeah, I saw.
Wow.
You didn't have to do that.
Yeah, I did.
Um, why don't you go clean yourself up?
And when you get back, drinks are on me.
I'll get back with you girls.
I got to go take care of business.
You killed him.
No.
I didn't.
(indistinct police radio transmission)
So that's what you saw?
You sure that's what happened?
I never saw a dead body before.
I freaked out.
I got out of here.
I called 911.
This place is not that big.
How's that possible?
I saw them fight.
That's it.
You have a clear line of sight to the men's room.
I don't know what to tell you.
You know, he was just sticking up for me.
But then the last time you saw Neal, he was headed to the men's room.
Yes.
H.
I thought somebody called in a dead body.
They did, Eric.
Nobody out there knows where the suspect is or the dead body.
DELKO:
There's no drag marks on the floor.
And there's only one way out of here, gentlemen.
If you get out of the bathroom, there's an exit in the back hall, here.
No witnesses saw the suspect leave, though.
So how did they get the body out?
Well, either somebody's lying or this Neal guy's Houdini.

Do you know the victim's last name?
I just heard the bartender call him Braden.
Braden, stop!
We didn't find any Braden in the receipts from last night.
You said the man who fought with him told you his name was Neal?
We did find three Neals.
Think you could pick the suspect out of these DMV photos?
This is him, Neal Marshall.
He doesn't look like a killer.
Looks can be deceiving.
Look, um, we're going to shut the place down today.
So you can go home.
But will you do me a favor and leave me your contact information?
(cell phone beeps)
Yeah, I need to put a BOLO out on a Neal Marshall.
Five-nine, brown hair, brown eyes.
Thanks.
I don't know if it's important, but he said he was meeting his brother here.
He never showed up.
I'll look into that.
Thank you.
Neal and I aren't just brothers, we run an investment firm together.
I know with absolute certainty that he wouldn't hurt anybody.
We have three little girls.
My husband's never been in any type of trouble.
Very nice.
Where do you think he could be?
He said he had a business meeting last night, but he never came home.
It's my understanding that you were supposed to meet him at Bar 212.
I was held up on an overseas call.
I was running late.
You told him to meet you at a singles bar again?
Witnesses stated that he was fighting over a woman.
Neal and I have been going through some difficulties.
Difficulties?
She keeps him on a tight leash, and he's finally tugging back.
(laughing):
You can't blame the guy.
I mean, they got married right out of high school.
Was he supposed to stay single and irresponsible, like you, forever, Dean?
You have been in his ear;
I can tell.
(cell phone rings)
CAINE:
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Was that about Neal?
His car was spotted pulling into a parking structure in South Beach.
Please don't let them hurt my husband.
I won't, Mrs. Marshall.
The parking lot is across from the home address that the waitress at the bar gave us.
Yeah, well, that's not a coincidence.
Exactly.
All right.
I'll go there now and check it out.
Natalia, that's it.
Clear.
Clear here.
He looks like he fits the description of the guy they found stabbed in the bathroom.
Well, at least we know where Neal Marshall put his body.
Where's Neal Marshall?
Olivia.
Olivia Hunter.
Miami-Dade Police Department.
Open the door.
OLIVIA:
Just a second.
Let's go.
Uh, I'm sorry.
I'm a little out of it, after what happened.
Can I come in?
What's this about?
Do you have any more questions about last night?
I want to come in.
Sure.
You here alone?
Yeah, why?
(cell phone rings)
You can't go in there!
Stay right there.
Neal Marshall?
Put your hands up.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't kill that guy.
Put your hands up.
Turn around.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can, and will, be used against you.
I'm innocent.
Please...
Let's go.
Get over there.
Cuff yourselves together.
Me?
Yeah, you.
You were hiding him.
What?
I didn't do anything.
Leave her alone.
She was just trying to help me.
Oh, my God.
What did you do?
I didn't.
I found him like that.
Okay.
Okay.
Take these keys.
Go to my place-
- Ozone and Twelfth.
We'll-we'll figure this out.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Why are you doing this for me?
Because you said you didn't do this, and I believe you.
Now, go!
It's called "aiding and abetting."
Let's go.
Come on.
(elevator bell dings)
This is an insane misunderstanding.
I fought with that guy at the bar, but I didn't kill him.
Sure.
Why is his body in your trunk, then?
What?
That's impossible.
I'm being set up.
Set up by who?
I don't know!
You should be quiet, Neal.
Someone needs to figure all this out!
(metallic screeching and rumbling)
Oh, no.
What the hell was that?
Hey.
It's them.
What do you mean, them?
Who's them?
(rumbling)
Guys, we got to get the hell out of here.
How?
However the hell way we can.
We can help!
OLIVIA:
Uncuff us!
Please!
(sighs, panting)
All right.
Grab the door.
On my count, right?
One, two, three.
(grunting)
(panting):
All right.
(squeaking)
(panting)
(metallic screeching)
Come on, give me your hand!
(gasps)
(panting)
(garbled radio transmission)
It doesn't look like it fell ten floors.
Car isn't even that damaged, man.
Yeah, well, trust me, it was falling.
(metallic creaking)
Hey, Wolfe, you got anything in that control panel?
Yeah, I think I got something.
Looks like a remote-control switch plate that's wired to the power line.
That explains what happened.
He turned off the power, triggering the electromagnetic brakes.
DELKO:
What the hell was that?
(metallic screeching)
Right, giving me time to get out of the car... (squeaking) ...turn the power back on and release the brakes.
(thudding)
WOLFE:
Yeah, the car falls, turn the power off, engage the brakes.
Gives Neal and Olivia a soft landing, lets them escape.
What was that?
!
(panting)
Hey, did these two know each other before last night?
Neal's married.
H spoke to his wife.
She said she was worried he might be stepping out on her.
I did a background check on Olivia Hunter.
I didn't find anything.
Well, someone must have been up here to help them rig the elevator.
That's how they got away.
Yeah, well, we need to find out who.
(sighs)
I need you to be honest with me right now, Mrs. Marshall, and tell me where your husband is.
You know, covering I have no idea.
for him is a felony.
That's a whole lot of prison time.
Are you accusing me of something?
We know that he didn't escape alone.
It was too well orchestrated.
I didn't help him, I swear.
Neal is the father of my children.
If I had any idea, any idea at all...
Do you know who Olivia Hunter is?
No.
Who is she?
She came up in the investigation.
God.
Look... all we know is that your husband is involved in something very dangerous, and I need your help.
You've got to tell me anything you possibly know that could help us figure out what.
I...
I don't know if it means anything, but Neal's been having some problems at work.
What kind of problems?
They lost an account, a big one, and I think his brother Dean blamed Neal for it.
Could his brother be involved?
I don't know.
I just want Neal back home.
Please find my husband.
Please.
Thank you for your help, Mrs. Marshall.
You can go home for now.
Got your text.
There's an anomaly with the victim found in Neal Marshall's trunk.
This body's temp-- it doesn't seem possible, but it's actually warming up.
What are you saying?
This man has been dead for several days.
So, he can't be our victim from the bar.
Couldn't have been.
A corpse normally loses two degrees of body heat the first hour after death, and another degree each hour after that.
So, by that calculation, he should be approximately 87 degrees.
Precisely, and this body temp is only 62.
So he started too low.
Are we saying he was frozen?
Or held in some sort of cold storage.
Take a look at the knife wound.
There should be perimortem bruising, but there isn't.
I think it's a medical cadaver.
Who found his way into the trunk of our suspect's car.
Right.
Now, this incision is recent.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What is that, Doctor?
It's an RFID chip.
Some medical facilities have started putting them in their cadavers so they can keep track of them.
Then the question becomes, who is this?
I just heard what happened to you in the elevator.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just...
I'm getting nowhere with this remote control switch.
So, whoever rigged it must have been wearing a body glove, because it's totally clean.
Hey, do you have the RFID reader in here?
Yeah.
Where did you get an RFID chip?
It was in our victim.
Well, actually, it's not even our victim anymore.
What?
The body that we found in the trunk-- it's a medical cadaver.
So our real victim's body is still missing?
Yes, and so is Neal.
We have surveillance at his house, but he hasn't come home yet.
Okay, so we got a missing body, a planted cadaver...
A phantom crime scene.
And a rigged elevator.
What the hell is going on?
(beep) Here we go.
The cadaver's name is Jason Norris.
Died of a myocardial infarction four days ago.
Donated his body to Silas BioTech.
I'm gonna ask Boa Vista to go by Silas BioTech.
Maybe she can get some answers.
(echoes):
Hello?
Oh, I am so sorry.
We are celebrating Celeste's birthday today.
I need to speak to the person in charge of your research cadavers.
Oh, well, that-that'd be my boss, but he's out.
That's why we're having the party now.
He does not like to have fun on the clock.
Well, unfortunately, he's probably not gonna like this, either.
We found one of your research cadavers at a crime scene.
Pulled this off the RFID chip.
Oh.
Mr. Norris.
Oh.
Okay, um... let's see here.
Hi.
Alisha, could you bring me, uh, the file on Jason Norris, please?
All right.
Did you know that he was missing?
Uh, actually, Mr. Norris was reported misappropriated two days ago.
How does a body become misappropriated?
Oh, there's lots of money on the black market for body parts.
Thank you.
We-We do everything we can to prevent it, but...
Did you file a police report?
We hadn't officially determined, uh, if Mr. Norris was stolen or just misplaced.
There was an inventory audit in mid-process.
Can you show me where you had his body stored?
Oh, he never arrived.
The body went missing during transport from Dade General, so... you might want to follow up with them.
I will.
Thank you.
All right.
(phone ringing)
Hello.
DUQUESNE:
Neal Marshall just called in to MDPD.
He's on the phone with Horatio right now.
We need you to come back.
I'm on my way.
Neal, listen to me.
Come in, and we'll work it out.
Why is this happening?
What is happening, Neal?
I didn't kill her.
I woke up, and she was dead.
Who's dead, Neal?
Is it Olivia Hunter?
I didn't want to get her mixed up in all this.
She said people must be after me, people who want to kill me.
Okay, Neal, why would they target you?
I'm an accountant.
Maybe I saw something.
Some financial statement I wasn't supposed to see.
I don't know!
Okay.
Where are you, Neal?
I can't trust you.
I can't trust anyone.
Neal?
(phone beeps off)
I got a location.
He's at the Brio Hotel on Thornton Avenue.
Don't forget to send backup.
On their way.

Eric.
I got the room key.
They checked in under the waitress's name.
It's clear.
She's gone.
DELKO:
I don't get this guy.
The victim at the bar, and now her.
I don't know what he's trying to do.
I don't either, Eric.
(garbled radio transmission, camera shutter clicking)
Look at this damage on the molding.
That looks like forced entry.
Yeah, it does.
But when would that have taken place?
Is it possible that somebody other than Neal killed this girl?
Or that's what he wants us to think.
Let's do a full process and see where that takes us, okay?
Dr. Loman.
Looks like our poor lady sustained a broken neck at C-3.
Spinal cord was severed;
death was instantaneous.
How could that have happened?
She fell.
Significant damage to the back of her head, damage to the occipital bone along the lamboid suture.
And what about the bruising on her chest and under the eye?
That bruise and this welt under that eye lead me to believe this fall was no accident.
It looks like she's been in a fight.
Evidence seems to indicate.
And the tattoo on the hand.
Hm.
Oh.
Chinese symbol for "long life."
Pity she was denied one.
She was covering it with body makeup.
She also has...
tinted contacts.
And her hair was dyed.
She's attempting to conceal her identity.
Now, why would she do that?
(beeping)
(beeping)
Hey, Natalia, did you run the DNA on our new vic?
I did, but Olivia Hunter didn't show up in any database anywhere.
Yeah, but when I ran her prints, she matched this girl in AFIS.
Lisa Blackhall?
Uh-huh.
Olivia Hunter's real name, in the system for DUI.
Wait-wait, so Lisa was pretending to be Olivia Hunter?
Exactly.
And since Olivia Hunter doesn't really exist, I wondered how she charged a hotel room where she and Neal were hiding out.
And?
Turns out she used a corporate credit card issued by Silas BioTech.
Now, you were there, right?
I was there, and they lied to me, because I just talked to Dade General, and they told me that the misappropriated cadaver was in Silas's custody when it went missing.
See, it's sounding like there is some sort of conspiracy against Neal.
Especially with that whole Lisa-slash-Olivia.
She had to have been part of it, right?
You know what,
I'm gonna go grab Horatio and head back to Silas now.
BOA VISTA:
Thank you.
Hora...
Horatio, I was here.
Right here.
(echoes):
Hello?
This was a working office.
There was...
a reception desk, there was... workers coming out of this back room.

I do not like to be made a fool of.
I know.
Hey, can you put in a search term?
Yeah, sure.
What are you thinking?
Olivia Hunter rented that hotel room with a Silas BioTech corporate card.
Okay.
So if Silas doesn't exist, it really is a front.
Then who's actually paying that bill?
I see where you're going.
Okay, here's the credit card number that I have-- so let's just search through the documents we've already scanned.
That account number's coming up several times.
Yeah.
The billing statements for that account were also being mailed to an office suite out by Miami International.

I'm afraid so.
You do know it's illegal to be planting cadavers and wasting our time, right?
Well, you can discuss that with my fleet of lawyers.

No, I swear.

She came up in the investigation.
God.
Look... all we know is that your husband is involved in something very dangerous, and I need your help.
You've got to tell me anything you possibly know that could help us figure out what.
I...
I don't know if it means anything, but Neal's been having some problems at work.
What kind of problems?
They lost an account, a big one, and I think his brother Dean blamed Neal for it.
Could his brother be involved?
I don't know.
I just want Neal back home.
Please find my husband.
Please.
Thank you for your help, Mrs. Marshall.
You can go home for now.
Got your text.
There's an anomaly with the victim found in Neal Marshall's trunk.
This body's temp-- it doesn't seem possible, but it's actually warming up.
What are you saying?
This man has been dead for several days.
So, he can't be our victim from the bar.
Couldn't have been.
A corpse normally loses two degrees of body heat the first hour after death, and another degree each hour after that.
So, by that calculation, he should be approximately 87 degrees.
Precisely, and this body temp is only 62.
So he started too low.
Are we saying he was frozen?
Or held in some sort of cold storage.
Take a look at the knife wound.
There should be perimortem bruising, but there isn't.
I think it's a medical cadaver.
Who found his way into the trunk of our suspect's car.
Right.
Now, this incision is recent.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What is that, Doctor?
It's an RFID chip.
Some medical facilities have started putting them in their cadavers so they can keep track of them.
Then the question becomes, who is this?
I just heard what happened to you in the elevator.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just...
I'm getting nowhere with this remote control switch.
So, whoever rigged it must have been wearing a body glove, because it's totally clean.
Hey, do you have the RFID reader in here?
Yeah.
Where did you get an RFID chip?
It was in our victim.
Well, actually, it's not even our victim anymore.
What?
The body that we found in the trunk-- it's a medical cadaver.
So our real victim's body is still missing?
Yes, and so is Neal.
We have surveillance at his house, but he hasn't come home yet.
Okay, so we got a missing body, a planted cadaver...
A phantom crime scene.
And a rigged elevator.
What the hell is going on?
(beep) Here we go.
The cadaver's name is Jason Norris.
Died of a myocardial infarction four days ago.
Donated his body to Silas BioTech.
I'm gonna ask Boa Vista to go by Silas BioTech.
Maybe she can get some answers.
(echoes):
Hello?
Oh, I am so sorry.
We are celebrating Celeste's birthday today.
I need to speak to the person in charge of your research cadavers.
Oh, well, that-that'd be my boss, but he's out.
That's why we're having the party now.
He does not like to have fun on the clock.
Well, unfortunately, he's probably not gonna like this, either.
We found one of your research cadavers at a crime scene.
Pulled this off the RFID chip.
Oh.
Mr. Norris.
Oh.
Okay, um... let's see here.
Hi.
Alisha, could you bring me, uh, the file on Jason Norris, please?
All right.
Did you know that he was missing?
Uh, actually, Mr. Norris was reported misappropriated two days ago.
How does a body become misappropriated?
Oh, there's lots of money on the black market for body parts.
Thank you.
We-We do everything we can to prevent it, but...
Did you file a police report?
We hadn't officially determined, uh, if Mr. Norris was stolen or just misplaced.
There was an inventory audit in mid-process.
Can you show me where you had his body stored?
Oh, he never arrived.
The body went missing during transport from Dade General, so... you might want to follow up with them.
I will.
Thank you.
All right.
(phone ringing)
Hello.
DUQUESNE:
Neal Marshall just called in to MDPD.
He's on the phone with Horatio right now.
We need you to come back.
I'm on my way.
Neal, listen to me.
Come in, and we'll work it out.
Why is this happening?
What is happening, Neal?
I didn't kill her.
I woke up, and she was dead.
Who's dead, Neal?
Is it Olivia Hunter?
I didn't want to get her mixed up in all this.
She said people must be after me, people who want to kill me.
Okay, Neal, why would they target you?
I'm an accountant.
Maybe I saw something.
Some financial statement I wasn't supposed to see.
I don't know!
Okay.
Where are you, Neal?
I can't trust you.
I can't trust anyone.
Neal?
(phone beeps off)
I got a location.
He's at the Brio Hotel on Thornton Avenue.
Don't forget to send backup.
On their way.

Eric.
I got the room key.
They checked in under the waitress's name.
It's clear.
She's gone.
DELKO:
I don't get this guy.
The victim at the bar, and now her.
I don't know what he's trying to do.
I don't either, Eric.
(garbled radio transmission, camera shutter clicking)
Look at this damage on the molding.
That looks like forced entry.
Yeah, it does.
But when would that have taken place?
Is it possible that somebody other than Neal killed this girl?
Or that's what he wants us to think.
Let's do a full process and see where that takes us, okay?
Dr. Loman.
Looks like our poor lady sustained a broken neck at C-3.
Spinal cord was severed;
death was instantaneous.
How could that have happened?
She fell.
Significant damage to the back of her head, damage to the occipital bone along the lamboid suture.
And what about the bruising on her chest and under the eye?
That bruise and this welt under that eye lead me to believe this fall was no accident.
It looks like she's been in a fight.
Evidence seems to indicate.
And the tattoo on the hand.
Hm.
Oh.
Chinese symbol for "long life."
Pity she was denied one.
She was covering it with body makeup.
She also has...
tinted contacts.
And her hair was dyed.
She's attempting to conceal her identity.
Now, why would she do that?
(beeping)
(beeping)
Hey, Natalia, did you run the DNA on our new vic?
I did, but Olivia Hunter didn't show up in any database anywhere.
Yeah, but when I ran her prints, she matched this girl in AFIS.
Lisa Blackhall?
Uh-huh.
Olivia Hunter's real name, in the system for DUI.
Wait-wait, so Lisa was pretending to be Olivia Hunter?
Exactly.
And since Olivia Hunter doesn't really exist, I wondered how she charged a hotel room where she and Neal were hiding out.
And?
Turns out she used a corporate credit card issued by Silas BioTech.
Now, you were there, right?
I was there, and they lied to me, because I just talked to Dade General, and they told me that the misappropriated cadaver was in Silas's custody when it went missing.
See, it's sounding like there is some sort of conspiracy against Neal.
Especially with that whole Lisa-slash-Olivia.
She had to have been part of it, right?
You know what,
I'm gonna go grab Horatio and head back to Silas now.
BOA VISTA:
Thank you.
Hora...
Horatio, I was here.
Right here.
(echoes):
Hello?
This was a working office.
There was...
a reception desk, there was... workers coming out of this back room.
I'm so sorry.

I do not like to be made a fool of.
I know.
Hey, can you put in a search term?
Yeah, sure.
What are you thinking?
Olivia Hunter rented that hotel room with a Silas BioTech corporate card.
Okay.
So if Silas doesn't exist, it really is a front.
Then who's actually paying that bill?
I see where you're going.
Okay, here's the credit card number that I have-- so let's just search through the documents we've already scanned.
That account number's coming up several times.
Yeah.
The billing statements for that account were also being mailed to an office suite out by Miami International.
I'll go check it out.

And everybody here was in on it?
I'm afraid so.
You do know it's illegal to be planting cadavers and wasting our time, right?
Well, you can discuss that with my fleet of lawyers.

So, Dean, did the game include murder?
No, I swear.

They lost an account, a big one, and I think his brother Dean blamed Neal for it.
Could his brother be involved?
I don't know.
I just want Neal back home.
Please find my husband.
Please.
Thank you for your help, Mrs. Marshall.
You can go home for now.
Got your text.
There's an anomaly with the victim found in Neal Marshall's trunk.
This body's temp-- it doesn't seem possible, but it's actually warming up.
What are you saying?
This man has been dead for several days.
So, he can't be our victim from the bar.
Couldn't have been.
A corpse normally loses two degrees of body heat the first hour after death, and another degree each hour after that.
So, by that calculation, he should be approximately 87 degrees.
Precisely, and this body temp is only 62.
So he started too low.
Are we saying he was frozen?
Or held in some sort of cold storage.
Take a look at the knife wound.
There should be perimortem bruising, but there isn't.
I think it's a medical cadaver.
Who found his way into the trunk of our suspect's car.
Right.
Now, this incision is recent.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What is that, Doctor?
It's an RFID chip.
Some medical facilities have started putting them in their cadavers so they can keep track of them.
Then the question becomes, who is this?
I just heard what happened to you in the elevator.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just...
I'm getting nowhere with this remote control switch.
So, whoever rigged it must have been wearing a body glove, because it's totally clean.
Hey, do you have the RFID reader in here?
Yeah.
Where did you get an RFID chip?
It was in our victim.
Well, actually, it's not even our victim anymore.
What?
The body that we found in the trunk-- it's a medical cadaver.
So our real victim's body is still missing?
Yes, and so is Neal.
We have surveillance at his house, but he hasn't come home yet.
Okay, so we got a missing body, a planted cadaver...
A phantom crime scene.
And a rigged elevator.
What the hell is going on?
(beep) Here we go.
The cadaver's name is Jason Norris.
Died of a myocardial infarction four days ago.
Donated his body to Silas BioTech.
I'm gonna ask Boa Vista to go by Silas BioTech.
Maybe she can get some answers.
(echoes):
Hello?
Oh, I am so sorry.
We are celebrating Celeste's birthday today.
I need to speak to the person in charge of your research cadavers.
Oh, well, that-that'd be my boss, but he's out.
That's why we're having the party now.
He does not like to have fun on the clock.
Well, unfortunately, he's probably not gonna like this, either.
We found one of your research cadavers at a crime scene.
Pulled this off the RFID chip.
Oh.
Mr. Norris.
Oh.
Okay, um... let's see here.
Hi.
Alisha, could you bring me, uh, the file on Jason Norris, please?
All right.
Did you know that he was missing?
Uh, actually, Mr. Norris was reported misappropriated two days ago.
How does a body become misappropriated?
Oh, there's lots of money on the black market for body parts.
Thank you.
We-We do everything we can to prevent it, but...
Did you file a police report?
We hadn't officially determined, uh, if Mr. Norris was stolen or just misplaced.
There was an inventory audit in mid-process.
Can you show me where you had his body stored?
Oh, he never arrived.
The body went missing during transport from Dade General, so... you might want to follow up with them.
I will.
Thank you.
All right.
(phone ringing)
Hello.
DUQUESNE:
Neal Marshall just called in to MDPD.
He's on the phone with Horatio right now.
We need you to come back.
I'm on my way.
Neal, listen to me.
Come in, and we'll work it out.
Why is this happening?
What is happening, Neal?
I didn't kill her.
I woke up, and she was dead.
Who's dead, Neal?
Is it Olivia Hunter?
I didn't want to get her mixed up in all this.
She said people must be after me, people who want to kill me.
Okay, Neal, why would they target you?
I'm an accountant.
Maybe I saw something.
Some financial statement I wasn't supposed to see.
I don't know!
Okay.
Where are you, Neal?
I can't trust you.
I can't trust anyone.
Neal?
(phone beeps off)
I got a location.
He's at the Brio Hotel on Thornton Avenue.
Don't forget to send backup.
On their way.

Eric.
I got the room key.
They checked in under the waitress's name.
It's clear.
She's gone.
DELKO:
I don't get this guy.
The victim at the bar, and now her.
I don't know what he's trying to do.
I don't either, Eric.
(garbled radio transmission, camera shutter clicking)
Look at this damage on the molding.
That looks like forced entry.
Yeah, it does.
But when would that have taken place?
Is it possible that somebody other than Neal killed this girl?
Or that's what he wants us to think.
Let's do a full process and see where that takes us, okay?
Dr. Loman.
Looks like our poor lady sustained a broken neck at C-3.
Spinal cord was severed;
death was instantaneous.
How could that have happened?
She fell.
Significant damage to the back of her head, damage to the occipital bone along the lamboid suture.
And what about the bruising on her chest and under the eye?
That bruise and this welt under that eye lead me to believe this fall was no accident.
It looks like she's been in a fight.
Evidence seems to indicate.
And the tattoo on the hand.
Hm.
Oh.
Chinese symbol for "long life."
Pity she was denied one.
She was covering it with body makeup.
She also has...
tinted contacts.
And her hair was dyed.
She's attempting to conceal her identity.
Now, why would she do that?
(beeping)
(beeping)
Hey, Natalia, did you run the DNA on our new vic?
I did, but Olivia Hunter didn't show up in any database anywhere.
Yeah, but when I ran her prints, she matched this girl in AFIS.
Lisa Blackhall?
Uh-huh.
Olivia Hunter's real name, in the system for DUI.
Wait-wait, so Lisa was pretending to be Olivia Hunter?
Exactly.
And since Olivia Hunter doesn't really exist, I wondered how she charged a hotel room where she and Neal were hiding out.
And?
Turns out she used a corporate credit card issued by Silas BioTech.
Now, you were there, right?
I was there, and they lied to me, because I just talked to Dade General, and they told me that the misappropriated cadaver was in Silas's custody when it went missing.
See, it's sounding like there is some sort of conspiracy against Neal.
Especially with that whole Lisa-slash-Olivia.
She had to have been part of it, right?
You know what,
I'm gonna go grab Horatio and head back to Silas now.
BOA VISTA:
Thank you.
Hora...
Horatio, I was here.
Right here.

Hello?
This was a working office.
There was...

Hey, can you put in a search term?
Yeah, sure.
What are you thinking?
Olivia Hunter rented that hotel room with a Silas BioTech corporate card.
Okay.
So if Silas doesn't exist, it really is a front.
Then who's actually paying that bill?
I see where you're going.
Okay, here's the credit card number that I have-- so let's just search through the documents we've already scanned.
That account number's coming up several times.
Yeah.
The billing statements for that account were also being mailed to an office suite out by Miami International.

You can go home for now.
Got your text.
There's an anomaly with the victim found in Neal Marshall's trunk.
This body's temp-- it doesn't seem possible, but it's actually warming up.
What are you saying?
This man has been dead for several days.
So, he can't be our victim from the bar.
Couldn't have been.
A corpse normally loses two degrees of body heat the first hour after death, and another degree each hour after that.
So, by that calculation, he should be approximately 87 degrees.
Precisely, and this body temp is only 62.
So he started too low.
Are we saying he was frozen?
Or held in some sort of cold storage.
Take a look at the knife wound.
There should be perimortem bruising, but there isn't.
I think it's a medical cadaver.
Who found his way into the trunk of our suspect's car.
Right.
Now, this incision is recent.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What is that, Doctor?
It's an RFID chip.
Some medical facilities have started putting them in their cadavers so they can keep track of them.
Then the question becomes, who is this?
I just heard what happened to you in the elevator.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just...
I'm getting nowhere with this remote control switch.
So, whoever rigged it must have been wearing a body glove, because it's totally clean.
Hey, do you have the RFID reader in here?
Yeah.
Where did you get an RFID chip?
It was in our victim.
Well, actually, it's not even our victim anymore.
What?
The body that we found in the trunk-- it's a medical cadaver.
So our real victim's body is still missing?
Yes, and so is Neal.
We have surveillance at his house, but he hasn't come home yet.
Okay, so we got a missing body, a planted cadaver...
A phantom crime scene.
And a rigged elevator.
What the hell is going on?
Here we go.
The cadaver's name is Jason Norris.
Died of a myocardial infarction four days ago.
Donated his body to Silas BioTech.
I'm gonna ask Boa Vista to go by Silas BioTech.
Maybe she can get some answers.
Hello?
Oh, I am so sorry.
We are celebrating Celeste's birthday today.
I need to speak to the person in charge of your research cadavers.
Oh, well, that-that'd be my boss, but he's out.
That's why we're having the party now.
He does not like to have fun on the clock.
Well, unfortunately, he's probably not gonna like this, either.
We found one of your research cadavers at a crime scene.
Pulled this off the RFID chip.
Oh.
Mr. Norris.
Oh.
Okay, um... let's see here.
Hi.
Alisha, could you bring me, uh, the file on Jason Norris, please?
All right.
Did you know that he was missing?
Uh, actually, Mr. Norris was reported misappropriated two days ago.
How does a body become misappropriated?
Oh, there's lots of money on the black market for body parts.
Thank you.
We-We do everything we can to prevent it, but...
Did you file a police report?
We hadn't officially determined, uh, if Mr. Norris was stolen or just misplaced.
There was an inventory audit in mid-process.
Can you show me where you had his body stored?
Oh, he never arrived.
The body went missing during transport from Dade General, so... you might want to follow up with them.
I will.
Thank you.
All right.
Hello.
Neal Marshall just called in to MDPD.
He's on the phone with Horatio right now.
We need you to come back.
I'm on my way.
Neal, listen to me.
Come in, and we'll work it out.
Why is this happening?
What is happening, Neal?
I didn't kill her.
I woke up, and she was dead.
Who's dead, Neal?
Is it Olivia Hunter?
I didn't want to get her mixed up in all this.
She said people must be after me, people who want to kill me.
Okay, Neal, why would they target you?
I'm an accountant.
Maybe I saw something.
Some financial statement I wasn't supposed to see.
I don't know!
Okay.
Where are you, Neal?
I can't trust you.
I can't trust anyone.
Neal?
I got a location.
He's at the Brio Hotel on Thornton Avenue.
Don't forget to send backup.
On their way.
Eric.
I got the room key.
They checked in under the waitress's name.
It's clear.
She's gone.
I don't get this guy.
The victim at the bar, and now her.
I don't know what he's trying to do.
I don't either, Eric.
Look at this damage on the molding.
That looks like forced entry.
Yeah, it does.
But when would that have taken place?
Is it possible that somebody other than Neal killed this girl?
Or that's what he wants us to think.
Let's do a full process and see where that takes us, okay?
Dr. Loman.
Looks like our poor lady sustained a broken neck at C-3.
Spinal cord was severed;
death was instantaneous.
How could that have happened?
She fell.
Significant damage to the back of her head, damage to the occipital bone along the lamboid suture.
And what about the bruising on her chest and under the eye?
That bruise and this welt under that eye lead me to believe this fall was no accident.
It looks like she's been in a fight.
Evidence seems to indicate.
And the tattoo on the hand.
Hm.
Oh.
Chinese symbol for "long life."
Pity she was denied one.
She was covering it with body makeup.
She also has...
tinted contacts.
And her hair was dyed.
She's attempting to conceal her identity.
Now, why would she do that?
Hey, Natalia, did you run the DNA on our new vic?
I did, but Olivia Hunter didn't show up in any database anywhere.
Yeah, but when I ran her prints, she matched this girl in AFIS.
Lisa Blackhall?
Uh-huh.
Olivia Hunter's real name, in the system for DUI.
Wait-wait, so Lisa was pretending to be Olivia Hunter?
Exactly.
And since Olivia Hunter doesn't really exist, I wondered how she charged a hotel room where she and Neal were hiding out.
And?
Turns out she used a corporate credit card issued by Silas BioTech.
Now, you were there, right?
I was there, and they lied to me, because I just talked to Dade General, and they told me that the misappropriated cadaver was in Silas's custody when it went missing.
See, it's sounding like there is some sort of conspiracy against Neal.
Especially with that whole Lisa-slash-Olivia.
She had to have been part of it, right?
You know what,
I'm gonna go grab Horatio and head back to Silas now.
Thank you.
Hora...
Horatio, I was here.
Right here.
Hello?
This was a working office.
There was...
a reception desk, there was... workers coming out of this back room.
I'm so sorry.
We are celebrating Celeste's birthday today.
This is crazy.
I mean, they completely stripped the place.
There's nothing here.
I don't get it.
Let's get a team here to go over this place.
Horatio, wait a minute.
There's something in here.
I'm not crazy.
I'm not cra...

He does not like to have fun on the clock.
I'm gonna take all these documents and try to get them reconstructed back at the lab.

I thought this software was supposed to make reconstructing documents easier.
It's searching for patterns and repeated text, but... with all of this...

Hey, we're working as fast as we can.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Look, it's just that I've got to figure out what the heck is going on here.
I do not like to be made a fool of.
I know.
Hey, can you put in a search term?
Yeah, sure.
What are you thinking?
Olivia Hunter rented that hotel room with a Silas BioTech corporate card.
Okay.
So if Silas doesn't exist, it really is a front.
Then who's actually paying that bill?
I see where you're going.
Okay, here's the credit card number that I have-- so let's just search through the documents we've already scanned.
That account number's coming up several times.
Yeah.
The billing statements for that account were also being mailed to an office suite out by Miami International.
I'll go check it out.
Yeah, sure.
Don't mention it.

I'm not your buddy.
As you can see, he's alive and well.
There was no murder.
So we know how the dead body got out of the men's room; it walked out.
And everybody here was in on it?
I'm afraid so.
You do know it's illegal to be planting cadavers and wasting our time, right?
Well, you can discuss that with my fleet of lawyers.
We have a young lady who's lying dead in the morgue.
Who?
Her name is Lisa Blackhall, a.k.a. Olivia Hunter.
Um... could we please discuss this in private?
She's gone.
When was the last time you talked to Lisa?
Well, she was off the grid for a couple hours, but that happens sometimes-

He doesn't know anything.
Explain it to him, Dean.
Okay, he's right.

That's exactly what Dean's going to do right now.
Aren't you, Dean?
What, do you know something, Dean?
Tell me.
Tell me!
Look where we are.
A woman is dead.
Why would you do this?
No one was supposed to die.
I was framed for murder.
I did it for you, for us.
For us?
I needed to get you out of your comfort zone.
My brother is a coward.
We can take his whole world and tilt it.
We'll strip him of everything he has and take him on a classic hero's journey.

It'll be money well spent.
Why?
I was happy.
It was killing our firm.
This is about money?
This is about the Dunlevy account?
I had them.
They were going to invest millions until you told them that it wasn't prudent.
I gave them a risk assessment.
You gave them an accurate risk assessment.
Who does that?
We lost them, how many others?
I needed you to man up.
I was actually starting to believe your crap about how
I needed to loosen up, have fun, but you know what I learned from all this?
What?
That I love my wife and kids and I want to be with them more than anything else, and that makes me more of a man than you'll ever be.
Gentlemen.
So, Dean, did the game include murder?
No, I swear.
This was all just supposed to be pretend.
I didn't kill her.
Who did?
I have no idea.
She called me from the hotel, she was pretty worried.
Did Neal just call you?
No, is he okay?
Well, he's freaking out just like he's supposed to.
So what's the problem?
I've kept him off his cell, but I just caught him talking to somebody.
He didn't call you?
No.
If he compromised the game, it could be dangerous.
I got to go.
I don't remember making a call.
That's because you were drugged, Neal.
That's the last I heard from Lisa.
Could I have your cell phone, please?
You did make a call, Neal, just preceding the murder.
He called me?
I must have missed it.
It's okay.
You're lying, Mrs. Marshall.
Pardon?
Can we see your left shoulder, please?
What?
Why?
Why are you doing that?
Because you were at the hotel, and you forced your way into your husband's room, didn't you?
I knew Dean wanted you to go to bars, to see other women...
Jenny, I never did any...
You were tempted.
I could tell.
So you did get that phone call from the hotel?
Yes.
Jenny, I don't think you're safe.
I need you to get the girls and go to your mother's.
Neal, what's going on?
The police said you were fighting over some woman, that you killed a man.
No, I didn't kill anyone.
You sound strange.
Where are you?
Jenny, please,
I'm at the Brio Hotel, but I think I'm being followed.

Who the hell are you?
Where's my husband?
I never thought that Neal would get blamed.
I just got out of there.
How could I know that it was only a game?
For me it was very real.
There was Neal with another woman.
I'm sorry that I ever gave you reason to believe that I would do that.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
We have to go.
Please, no, there has to be a way.
Tell the girls I love them, okay?
Can you do that?
Please.
Can't you do something?
It's not her fault.
Please, it's the game.

Do you know who Olivia Hunter is?
No.
Who is she?
She came up in the investigation.

Look... all we know is that your husband is involved in something very dangerous, and I need your help.
You've got to tell me anything you possibly know that could help us figure out what.
I...
I don't know if it means anything, but Neal's been having some problems at work.
What kind of problems?
They lost an account, a big one, and I think his brother Dean blamed Neal for it.
Could his brother be involved?
I don't know.
I just want Neal back home.
Please find my husband.
Please.
Thank you for your help, Mrs. Marshall.
You can go home for now.
Got your text.
There's an anomaly with the victim found in Neal Marshall's trunk.
This body's temp-- it doesn't seem possible, but it's actually warming up.
What are you saying?
This man has been dead for several days.
So, he can't be our victim from the bar.
Couldn't have been.
A corpse normally loses two degrees of body heat the first hour after death, and another degree each hour after that.
So, by that calculation, he should be approximately 87 degrees.
Precisely, and this body temp is only 62.
So he started too low.
Are we saying he was frozen?
Or held in some sort of cold storage.
Take a look at the knife wound.
There should be perimortem bruising, but there isn't.
I think it's a medical cadaver.
Who found his way into the trunk of our suspect's car.
Right.
Now, this incision is recent.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What is that, Doctor?
It's an RFID chip.
Some medical facilities have started putting them in their cadavers so they can keep track of them.
Then the question becomes, who is this?
I just heard what happened to you in the elevator.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just...
I'm getting nowhere with this remote control switch.
So, whoever rigged it must have been wearing a body glove, because it's totally clean.
Hey, do you have the RFID reader in here?
Yeah.
Where did you get an RFID chip?
It was in our victim.
Well, actually, it's not even our victim anymore.
What?
The body that we found in the trunk-- it's a medical cadaver.
So our real victim's body is still missing?
Yes, and so is Neal.
We have surveillance at his house, but he hasn't come home yet.
Okay, so we got a missing body, a planted cadaver...
A phantom crime scene.
And a rigged elevator.

Okay, um... let's see here.
Hi.
Alisha, could you bring me, uh, the file on Jason Norris, please?
All right.
Did you know that he was missing?
Uh, actually, Mr. Norris was reported misappropriated two days ago.
How does a body become misappropriated?
Oh, there's lots of money on the black market for body parts.
Thank you.
We-We do everything we can to prevent it, but...
Did you file a police report?
We hadn't officially determined, uh, if Mr. Norris was stolen or just misplaced.
There was an inventory audit in mid-process.
Can you show me where you had his body stored?
Oh, he never arrived.
The body went missing during transport from Dade General, so... you might want to follow up with them.
I will.
Thank you.
All right.
Hello.
Neal Marshall just called in to MDPD.
He's on the phone with Horatio right now.
We need you to come back.
I'm on my way.
Neal, listen to me.
Come in, and we'll work it out.
Why is this happening?
What is happening, Neal?
I didn't kill her.
I woke up, and she was dead.
Who's dead, Neal?
Is it Olivia Hunter?
I didn't want to get her mixed up in all this.
She said people must be after me, people who want to kill me.
Okay, Neal, why would they target you?
I'm an accountant.
Maybe I saw something.
Some financial statement I wasn't supposed to see.
I don't know!
Okay.
Where are you, Neal?
I can't trust you.
I can't trust anyone.
Neal?
I got a location.
He's at the Brio Hotel on Thornton Avenue.
Don't forget to send backup.
On their way.
Eric.
I got the room key.
They checked in under the waitress's name.
It's clear.
She's gone.
I don't get this guy.
The victim at the bar, and now her.
I don't know what he's trying to do.
I don't either, Eric.
Look at this damage on the molding.
That looks like forced entry.
Yeah, it does.
But when would that have taken place?
Is it possible that somebody other than Neal killed this girl?
Or that's what he wants us to think.
Let's do a full process and see where that takes us, okay?
Dr. Loman.
Looks like our poor lady sustained a broken neck at C-3.
Spinal cord was severed;
death was instantaneous.
How could that have happened?
She fell.
Significant damage to the back of her head, damage to the occipital bone along the lamboid suture.
And what about the bruising on her chest and under the eye?
That bruise and this welt under that eye lead me to believe this fall was no accident.
It looks like she's been in a fight.
Evidence seems to indicate.
And the tattoo on the hand.
Hm.
Oh.
Chinese symbol for "long life."
Pity she was denied one.
She was covering it with body makeup.
She also has...
tinted contacts.
And her hair was dyed.
She's attempting to conceal her identity.
Now, why would she do that?
Hey, Natalia, did you run the DNA on our new vic?
I did, but Olivia Hunter didn't show up in any database anywhere.
Yeah, but when I ran her prints, she matched this girl in AFIS.
Lisa Blackhall?
Uh-huh.
Olivia Hunter's real name, in the system for DUI.
Wait-wait, so Lisa was pretending to be Olivia Hunter?
Exactly.
And since Olivia Hunter doesn't really exist, I wondered how she charged a hotel room where she and Neal were hiding out.
And?
Turns out she used a corporate credit card issued by Silas BioTech.
Now, you were there, right?
I was there, and they lied to me, because I just talked to Dade General, and they told me that the misappropriated cadaver was in Silas's custody when it went missing.
See, it's sounding like there is some sort of conspiracy against Neal.
Especially with that whole Lisa-slash-Olivia.
She had to have been part of it, right?
You know what,
I'm gonna go grab Horatio and head back to Silas now.
BOA VISTA:
Thank you.
Hora...
Horatio, I was here.
Right here.
Hello?
This was a working office.
There was...
a reception desk, there was... workers coming out of this back room.
I'm so sorry.
We are celebrating Celeste's birthday today.
BOA VISTA:
This is crazy.
I mean, they completely stripped the place.
There's nothing here.
I don't get it.
Let's get a team here to go over this place.
Horatio, wait a minute.
There's something in here.
I'm not crazy.
I'm not cra...

I'm gonna take all these documents and try to get them reconstructed back at the lab.

I thought this software was supposed to make reconstructing documents easier.
It's searching for patterns and repeated text, but... with all of this...

Hey, we're working as fast as we can.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Look, it's just that I've got to figure out what the heck is going on here.
I do not like to be made a fool of.
I know.
Hey, can you put in a search term?
Yeah, sure.
What are you thinking?
Olivia Hunter rented that hotel room with a Silas BioTech corporate card.
Okay.
So if Silas doesn't exist, it really is a front.
Then who's actually paying that bill?
I see where you're going.
Okay, here's the credit card number that I have-- so let's just search through the documents we've already scanned.
That account number's coming up several times.
Yeah.
The billing statements for that account were also being mailed to an office suite out by Miami International.
I'll go check it out.
Yeah, sure.
Don't mention it.

Ladies and gentlemen, could I have you all stand against the wall, please?
Whoa, whoa.
Excuse me.
I think I can help here.
This is the lady from before.
She's from Silas BioTech.
Mr. Norris was reported misappropriated two days ago.
Actually, I'm sorry, I was not completely honest with you before.
I am Wendy Colton.
I am the CEO of L.I.V.E. Corporation.
Nice to meet you.
If you are investigating the murder at Bar 212,
I think I can ease your minds.
This is Braden Wilkinson.
Hello.
And, uh, he was the man who fought with Neal Marshall at the bar.
I'm not your buddy.
As you can see, he's alive and well.
There was no murder.
So we know how the dead body got out of the men's room; it walked out.
And everybody here was in on it?
I'm afraid so.
You do know it's illegal to be planting cadavers and wasting our time, right?
Well, you can discuss that with my fleet of lawyers.
We have a young lady who's lying dead in the morgue.
Who?
Her name is Lisa Blackhall, a.k.a. Olivia Hunter.
Um... could we please discuss this in private?
She's gone.
When was the last time you talked to Lisa?
Well, she was off the grid for a couple hours, but that happens sometimes-

What exactly do you do here?
We solved the problem of virtual reality.
We make it real.

No.
He had no idea what was going on.
His game was a gift.

Contractually, I can't say.
Consider the contract null and void.
We're talking about one of your employees here.
That's fine, we'll just get a warrant.

This is a mistake.
Wouldn't be my first one today.
But it'll be your last.

This is just a game.

Please, baby, I don't want to see you get hurt.
Neal, look, you're taking this way too far.
You're innocent, we can prove that.
Put the gun down.
Listen to what he says.
Your brother knows what he's talking about.
He doesn't know anything.
Explain it to him, Dean.
Okay, he's right.
Look, none of this is real.

I just want my life back.
You'll get it back, but you've got to put that gun down first.
I can't trust you.
I'm all you've got right now.
Look, please, the gun is not loaded, so don't, don't shoot him, please.
I keep this gun loaded, Dean.
How did you know that?
How did you know it wasn't loaded?
It's always loaded.
D-Did you take the bullets out?
Would somebody explain to me what's going on?
That's exactly what Dean's going to do right now.
Aren't you, Dean?
What, do you know something, Dean?
Tell me.
Tell me!
Look where we are.
A woman is dead.
Why would you do this?
No one was supposed to die.
I was framed for murder.
I did it for you, for us.
For us?
I needed to get you out of your comfort zone.
My brother is a coward.
We can take his whole world and tilt it.
We'll strip him of everything he has and take him on a classic hero's journey.
Once he succeeds in overcoming the worst we can throw at him, he'll come out of the game with a new confidence, afraid of nothing.
This is very... expensive.
It'll be money well spent.
Why?
I was happy.
It was killing our firm.
This is about money?
This is about the Dunlevy account?
I had them.
They were going to invest millions until you told them that it wasn't prudent.
I gave them a risk assessment.
You gave them an accurate risk assessment.
Who does that?
We lost them, how many others?
I needed you to man up.
I was actually starting to believe your crap about how
I needed to loosen up, have fun, but you know what I learned from all this?
What?
That I love my wife and kids and I want to be with them more than anything else, and that makes me more of a man than you'll ever be.
Gentlemen.
So, Dean, did the game include murder?
No, I swear.
This was all just supposed to be pretend.
I didn't kill her.
Who did?
I have no idea.
She called me from the hotel, she was pretty worried.
Did Neal just call you?
No, is he okay?
Well, he's freaking out just like he's supposed to.
So what's the problem?
I've kept him off his cell, but I just caught him talking to somebody.
He didn't call you?
No.
If he compromised the game, it could be dangerous.
I got to go.
I don't remember making a call.
That's because you were drugged, Neal.
That's the last I heard from Lisa.
Could I have your cell phone, please?
You did make a call, Neal, just preceding the murder.
He called me?
I must have missed it.
It's okay.
You're lying, Mrs. Marshall.
Pardon?
Can we see your left shoulder, please?
What?
Why?
Why are you doing that?
Because you were at the hotel, and you forced your way into your husband's room, didn't you?
I knew Dean wanted you to go to bars, to see other women...
Jenny, I never did any...
You were tempted.
I could tell.
So you did get that phone call from the hotel?
Yes.
Jenny, I don't think you're safe.
I need you to get the girls and go to your mother's.
Neal, what's going on?
The police said you were fighting over some woman, that you killed a man.
No, I didn't kill anyone.
You sound strange.
Where are you?
Jenny, please,
I'm at the Brio Hotel, but I think I'm being followed.
It's not safe.
OLIVIA:
Neal?
Who are you talking to?
Are you alone?
Just do what I said.
Get the girls and go to your mother's now.
I went to the hotel.
I wasn't sure what I would find.
Can I help you?
Who the hell are you?
Where's my husband?
I never thought that Neal would get blamed.
I just got out of there.
How could I know that it was only a game?
For me it was very real.
There was Neal with another woman.
I'm sorry that I ever gave you reason to believe that I would do that.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
We have to go.
Please, no, there has to be a way.
Tell the girls I love them, okay?
Can you do that?
Please.
Can't you do something?
It's not her fault.
Please, it's the game.
I'm sorry, she killed someone.
She's looking at manslaughter.

Please tell me this isn't real.

Could his brother be involved?
I don't know.
I just want Neal back home.
Please find my husband.
Please.
Thank you for your help, Mrs. Marshall.
You can go home for now.
Got your text.
There's an anomaly with the victim found in Neal Marshall's trunk.
This body's temp-- it doesn't seem possible, but it's actually warming up.
What are you saying?
This man has been dead for several days.
So, he can't be our victim from the bar.
Couldn't have been.
A corpse normally loses two degrees of body heat the first hour after death, and another degree each hour after that.
So, by that calculation, he should be approximately 87 degrees.
Precisely, and this body temp is only 62.
So he started too low.
Are we saying he was frozen?
Or held in some sort of cold storage.
Take a look at the knife wound.
There should be perimortem bruising, but there isn't.
I think it's a medical cadaver.
Who found his way into the trunk of our suspect's car.
Right.
Now, this incision is recent.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What is that, Doctor?
It's an RFID chip.
Some medical facilities have started putting them in their cadavers so they can keep track of them.
Then the question becomes, who is this?
I just heard what happened to you in the elevator.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just...
I'm getting nowhere with this remote control switch.
So, whoever rigged it must have been wearing a body glove, because it's totally clean.
Hey, do you have the RFID reader in here?
Yeah.
Where did you get an RFID chip?
It was in our victim.
Well, actually, it's not even our victim anymore.
What?
The body that we found in the trunk-- it's a medical cadaver.
So our real victim's body is still missing?
Yes, and so is Neal.
We have surveillance at his house, but he hasn't come home yet.
Okay, so we got a missing body, a planted cadaver...
A phantom crime scene.
And a rigged elevator.
What the hell is going on?
(beep) Here we go.
The cadaver's name is Jason Norris.
Died of a myocardial infarction four days ago.
Donated his body to Silas BioTech.

Oh, there's lots of money on the black market for body parts.
Thank you.
We-We do everything we can to prevent it, but...
Did you file a police report?

Oh, he never arrived.

What is happening, Neal?
I didn't kill her.
I woke up, and she was dead.
Who's dead, Neal?
Is it Olivia Hunter?
I didn't want to get her mixed up in all this.
She said people must be after me, people who want to kill me.
Okay, Neal, why would they target you?
I'm an accountant.
Maybe I saw something.
Some financial statement I wasn't supposed to see.
I don't know!
Okay.
Where are you, Neal?
I can't trust you.
I can't trust anyone.
Neal?
(phone beeps off)
I got a location.
He's at the Brio Hotel on Thornton Avenue.
Don't forget to send backup.
On their way.
(sirens blaring)
(garbled radio transmission)
Eric.
I got the room key.
They checked in under the waitress's name.
It's clear.
She's gone.
DELKO:
I don't get this guy.
The victim at the bar, and now her.
I don't know what he's trying to do.
I don't either, Eric.
(garbled radio transmission, camera shutter clicking)
Look at this damage on the molding.
That looks like forced entry.
Yeah, it does.
But when would that have taken place?
Is it possible that somebody other than Neal killed this girl?
Or that's what he wants us to think.
Let's do a full process and see where that takes us, okay?
Dr. Loman.
Looks like our poor lady sustained a broken neck at C-3.
Spinal cord was severed;
death was instantaneous.
How could that have happened?
She fell.
Significant damage to the back of her head, damage to the occipital bone along the lamboid suture.
And what about the bruising on her chest and under the eye?
That bruise and this welt under that eye lead me to believe this fall was no accident.
It looks like she's been in a fight.
Evidence seems to indicate.
And the tattoo on the hand.
Hm.
Oh.
Chinese symbol for "long life."
Pity she was denied one.
She was covering it with body makeup.
She also has...
tinted contacts.
And her hair was dyed.
She's attempting to conceal her identity.
Now, why would she do that?
(beeping)
(beeping)
Hey, Natalia, did you run the DNA on our new vic?
I did, but Olivia Hunter didn't show up in any database anywhere.
Yeah, but when I ran her prints, she matched this girl in AFIS.
Lisa Blackhall?
Uh-huh.
Olivia Hunter's real name, in the system for DUI.
Wait-wait, so Lisa was pretending to be Olivia Hunter?
Exactly.
And since Olivia Hunter doesn't really exist, I wondered how she charged a hotel room where she and Neal were hiding out.
And?
Turns out she used a corporate credit card issued by Silas BioTech.
Now, you were there, right?
I was there, and they lied to me, because I just talked to Dade General, and they told me that the misappropriated cadaver was in Silas's custody when it went missing.
See, it's sounding like there is some sort of conspiracy against Neal.
Especially with that whole Lisa-slash-Olivia.
She had to have been part of it, right?
You know what,
I'm gonna go grab Horatio and head back to Silas now.
BOA VISTA:
Thank you.
Hora...
Horatio, I was here.
Right here.

Hello?
This was a working office.
There was...

I do not like to be made a fool of.
I know.
Hey, can you put in a search term?
Yeah, sure.
What are you thinking?
Olivia Hunter rented that hotel room with a Silas BioTech corporate card.
Okay.
So if Silas doesn't exist, it really is a front.
Then who's actually paying that bill?
I see where you're going.
Okay, here's the credit card number that I have-- so let's just search through the documents we've already scanned.
That account number's coming up several times.
Yeah.
The billing statements for that account were also being mailed to an office suite out by Miami International.
I'll go check it out.
Yeah, sure.
Don't mention it.

As you can see, he's alive and well.
There was no murder.
So we know how the dead body got out of the men's room; it walked out.
And everybody here was in on it?
I'm afraid so.
You do know it's illegal to be planting cadavers and wasting our time, right?
Well, you can discuss that with my fleet of lawyers.
We have a young lady who's lying dead in the morgue.
Who?
Her name is Lisa Blackhall, a.k.a. Olivia Hunter.
Um... could we please discuss this in private?
She's gone.
When was the last time you talked to Lisa?
Well, she was off the grid for a couple hours, but that happens sometimes-

Gentlemen.
So, Dean, did the game include murder?
No, I swear.
This was all just supposed to be pretend.
I didn't kill her.
Who did?
I have no idea.
She called me from the hotel, she was pretty worried.
Did Neal just call you?
No, is he okay?
Well, he's freaking out just like he's supposed to.
So what's the problem?
I've kept him off his cell, but I just caught him talking to somebody.
He didn't call you?
No.
If he compromised the game, it could be dangerous.

I don't know if it means anything, but Neal's been having some problems at work.
What kind of problems?
They lost an account, a big one, and I think his brother Dean blamed Neal for it.
Could his brother be involved?
I don't know.
I just want Neal back home.
Please find my husband.
Please.
Thank you for your help, Mrs. Marshall.
You can go home for now.
Got your text.
There's an anomaly with the victim found in Neal Marshall's trunk.
This body's temp-- it doesn't seem possible, but it's actually warming up.
What are you saying?
This man has been dead for several days.
So, he can't be our victim from the bar.
Couldn't have been.
A corpse normally loses two degrees of body heat the first hour after death, and another degree each hour after that.
So, by that calculation, he should be approximately 87 degrees.
Precisely, and this body temp is only 62.
So he started too low.
Are we saying he was frozen?
Or held in some sort of cold storage.
Take a look at the knife wound.
There should be perimortem bruising, but there isn't.
I think it's a medical cadaver.
Who found his way into the trunk of our suspect's car.
Right.
Now, this incision is recent.
Hmm.
Yeah.
What is that, Doctor?
It's an RFID chip.
Some medical facilities have started putting them in their cadavers so they can keep track of them.
Then the question becomes, who is this?
I just heard what happened to you in the elevator.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just...
I'm getting nowhere with this remote control switch.
So, whoever rigged it must have been wearing a body glove, because it's totally clean.
Hey, do you have the RFID reader in here?
Yeah.
Where did you get an RFID chip?
It was in our victim.
Well, actually, it's not even our victim anymore.
What?
The body that we found in the trunk-- it's a medical cadaver.
So our real victim's body is still missing?
Yes, and so is Neal.
We have surveillance at his house, but he hasn't come home yet.
Okay, so we got a missing body, a planted cadaver...
A phantom crime scene.
And a rigged elevator.
What the hell is going on?
Here we go.
The cadaver's name is Jason Norris.
Died of a myocardial infarction four days ago.
Donated his body to Silas BioTech.

Hi.

Oh, there's lots of money on the black market for body parts.
Thank you.
We-We do everything we can to prevent it, but...
Did you file a police report?
We hadn't officially determined, uh, if Mr. Norris was stolen or just misplaced.
There was an inventory audit in mid-process.
Can you show me where you had his body stored?
Oh, he never arrived.
The body went missing during transport from Dade General, so... you might want to follow up with them.
I will.
Thank you.

Is it possible that somebody other than Neal killed this girl?
Or that's what he wants us to think.
Let's do a full process and see where that takes us, okay?
Dr. Loman.
Looks like our poor lady sustained a broken neck at C-3.
Spinal cord was severed;
death was instantaneous.
How could that have happened?
She fell.
Significant damage to the back of her head, damage to the occipital bone along the lamboid suture.
And what about the bruising on her chest and under the eye?
That bruise and this welt under that eye lead me to believe this fall was no accident.
It looks like she's been in a fight.
Evidence seems to indicate.
And the tattoo on the hand.
Hm.
Oh.
Chinese symbol for "long life."
Pity she was denied one.
She was covering it with body makeup.
She also has...
tinted contacts.
And her hair was dyed.
She's attempting to conceal her identity.
Now, why would she do that?
Hey, Natalia, did you run the DNA on our new vic?
I did, but Olivia Hunter didn't show up in any database anywhere.
Yeah, but when I ran her prints, she matched this girl in AFIS.
Lisa Blackhall?
Uh-huh.
Olivia Hunter's real name, in the system for DUI.
Wait-wait, so Lisa was pretending to be Olivia Hunter?
Exactly.
And since Olivia Hunter doesn't really exist, I wondered how she charged a hotel room where she and Neal were hiding out.
And?
Turns out she used a corporate credit card issued by Silas BioTech.
Now, you were there, right?
I was there, and they lied to me, because I just talked to Dade General, and they told me that the misappropriated cadaver was in Silas's custody when it went missing.
See, it's sounding like there is some sort of conspiracy against Neal.
Especially with that whole Lisa-slash-Olivia.
She had to have been part of it, right?
You know what,
I'm gonna go grab Horatio and head back to Silas now.
Thank you.
Hora...
Horatio, I was here.
Right here.
Hello?
This was a working office.
There was...
a reception desk, there was... workers coming out of this back room.
I'm so sorry.
We are celebrating Celeste's birthday today.
This is crazy.
I mean, they completely stripped the place.
There's nothing here.
I don't get it.
Let's get a team here to go over this place.
Horatio, wait a minute.
There's something in here.
I'm not crazy.
I'm not cra...

He does not like to have fun on the clock.
I'm gonna take all these documents and try to get them reconstructed back at the lab.

I thought this software was supposed to make reconstructing documents easier.
It's searching for patterns and repeated text, but... with all of this...
we're gonna be lucky to even find segments of information.
It is gonna take some time.
You think?
Hey, we're working as fast as we can.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Look, it's just that I've got to figure out what the heck is going on here.
I do not like to be made a fool of.
I know.
Hey, can you put in a search term?
Yeah, sure.
What are you thinking?
Olivia Hunter rented that hotel room with a Silas BioTech corporate card.
Okay.
So if Silas doesn't exist, it really is a front.
Then who's actually paying that bill?
I see where you're going.
Okay, here's the credit card number that I have-- so let's just search through the documents we've already scanned.
That account number's coming up several times.
Yeah.
The billing statements for that account were also being mailed to an office suite out by Miami International.
I'll go check it out.
Yeah, sure.
Don't mention it.
Thank you.

I'm not your buddy.
As you can see, he's alive and well.
There was no murder.
So we know how the dead body got out of the men's room; it walked out.
And everybody here was in on it?
I'm afraid so.

That's exactly what Dean's going to do right now.
Aren't you, Dean?
What, do you know something, Dean?
Tell me.
Tell me!
Look where we are.
A woman is dead.
Why would you do this?
No one was supposed to die.
I was framed for murder.
I did it for you, for us.
For us?
I needed to get you out of your comfort zone.
My brother is a coward.
We can take his whole world and tilt it.

Why?
I was happy.
It was killing our firm.
This is about money?
This is about the Dunlevy account?
I had them.
They were going to invest millions until you told them that it wasn't prudent.
I gave them a risk assessment.
You gave them an accurate risk assessment.
Who does that?
We lost them, how many others?
I needed you to man up.
I was actually starting to believe your crap about how
I needed to loosen up, have fun, but you know what I learned from all this?
What?
That I love my wife and kids and I want to be with them more than anything else, and that makes me more of a man than you'll ever be.
Gentlemen.
So, Dean, did the game include murder?
No, I swear.
This was all just supposed to be pretend.
I didn't kill her.
Who did?
I have no idea.
She called me from the hotel, she was pretty worried.
Did Neal just call you?
No, is he okay?
Well, he's freaking out just like he's supposed to.
So what's the problem?
I've kept him off his cell, but I just caught him talking to somebody.
He didn't call you?
No.
If he compromised the game, it could be dangerous.
I got to go.
I don't remember making a call.
That's because you were drugged, Neal.
That's the last I heard from Lisa.
Could I have your cell phone, please?
You did make a call, Neal, just preceding the murder.
He called me?
I must have missed it.
It's okay.
You're lying, Mrs. Marshall.
Pardon?
Can we see your left shoulder, please?
What?
Why?
Why are you doing that?
Because you were at the hotel, and you forced your way into your husband's room, didn't you?
I knew Dean wanted you to go to bars, to see other women...
Jenny, I never did any...
You were tempted.
I could tell.
So you did get that phone call from the hotel?
Yes.
Jenny, I don't think you're safe.
I need you to get the girls and go to your mother's.
Neal, what's going on?
The police said you were fighting over some woman, that you killed a man.
No, I didn't kill anyone.
You sound strange.
Where are you?
Jenny, please,
I'm at the Brio Hotel, but I think I'm being followed.
It's not safe.
OLIVIA:

I went to the hotel.
I wasn't sure what I would find.
Can I help you?
Who the hell are you?
Where's my husband?
I never thought that Neal would get blamed.
I just got out of there.
How could I know that it was only a game?
For me it was very real.
There was Neal with another woman.
I'm sorry that I ever gave you reason to believe that I would do that.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
We have to go.
Please, no, there has to be a way.
Tell the girls I love them, okay?
Can you do that?
Please.
Can't you do something?
It's not her fault.
Please, it's the game.
I'm sorry, she killed someone.
She's looking at manslaughter.
Is this part of the game?
Please tell me this isn't real.

And we'll have corn at our own price.

Aye...
Let us revenge this with our sticks, ere we become rakes.
No more talking on it.
Come!
Soft, soft, who comes here?
...friends, mine honest neighbors...
Worthy Senator Menenius, one that has always loved the people.
I tell you, friends, most charitable care have the patricians of you.
For your wants, your suffering in this dearth, you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the Roman state.
Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain.

It is so.
- I'm a Roman.

What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections.
- The people against the senators.
- Hath been?
Is it ended then?
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again.
(Aufidius on TV) You have ended my business.
The news is the Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that'll put you to it.
I sin in envying his nobility.
And were I anything but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together?
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt.
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
Lead you on.
So your opinion is, Aufidius, that they of Rome are entered in our counsels
- and know how we proceed.
(Aufidius) Is it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone since I heard thence.
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim.
And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads on this preparation.
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more.
If ever again I meet him beard to beard, he's mine or I am his.

I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
If my son were my husband,
I would more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb,
I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame.
To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Then his good report should have been my son.
Hear me.
Had I a dozen sons,
I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius.
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum.
I see him stamp thus, cry thus:
"Come on, you cowards!
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome. "
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men!
Pluto and hell.
Look to it.
Come on!
Mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe and make my wars on you.
His bloody brow then wiping, forth he goes.
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.
Away, you fool.
It more becomes a man than gold his trophy.
Senator Menenius is come to visit you.
Tell him we are fit to bid him welcome.
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- Indeed, you shall not.
- My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both?
And how does your little son?
I thank you, sir.
Well, good.
He'd rather play with swords and hear a drum
- than look upon his schoolmaster.
- On my word, the father's son.
(both chuckling)
Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.
No, good sir, I will not out of doors.
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.
Indeed, no, by your patience.
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.
- I cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
(chuckling)
No, good sir.
Pardon me.
Indeed, I will not forth.
Go with me, and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
No, good sir, there can be none yet.
- There came news from him last night.
(woman) Indeed?
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Carioles.
They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars.
This is true, on mine honor.
So, I pray, go outwith us.
Give me excuse, good sir.
I will obey you in everything hereafter.

O gods!
He has the stamp of Martius.
Come I too late?

Aye, if you come not in the blood of others, but mantled in your own.
Let me hold you in arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done.

There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight.
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.
The blood I drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me.
To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight.
If any such be here, as it were sin to doubt, that love this painting wherein you see me smeared, if any fear lesser his person than an ill report, if any think brave death outweighs bad life,
and that his country is dearer than himself, let him alone, or so many so minded wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow Martius!
O... me alone.
Make you a sword of me!
(all yelling)

Oi!
(Martius) Advance, brave Titus!

Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee.
So often has thou beat me, and would do so, I fear, should we encounter as often as we eat.
For where I thought to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way.
Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.
(Aufidius) Bolder, though not so subtle.
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius.
Where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.
(woman) Honorable Menenius!
My boy, Martius, approaches.
For the love of Juno, let's go.
Is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.
O yes, he is wounded.
I thank the gods for it.
O, so do I too, if it be not too much.
Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius said they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
Gods grant them true.
- True.
- I'll be sworn they're true.
Where is he wounded?
In the shoulder and in the left arm.
There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
He had, before this last expedition,
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.
Every gash was an enemy's grave.
(quietly) Before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm doth lie.
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
(cameras clicking)
(man) Be it known, as to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius wears this war's garland.
And, from this time, for what he did before Corioles, call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host:
"Caius Martius Coriolanus." Bear the addition nobly ever.
(all) Caius Martius Coriolanus!

No more of this.
It does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother.
O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods for my prosperity.
Nay, my good soldier, up.
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honor newly named...
What is it?
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife...
My gracious silence, hail.
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home, that weeps to see me triumph?
Aye, my dear, such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, and mothers that lack sons.
(Menenius) Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh.
I'm light and heavy.
(laughter)
- I know not where to turn.
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!
(applause)
- Welcome, Coriolanus!
Welcome!
(man) 'Tis thought that Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and the blind to hear him speak.
Matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed.
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.
And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
(man) Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius?
(man 2) He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people...
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
You blame Martius for being proud?
- We do it not alone, sir.
- I know you can do very little alone.
You talk of pride.
O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves.
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy politicians, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it.
One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning.
What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.
- You're ambitious.
(chuckles)
(sighs)
Good e'en to your worships.
More of your conversation would infect my brain.
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say, but 'tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow, but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people.
There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them.
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition.
And, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see it.
But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him.
Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well.
And would be content to give him good report for it, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.
(clattering)
(paper tearing)
(Martius grunts softly)
(sighs)
The good senators must be visited, from whom I have received not only greetings, but with them change of honors.
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy.
Only there's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee.
Good mother, I'd rather be their servant in my way, than sway with them in theirs.
(door opens)
Coriolanus will carry it.
He's a worthy man.
He will carry it.
(bell rings)
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, during his power, go asleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end, but will lose those he hath won.
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear in the marketplace, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word.
It shall be to him then, a sure destruction.
So it must fall out to him, or our authorities, for an end.
We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them.
Kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze shall darken him forever.
(low, indistinct chatter)
(Menenius) It remains, as the main point of this our after-meeting, to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country.
Therefore, please you, most grave and reverend elders, to desire the present consul, and last general in our well-found successes, to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.
(man) Speak, good Cominius.
(men) Aye.
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.
Never shame to hear what you have nobly done.
Your honor's pardon.
I'd rather have my wounds to heal again
- than hear say how I got them.
- Pray you, sit down.
I'd rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered.
(murmuring)
(man) Speak, good Cominius.
(man 2) Aye, proceed.
The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly.
It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver.
If it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
(voice receding) At 16 years, he fought beyond the mark of others.
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man in the field.
(voice echoing) And in the brunt of 17 battles since, he lurched all swords of the garland.
For this last, before and in Corioles, let me say I cannot speak him home.
He stopped the fliers, and by his rare example, made coward turn terror into sport, from face to foot.
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
(voice echoing) Alone, he entered the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny.
(low rumbling)
- Aidless came off, and with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioles like a planet.
(voice receding) Until we called both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting.
Our spoils he kicked at, and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world.
He covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
(applause)
(indistinct salutations)
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
(scattered murmurs) Aye.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you, let me overleap that custom, for I cannot entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage.
Please you that I may pass this doing.
Sir!
The people must have their voices.
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.
It is a part that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken
- from the people.
- Mark you that?
To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, as if I had received them for the hire of their breath only.
To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor!
(applause)
(laughter) (applause continues over TV)
(Menenius) The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul!
(Martius) I do owe them still my life and services.
(Menenius) It then remains that you do speak to the people.
(Martius) Let me overleap that custom.
(man) The people must have their voices.
Have you not known the worthiest men have done it?
Custom calls me to it.
What custom wills, in all things should we do it.
What must I say?
"Look, sir, my wounds.
I got them in my country's service."
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that.
You must desire them to think upon you.
Think upon me?
Hang 'em.
I would they would forget me.
(siren chirping)
Pray you, speak to them.
I pray you, in wholesome manner.
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean.
(helicopter passing overhead)
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
We do, sir.
Tell us what hath brought you to it.
- Mine own desert.
(woman) Your own desert?
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it.
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private.
Your good voice, sir.
What say you?
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged.
Adieu.
But this is something odd.
(Martius) Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voice that I may be consul.
You've deserved nobly of your country, and you've not deserved nobly.
(chuckles)
Your enigma?
You've been a scourge to her enemies, you've been a rod to her friends.
You've not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.
I'll make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.
Your voices!
For your voices I have fought.
Watched for your voices.
For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd.
Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of!
For your voices have done many things, some less, some more.
Your voices!
Indeed, I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!
(man)
- Aye.
(man 2)
- Aye.
Therefore, let him be consul!
- Amen!
- Amen!
(others join in) Amen!
Amen!
(chanting)
- Amen!
(chanting continues)
- Worthy voices!
(chanting continues)
Worthy voices, worthy voices.
(chanting, cheering)
(Menenius) You have stood your limitation.
And the tribunes now endow you with the people's voice.
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged.
The people do admit you, and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation.
- Where?
At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.
I'll keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
(man) God save thee, noble consul!
(crowd chanting) Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, my masters!
My masters!
My masters, how now!
- Have you chose this man?
(multiple voices) Aye!
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
(woman) Amen, sir.
To my poor, unworthy notice, he mocked us when he begged our voices.
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright.
O, no, no, no, it is his kind of speech.
(scattered voices) Aye.
- He did not mock us.
He should have showed us his marks of merit,
- wounds received for his country.
(several shouting) Yes!
- Why, I'm sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't!
No, no, no!
No!
No!
No one saw them!
Was this mockery?
(scattered voices) Yes!
When he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy.
(scattered assent)
- Ever spake against your liberties.
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?
(scattered voices) Aye!
It is not confirmed.
It is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!
(murmuring)
- And will deny him!
I'll have 500 voices of that sound.
(multiple voices) Yes!
- I twice 500 and their friends!
(crowd) Yes!
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties!
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment, all revoke your ignorant election.
Enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you!
And, presently, when you have drawn the number, repair to the senate.
(low, indistinct chatter)
Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
He has, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
How?
What?
How often he had met you, sword to sword.
That of all things upon the earth, he hated your person most.
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, to oppose his hatred fully.
Come, Rome must know the value of her own.
(low, indistinct chatter)
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, the tongues of the common mouth.
- Pass no further.
- Ah?
What is that?
It will be dangerous to go on.
No further.
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.
- Are these your herd?
(Menenius) Be calm, be calm.
The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them time-pleasers,
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.
You show too much of that for which the people stir.
If you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit.
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.
This was my speech, and I'll speak it again.
- Not now, not now.
(Cominius) Not in this heat, sir.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves.
I say again, in soothing them, we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honored number who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
but that which we have given to beggars!
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you.
You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
It were well we let the people know it.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, by Jove, it would be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
Mark you his absolute "shall"?
Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, more worthier than their voices!
By Jove himself, it makes the consuls base, and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other.
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears, which will, in time, break open the locks of the senate, and bring in the crows to peck the eagles!
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure.
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do!
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul?
No!
Seize him!
Hence, old goat!
(crowd shouting)
On both sides more respect!
(crowd booing) (yelling)
Shh!
Shh!
Here's he that would take from you all your power!
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you,
Martius, whom late you have named for consul.
(angry shouting)
- What is the city but the people?
!
(woman) True!
The people are the city!
The people are the city!
(clamoring)
We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,
Martius is worthy of present death!
(clamoring)
Death!
- Guards, seize him!
- No, I'll die here!
(clamoring continuing)
Get you to your house!
Be gone, away!
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!
(clamoring continues)
(sirens wailing nearby)
(clears throat)
(sighs)
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults.
Consul?
What consul?
- The Consul Coriolanus.
(scoffs) He, consul?
It is decreed he dies tonight.
He's a disease that must be cut away.
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?
Killing our enemies?
(sighs)
The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country.
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more...
Consider this:
He's been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled in graceful language.
Give me leave.
I'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form, in peace, to his utmost peril.
Noble tribunes, it is the humane way.
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.
In you bring not Martius, we'll proceed in our first way.
I'll bring him to you.
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
- yet will I still be thus to them!
- Martius...
I muse my mother does not approve me further.
I talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?
Would you have me false to my nature?
Rather say I play the man I am.
Sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out.
- Let go.
- You might have been enough the man you are, with striving less to be so.
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.
Come, come, you've been too rough, something too rough.
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy, unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst and perish.
Pray, be counseled.
I have a heart as little apt as yours, but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage.
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must I do?
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then?
What then?
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods.
Must I then do it to them?
You are too absolute.
I've heard you say that honor and policy, like unsevered friends in war, do grow together.
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people, not by your own instruction, nor by the matter your heart prompts you, but with such words that are but roted in your tongue, though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor.
I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles... and you.
I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier.
And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves.
But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours.
I prithee, go and be ruled.
Sir, it is fit you make strong party, or defend yourself by calmness or by absence.
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.
I think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit.
He must.
He will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
Must I, with base tongue, give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I'll do it.
Away, my disposition, and possess me some harlot's spirit.
A beggar's tongue make motion through my lips.
I will not do it.
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth, and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
At thy choice, then.
To beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them.
Come all to ruin.
Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'st it from me, but owe thy pride thyself.
Pray, be content, Mother, I'm going.
Chide me no more.
Look, I am going.
I'll return consul, or never trust to what my tongue can do
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.
In this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power.
If he evade us there, enforce him with his hatred to the people.
Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll?
I have.
It's ready.
When the people hear me say
"it shall be so in the right and strength of the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then, let them, if they hear me say "Fine," cry "Fine."
- If "Death," cry "Death."
- We shall inform them.
(man) God preserve thee.
(light applause)
(indistinct chatter)
(whistles) (teering)
(loud jeer)
(shrill whistle)
The people are the city.
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.
Calmly, I beseech you.
(teering subsides)
(clears throat)
- The honored gods...
(microphone whines)
(crowd laughing)
(clears throat)
The honored gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men, plant love among us, throng our large temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with war.
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, if you submit you to the people's voices.
(scattered voices) Aye.
- I am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
The warlike service he has done, consider.
Think upon the wounds his body bears, which show like graves in the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers, scars to move laughter only.
Consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen,
- you find him like a soldier.
(inaudible murmurs)
Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as I say, such as become a soldier.
What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again?
We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office, and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical, for which you are a traitor to the people.
How... traitor?
- Traitor!
- Nay, temperately.
Your promise.
The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people.
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.
(angry shouts) (man) Traitor!
But since he hath served well for Rome...
What do you prate of service?
- I talk of that, that know it.
- You?
Is this the promise you made your mother?
I'll know no further.
Let them pronounce death, exile, flaying,
I would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word.
In the name of the people, and in the power of us, the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish him our city.
In the people's name, I say...
it shall be so.
- It shall be so!
- He's banished.
It shall be so!
(crowd shouting)
- It shall be so!
(chanting) It shall be so!
(Cominius) Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...
- He's sentenced.
No more hearing.
(Cominius) Let me speak.
(overlapping) It shall be so!
- I have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies' marks upon me...
There is no more to be said, but he is banished as enemy
- to the people and his country!
(crowd) It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
(chanting) It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
You common cry of curs!
Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air.
I... banish... you!
And here remain with your uncertainty.
Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts.
Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair.
Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows.
Despising, for you, the city... thus.
...I turn my back.
There is a world... elsewhere.
The people's enemy is gone!
(applause) (cheering)
(laughter)
- Whoo!
(cheering)
(children chattering nearby)
(dogs barking)
(indistinct chatter)
(Martius) Nay, Mother, where is your ancient courage?
(Mother) You are too absolute.
(birds cawing)
(Martius) Nay, Mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked.
I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.
The gods keep you.
This is a happier and more comely time.
- Yeah.
- Good day.
Good day.
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.
The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love.
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!
I would I had the power to say so to my husband.
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?
I tell thee what, fool, hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words?
(gasping) Blessed heavens...
More noble blows than ever thou wise words, and for Rome's good.
Yet go.
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.
I tell thee what.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!
- Bastards and all.
- Come!
Come, peace!
Well, well, we'll leave you.
Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses!
Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it.
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat.
I sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding.
- Come.
- Come, madam.
(hoofbeats approaching)
(indistinct chatter)
(up-tempo music plays nearby)
Hey.
(men calling out) Aufidius!
Ah, general.
Yes.
Well, well.
(bell tolling)
(soldiers chattering, muffled)
(door opens) (man) Hey, hey!
(grunting) (weapons cocking)
Whence comes thou?
Thy name?
Speak, man.
What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, and harsh in sound to thine.
Say... what's thy name?
Thou has a grim appearance.
What's thy name?
- Know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not.
Thy name?
My name is Caius Martius who hath done to thee, particularly, and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief.
Thereto witness may my surname Coriolanus.
Only that name remains.
The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest, and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome.
Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if I had feared death, of all men in the world
I would have avoided thee.
But, in mere spite, to be full quit of those, my banishers, stand I before thee here.
I will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends.
But if thou dares not this, then I present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice, which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since I have ever followed thee with hate, and cannot live but to thy shame
unless it be to do thee service.
(breathing heavily)
O Martius...
Martius...
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
Let me twine mine arms about that body.
Know thou I loved the maid I married, never man sighed truer breath.
But that I see thee here, thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when I first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold.
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, thou hast beat me out 12 several times, and I have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.
Worthy Martius, had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that thou art thence banished, we would muster all from 12 to 70, and, pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, like a bold flood, overbear it.
(snipping)
(buzzing)
Come, go in, and take our friendly senators by the hands.
You bless me, gods.
Therefore, most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission.
And set down as best thou art experienced, since thou knows thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of Rome, or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them, ere destroy.
(indistinct chatter)
(man) Is this Menenius?
(man 2) O, 'tis he, 'tis he.
O, he's grown most kind of late.
- Hail, sir.
- Hail to you both.
Your Coriolanus is not much missed, but with his friends.
All's well, and might have been much better
- if he could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?
I hear nothing.
His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.
Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war, but insolent, overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, self-loving...
I think not so.
And Rome sits safe and still without him.
- Shh!
- Shh!
(fanfare plays)
There are reports the Volsces with two several powers, are entered in the Roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war, destroy what lies before them.
(patrons) Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius, who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns into the world again. (chuckles)
Come, what talk you of Martius?
It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be?
We have record that it can.
(man) The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House.
Some news is coming that turns their countenances.
Yes, the first report is seconded, and more more fearful is delivered.
Martius has joined with Aufidius.
He leads a power against Rome, and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories, and have already overborne their way, consumed with fire, and took what lay before them.
Martius has joined with the Volscians.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies.
(men cheering)
(laughter)
(rock music playing)
(clippers buzzing) (men cheering)
Do they still fly to the Roman?
(man) I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, their talk at table, and their thanks at end.
And you are darkened in this action, sir.
He bears himself more proud, even to my person, than I thought he would when first I did embrace him.
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature.
(cheering)
(rock music continuing)
Whether it was pride, whether defect of judgment or whether nature, not to be other than one thing, made him feared, so hated, and so banished so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time.
One fire drives out one fire one nail, one nail.
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
When, Caius,
Rome is thine, thou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mine.
No, I'll not go.
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banished him.
A mile before his tent, fall down, and kneel the way into his mercy.
(door opens)
He would not seem to know me.
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops that we have bled together.
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to, forbad all names.
He was a kind of nothing.
Titleless.
Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome.
If you refuse your aid in this...
If you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman.
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius.
Well, and say "Martius return me, as Titus is returned, unhurt."
What then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome.
You know the very road into his kindness, and cannot lose your way.
I'll undertake it.
I think he'll hear me.
- He'll never hear him.
- No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold his eye, red, as it would burn Rome.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does.
O Martius, Martius.
Thou art preparing fire for us.
Look thee there's water to quench it.
I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee,
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome.
Away.
How?
Away?
Wife... mother... child...
I know not.
My affairs are servanted to others.
- Sir...
- Therefore be gone.
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.
This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings.
He's more than a creeping thing.
(engines starting)
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.
(car driving away)
(coughs)

My lord and husband.
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so.
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny, but do not say for that "Forgive our Romans."
O, a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge.
Ye gods, I prate, and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted.
Sink, my knee, in the earth.
Stand up, blest.
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
- I kneel before thee.
- What's this?
Your knees to me?
To your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior.
I helped to frame thee.
This is a poor epitome of yours, which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may'st prove to shame, invulnerable.
Your knee, sir.
Even he, your wife, this lady and myself,
- are suitors to you.
- I beseech you, peace.
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural.
Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons.
No more, no more.
You have said you will not grant us anything, for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already.
Yet we will ask, that if you fail in our request, the blame may hang upon your hardness.
Therefore hear us.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.
For we'll hear naught from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile.
Think with thyself.
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother, wife, and child
to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out.
And we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win.
For either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles through our streets, or else, triumphantly, tread on thy country's ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood.
For myself... son I purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine.
If I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world.
Aye, and mine, that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time.
You shall not tread on me.
I'll run away till I'm bigger but then I'll fight!
- I have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans, thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve, thou might'st condemn us as poisonous of your honor.
No.
Our suit is that you reconcile them.
So that the Voices may say "This mercy we have showed,"
the Romans, "This we've received,"
and each on either side give the all-hail to thee and cry,
"Be blest for making up this peace!"
Speak to me, son.
Why dost not speak?
Speak you, daughter.
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy.
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons.
There's no man in the world more bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks!
Thou hast never, in thy life, shown thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor.
Say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs.
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees!
Down!
This is the last.
An end.
So we will home to Rome, and die among our neighbors.
Nay.
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot tell what he would have yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship.
Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it.
Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother!
His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance.
Yet give us our dispatch I am hushed until our city be afire, and then I'll speak a little.
O Mother...
Mother...
What have you done?
Behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at.
(sobbing) O my mother!
Mother!
(sobs) O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome.
But for your son, believe it.
O believe it.
Most... dangerously you have prevailed with him.
If not most mortal to him.
But let it come.
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less?
Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.
But, good sir, what peace you'll make, advise me.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
We have all great cause to give great thanks.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain.
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction.
I raised him, and I pawned mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened, he watered his new plants with dews of flattery, seducing so my friends.
At the last, I seemed his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary.
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.
And, in the last, when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory...
There was it!
For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor of our great action.
Therefore shall he die...
- ...and I'll renew me in his fall.
(man whistles)
(vehicle approaching)
- Say no more.
I am returned your soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when I parted hence, but still subsisting under your great command.
We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans.
Tell the traitor, in the highest degree
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor?
How now?
Aye, traitor, Martius.
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.
Caius Martius.
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?
Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome.
I say "your city," for his wife and mother.
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk.
Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory.
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it.
"Boy"?
O slave.
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me!
"Boy"?
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there that, like an eagle in a dovecote,
I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
Alone I did it.
"Boy."
Let him die for it.

Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
[all] Resolved.
First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.
- [all murmur] We know it.
- Let us kill him.
And we'll have corn at our own price.
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, our suffering, is a gain to them.
Aye...
Let us revenge this with our sticks, ere we become rakes.
No more talking on it.
Come!
Soft, soft, who comes here?
...friends, mine honest neighbors...
Worthy Senator Menenius, one that has always loved the people.
I tell you, friends, most charitable care have the patricians of you.
For your wants, your suffering in this dearth, you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the Roman state.
Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain.
Bread!
- [man] Bread!
- [all murmur] Bread.
[all] Bread!
[crowd chanting] Bread, bread, bread...!
[clamoring]
Bread, bread, bread...
- [horn honking] - [people screaming] [grunting]
Stop!
- Stop!
Stop!
- [shouting ceases]
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word.
He that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring.
What would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war?
The one affrights you, the other makes you proud.
He that trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares, where foxes, geese.
Who deserves greatness, deserves your hate.
Hang ye.
Trust ye?
With every minute you do change your mind, and call him noble that was now your hate, him vile that was your garland.
What's the matter, that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?
Go.
Get you home you fragments.
[batons rhythmically pounding shields]

- Please...
- Know you me yet?
I know you well.
Your name, I think, is Aufidius.
It is so.
- l'm a Roman.
- What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections.
- The people against the senators.
- Hath been?
is it ended then?
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again.
[Aufidius on TV] You have ended my business.
The news is the Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that'll put you to it.
I sin in envying his nobility.
And were I anything but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together?
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt.
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
Lead you on.
So your opinion is, Aufidius, that they of Rome are entered in our counsels
- and know how we proceed.
- [Aufidius] ls it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone since I heard thence.
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim.
And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads on this preparation.
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more.
If ever again I meet him beard to beard, he's mine or I am his.
[bombs whistling]
[rapid gunfire]
[rapid gunfire continues] [grunts]
[man] Mark me!
[screams]
[Martius] They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts.
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge!
Go!
[grunts] [bullets ricochet]
Come on.
Away!
[rapid gunfire]
[grunting]
[gunshot] [can clanking on ground]
[TV plays indistinctly]
[man] The citizens of Corioles have issued and given to Titus and to Martius battle.
We've heard their drums.
I saw our forces to their trenches
- driven, and then I came away...
- [TV clicks off] I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
If my son were my husband, I would more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame.
To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Then his good report should have been my son.
Hear me.
Had I a dozen sons, I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius.
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum.
I see him stamp thus, cry thus:
"Come on, you cowards!
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome."
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men!
Pluto and hell.
Look to it.
Come on!
Mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe and make my wars on you.
His bloody brow then wiping, forth he goes.
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.
Away, you fool.
It more becomes a man than gold his trophy.
Senator Menenius is come to visit you.
Tell him we are fit to bid him welcome.
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- indeed, you shall not.
- My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both?
And how does your little son?
I thank you, sir.
Well, good.
He'd rather play with swords and hear a drum
- than look upon his schoolmaster.
- On my word, the father's son.
[both chuckling]
Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.
No, good sir, I will not out of doors.
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.
Indeed, no, by your patience.
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.
- l cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
[chuckling]
No, good sir.
Pardon me.
Indeed, I will not forth.
Go with me, and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
No, good sir, there can be none yet.
- There came news from him last night.
- [woman] Indeed?
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Carioles.
They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars.
This is true, on mine honor.
So, I pray, go out with us.
Give me excuse, good sir.
I will obey you in everything hereafter.
Let her alone.
As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.

- [Titus] What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless.
He is himself alone, to answer all the city.
[whispers] Thou art lost, Martius.
[rapid gunfire in distance]
Who's yonder, that does appear as he were flayed?
O gods!
He has the stamp of Martius.
Come I too late?
!
Aye, if you come not in the blood of others, but mantled in your own.
Let me hold you in arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done.
[explosion]
There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight.
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.
The blood I drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me.
To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight.
If any such be here, as it were sin to doubt, that love this painting wherein you see me smeared, if any fear lesser his person than an ill report, if any think brave death outweighs bad life,
and that his country is dearer than himself, let him alone, or so many so minded wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow Martius!
O... me alone.
Make you a sword of me!
[all yelling] [rapid gunfire]
Oi!
[Martius] Advance, brave Titus!
[grunts] [rapid gunfire continues]
Away!
Come!
Come!
I'll fight with none but thee, for l do hate thee.
We hate alike.
[both grunting]
[grunts] [grunts, yells]
[both yelling]
[yelling]
[groaning]
[explosion]
[bomb whistling] [explosion] [debris clattering]
[wind whistling]
[panting]
Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee.
So often has thou beat me, and would do so, I fear, should we encounter as often as we eat.
For where l thought to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way.
Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.
[Aufidius] Bolder, though not so subtle.
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius.
Where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.
[woman] Honorable Menenius!
My boy, Martius, approaches.
For the love of Juno, let's go.
is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.
O yes, he is wounded.
I thank the gods for it.
O, so do I too, if it be not too much.
Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius said they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
Gods grant them true.
- True.
- l'll be sworn they're true.
Where is he wounded?
In the shoulder and in the left arm.
There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
He had, before this last expedition,
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.
Every gash was an enemy's grave.
[quietly] Before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm doth lie.
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
[cameras clicking]
[man] Be it known, as to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius wears this war's garland.
And, from this time, for what he did before Corioles, call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host:
"Caius Martius Coriolanus." Bear the addition nobly ever.
[all] Caius Martius Coriolanus!
[applause]
No more of this. lt does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother.
O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods for my prosperity.
Nay, my good soldier, up.
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honor newly named...
What is it?
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife...
My gracious silence, hail.
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home, that weeps to see me triumph?
Aye, my dear, such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, and mothers that lack sons.
- [Menenius] Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh.
I'm light and heavy.
- [laughter] - l know not where to turn.
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!
- [applause]
- Welcome, Coriolanus!
Welcome!
[man] 'Tis thought that Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and the blind to hear him speak.
Matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed.
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.
And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
[man] Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius?
[man 2] He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people...
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
You blame Martius for being proud?
- We do it not alone, sir.
- l know you can do very little alone.
You talk of pride.
O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves.
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy politicians, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it.
One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning.
What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.
- You're ambitious.
- [chuckles] [sighs]
Good e'en to your worships.
More of your conversation would infect my brain.
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say, but 'tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow, but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people.
There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them.
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition.
And, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see it.
But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him.
Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well.
And would be content to give him good report for it, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.
[clattering] [paper tearing]
[Martius grunts softly] [sighs]
The good senators must be visited, from whom I have received not only greetings, but with them change of honors.
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy.
Only there's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee.
Good mother, I'd rather be their servant in my way, than sway with them in theirs.
[door opens]
Coriolanus will carry it.
He's a worthy man.
He will carry it.
[bell rings]
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, during his power, go asleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end, but will lose those he hath won.
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear in the marketplace, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word. lt shall be to him then, a sure destruction.
So it must fall out to him, or our authorities, for an end.
We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them.
Kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze shall darken him forever.
[low, indistinct chatter]
[Menenius] lt remains, as the main point of this our after-meeting, to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country.
Therefore, please you, most grave and reverend elders, to desire the present consul, and last general in our well-found successes, to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.
- [man] Speak, good Cominius.
- [men] Aye.
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.
Never shame to hear what you have nobly done.
Your honor's pardon. I'd rather have my wounds to heal again
- than hear say how I got them.
- Pray you, sit down.
I'd rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered.
[murmuring]
- [man] Speak, good Cominius.
- [man 2] Aye, proceed.
The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly.
It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver.
If it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
[voice receding] At 1 6 years, he fought beyond the mark of others.
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man in the field.
[voice echoing] And in the brunt of 1 7 battles since, he lurched all swords of the garland.
For this last, before and in Corioles, let me say I cannot speak him home.
He stopped the fliers, and by his rare example, made coward turn terror into sport, from face to foot.
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
[voice echoing] Alone, he entered the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny.
- [low rumbling]
- Aidless came off, and with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioles like a planet.
[voice receding] Until we called both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting.
Our spoils he kicked at, and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world.
He covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
[applause] [indistinct salutations]
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
[scattered murmurs] Aye.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you, let me overleap that custom, for l cannot entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage.
Please you that I may pass this doing.
Sir!
The people must have their voices.
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.
It is a part that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken
- from the people.
- Mark you that?
To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, as if I had received them for the hire of their breath only.
To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor!
[applause]
- [laughter] - [applause continues over TV]
[Menenius] The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul!
[Martius] I do owe them still my life and services.
[Menenius] lt then remains that you do speak to the people.
[Martius] Let me overleap that custom.
[man] The people must have their voices.
Have you not known the worthiest men have done it?
Custom calls me to it.
What custom wills, in all things should we do it.
What must I say?
"Look, sir, my wounds.
I got them in my country's service."
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that.
You must desire them to think upon you.
Think upon me?
Hang 'em.
I would they would forget me.
[siren chirping]
Pray you, speak to them.
I pray you, in wholesome manner.
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean.
[helicopter passing overhead]
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
We do, sir.
Tell us what hath brought you to it.
- Mine own desert.
- [woman] Your own desert?
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it.
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private.
Your good voice, sir.
What say you?
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged.
Adieu.
But this is something odd.
[Martius] Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voice that I may be consul.
You've deserved nobly of your country, and you've not deserved nobly.
[chuckles]
Your enigma?
You've been a scourge to her enemies, you've been a rod to her friends.
You've not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.
I'll make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.
Your voices!
For your voices I have fought.
Watched for your voices.
For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd.
Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of!
For your voices have done many things, some less, some more.
Your voices!
Indeed, I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!
- [man] Aye.
- [man 2] Aye.
Therefore, let him be consul!
- Amen!
- Amen!
[others join in] Amen!
Amen!
[chanting]
- Amen!
- [chanting continues]
- Worthy voices!
- [chanting continues]
Worthy voices, worthy voices.
[chanting, cheering]
[Menenius] You have stood your limitation.
And the tribunes now endow you with the people's voice.
is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged.
The people do admit you, and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation.
- Where?
At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.
I'll keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
[man] God save thee, noble consul!
[crowd chanting] Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, my masters!
My masters!
My masters, how now!
- Have you chose this man?
- [multiple voices] Aye!
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
[woman] Amen, sir.
To my poor, unworthy notice, he mocked us when he begged our voices.
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright.
O, no, no, no, it is his kind of speech.
- [scattered voices] Aye.
- He did not mock us.
He should have showed us his marks of merit,
- wounds received for his country.
- [several shouting] Yes!
- Why, I'm sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't!
No, no, no!
No!
No!
No one saw them!
Was this mockery?
[scattered voices] Yes!
When he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy.
- [scattered assent]
- Ever spake against your liberties.
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?
[scattered voices] Aye!
It is not confirmed.
It is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!
- [murmuring]
- And will deny him!
I'll have 500 voices of that sound.
- [multiple voices] Yes!
- l twice 500 and their friends!
[crowd] Yes!
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties!
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment, all revoke your ignorant election.
Enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you!
And, presently, when you have drawn the number, repair to the senate.
[low, indistinct chatter]
Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
He has, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
How?
What?
How often he had met you, sword to sword.
That of all things upon the earth, he hated your person most.
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, to oppose his hatred fully.
Come, Rome must know the value of her own.
[low, indistinct chatter]
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, the tongues of the common mouth.
- Pass no further.
- Ah?
What is that?
It will be dangerous to go on.
No further.
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.
- Are these your herd?
- [Menenius] Be calm, be calm.
The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them time-pleasers,
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.
You show too much of that for which the people stir.
If you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit.
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.
This was my speech, and I'll speak it again.
- Not now, not now.
- [Cominius] Not in this heat, sir.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves.
I say again, in soothing them, we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honored number who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
but that which we have given to beggars!
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you.
You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
It were well we let the people know it.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, by Jove, it would be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
Mark you his absolute "shall"?
Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, more worthier than their voices!
By Jove himself, it makes the consuls base, and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other.
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears, which will, in time, break open the locks of the senate, and bring in the crows to peck the eagles!
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure.
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do!
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul?
No!
Seize him!
Hence, old goat!
[crowd shouting]
On both sides more respect!
- [crowd booing] - [yelling]
Shh!
Shh!
Here's he that would take from you all your power!
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you,
Martius, whom late you have named for consul.
[angry shouting]
- What is the city but the people?
!
- [woman] True!
The people are the city!
The people are the city!
[clamoring]
We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,
Martius is worthy of present death!
[clamoring]
Death!
- Guards, seize him!
- No, I'll die here!
[clamoring continuing]
Get you to your house!
Be gone, away!
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!
[clamoring continues]
[sirens wailing nearby]
[clears throat]
[sighs]
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults.
Consul?
What consul?
- The Consul Coriolanus.
- [scoffs] He, consul?
It is decreed he dies tonight.
He's a disease that must be cut away.
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?
Killing our enemies?
[sighs]
The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country.
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more...
Consider this:
He's been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled in graceful language.
Give me leave. I'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form, in peace, to his utmost peril.
Noble tribunes, it is the humane way.
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.
In you bring not Martius, we'll proceed in our first way.
I'll bring him to you.
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
- yet will I still be thus to them!
- Martius... I muse my mother does not approve me further.
I talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?
Would you have me false to my nature?
Rather say I play the man I am.
Sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out.
- Let go.
- You might have been enough the man you are, with striving less to be so.
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.
Come, come, you've been too rough, something too rough.
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy, unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst and perish.
Pray, be counseled.
I have a heart as little apt as yours, but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage.
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must I do?
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then?
What then?
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods.
Must I then do it to them?
You are too absolute.
I've heard you say that honor and policy, like unsevered friends in war, do grow together.
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people, not by your own instruction, nor by the matter your heart prompts you, but with such words that are but roted in your tongue, though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor.
I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles... and you.
I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier.
And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves.
But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours.
I prithee, go and be ruled.
Sir, it is fit you make strong party, or defend yourself by calmness or by absence.
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.
I think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit.
He must.
He will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
Must I, with base tongue, give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I'll do it.
Away, my disposition, and possess me some harlot's spirit.
A beggar's tongue make motion through my lips.
I will not do it.
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth, and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
At thy choice, then.
To beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them.
Come all to ruin.
Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness, for l mock at death with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'st it from me, but owe thy pride thyself.
Pray, be content, Mother, I'm going.
Chide me no more.
Look, I am going.
I'll return consul, or never trust to what my tongue can do
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.
In this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power.
If he evade us there, enforce him with his hatred to the people.
Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll?
I have. lt's ready.
When the people hear me say
"lt shall be so in the right and strength of the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then, let them, if they hear me say "Fine," cry "Fine."
- lf "Death," cry "Death."
- We shall inform them.
- [man] God preserve thee.
- [light applause]
[indistinct chatter]
- [whistles] - [jeering] [loud jeer]
[shrill whistle]
The people are the city.
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.
Calmly, I beseech you.
[jeering subsides]
[clears throat]
- The honored gods...
- [microphone whines] [crowd laughing]
[clears throat]
The honored gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs ofjustice supplied with worthy men, plant love among us, throng our large temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with war.
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, if you submit you to the people's voices.
[scattered voices] Aye.
- l am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
The warlike service he has done, consider.
Think upon the wounds his body bears, which show like graves in the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers, scars to move laughter only.
Consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen,
- you find him like a soldier.
- [inaudible murmurs]
Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as I say, such as become a soldier.
What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice, I am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again?
We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office, and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical, for which you are a traitor to the people.
How... traitor?
- Traitor!
- Nay, temperately.
Your promise.
The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people.
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.
- [angry shouts] - [man] Traitor!
But since he hath served well for Rome...
What do you prate of service?
- l talk of that, that know it.
- You?
is this the promise you made your mother?
I'll know no further.
Let them pronounce death, exile, flaying, I would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word.
In the name of the people, and in the power of us, the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish him our city.
In the people's name, I say...
it shall be so.
- lt shall be so!
- He's banished. lt shall be so!
- [crowd shouting] - lt shall be so!
- [chanting] lt shall be so!
- [Cominius] Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...
- He's sentenced.
No more hearing.
- [Cominius] Let me speak.
- [overlapping] lt shall be so!
- l have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies' marks upon me...
There is no more to be said, but he is banished as enemy
- to the people and his country!
- [crowd] lt shall be so!
- lt shall be so!
- lt shall be so!
[chanting] lt shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- lt shall be so!
- lt shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
You common cry of curs!
Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air.
I... banish... you!
And here remain with your uncertainty.
Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts.
Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair.
Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length
making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows.
Despising, for you, the city thus I turn my back.
There is a world... elsewhere.
The people's enemy is gone!
- [applause] - [cheering]
- [laughter]
- Whoo!
[cheering] [children chattering nearby]
[dogs barking]
[indistinct chatter]
[Martius] Nay, Mother, where is your ancient courage?
- [Mother] You are too absolute.
- [birds cawing]
[Martius] Nay, Mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked.
I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.
The gods keep you.
This is a happier and more comely time.
- Yeah.
- Good day.
Good day.
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.
The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love.
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!
I would I had the power to say so to my husband.
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?
I tell thee what, fool, hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words?
[gasping] Blessed heavens...
More noble blows than ever thou wise words, and for Rome's good.
Yet go.
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.
I tell thee what.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!
- Bastards and all.
- Come!
Come, peace!
Well, well, we'll leave you.
Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses!
Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it.
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat.
I sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding.
- Come.
- Come, madam.
[hoofbeats approaching]
[indistinct chatter] [up-tempo music plays nearby]
Hey.
[men calling out] Aufidius!
Ah, general.
Yes.
Well, well.
[bell tolling]
[soldiers chattering, muffled]
- [door opens] - [man] Hey, hey!
- [grunting] - [weapons cocking]
Whence comes thou?
Thy name?
Speak, man.
What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, and harsh in sound to thine.
Say... what's thy name?
Thou has a grim appearance.
What's thy name?
- Know'st thou me yet?
- l know thee not.
Thy name?
My name is Caius Martius who hath done to thee, particularly, and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief.
Thereto witness may my surname Coriolanus.
Only that name remains.
The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest, and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome.
Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if I had feared death, of all men in the world I would have avoided thee.
But, in mere spite, to be full quit of those, my banishers, stand I before thee here.
I will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends.
But if thou dares not this, then I present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice, which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since I have ever followed thee with hate, and cannot live but to thy shame
unless it be to do thee service.
[breathing heavily]
O Martius...
Martius...
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
Let me twine mine arms about that body.
Know thou I loved the maid I married, never man sighed truer breath.
But that I see thee here, thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when I first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold.
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, thou hast beat me out 1 2 several times, and I have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.
Worthy Martius, had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that thou art thence banished, we would muster all from 1 2 to 70, and, pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, like a bold flood, overbear it.
[snipping] [buzzing]
Come, go in, and take our friendly senators by the hands.
You bless me, gods.
Therefore, most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission.
And set down as best thou art experienced, since thou knows thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of Rome, or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them, ere destroy.
[indistinct chatter]
- [man] ls this Menenius?
- [man 2] O, 'tis he, 'tis he.
O, he's grown most kind of late.
- Hail, sir.
- Hail to you both.
Your Coriolanus is not much missed, but with his friends.
All's well, and might have been much better
- if he could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?
I hear nothing.
His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.
Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war, but insolent, overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, self-loving... I think not so.
And Rome sits safe and still without him.
- Shh!
- Shh!
[fanfare plays]
There are reports the Volsces, with two several powers, are entered in the Roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war, destroy what lies before them.
- [patrons] Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius, who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns into the world again. [chuckles]
Come, what talk you of Martius?
It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be?
We have record that it can.
[man] The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House.
Some news is coming that turns their countenances.
Yes, the first report is seconded, and more more fearful is delivered.
Martius has joined with Aufidius.
He leads a power against Rome, and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius, associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories, and have already overborne their way, consumed with fire, and took what lay before them.
Martius has joined with the Volscians.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies.
[men cheering]
[laughter] [rock music playing]
- [clippers buzzing] - [men cheering]
Do they still fly to the Roman?
[man] I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, their talk at table, and their thanks at end.
And you are darkened in this action, sir.
He bears himself more proud, even to my person, than I thought he would when first I did embrace him.
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature.
[cheering]
[rock music continuing]
Whether it was pride, whether defect ofjudgment or whether nature, not to be other than one thing, made him feared, so hated, and so banished so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time.
One fire drives out one fire one nail, one nail.
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
When, Caius,
Rome is thine, thou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mine.
No, I'll not go.
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banished him.
A mile before his tent, fall down, and kneel the way into his mercy.
[door opens]
He would not seem to know me.
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops that we have bled together.
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to, forbad all names.
He was a kind of nothing.
Titleless.
Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome.
If you refuse your aid in this... lf you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman.
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius.
Well, and say "Martius return me, as Titus is returned, unhurt."
What then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome.
You know the very road into his kindness, and cannot lose your way.
I'll undertake it.
I think he'll hear me.
- He'll never hear him.
- No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold his eye, red, as it would burn Rome.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does.
O Martius, Martius.
Thou art preparing fire for us.
Look thee there's water to quench it.
I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee, I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome.
Away.
How?
Away?
Wife... mother... child...
I know not.
My affairs are servanted to others.
- Sir...
- Therefore be gone.
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.
This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings.
He's more than a creeping thing.
[engines starting]
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.
[car driving away]
[coughs]
[breathes heavily]
[helicopters whirring]
[wolf whistle]
My lord and husband.
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so.
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny, but do not say for that "Forgive our Romans."
O, a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge.
Ye gods, I prate, and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted.
Sink, my knee, in the earth.
Stand up, blest.
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
- l kneel before thee.
- What's this?
Your knees to me?
To your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior.
I helped to frame thee.
This is a poor epitome of yours, which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may'st prove to shame, invulnerable.
Your knee, sir.
Even he, your wife, this lady and myself,
- are suitors to you.
- l beseech you, peace.
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural.
Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons.
No more, no more.
You have said you will not grant us anything, for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already.
Yet we will ask, that if you fail in our request, the blame may hang upon your hardness.
Therefore hear us.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.
For we'll hear naught from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile.
Think with thyself.
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother, wife, and child
to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out.
And we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win.
For either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles through our streets, or else, triumphantly, tread on thy country's ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood.
For myself... son I purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine.
If I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world.
Aye, and mine, that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time.
You shall not tread on me.
I'll run away till I'm bigger but then I'll fight!
- l have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans, thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve, thou might'st condemn us as poisonous of your honor.
No.
Our suit is that you reconcile them.
So that the Volces may say "This mercy we have showed,"
the Romans, "This we've received,"
and each on either side give the all-hail to thee and cry,
"Be blest for making up this peace!"
Speak to me, son.
Why dost not speak?
Speak you, daughter.
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy.
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons.
There's no man in the world more bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks!
Thou hast never, in thy life, shown thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor.
Say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs.
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees!
Down!
This is the last.
An end.
So we will home to Rome, and die among our neighbors.
Nay.
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot tell what he would have yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship.
Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it.
Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother!
His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance.
Yet give us our dispatch I am hushed until our city be afire, and then I'll speak a little.
O Mother...
Mother...
What have you done?
Behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at.
[sobbing] O my mother!
Mother!
[sobs] O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome.
But for your son, believe it.
O believe it.
Most... dangerously you have prevailed with him.
If not most mortal to him.
But let it come.
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less?
Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.
But, good sir, what peace you'll make, advise me.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
We have all great cause to give great thanks.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain.
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction.
I raised him, and I pawned mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened, he watered his new plants with dews of flattery, seducing so my friends.
At the last, I seemed his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary.
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.
And, in the last, when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory...
There was it!
For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor of our great action.
Therefore shall he die...
- ...and I'll renew me in his fall.
- [man whistles]
- [vehicle approaching]
- Say no more.
I am returned your soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when I parted hence, but still subsisting under your great command.
We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans.
Tell the traitor, in the highest degree
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor?
How now?
Aye, traitor, Martius.
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.
Caius Martius.
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?
Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome.
I say "your city," for his wife and mother.
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk.
Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory.
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it.
"Boy"?
O slave.
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me!
"Boy"?
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there that, like an eagle in a dovecote, I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
Alone I did it.
"Boy."
Let him die for it.
[shouting] [screams]
[yells]
- [moans softly] - [wind whistling softly]
[no audio]
[knife rips out loudly]
[♪ Lisa Zane: "Sta Pervolia"]
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
Resolved.
First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.
- We know it.
- Let us kill him.
And we'll have corn at our own price.
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, our suffering, is a gain to them.
Aye...
Let us revenge this with our sticks, ere we become rakes.
No more talking on it.
Come!
Soft, soft, who comes here?
...friends, mine honest neighbors...
Worthy Senator Menenius, one that has always loved the people.
I tell you, friends, most charitable care have the patricians of you.
For your wants, your suffering in this dearth, you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the Roman state.
Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain.
Bread!
- Bread!
- Bread.
Bread!
Bread, bread, bread...!
Bread, bread, bread...
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word.
He that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring.
What would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war?
The one affrights you, the other makes you proud.
He that trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares, where foxes, geese.
Who deserves greatness, deserves your hate.
Hang ye.
Trust ye?
With every minute you do change your mind, and call him noble that was now your hate, him vile that was your garland.
What's the matter, that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?
Go.
Get you home you fragments.
- Go back!
- Forward!
Go back!
- Please...
- Know you me yet?
I know you well.
Your name, I think, is Aufidius.
It is so.
- I'm a Roman.
- What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections.
- The people against the senators.
- Hath been?
Is it ended then?
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again.
You have ended my business.
The news is the Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that'll put you to it.
I sin in envying his nobility.
And were I anything but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together?
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt.
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
Lead you on.
So your opinion is, Aufidius, that they of Rome are entered in our counsels
- and know how we proceed.
- Is it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone since I heard thence.
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim.
And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads on this preparation.
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more.
If ever again I meet him beard to beard, he's mine or I am his.
Mark me!
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts.
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge!
Go!
Come on.
Away!
The citizens of Corioles have issued and given to Titus and to Martius battle.
We've heard their drums.
I saw our forces to their trenches driven, and then I came away...
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
If my son were my husband,
I would more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb,
I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame.
To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Then his good report should have been my son.
Hear me.
Had I a dozen sons,
I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius.
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum.
I see him stamp thus, cry thus:
"Come on, you cowards!
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome."
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men!
Pluto and hell.
Look to it.
Come on!
Mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe and make my wars on you.
His bloody brow then wiping, forth he goes.
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.
Away, you fool.
It more becomes a man than gold his trophy.
Senator Menenius is come to visit you.
Tell him we are fit to bid him welcome.
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- Indeed, you shall not.
- My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both?
And how does your little son?
I thank you, sir.
Well, good.
He'd rather play with swords and hear a drum
- than look upon his schoolmaster.
- On my word, the father's son.
Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.
No, good sir, I will not out of doors.
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.
Indeed, no, by your patience.
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.
- I cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
No, good sir.
Pardon me.
Indeed, I will not forth.
Go with me, and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
No, good sir, there can be none yet.
- There came news from him last night.
- Indeed?
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Carioles.
They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars.
This is true, on mine honor.
So, I pray, go out with us.
Give me excuse, good sir.
I will obey you in everything hereafter.
Let her alone.
As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.
- What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless.
He is himself alone, to answer all the city.
Thou art lost, Martius.
Who's yonder, that does appear as he were flayed?
O gods!
He has the stamp of Martius.
Come I too late?
!
Come I too late?
!
Aye, if you come not in the blood of others, but mantled in your own.
Let me hold you in arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done.
There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight.
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.
The blood I drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me.
To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight.
If any such be here, as it were sin to doubt, that love this painting wherein you see me smeared, if any fear lesser his person than an ill report, if any think brave death outweighs bad life,
and that his country is dearer than himself, let him alone, or so many so minded wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow Martius!
O... me alone.
Make you a sword of me!
Oi!
Advance, brave Titus!
Away!
Come!
Come!
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee.
We hate alike.
Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee.
So often has thou beat me, and would do so, I fear, should we encounter as often as we eat.
For where I thought to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way.
Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.
Bolder, though not so subtle.
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius.
Where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.
Honorable Menenius!
My boy, Martius, approaches.
For the love of Juno, let's go.
Is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.
O yes, he is wounded.
I thank the gods for it.
O, so do I too, if it be not too much.
Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius said they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
Gods grant them true.
- True.
- I'll be sworn they're true.
Where is he wounded?
In the shoulder and in the left arm.
There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
He had, before this last expedition,
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.
Every gash was an enemy's grave.
Before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm doth lie.
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
Be it known, as to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius wears this war's garland.
And, from this time, for what he did before Corioles, call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host:
"Caius Martius Coriolanus." Bear the addition nobly ever.
Caius Martius Coriolanus!
No more of this.
It does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother.
O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods for my prosperity.
Nay, my good soldier, up.
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honor newly named...
What is it?
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife...
My gracious silence, hail.
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home, that weeps to see me triumph?
Aye, my dear, such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, and mothers that lack sons.
- Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh.
I'm light and heavy.
I know not where to turn.
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!
Welcome, Coriolanus!
Welcome!
'Tis thought that Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and the blind to hear him speak.
Matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed.
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.
And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius?
He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people...
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
You blame Martius for being proud?
- We do it not alone, sir.
- I know you can do very little alone.
You talk of pride.
O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves.
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy politicians, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it.
One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning.
What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.
You're ambitious.
Good e'en to your worships.
More of your conversation would infect my brain.
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say, but 'tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow, but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people.
There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them.
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition.
And, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see it.
But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him.
Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well.
And would be content to give him good report for it, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.
The good senators must be visited, from whom I have received not only greetings, but with them change of honors.
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy.
Only there's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee.
Good mother, I'd rather be their servant in my way, than sway with them in theirs.
Coriolanus will carry it.
He's a worthy man.
He will carry it.
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, during his power, go asleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end, but will lose those he hath won.
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear in the marketplace, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word.
It shall be to him then, a sure destruction.
So it must fall out to him, or our authorities, for an end.
We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them.
Kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze shall darken him forever.
It remains, as the main point of this our after-meeting, to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country.
Therefore, please you, most grave and reverend elders, to desire the present consul, and last general in our well-found successes, to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.
- Speak, good Cominius.
- Aye.
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.
Never shame to hear what you have nobly done.
Your honor's pardon.
I'd rather have my wounds to heal again
- than hear say how I got them.
- Pray you, sit down.
I'd rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered.
- Speak, good Cominius.
- Aye, proceed.
The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly.
It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver.
If it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
At 16 years, he fought beyond the mark of others.
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man in the field.
And in the brunt of 17 battles since, he lurched all swords of the garland.
For this last, before and in Corioles, let me say I cannot speak him home.
He stopped the fliers, and by his rare example, made coward turn terror into sport, from face to foot.
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
Alone, he entered the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny.
Aidless came off, and with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioles like a planet.
Until we called both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting.
Our spoils he kicked at, and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world.
He covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
Aye.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you, let me overleap that custom, for I cannot entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage.
Please you that I may pass this doing.
Sir!
The people must have their voices.
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.
It is a part that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken
- from the people.
- Mark you that?
To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, as if I had received them for the hire of their breath only.
To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor!
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul!
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
Let me overleap that custom.
The people must have their voices.
Have you not known the worthiest men have done it?
Custom calls me to it.
What custom wills, in all things should we do it.
What must I say?
"Look, sir, my wounds.
I got them in my country's service."
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that.
You must desire them to think upon you.
Think upon me?
Hang 'em.
I would they would forget me.
Pray you, speak to them.
I pray you, in wholesome manner.
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean.
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
We do, sir.
Tell us what hath brought you to it.
- Mine own desert.
- Your own desert?
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it.
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private.
Your good voice, sir.
What say you?
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged.
Adieu.
But this is something odd.
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voice that I may be consul.
You've deserved nobly of your country, and you've not deserved nobly.
Your enigma?
You've been a scourge to her enemies, you've been a rod to her friends.
You've not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.
I'll make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.
Your voices!
For your voices I have fought.
Watched for your voices.
For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd.
Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of!
For your voices have done many things, some less, some more.
Your voices!
Indeed, I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!
- Aye.
- Aye.
Therefore, let him be consul!
- Amen!
- Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Worthy voices!
Worthy voices, worthy voices.
You have stood your limitation.
And the tribunes now endow you with the people's voice.
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged.
The people do admit you, and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation.
- Where?
At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.
I'll keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
God save thee, noble consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, my masters!
My masters!
My masters, how now!
- Have you chose this man?
- Aye!
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Amen, sir.
To my poor, unworthy notice, he mocked us when he begged our voices.
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright.
O, no, no, no, it is his kind of speech.
- Aye.
- He did not mock us.
He should have showed us his marks of merit,
- wounds received for his country.
- Yes!
- Why, I'm sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't!
No, no, no!
No!
No!
No one saw them!
Was this mockery?
Yes!
When he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy.
Ever spake against your liberties.
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?
Aye!
It is not confirmed.
It is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!
And will deny him!
I'll have 500 voices of that sound.
- Yes!
- I twice 500 and their friends!
Yes!
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties!
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment, all revoke your ignorant election.
Enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you!
And, presently, when you have drawn the number, repair to the senate.
Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
He has, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
How?
What?
How often he had met you, sword to sword.
That of all things upon the earth, he hated your person most.
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, to oppose his hatred fully.
Come, Rome must know the value of her own.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, the tongues of the common mouth.
- Pass no further.
- Ah?
What is that?
It will be dangerous to go on.
No further.
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.
- Are these your herd?
- Be calm, be calm.
The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them time-pleasers,
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.
You show too much of that for which the people stir.
If you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit.
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.
This was my speech, and I'll speak it again.
- Not now, not now.
- Not in this heat, sir.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves.
I say again, in soothing them, we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honored number who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
but that which we have given to beggars!
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you.
You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
It were well we let the people know it.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, by Jove, it would be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
Mark you his absolute "shall"?
Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, more worthier than their voices!
By Jove himself, it makes the consuls base, and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other.
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears, which will, in time, break open the locks of the senate, and bring in the crows to peck the eagles!
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure.
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do!
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul?
No!
Seize him!
Hence, old goat!
On both sides more respect!
Shh!
Shh!
Here's he that would take from you all your power!
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you,
Martius, whom late you have named for consul.
- What is the city but the people?
!
- True!
The people are the city!
The people are the city!
We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,
Martius is worthy of present death!
Death!
- Guards, seize him!
- No, I'll die here!
Get you to your house!
Be gone, away!
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults.
Consul?
What consul?
- The Consul Coriolanus.
- He, consul?
It is decreed he dies tonight.
He's a disease that must be cut away.
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?
Killing our enemies?
The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country.
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more...
Consider this:
He's been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled in graceful language.
Give me leave.
I'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form, in peace, to his utmost peril.
Noble tribunes, it is the humane way.
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.
In you bring not Martius, we'll proceed in our first way.
I'll bring him to you.
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
- yet will I still be thus to them!
- Martius...
I muse my mother does not approve me further.
I talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?
Would you have me false to my nature?
Rather say I play the man I am.
Sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out.
- Let go.
- You might have been enough the man you are, with striving less to be so.
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.
Come, come, you've been too rough, something too rough.
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy, unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst and perish.
Pray, be counseled.
I have a heart as little apt as yours, but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage.
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must I do?
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then?
What then?
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods.
Must I then do it to them?
You are too absolute.
I've heard you say that honor and policy, like unsevered friends in war, do grow together.
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people, not by your own instruction, nor by the matter your heart prompts you, but with such words that are but roted in your tongue, though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor.
I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles... and you.
I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier.
And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves.
But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours.
I prithee, go and be ruled.
Sir, it is fit you make strong party, or defend yourself by calmness or by absence.
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.
I think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit.
He must.
He will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
Must I, with base tongue, give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I'll do it.
Away, my disposition, and possess me some harlot's spirit.
A beggar's tongue make motion through my lips.
I will not do it.
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth, and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
At thy choice, then.
To beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them.
Come all to ruin.
Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'st it from me, but owe thy pride thyself.
Pray, be content, Mother, I'm going.
Chide me no more.
Look, I am going.
I'll return consul, or never trust to what my tongue can do
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.
In this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power.
If he evade us there, enforce him with his hatred to the people.
Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll?
I have.
It's ready.
When the people hear me say
"It shall be so in the right and strength of the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then, let them, if they hear me say "Fine," cry "Fine."
- If "Death," cry "Death."
- We shall inform them.
God preserve thee.
The people are the city.
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.
Calmly, I beseech you.
The honored gods...
The honored gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men, plant love among us, throng our large temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with war.
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, if you submit you to the people's voices.
Aye.
- I am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
The warlike service he has done, consider.
Think upon the wounds his body bears, which show like graves in the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers, scars to move laughter only.
Consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen, you find him like a soldier.
Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as I say, such as become a soldier.
What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again?
We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office, and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical, for which you are a traitor to the people.
How... traitor?
- Traitor!
- Nay, temperately.
Your promise.
The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people.
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.
Traitor!
But since he hath served well for Rome...
What do you prate of service?
- I talk of that, that know it.
- You?
Is this the promise you made your mother?
I'll know no further.
Let them pronounce death, exile, flaying,
I would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word.
In the name of the people, and in the power of us, the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish him our city.
In the people's name, I say...
it shall be so.
- It shall be so!
- He's banished.
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...
- He's sentenced.
No more hearing.
- Let me speak.
- It shall be so!
- I have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies' marks upon me...
There is no more to be said, but he is banished as enemy
- to the people and his country!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
You common cry of curs!
Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air.
I... banish... you!
And there remain with your uncertainty.
Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts.
Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair.
Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows.
Despising, for you, the city thus I turn my back.
There is a world... elsewhere.
The people's enemy is gone!
Whoo!
Nay, Mother, where is your ancient courage?
You are too absolute.
Nay, Mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked.
I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.
The gods keep you.
This is a happier and more comely time.
- Yeah.
- Good day.
Good day.
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.
The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love.
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!
I would I had the power to say so to my husband.
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?
I tell thee what, fool, hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words?
Blessed heavens...
More noble blows than ever thou wise words, and for Rome's good.
Yet go.
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.
I tell thee what.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!
- Bastards and all.
- Come!
Come, peace!
Well, well, we'll leave you.
Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses!
Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it.
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat.
I sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding.
- Come.
- Come, madam.
Hey.
Aufidius!
Ah, general.
Yes.
Well, well.
Hey, hey!
Whence comes thou?
Thy name?
Speak, man.
What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, and harsh in sound to thine.
Say... what's thy name?
Thou has a grim appearance.
What's thy name?
- Know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not.
Thy name?
My name is Caius Martius who hath done to thee, particularly, and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief.
Thereto witness may my surname Coriolanus.
Only that name remains.
The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest, and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome.
Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if I had feared death, of all men in the world
I would have avoided thee.
But, in mere spite, to be full quit of those, my banishers, stand I before thee here.
I will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends.
But if thou dares not this, then I present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice, which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since I have ever followed thee with hate, and cannot live but to thy shame
unless it be to do thee service.
O Martius...
Martius...
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
Let me twine mine arms about that body.
Know thou I loved the maid I married, never man sighed truer breath.
But that I see thee here, thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when I first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold.
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, thou hast beat me out 12 several times.
and I have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.
Worthy Martius, had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that thou art thence banished, we would muster all from 12 to 70, and, pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, like a bold flood, overbear it.
Come, go in, and take our friendly senators by the hands.
You bless me, gods.
Therefore, most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission.
And set down as best thou art experienced, since thou knows thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of Rome, or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them, ere destroy.
- Is this Menenius?
- O, 'tis he, 'tis he.
O, he's grown most kind of late.
- Hail, sir.
- Hail to you both.
Your Coriolanus is not much missed, but with his friends.
All's well, and might have been much better
- if he could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?
I hear nothing.
His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.
Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war, but insolent, overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, self-loving...
I think not so.
And Rome sits safe and still without him.
- Shh!
- Shh!
There are reports the Volsces, with two several powers, are entered in the Roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war, destroy what lies before them.
- Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius, who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns into the world again.
Come, what talk you of Martius?
It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be?
We have record that it can.
The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House.
Some news is coming that turns their countenances.
Yes, the first report is seconded, and more more fearful is delivered.
Martius has joined with Aufidius.
He leads a power against Rome, and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius, associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories, and have already overborne their way, consumed with fire, and took what lay before them.
Martius has joined with the Volscians.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies.
Do they still fly to the Roman?
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, their talk at table, and their thanks at end.
And you are darkened in this action, sir.
He bears himself more proud, even to my person, than I thought he would when first I did embrace him.
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature.
Whether it was pride, whether defect of judgment or whether nature, not to be other than one thing, made him feared, so hated, and so banished so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time.
One fire drives out one fire one nail, one nail.
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
When, Caius,
Rome is thine, thou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mine.
No, I'll not go.
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banished him.
A mile before his tent, fall down, and kneel the way into his mercy.
He would not seem to know me.
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops that we have bled together.
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to, forbad all names.
He was a kind of nothing.
Titleless.
Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome.
If you refuse your aid in this...
If you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman.
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius.
Well, and say "Martius return me, as Titus is returned, unhurt."
What then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome.
You know the very road into his kindness, and cannot lose your way.
I'll undertake it.
I think he'll hear me.
- He'll never hear him.
- No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold his eye, red, as it would burn Rome.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does.
O Martius, Martius.
Thou art preparing fire for us.
Look thee there's water to quench it.
I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee,
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome.
Away.
How?
Away?
Wife... mother... child...
I know not.
My affairs are servanted to others.
- Sir...
- Therefore be gone.
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.
This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings.
He's more than a creeping thing.
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.
My lord and husband.
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so.
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny, but do not say for that "Forgive our Romans."
O, a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge.
Ye gods, I prate, and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted.
Sink, my knee, in the earth.
Stand up, blest.
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
- I kneel before thee.
- What's this?
Your knees to me?
To your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior.
I helped to frame thee.
This is a poor epitome of yours, which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may'st prove to shame, invulnerable.
Your knee, sir.
Even he, your wife, this lady and myself,
- are suitors to you.
- I beseech you, peace.
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural.
Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons.
No more, no more.
You have said you will not grant us anything, for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already.
Yet we will ask, that if you fail in our request, the blame may hang upon your hardness.
Therefore hear us.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.
For we'll hear naught from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile.
Think with thyself.
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother, wife, and child
to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out.
And we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win.
For either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles through our streets, or else, triumphantly, tread on thy country's ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood.
For myself... son I purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine.
If I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world.
Aye, and mine, that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time.
You shall not tread on me.
I'll run away till I'm bigger but then I'll fight!
- I have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans, thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve, thou might'st condemn us as poisonous of your honor.
No.
Our suit is that you reconcile them.
So that the Voices may say "This mercy we have showed,"
the Romans, "This we've received,"
and each on either side give the all-hail to thee and cry,
"Be blest for making up this peace!"
Speak to me, son.
Why dost not speak?
Speak you, daughter.
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy.
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons.
There's no man in the world more bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks!
Thou hast never, in thy life, shown thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor.
Say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs.
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees!
Down!
This is the last.
An end.
So we will home to Rome, and die among our neighbors.
Nay.
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot tell what he would have yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship.
Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it.
Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother!
His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance.
Yet give us our dispatch I am hushed until our city be afire, and then I'll speak a little.
O Mother...
Mother...
What have you done?
Behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at.
O my mother!
Mother!
O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome.
But for your son, believe it.
O believe it.
Most... dangerously you have prevailed with him.
If not most mortal to him.
But let it come.
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less?
Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.
But, good sir, what peace you'll make, advise me.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
We have all great cause to give great thanks.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain.
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction.
I raised him, and I pawned mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened, he watered his new plants with dews of flattery, seducing so my friends.
At the last, I seemed his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary.
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.
And, in the last, when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory...
There was it!
For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor of our great action.
Therefore shall he die and I'll renew me in his fall.
Say no more.
I am returned your soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when I parted hence, but still subsisting under your great command.
We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans.
Tell the traitor, in the highest degree
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor?
How now?
Aye, traitor, Martius.
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.
Caius Martius.
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?
Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome.
I say "your city," for his wife and mother.
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk.
Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory.
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it.
"Boy"?
O slave.
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me!
"Boy"?
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there that, like an eagle in a dovecote,
I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
Alone I did it.
"Boy."
Let him die for it.
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
Resolved.
First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.
- We know it.
- Let us kill him.
And we will have corn at our own price.
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, our suffering, is a gain to them.
Aye...
Let us revenge this with our sticks, ere we become rakes.
No more talking on it.
Come.
Soft, soft, who comes here?
...friends, mine honest neighbors...
Worthy Senator Menenius, one that has always loved the people.
I tell you, friends, most charitable care have the patricians of you.
For your wants, your suffering in this dearth, you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the Roman state.
Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain.
Bread.
- Bread.
- Bread.
Bread.
Bread, bread, bread....
Bread, bread, bread...
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word.
He that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring.
What would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war?
The one affrights you, the other makes you proud.
He that trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares, where foxes, geese.
Who deserves greatness, deserves your hate.
Hang ye.
Trust ye?
With every minute you do change your mind, and call him noble that was now your hate, him vile that was your garland.
What's the matter, that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?
Go.
Get you home you fragments.
- Go back.
- Forward.
Go back.
- Please...
- Know you me yet?
I know you well.
Your name, I think, is Aufidius.
It is so.
- I am a Roman.
- What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections.
- The people against the senators.
- Hath been?
Is it ended then?
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again.
You have ended my business.
The news is the Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to it.
I sin in envying his nobility.
And were I anything but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together?
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt.
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
Lead you on.
So your opinion is, Aufidius, that they of Rome are entered in our counsels
- and know how we proceed.
- Is it not yours?
It is not four days gone since I heard thence.
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim.
And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads on this preparation.
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, it is sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more.
If ever again I meet him beard to beard, he's mine or I am his.
Mark me.
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts.
He that retires, I will take him for a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge.
Go.
Come on.
Away.
The citizens of Corioles have issued and given to Titus and to Martius battle.
We have heard their drums.
I saw our forces to their trenches driven, and then I came away...
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
If my son were my husband,
I would more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb,
I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame.
To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Then his good report should have been my son.
Hear me.
Had I a dozen sons,
I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius.
He will beat Aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck.
Me thinks I hear hither your husband's drum.
I see him.......
stamp....... thus, cry thus:
Come on, you cowards.
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome.
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men.
Pluto and hell.
Look to it.
Come on.
Mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, I will leave the foe and make my wars on you.
His bloody brow then wiping, forth he goes.
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.
Away, you fool.
It more becomes a man than gold his trophy.
Senator Menenius is come to visit you.
Tell him we are fit to bid him welcome.
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- Indeed, you shall not.
- My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both?
And how does your little son?
I thank you, sir.
Well, good.
He'd rather play with swords and hear a drum
- than look upon his schoolmaster.
- On my word, the father's son.
Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.
No, good sir, I will not out of doors.
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.
Indeed, no, by your patience.
I will not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.
- I cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
No, good sir.
Pardon me.
Indeed, I will not forth.
Go with me, and I will tell you excellent news of your husband.
No, good sir, there can be none yet.
- There came news from him last night.
- Indeed?
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Carioles.
They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars.
This is true, on mine honor.
So, I pray, go out with us.
Give me excuse, good sir.
I will obey you in everything hereafter.
Let her alone.
As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.
- What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless.
He is himself alone, to answer all the city.
Thou art lost, Martius.
Who's yonder, that does appear as he were flayed?
O gods.
He has the stamp of Martius.
- Come I too late?
- Come I too late?
Aye, if you come not in the blood of others, but mantled in your own.
Let me hold you in arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done.
There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight.
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.
The blood I drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me.
To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight.
If any such be here, as it were sin to doubt, that love this painting wherein you see me smeared, if any fear lesser his person than an ill report, if any think brave death outweighs bad life,
and that his country is dearer than himself, let him alone, or so many so minded wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow Martius.
O... me alone.
Make you a sword of me.
Oi.
Advance, brave Titus.
Away.
Come.
Come.
I will fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee.
We hate alike.
Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee.
So often has thou beat me, and would do so, I fear, should we encounter as often as we eat.
For where I thought to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, I will potch at him some way.
Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.
Bolder, though not so subtle.
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius.
Where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.
Honorable Menenius.
My boy, Martius, approaches.
For the love of Juno, let's go.
Is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.
O yes, he is wounded.
I thank the gods for it.
O, so do I too, if it be not too much.
Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius said they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
Gods grant them true.
- True.
- I will be sworn they're true.
Where is he wounded?
In the shoulder and in the left arm.
There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
He had, before this last expedition,
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.
Every gash was an enemy's grave.
Before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm doth lie.
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
Be it known, as to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius wears this war's garland.
And, from this time, for what he did before Corioles, call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host:
"Caius Martius Coriolanus." Bear the addition nobly ever.
Caius Martius Coriolanus.
No more of this.
It does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother.
O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods for my prosperity.
Nay, my good soldier, up.
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honor newly named...
What is it?
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife...
My gracious silence, hail.
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home, that weeps to see me triumph?
Aye, my dear, such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, and mothers that lack sons.
- Now, the gods crown thee.
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh.
I am light and heavy.
I know not where to turn.
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.
- A hundred thousand welcomes.
- Welcome all.
Welcome, Coriolanus.
Welcome.
It is thought that Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and the blind to hear him speak.
Matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed.
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.
And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius?
He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people...
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
You blame Martius for being proud?
- We do it not alone, sir.
- I know you can do very little alone.
You talk of pride.
O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves.
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy politicians, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it.
One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning.
What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.
You're ambitious.
Good e'en to your worships.
More of your conversation would infect my brain.
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say, but it is thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow, but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people.
There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them.
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition.
And, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see it.
But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him.
Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well.
And would be content to give him good report for it, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.
The good senators must be visited, from whom I have received not only greetings, but with them change of honors.
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy.
Only there's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee.
Good mother, I'd rather be their servant in my way, than sway with them in theirs.
Coriolanus will carry it.
He's a worthy man.
He will carry it.
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, during his power, go asleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end, but will lose those he hath won.
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear in the marketplace, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word.
It shall be to him then, a sure destruction.
So it must fall out to him, or our authorities, for an end.
We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them.
Kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze shall darken him forever.
It remains, as the main point of this our after-meeting, to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country.
Therefore, please you, most grave and reverend elders, to desire the present consul, and last general in our well-found successes, to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.
- Speak, good Cominius.
- Aye.
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.
Never shame to hear what you have nobly done.
Your honor's pardon.
I'd rather have my wounds to heal again
- than hear say how I got them.
- Pray you, sit down.
I'd rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered.
- Speak, good Cominius.
- Aye, proceed.
The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly.
It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver.
If it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
At 16 years, he fought beyond the mark of others.
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man in the field.
And in the brunt of 17 battles since, he lurched all swords of the garland.
For this last, before and in Corioles, let me say I cannot speak him home.
He stopped the fliers, and by his rare example, made coward turn terror into sport, from face to foot.
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
Alone, he entered the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny.
Aidless came off, and with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioles like a planet.
Until we called both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting.
Our spoils he kicked at, and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world.
He covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
Aye.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you, let me overleap that custom, for I cannot entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage.
Please you that I may pass this doing.
Sir.
The people must have their voices.
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.
It is a part that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken
- from the people.
- Mark you that?
To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus."
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, as if I had received them for the hire of their breath only.
To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor.
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
Let me overleap that custom.
The people must have their voices.
Have you not known the worthiest men have done it?
Custom calls me to it.
What custom wills, in all things should we do it.
What must I say?
"Look, sir, my wounds.
I got them in my country's service."
O me, the gods.
You must not speak like that.
You must desire them to think upon you.
Think upon me?
Hang them.
I would they would forget me.
Pray you, speak to them.
I pray you, in wholesome manner.
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean.
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
We do, sir.
Tell us what hath brought you to it.
- Mine own desert.
- Your own desert?
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it.
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private.
Your good voice, sir.
What say you?
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged.
Adieu.
But this is something odd.
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voice that I may be consul.
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly.
Your enigma?
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have been a rod to her friends.
You have not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.
I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.
Your voices.
For your voices I have fought.
Watched for your voices.
For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd.
Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of.
For your voices have done many things, some less, some more.
Your voices.
Indeed, I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice.
- Aye.
- Aye.
Therefore, let him be consul.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Worthy voices.
Worthy voices, worthy voices.
You have stood your limitation.
And the tribunes now endow you with the people's voice.
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged.
The people do admit you, and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation.
- Where?
At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.
I will keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
God save thee, noble consul.
Consul.
Consul.
Consul.
Consul.
Consul.
Consul.
How now, my masters.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, my masters.
My masters.
My masters, how now.
- Have you chose this man?
- Aye.
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Amen, sir.
To my poor, unworthy notice, he mocked us when he begged our voices.
- He mocked us.
- Flouted us downright.
O, no, no, no, it is his kind of speech.
- Aye.
- He did not mock us.
He should have showed us his marks of merit,
- wounds received for his country.
- Yes.
- Why, I am sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't.
No, no, no.
No.
No.
No one saw them.
Was this mockery?
Yes.
When he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy.
Ever spake against your liberties.
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?
Aye.
It is not confirmed.
It is not confirmed.
We may deny him yet.
And will deny him.
I will have 500 voices of that sound.
- Yes.
- I twice 500 and their friends.
Yes.
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties.
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment, all revoke your ignorant election.
Enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you.
And, presently, when you have drawn the number, repair to the senate.
Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
He has, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
How?
What?
How often he had met you, sword to sword.
That of all things upon the earth, he hated your person most.
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, to oppose his hatred fully.
Come, Rome must know the value of her own.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, the tongues of the common mouth.
- Pass no further.
- Ah?
What is that?
It will be dangerous to go on.
No further.
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.
- Are these your herd?
- Be calm, be calm.
The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them time-pleasers,
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.
You show too much of that for which the people stir.
If you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit.
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.
This was my speech, and I will speak it again.
- Not now, not now.
- Not in this heat, sir.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves.
I say again, in soothing them, we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honored number who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
but that which we have given to beggars.
- Well, no more.
- No more words, we beseech you.
You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
It were well we let the people know it.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, by Jove, it would be my mind.
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
Mark you his absolute "shall"?
Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
I will give my reasons, more worthier than their voices.
By Jove himself, it makes the consuls base, and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other.
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears, which will, in time, break open the locks of the senate, and bring in the crows to peck the eagles.
- Come, enough.
- Enough, with over-measure.
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do.
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee.
- Manifest treason.
- This is a consul?
No.
Seize him.
Hence, old goat.
On both sides more respect.
Shh.
Shh.
Here's he that would take from you all your power.
You are at point to lose your liberties.
Martius would have all from you,
Martius, whom late you have named for consul.
- What is the city but the people?
- True.
The people are the city.
The people are the city.
We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,
Martius is worthy of present death.
Death.
- Guards, seize him.
- No, I will die here.
Get you to your house.
Be gone, away.
- All will be naught else.
- Come, sir, along with us.
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults.
Consul?
What consul?
- The Consul Coriolanus.
- He, consul?
It is decreed he dies tonight.
He's a disease that must be cut away.
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?
Killing our enemies?
The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country.
- This is clean kam.
- We will hear no more...
Consider this:
He's been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled in graceful language.
Give me leave.
I will go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form, in peace, to his utmost peril.
Noble tribunes, it is the humane way.
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.
If you bring not Martius, we will proceed in our first way.
I will bring him to you.
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
- yet will I still be thus to them.
- Martius...
I muse my mother does not approve me further.
I talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?
Would you have me false to my nature?
Rather say I play the man I am.
Sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out.
- Let go.
- You might have been enough the man you are, with striving less to be so.
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.
Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough.
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy, unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst and perish.
Pray, be counseled.
I have a heart as little apt as yours, but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage.
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must I do?
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then?
What then?
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods.
Must I then do it to them?
You are too absolute.
I have heard you say that honor and policy, like unsevered friends in war, do grow together.
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people, not by your own instruction, nor by the matter your heart prompts you, but with such words that are but roted in your tongue, though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor.
I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles........ and you.
I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier.
And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves.
But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours.
I prithee, go and be ruled.
Sir, it is fit you make strong party, or defend yourself by calmness or by absence.
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.
I think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit.
He must.
He will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
Must I, with base tongue, give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I will do it.
Away, my disposition, and possess me some harlot's spirit.
A beggar's tongue make motion through my lips.
I will not do it.
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth, and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
At thy choice, then.
To beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them.
Come all to ruin.
Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'st it from me, but owe thy pride thyself.
Pray, be content, Mother, I am going.
Chide me no more.
Look, I am going.
I will return consul, or never trust to what my tongue can do
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.
In this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power.
If he evade us there, enforce him with his hatred to the people.
Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll?
I have.
It's ready.
When the people hear me say
"It shall be so in the right and strength of the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then, let them, if they hear me say "Fine," cry "Fine."
- If "Death," cry "Death."
- We shall inform them.
God preserve thee.
The people are the city.
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.
Calmly, I beseech you.
The honored gods...
The honored gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men, plant love among us, throng our large temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with war.
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, if you submit you to the people's voices.
Aye.
- I am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
The warlike service he has done, consider.
Think upon the wounds his body bears, which show like graves in the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers, scars to move laughter only.
Consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen, you find him like a soldier.
Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as I say, such as become a soldier.
What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again?
We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office, and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical, for which you are a traitor to the people.
How... traitor?
for which you are a traitor to the people.
How... traitor?
- Traitor.
- Nay, temperately.
Your promise.
The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people.
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.
Traitor.
But since he hath served well for Rome...
What do you prate of service?
- I talk of that, that know it.
- You?
Is this the promise you made your mother?
I will know no further.
Let them pronounce death, exile, flaying,
I would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word.
In the name of the people, and in the power of us, the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish him our city.
In the people's name, I say...
it shall be so.
- It shall be so.
- He's banished.
It shall be so.
It shall be so.
- It shall be so.
- Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...
- He's sentenced.
No more hearing.
- Let me speak.
- It shall be so.
- I have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies' marks upon me...
There is no more to be said, but he is banished as enemy
- to the people and his country.
- It shall be so.
- It shall be so.
- It shall be so.
It shall be so.
It shall be so.
It shall be so.
It shall be so.
- It shall be so.
- It shall be so.
It shall be so.
It shall be so.
It shall be so.
It shall be so.
It shall be so.
It shall be so.
You... common... cry... of... curs.
Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air.
I... banish... you.
And here remain with your uncertainty.
Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts.
Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair.
Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows.
Despising, for you, the city thus I turn my back.
There is a world... elsewhere.
The people's enemy is gone.
Whoo.
Nay, Mother, where is your ancient courage?
You are too absolute.
Nay, Mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked.
I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.
The gods keep you.
This is a happier and more comely time.
- Yeah.
- Good day.
Good day.
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.
The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love.
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too.
I would I had the power to say so to my husband.
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?
I tell thee what, fool, hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words?
Blessed heavens...
More noble blows than ever thou wise words, and for Rome's good.
Yet go.
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.
I tell thee what.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity.
- Bastards and all.
- Come.
Come, peace.
Well, well, we will leave you.
Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses.
Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it.
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.
You will sup with me?
Anger's my meat.
I sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding.
- Come.
- Come, madam.
Hey.
Aufidius.
Ah, general.
Yes.
Well, well.
Hey, hey.
Whence comes thou?
Thy name?
Speak, man.
What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, and harsh in sound to thine.
Say... what's thy name?
Thou has a grim appearance.
What's thy name?
- Know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not.
Thy name?
My name is Caius Martius who hath done to thee, particularly, and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief.
Thereto witness may my surname Coriolanus.
Only that name remains.
The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest, and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome.
Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if I had feared death, of all men in the world
I would have avoided thee.
But, in mere spite, to be full quit of those, my banishers, stand I before thee here.
I will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends.
But if thou dares not this, then I present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice, which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since I have ever followed thee with hate, and cannot live but to thy shame
unless it be to do thee service.
O Martius...
Martius...
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
Let me twine mine arms about that body.
Know thou I loved the maid I married, never man sighed truer breath.
But that I see thee here, thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when I first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold.
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, thou hast beat me out 12 several times, and I have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.
Worthy Martius, had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that thou art thence banished, we would muster all from 12 to 70, and, pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, like a bold flood, overbear it.
Come, go in, and take our friendly senators by the hands.
You bless me, gods.
Therefore, most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission.
And set down as best thou art experienced, since thou knows thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of Rome, or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them, ere destroy.
- Is this Menenius?
- O, it is he, it is he.
O, he's grown most kind of late.
- Hail, sir.
- Hail to you both.
Your Coriolanus is not much missed, but with his friends.
All's well, and might have been much better
- if he could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?
I hear nothing.
His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.
Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war, but insolent, overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, self-loving...
I think not so.
And Rome sits safe and still without him.
- Shh.
- Shh.
There are reports the Volsces, with two several powers, are entered in the Roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war, destroy what lies before them.
- Shh.
- It is Aufidius, who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns into the world again.
Come, what talk you of Martius?
It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be?
We have record that it can.
The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House.
Some news is coming that turns their countenances.
Yes, the first report is seconded, and more more fearful is delivered.
Martius has joined with Aufidius.
He leads a power against Rome, and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius, associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories, and have already overborne their way, consumed with fire, and took what lay before them.
Martius has joined with the Volscians.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies.
Do they still fly to the Roman?
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, their talk at table, and their thanks at end.
And you are darkened in this action, sir.
He bears himself more proud, even to my person, than I thought he would when first I did embrace him.
Sir, I beseech you, think you he will carry Rome?
I think he will be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature.
Whether it was pride, whether defect of judgment or whether nature, not to be other than one thing, made him feared, so hated, and so banished so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time.
One fire drives out one fire one nail, one nail.
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
When.....
Caius......
Rome is thine, thou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mine.
No, I will not go.
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banished him.
A mile before his tent, fall down, and kneel the way into his mercy.
He would not seem to know me.
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops that we have bled together.
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to, forbad all names.
He was a kind of nothing.
Titleless.
Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome.
If you refuse your aid in this...
If you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman.
- No, I will not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius.
Well, and say "Martius return me, as Titus is returned, unhurt."
What then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome.
You know the very road into his kindness, and cannot lose your way.
I will undertake it.
I think he will hear me.
- He will never hear him.
- No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold his eye, red, as it would burn Rome.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does.
O Martius, Martius.
Thou art preparing fire for us.
Look thee there's water to quench it.
I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee,
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome.
Away.
- "How"?
- "Away"?
Wife... mother... child...
I know not.
My affairs are servanted to others.
- Sir...
- Therefore be gone.
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.
This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings.
He's more than a creeping thing.
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.
My lord and husband.
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so.
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny, but do not say for that "Forgive our Romans."
O, a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge.
Ye gods, I prate, and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted.
Sink, my knee, in the earth.
Stand up, blest.
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
- I kneel before thee.
- What's this?
Your knees to me?
To your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior.
I helped to frame thee.
This is a poor epitome of yours, which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may'st prove to shame, invulnerable.
Your knee, sir.
Even he, your wife, this lady and myself,
- are suitors to you.
- I beseech you, peace.
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural.
Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons.
No more, no more.
You have said you will not grant us anything, for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already.
Yet we will ask, that if you fail in our request, the blame may hang upon your hardness.
Therefore hear us.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.
For we will hear naught from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile.
Think with thyself.
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother, wife, and child
to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out.
And we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win.
For either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles through our streets, or else, triumphantly, tread on thy country's ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood.
For myself... son I purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine.
If I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world.
Aye, and mine, that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time.
You shall not tread on me.
I will run away till I am bigger but then I will fight.
- I have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans, thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve, thou might'st condemn us as poisonous of your honor.
No.
Our suit is that you reconcile them.
So that the Volces may say "This mercy we have showed,"
the Romans, "This we have received,"
and each on either side give the all-hail to thee and cry,
"Be blest for making up this peace."
Speak to me, son.
Why dost not speak?
Speak you, daughter.
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy.
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons.
There's no man in the world more bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks.
Thou hast never, in thy life, shown thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor.
Say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs.
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees.
Down.
This is the last.
An end.
So we will home to Rome, and die among our neighbors.
Nay.
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot tell what he would have yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship.
Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it.
Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother.
His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance.
Yet give us our dispatch I am hushed until our city be afire, and then I will speak a little.
O Mother...
Mother...
What have you done?
Behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at.
O my mother.
Mother.
O.
You have won a happy victory to Rome.
But for your son, believe it.
O believe it.
Most... dangerously you have prevailed with him.
If not most mortal to him.
But let it come.
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars, I will frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less?
Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.
But, good sir, what peace you will make, advise me.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
We have all great cause to give great thanks.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain.
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction.
I raised him, and I pawned mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened, he watered his new plants with dews of flattery, seducing so my friends.
At the last, I seemed his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary.
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.
And, in the last, when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory...
There was it.
For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor of our great action.
Therefore shall he die and I will renew me in his fall.
Say no more.
I am returned your soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when I parted hence, but still subsisting under your great command.
We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans.
Tell the traitor, in the highest degree
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor?
How now?
Aye, traitor, Martius.
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.
Caius Martius.
Dost thou think I will grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?
Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome.
I say "your city," for his wife and mother.
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk.
Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory.
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it.
"Boy"?
O slave.
Cut me to pieces, Volsces.
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me.
"Boy"?
If you have writ your annals true, it is there that, like an eagle in a dovecote,
I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
Alone I did it.
"Boy."
Let him die for it.

Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
Resolved. resolved.
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
We know't, we know't.
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
We are accounted poor citizens,the patricians good.

Let us revenge this with our sticks and we become rakes.

I tell you, friends, most charitable care Have the patricians of you.
For your wants, Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them Against the Roman state, suffer us to famish, and their store-houses crammed with grain.

Hang ye!

With every minute you do change a mind,
And call him noble that was now your hate,
Him vile that was your garland.

You cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?

Ancient Volscian border dispute flares
Tullus Aufidius threatens Volscain attack on Rome
Volscian headquarters Antium
Please .
know you me yet?
I know you well, your name, I think, is Aufidius.
It is so .
I am a Roman .
What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections;
the people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
Hath been!
- is it ended, then?
- The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again you have ended my business .
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
The Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader,Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
I sin in envying his nobility,
And were I any thing but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together.
he is a lion that I am proud to hunt.
Titus Lartius, thou Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face
Lead you on.
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels ...
- And know how we proceed.
- Is it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone Since I heard thence;
By the discovery We shall be shorten'd in our aim .
and it is rumour'd, Marcius your old enemy, lead on this preparation .
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike Till one can do no more.
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his
Volscian city of Corioles
He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce, And he shall feel mine edge.
Go!
The citizens of Corioli have issued, And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle.
I saw our party to their trenches driven, And then I came away.
I pray you, daughter, sing;
or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
if my son were my husband,
I'm more free with rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour... than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb,
I, considering how honour would become such a person.
was pleased to let him seek danger , where he was like to find fame.
To a cruel war I sent him;
from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
But had he died in the business, madam; how then?
Then ... his good report should have been my son;
Hear me .
had I a dozen sons,
I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee And tread upon his neck
Methinks I hear ... hither your husband's drum,
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus
'Come on, you cowards!
you were got in fear, Though you were born in Rome'
You souls of geese,
That bear the shapes of men,
Pluto and hell!
look to't, come on .
Mend and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
And make my wars on you
his bloody brow With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
His bloody brow!
O Jupiter, no blood!
Away, you fool!
it more becomes a man Than gilt his trophy
The Senator Valeria is come to visit you.
Tell Valeria,We are fit to bid her welcome.
- Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- Indeed, you shall not.
My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both?
How does your little son?
Thank you,so well good .
He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than look upon his school-master.
O' my word, the father's son
Come, I must have you play the idle husewife with me this afternoon.
- No signore, non voglio uscire.
- No , I will not out of doors.
- She shall, she shall.
-Indeed, no, by your patience
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably
I cannot go thither.
You would be another Penelope yet, they say, all the yarn she spun in
Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
No, pardon me,indeed, I will not forth go with me and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
- Ma e' troppo presto per averne.
- there came news from him last night.
Indeed ?
your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars.
This is true, on mine honour and so, I pray, go out with us.
Give me excuse, But it's Ah...
I will obey you in every thing hereafter.
Let her alone, as she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.
What is become of Marcius?
Slain, sir, doubtless.
he is himself alone, To answer all the city.
Thou art left, Marcius
Who's yonder,that does appear as he were flay'd?
O gods, he has the stamp of Marcius
Come I too late?
Come I too late?
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others, But mantled in your own.
O, let me clip ye In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done
There is the man of my soul's hate,
Aufidius, Piercing my Romans .
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st.
Thy exercise hath been too violent for A second course of fight.
Sir, praise me not;
My work hath yet not warm'd me
The blood I drop is rather physical Than dangerous to me to Aufidius thus I will appear, and fight.
If any such be here-- As it were sin to doubt that love this painting Wherein you see me smear'd if any fear Lesser his person than an ill report
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
And that his country's dearer than himself Let him alone, or so many so minded, Wave thus, to express his disposition,
And follow Marcius !
O, me alone!
make you a sword of me .
Avanza, valoroso Tito!
Away !
- Come !
- Come!
I'll fight with none but thee for I do hate thee
We hate alike
Five times, Marcius, I have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me,
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter As often as we eat.
for where I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword,
I'll potch at him some way
Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.
Bolder, though not so subtle.
nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick,
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice, shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst my hate to Marcius
where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard,
even there, would I wash my fierce hand in's heart.
Honourable Menenius !
my boy Marcius approaches;
for the love of Juno, let's go.
Is he not wounded?
he was wont to come home wounded.
O, yes, he is wounded;
I thank the gods for't.
So do I too, if it be not too much brings a' victory in his pocket?
the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
The gods grant them true!
- True ?
-I'll be sworn they are true.
- Where is he wounded?
- I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall stand for his place
He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five wounds upon him.
Now it's twenty-seven every gash was an enemy's grave.
before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
be it known, as to us, to all the world that Caius Marcius Wears this war's garland and from this time, For what he did before Corioli, call him,With all the applause and clamour of the host,
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS!
Bear the addition nobly ever!
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS
No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother!
O,You have, I know, petition'd all the gods For my prosperity!
Nay, my good soldier, up .
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honour newly named, What is it ?
Coriolanus must I call you?
But O, thy wife!
My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home, That weep'st to see me triumph?
Ay, my dear, Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
And mothers that lack sons.
- Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh, I am light and heavy.
I know not where to turn
O, you're welcome home and ye're welcome all.
- A hundred thousand welcomes.
- Welcome home!
Welcome home,welcome!
Benvenuto Coriolano!
Will newly general coriolanus stand for consulship ?
'Tis thought that Marcius shall be consul
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to bear him speak matronsflunggloves,Ladiesand maids their scarfs and handkerchers,upon him as he pass'd thenoblesbended, As to Jove's statue,
and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts I never saw the like.
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people ...
- Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
- Nay. but his taunts.
The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Marcius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
You blame Marcius for being proud?
We do it not alone, sir.
I know you can do very little alone
You talk of pride
O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
O that you could!
What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber in't one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning
what I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing.
You are ambitious
God-den to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain
How many stand for consulships?
Three, they say , but 'tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and loves not the common people.
there had been many great men that have flattered the people, who ne'er loved them therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see't.
but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him
That seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well; and could be content to give him good report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
The good patricians must be visited;
From whom I have received not only greetings,
But with them change of honours.
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Our Rome will cast upon thee.
Know, good mother, I had rather be their servant in my way,
Than sway with them in theirs.
coriolanus wil win .
Well , he's a good man,he'll win .
- All tongues speak of him.
-On the sudden,I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, During his power, go sleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honours from where he should begin and end, but will Lose those he hath won.
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear i' the market-place nor on him put the napless vesture of humility
Nor showing, as the manner is his wounds To the people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word, It shall be to him then as our good wills,a sure destruction.
So it must fall out to him or our authorities.
For an end,
We must suggest the people in what hatred He still hath held them
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze Shall darken him for ever.
As the main point of this our after-meeting, To gratify his noble service that
Hath thus stood for his country therefore,please you,Most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul, and last general In our well-found successes to report a little of that worthy work perform'd By Caius Marcius Coriolanus
Speak, good Cominius
Nay, keep your place.
Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear What you have nobly done.
Your horror's pardon, I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them.
Pray now, sit down.
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monster'd.
- Parla, buon Comino.
- Cominio, procedi.
The deeds of Coriolanus Should not be utter'd feebly.
It is held that valour is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver if it be,the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
At sixteen years, he fought beyond the mark of others
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man i' the field,
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurch'd all swords of the garland.
For this last, Before and in Corioli, let me say,I cannot speak him home he stopp'd the fliers;
and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport from face to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries alone he enter'd The mortal gate of the city, whichhepaintedwithshunlessdestiny;
aidless came off, and with a sudden reinforcement struck Corioli like a planet andtillwe call'd Both field and city ours, he never stood To ease his breast with panting.
Our spoils he kick'd at,and look'd upon things precious as they were
And look'd upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world he covets less Than misery itself would give;
rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you, let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot entreat them, for my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage please you that I may pass this doing.
Sir, the people must have their voices
Pray you, go fit you to the custom
It is apart that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken from the people.
- Mark you that?
- To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
As if I had received them for the hire of their breath only!
and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour.
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased To make thee consul.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
- Let me o'erleap that custom,
- The people must have their voices have you not known the worthiest men have done't?
Custom calls me to't:
what custom wills, in all things should we do't,
What must I say?
Look, sir, my wounds!
I got them in my country's service,
O me, the gods!
You must not speak of that
- you must desire them to think upon you.
-Think upon me!
hang 'em!
I would they would forget me
pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you, In wholesome manner.
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean.
You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
- Mine own desert.
- Your own desert!
- Ay, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?
No, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly!
Sir, I pray, let me ha't
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private
Your good voice, sir; what say you?
You shall ha' it,worthy sir.
A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged , adieu.
But this is something odd.
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul,
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly.
Your enigma?
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have been a rod to her friends;
you have not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
Noi speriamo d'averti amico
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give you our voices heartily.
I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
Your voices for your voices I have fought;
Watch'd for your voices;
Your voices bear Of wounds two dozen odd;
battles thrice six I have seen and heard of;
for your voices have Done many things, some less,some more
your voices,
Indeed
I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice.
Therefore let him be consul
Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Worthy voices!
Worthy voices!
Worthy voices!
You have stood your limitation;
and the tribunes endue you with the people's voice
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged
The people do admit you, and are summon'd To meet anon, upon your approbation.
- Where?
at the senate-house?
- There, Coriolanus.
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.
I'll keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
God save thee, noble consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
my masters , my masters !
My masters , how now ?
!
have you chose this man?
Yes !
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Amen, sir to my poor unworthy notice, He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
He flouted us downright.
No, no,no, no
No,'tis his kind of speech, he did not mock us.
he should have show'd us His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
Why, I am sure,so he did .
No , he didn't .
No, no; no one saw 'em.
Was not this mockery?
Yes!
yes!
when he had no power,but was a petty servant to the state,He was your enemy, ever spake against your liberties
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you, When he hath power to crush?
Yes !
yes!
He's not confirm'd !
He's not confirm'd !
- we may deny him yet.
- Yes !
yes !
And will deny him
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
Yes !
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
Yes !
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends, they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties
Let them assemble,and on a safer judgment all revoke Your ignorant election;
enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you
And presently, when you have drawn your number, Repair to the Senate.
- Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
- He had, my lord .
- Saw you Aufidius?
- he is retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
- How?
what?
- How often he had met you, sword to sword;
That of all things upon the earth he hated Your person most,
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, To oppose his hatred fully.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, The tongues o' the common mouth
- Pass no further.
- Ha!
what is that?
It will be dangerous to go on
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give way .
- The people are incensed against him.
- Are these your herd?
- Be calm, be calm.
The people cry you mock'd them, They made call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.
- You show too much of that for which the people stir if you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way,with a gentler spirit,
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused; set on.
This was my speech, and I will speak't again--
Not now, not now.
Not in this heat, sir, now.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them Regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves
I say again,
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd,
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number, who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
- but that which they have given to beggars.
- Well, no more.
No more words, we beseech you.
You speak o' the people, as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
'Twere well We let the people know't.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
mark you his absolute 'shall'?
Why, shall the people give One that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, More worthier than their voices.
By Jove himself!
It makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter 'twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other.
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles.
- Come, enough.
- Enough, with over-measure.
Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do.
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This a consul?
no.
Hence, old goat!
On both sides more respect.
Here's he that would take from you all your power.
You are at point to lose your liberties
Marcius would have all from you;
Marcius, whom late you have named for consul.
What is the city but the people?
True, the people are the city.
the people are the city.
We do here pronounce, Upon the part o' the people,
Marcius is worthy of present death.
Death !
Death!
seize him!
No, I'll die here.
Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught else.
Come, sir, along with us.
As I do know the consul's worthiness, So can I name his faults,--
Consul!
what consul?
- The consul Coriolanus.
- He consul!
- It is decreed he dies to-night.
- He's a disease that must be cut away.
O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killing our enemies?
the blood he hath lost...
he dropp'd it for his country;
-This is clean kam.
-We'll hear no more.
Consider This!
he has been bred i' the wars Since he could draw a sword.
and is ill school'd In bolted language.
Give me leave, I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
Where he shall answer, by a lawful form In peace to his utmost peril.
Noble tribunes, It is the humane way.
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.
if you bring not Marcius... we'll proceed In our first way.
I'll bring him to you.
Let them puff all about mine ears!
present me Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels, yet will I still Be thus to them.
I muse my mother Does not approve me further!
I talk of you Why did you wish me milder?
would you have me False to my nature?
Rather say I play The man I am.
O, sir, sir, sir,
I would have had you put your power well on, Before you had worn it out.
Let go!
You might have been enough the man you are, With striving less to be so
- Let them hang!
- Ay, and burn too!
Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough;
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy;unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst, and perish.
Pray, be counsell'd:
I have a heart as little apt as yours,
But yet a brain... that leads my use of anger To better vantage.
- Well said, noble woman .
- What must I do?
- Return to the tribunes.
- Well, what then?
what then?
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?
You are too absolute;
I have heard you say,
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends, I' the war do grow together
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak To the people ot by your own instruction,
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
But with such words that are but rooted in Your tongue, hough but bastards and syllables Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required I should do so in honour
I am in this, Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
And you.
I prithee now, my son,
Go to them, be with them, say to them,
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils Hast not the soft way
In asking their good loves.
but... thou wilt frame Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
This but done, Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
Prithee now, Go, and be ruled.
sir,'tis fit You make strong party, or defend yourself By calmness or by absence
- all's in anger.
- Only fair speech.
I think 'twill serve, if he Can thereto frame his spirit.
He must do it!
You will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I will do't
Away, my disposition, and possess me Some harlot's spirit!
a beggar's tongue make motion through my lips
I will not do't,
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
And by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
At thy choice, then
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour Than thou of them.
Come all to ruin;
let Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
But owe thy pride thyself.
Pray, be content, Mother I am going,
Chide me no more.
Look!
I am going!
I'll return consul.
Or never trust to what my tongue can do I' the way of flattery further.
Do your will.
In this point charge him home, that he affects Tyrannical power, if he evade us there, Enforce him with his envy to the people,
Have you a catalogue Of all the voices that we have procured Set down by the poll?
I have; 'tis ready.
And the people hither me say 'It shall be so I' the right and strength o' the commons, ' be it either For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them hear me say Fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
I shall inform them.
May God preserve you!
The people are 'the city'.
I'm not been ready for each of common , Calmly, I do beseech you.
The honour'd...
The honour'd gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men!
plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace, And not our streets with war!
- Amen!
- Amen!
A noble wish.
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, If you submit you to the people's voices,
I am content.
Lo, citizens, he says he is content
The warlike service he has done.
Consider,think upon the wounds his body bears, which show Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers, Scars to move laughter only.
Consider further, That when he speaks not like a citizen,
You find him like a soldier.
do not take His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
But, as I say, such as become a soldier.
What is the matter That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour You take it off again?
We charge you, that you have contrived to take From Rome all season'd office, and to wind Yourself into a power tyrannical;
For which you are a traitor to the people.
traitor?
traitor!
- Nay, temperately; your promise.
- The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
Call me their traitor!
Thou injurious tribune!
Mark you this, people?
Yeah!
Traitor!
he hath Served well for Rome.
What do you prate of service?
- I talk of that, that know it.
- You!
Is this the promise that you made your mother?
I know no further , let them pronounce to the death, Exile, Flame,
I would not buy Their mercy at the price of one fair word!
in the name o' the people and in the power of us The tribunes we even from this instant, banish him our city, I' the people's name i say,
It shall be so, it shall be so.
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
It shall be so, it shall be so!
It shall be so, it shall be so!
Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...
- He's sentenced; no more hearing.
- Let me speak.
I have been consul, and can show for Rome Her enemies' marks upon me.
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
As enemy to the people and his country.
It shall be so, it shall be so!
It shall be so, it shall be so!
No!
You common cry of curs!
whose breath I hate as reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
As the dead carcasses of unburied men That do corrupt my air.
I banish you.
And here remain with your uncertainty!
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
Fan you into despair!
Have the power still To banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
Making not reservation of yourselves,
Still your own foes, deliver you, as most abated captives to some nation,
That won you without blows!
Despising,
For you,
The city.
Thus,
I turn my back.
There is a world,
Elsewhere.
The people's enemy is gone!
Nay, mother, Where is your ancient courage?
You are too absolute.
My mother, I shall be loved when I am lack'd.
I go alone.
Like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both!
- God-den to you all.
God-den to you all.
- Today the life and 'more' happy, more 'beautiful.
- Yes.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- Here comes his mother.
- They say she's mad.
O, ye're well met.
The hoarded plague o' the gods Requite your love!
Will you be gone?
You shall stay too , I would I had the power To say so to my husband.
Are you mad?
Ay, fool; is that a shame?
tell me what
Hadst thou craft To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
Than thou hast spoken words?
- O blessed heavens!
- More noble blows than ever thou wise words
And for Rome's good.
Now go 'way.
Nay, but thou shalt stay too.
Tell you what,
I would my son Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him, His good sword in his hand.
- What then?
- What then!
He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
- Bastards and all.
-Come, come, peace.
Well, well, let's go.
Why stay we to be baited With one that wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do,
But to confirm my curses!
Could I meet 'em But once a-day, it would unclog my heart Of what lies heavy to't.
You have told them home;
And, by my troth, you have cause.
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat.
I sup upon myself,
And so shall starve with feeding.
ANTIUM
Oh, Aufidius.
General!
Whence comest thou?
thy name?
Speak, man What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, And harsh in sound to thine.
Say!
What's thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance.
What's thy name?
- know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not.
- thy name?
- My name is Caius Marcius,
Who hath done To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces Great hurt and mischief.
thereto witness may my surname
Coriolanus.
Only that name remains,
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Who have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest.
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be Whoop'd out of Rome.
Now this extremity Hath brought me to thy hearth, ot out of hope-- Mistake me not--to save my life.
for if I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers, Stand I before thee here.
I will fight,
Against my canker'd country with the spleen Of all the under fiends.
But if so be Thou darest not this, and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice.
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
And cannot live but to thy shame,
Unless It be to do thee service.
O Marcius!
Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke, hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
Let me twine Mine arms, about that body,
Know thou ,
I loved the maid I married,
Never man Sigh'd truer breath.
but that I see thee here,
Thou noble thing!
More dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw Bestride my threshold.
Why, thou Mars!
I tell thee,
Thou hast beat me out Twelve several times, and I have nightly since Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me
Worthy Marcius,
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that Thou art thence banish'd,
We would muster all From twelve to seventy,
And pouring war Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear.
O, come, go in,
And take our friendly senators by the hands;
You bless me, gods!
Therefore,
Most absolute sir, if thou wilt have The leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission;
and set down...
As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st Thy country's strength and weakness...thine own ways;
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
Or rudely visit them in parts remote, To fright them, ere destroy.
Is this Menenius?
'Tis he,'tis he, O, he is grown most kind of late.
Hail sir!
Hail to you both!
Your Coriolanus Is not much miss'd, but with his friends ,
All's well;
and might have been much better, if He could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?
- Nay, I hear nothing
His mother and his wife Hear nothing from him.
Caius Marcius was A worthy officer i' the war... insolent, O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
- Self-loving...
- I think not so.
and Rome Sits safe and still without him.
There are reports the Volsces with two several powers Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
And with the deepest malice of the war Destroy what lies before 'em.
'Tis Aufidius!
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment, Thrusts forth his horns into the world again;
Come what talk you Of Marcius?
It cannot be The Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can,
The nobles in great earnestness are going All to the senate-house some news is come That turns their countenances.
Yes, The slave's report is seconded; and more, More fearful, is deliver'd.
Marcius, Join'd with Aufidius
Heleadsapower'gainstRome, And vows revenge as spacious as between The young'st and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius Associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories; and have already O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took What lay before them.
Marcius, Join'd with The Volsce.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies
Or butchers killing flies.
Do they still fly to the Roman?
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end
And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
He bears himself more proudlier, Even to my person, than I thought he would When first I did embrace him sir,
I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it By sovereignty of nature.
Whether 'twas pride,
Whether defect of judgment or whether nature, Not to be other than one thing, ...made him fear'd,
So hated, and so banish'd
So our virtues Lie in the interpretation of the time
One fire drives out one fire;
one nail, one nail;
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
When,
Caius,
Rome is thine,
Thou art poor'st of all;
then shortly... art thou mine.
No, I'll not go
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banish'd him!
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee The way into his mercy
He would not seem to know me.
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops That we have bled together.
Coriolanus He would not answer to forbad all names.
He was a... kind of nothing,
titleless,
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire Of burning Rome.
- if you refuse your aid...
- if you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue more than the instant army we can make, Might stop our countryman.
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.
What should I do?
Only make trial what your love can do For Rome, towards Marcius.
Well, and say that Marcius Return me, as Titus is return'd, Unheard; what then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome,
You know the very road into his kindness, And cannot lose your way.
I'll undertake 't
I think he'll hear me.
He'll never hear him.
No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold,
His eye red as 'twould burn Rome;
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does!
O Martius, Martius!
thou art preparing fire for us.
Look thee,
Here's water to quench it.
I was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee,
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs.
and conjure thee to pardon Rome,
Away!
HOW!
Away!
?
Wife, mother, child, I know not.
My affairs are servanted to others
- sir...
- Therefore, be gone.
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.
This Marcius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings;
He's more than a creeping thing.
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.
Coriolanus and Aufidius begin assault on Rome.
My lord and husband!
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed Makes you think so.
Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny.
but do not say For that 'Forgive our Romans'.
O, a kiss
Long as my exile,
Sweet as my revenge!
You gods!
I prate,
And the most noble mother of the world Leave unsaluted.
Sink, my knee, i' the earth;
O, stand up blest!
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint, I kneel before thee
What is this?
Your knees to me?
To your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee.
This is a poor epitome of yours,
Which by the interpretation of full time May show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove To shame unvulnerable,
Your knee, sirrah.
Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself, Are suitors to you.
I beseech you, peace!
Or, if you'ld ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.
Tell me not Wherein I seem unnatural
Desire not to ally my rages and revenges with Your colder reasons.
O, no more, no more!
You have said you will not grant us any thing,
For we have nothing else to ask, but that Which you deny already: yet we will ask,
That, if you fail in our request, the blame May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll Hear nought from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life We have led since thy exile.
Think!
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that thy sight which should Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow
Making the mother, wife and child to see
The son, the husband and the father tearing His country's bowels out.
We must find An evident calamity, though we had Our wish, which side should win for either thou.
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led With manacles thorough our streets, or else triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
Thy wife and children's blood.
For myself, son,
I purpose not to wait on fortune till These wars determine.
if I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner March to assault thy country than to tread--on thy mother's womb,
- That brought thee to this world.
- Ay, and mine,
That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name Living to time.
A' shall not tread on me!
I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight!
- I have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us, As poisonous of your honour, no
Our suit Is that you reconcile them
So the Volsces May say 'This mercy we have show'd the Romans, 'This we received;' and each in either side give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest for making up this peace!
'
Speak to me, son
Why dost not speak?
Daughter, speak you
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more Than can our reasons.
There's no man in the world More bound to 's mother, yet here he lets me prate Like one i' the stocks.
Thou hast never in thy life Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy, When she, poor hen, Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home, Loaden with honour.
Say my request's unjust, And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
Thou art not honest.
and the gods will plague thee,
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which To a mother's part belongs.
Down, ladies;
let us shame him with our knees.
Down!
This is the last!
pray.
so we will home to Rome, And die among our neighbours.
Nay, behold 's this boy, that cannot tell what he would have
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
Does reason our petition with more strength
Than thou hast to deny 't.
Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother,
His wife is in Corioli and his child Like him by chance.
Yet give us our dispatch.
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire, And then I'll speak a little.
O mother,
mother!
What have you done?
Behold,
the heavens, do ope,
The gods look down,
and this unnatural scene They laugh at.
O my mother, mother!
O mother!
Ah!
You have won a happy victory to Rome.
But, for your son,--believe it,
O, believe it!
Most,
Dangerously you have prevail'd with him,
If not most mortal to him.
But, let it come.
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, Were you in my stead, would you have heard A mother less?
or granted less, Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were!
And, sir, it is no little thing to make Mine eyes to sweat compassion.
But, good sir, What peace you'll make, advise me.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
we have all Great cause to give great thanks.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain.
His stoutness will remain uncertain whilst 'Twixt you there's difference.
but the fall of either Makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits A good construction.
I raised him, and I pawn'd Mine honour for his truth.
who being so heighten'd,
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
Seducing so my friends.
at the last, I seem'd his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance, as if I had been mercenary.
So he did, my lord:
The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last, When he had carried Rome and that we look'd For no less spoil than glory...
There was it.
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour Of our great action.
therefore shall he die
And I'll renew me in his fall.
'tseems he arrived !
I am return'd your soldier,
No more infected with my country's love Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting Under your great command.
We have made peace With no less honour to the Volscians
Than shame to the Romans.
Tell the traitor, in the high'st degree He hath abused your powers.
Traitor?
how now!
Ay, traitor, Marcius!
- Marcius?
- Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius!
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name Coriolanus?
Perfidiously He has betray'd your business, and given up, For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother,
Breaking his oath and resolution like A twist of rotten silk, never admitting Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears.
He whined and roar'd away your victory,
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart Too great for what contains it.
Boy!
O slave!
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all your edges on me.
Boy!
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there, That, like an eagle in a dove-cote,
I flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
Alone I did it.
Boy!
Let him die for't.

[indistinct chatter]
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
[all] Resolved.
First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.
- [all murmur] We know it.
- Let us kill him.
And we'll have corn at our own price.
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, our suffering, is a gain to them.
Aye...
Let us revenge this with our sticks, ere we become rakes.
No more talking on it.
Come!
Soft, soft, who comes here?
...friends, mine honest neighbors...
Worthy Senator Menenius, one that has always loved the people.
I tell you, friends, most charitable care have the patricians of you.
For your wants, your suffering in this dearth, you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the Roman state.
Suffer us to fam ish, and their storehouses crammed with grain.
Bread!
- [man] Bread!
- [all murmur] Bread.
[all] Bread!
[crowd chanting] Bread, bread, bread...!
[clamoring]
Bread, bread, bread...
- [horn honking] - [people screaming] [grunting]
Stop!
- Stop!
Stop!
- [shouting ceases]
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word.
He that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring.
What would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war?
The one affrights you, the other makes you proud.
He that trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares, where foxes, geese.
Who deserves greatness, deserves your hate.
Hang ye.
Trust ye?
With every minute you do change your mind, and call him noble that was now your hate, him vile that was your garland.
What's the matter, that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?
Go.
Get you home you fragments.
[batons rhythmically pounding shields]
- [man] Go back!
- [man 2] Forward!
[shouts]
- [rhythmic pounding continuing over TV] - [man] Go back!
[clamoring over TV]
[inaudible]
- Please...
- Know you me yet?
I know you well.
Your name, I think, is Aufidius.
It is so.
- I'm a Roman.
- What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections.
- The people against the senators.
- Hath been?
Is it ended then?
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again.
[Aufidius on TV] You have ended my business.
The news is the Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that'll put you to it.
I sin in envying his nobility.
And were I anything but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together?
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt.
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
Lead you on.
So your opinion is, Aufidius, that they of Rome are entered in our counsels
- and know how we proceed.
- [Aufidius] Is it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone since I heard thence.
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim.
And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads on this preparation.
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more.
If ever again I meet him beard to beard, he's mine or I am his.
[bombs whistling]
[rapid gunfire]
[rapid gunfire continues] [grunts]
[grunts]
[man] Mark me!
[screams]
[Martius] They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts.
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge!
Go!
[grunts] [bullets ricochet]
Come on.
Away!
[rapid gunfire]
[grunting]
[gunshot] [can clanking on ground]
[TV plays indistinctly]
[man] The citizens of Corioles have issued and given to Titus and to Martius battle.
We've heard their drums.
I saw our forces to their trenches
- driven, and then I came away...
- [TV clicks off]
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
If my son were my husband,
I would more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb,
I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame.
To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Then his good report should have been my son.
Hear me.
Had I a dozen sons,
I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius.
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum.
I see him stamp thus, cry thus:
"Come on, you cowards!
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome. "
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men!
Pluto and hell.
Look to it.
Come on!
Mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe and make my wars on you.
His bloody brow then wiping, forth he goes.
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.
Away, you fool.
It more becomes a man than gold his trophy.
Senator Menenius is come to visit you.
T ell him we are fit to bid him welcome.
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- Indeed, you shall not.
- My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both?
And how does your little son?
I thank you, sir.
Well, good.
He'd rather play with swords and hear a drum
- than look upon his schoolmaster.
- On my word, the father's son.
[both chuckling]
Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.
No, good sir, I will not out of doors.
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.
Indeed, no, by your patience.
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.
- I cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
[chuckling]
No, good sir.
Pardon me.
Indeed, I will not forth.
Go with me, and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
No, good sir, there can be none yet.
- There came news from him last night.
- [woman] Indeed?
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Carioles.
They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars.
This is true, on mine honor.
So, I pray, go out with us.
Give me excuse, good sir.
I will obey you in everything hereafter.
Let her alone.
As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.

- [Titus] What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless.
He is himself alone, to answer all the city.
[whispers] Thou art lost, Martius.
[rapid gunfire in distance]
Who's yonder, that does appear as he were flayed?
O gods!
He has the stamp of Martius.
Come I too late?
!
Come I too late?
!
Aye, if you come not in the blood of others, but mantled in your own.
Let me hold you in arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done.
[explosion]
There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight.
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.
The blood I drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me.
T o Aufidius thus I will appear and fight.
If any such be here, as it were sin to doubt, that love this painting wherein you see me smeared, if any fear lesser his person than an ill report, if any think brave death outweighs bad life,
and that his country is dearer than himself,
let him alone, or so many so minded wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow Martius!
O... me alone.
Make you a sword of me!
[all yelling] [rapid gunfire]
Oi!
[Martius] Advance, brave Titus!
[grunts] [rapid gunfire continues]
Away!
Come!
Come!
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee.
We hate alike.
[both grunting]
[grunts] [grunts, yells]
[both yelling]
[yelling]
[groaning]
[explosion]
[bomb whistling] [explosion] [debris clattering]
[wind whistling]
[panting]
Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee.
So often has thou beat me, and would do so, I fear, should we encounter as often as we eat.
For where I thought to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way.
Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.
[Aufidius] Bolder, though not so subtle.
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius.
Where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.
[woman] Honorable Menenius!
My boy, Martius, approaches.
For the love of Juno, let's go.
Is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.
O yes, he is wounded.
I thank the gods for it.
O, so do I too, if it be not too much.
Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius said they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
Gods grant them true.
- True.
- I'll be sworn they're true.
Where is he wounded?
In the shoulder and in the left arm.
There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
He had, before this last expedition,
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.
Every gash was an enemy's grave.
[quietly] Before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm doth lie.
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
[cameras clicking]
[man] Be it known, as to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius wears this war's garland.
And, from this time, for what he did before Corioles, call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host:
"Caius Martius Coriolanus." Bear the addition nobly ever.
[all] Caius Martius Coriolanus!
[applause]
No more of this.
It does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother.
O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods for my prosperity.
Nay, my good soldier, up.
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honor newly named...
What is it?
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife...
My gracious silence, hail.
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home, that weeps to see me triumph?
Aye, my dear, such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, and mothers that lack sons.
- [Menenius] Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh.
I'm light and heavy.
- [laughter]
- I know not where to turn.
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!
- [applause]
- Welcome, Coriolanus!
Welcome!
[man] 'Tis thought that Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and the blind to hear him speak.
Matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed.
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.
And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
[man] Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius?
[man 2] He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people...
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
You blame Martius for being proud?
- We do it not alone, sir.
- I know you can do very little alone.
You talk of pride.
O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves.
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy politicians, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it.
One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning.
What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.
- You're ambitious.
- [chuckles] [sighs]
Good e'en to your worships.
More of your conversation would infect my brain.
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say, but 'tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow, but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people.
There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them.
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition.
And, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see it.
But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him.
Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well.
And would be content to give him good report for it, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.
[clattering] [paper tearing]
[Martius grunts softly] [sighs]
The good senators must be visited, from whom I have received not only greetings, but with them change of honors.
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy.
Only there's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee.
Good mother, I'd rather be their servant in my way, than sway with them in theirs.
[door opens]
Coriolanus will carry it.
He's a worthy man.
He will carry it.
[bell rings]
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, during his power, go asleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end, but will lose those he hath won.
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear in the marketplace, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word.
It shall be to him then, a sure destruction.
So it must fall out to him, or our authorities, for an end.
We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them.
Kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze shall darken him forever.
[low, indistinct chatter]
[Menenius] It remains, as the main point of this our after-meeting, to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country.
Therefore, please you, most grave and reverend elders, to desire the present consul, and last general in our well-found successes, to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.
- [man] Speak, good Cominius.
- [men] Aye.
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.
Never shame to hear what you have nobly done.
Your honor's pardon.
I'd rather have my wounds to heal again
- than hear say how I got them.
- Pray you, sit down.
I'd rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered.
[murmuring]
- [man] Speak, good Cominius.
- [man 2] Aye, proceed.
The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly.
It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver.
If it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
[voice receding] At 16 years, he fought beyond the mark of others.
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man in the field.
[voice echoing] And in the brunt of 17 battles since, he lurched all swords of the garland.
For this last, before and in Corioles,
let me say I cannot speak him home.
He stopped the fliers, and by his rare example, made coward turn terror into sport, from face to foot.
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
[voice echoi ng] Alone, he entered the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny.
- [low rumbling]
- Aidless came off, and with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioles like a planet.
[voice receding] Until we called both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting.
Our spoils he kicked at, and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world.
He covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
[applause] [indistinct salutations]
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
[scattered murmurs] Aye.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you, let me overleap that custom, for I cannot entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage.
Please you that I may pass this doing.
Sir!
The people must have their voices.
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.
It is a part that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken
- from the people.
- Mark you that?
T o brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, as if I had received them for the hire of their breath only.
To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor!
[applause]
- [laughter] - [applause continues over TV]
[Menenius] The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul!
[Martius] I do owe them still my life and services.
[Menenius] It then remains that you do speak to the people.
[Martius] Let me overleap that custom.
[man] The people must have their voices.
Have you not known the worthiest men have done it?
Custom calls me to it.
What custom wills, in all things should we do it.
What must I say?
"Look, sir, my wounds.
I got them in my country's service."
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that.
You must desire them to think upon you.
Think upon me?
Hang 'em.
I would they would forget me.
[siren chirping]
Pray you, speak to them.
I pray you, in wholesome manner.
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean.
[helicopter passing overhead]
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
We do, sir.
T ell us what hath brought you to it.
- Mine own desert.
- [woman] Your own desert?
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it.
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private.
Your good voice, sir.
What say you?
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged.
Adieu.
But this is something odd.
[Martius] Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voice that I may be consul.
You've deserved nobly of your country, and you've not deserved nobly.
[chuckles]
Your enigma?
You've been a scourge to her enemies, you've been a rod to her friends.
You've not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.
I'll make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.
Your voices!
For your voices I have fought.
Watched for your voices.
For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd.
Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of!
For your voices have done many things, some less, some more.
Your voices!
Indeed, I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!
- [man] Aye.
- [man 2] Aye.
Therefore, let him be consul!
- Amen!
- Amen!
[others join in] Amen!
Amen!
[chanting]
- Amen!
- [chanting continues]
- Worthy voices!
- [chanting continues]
Worthy voices, worthy voices.
[chanting, cheering]
[Menenius] You have stood your limitation.
And the tribunes now endow you with the people's voice.
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged.
The people do admit you, and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation.
- Where?
At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.
I'll keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
[man] God save thee, noble consul!
[crowd chanting] Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, my masters!
My masters!
My masters, how now!
- Have you chose this man?
- [multiple voices] Aye!
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
[woman] Amen, sir.
T o my poor, unworthy notice, he mocked us when he begged our voices.
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright.
O, no, no, no, it is his kind of speech.
- [scattered voices] Aye.
- He did not mock us.
He should have showed us his marks of merit,
- wounds received for his country.
- [several shouting] Yes!
- Why, I'm sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't!
No, no, no!
No!
No!
No one saw them!
Was this mockery?
[scattered voices] Yes!
When he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy.
- [scattered assent]
- Ever spake against your liberties.
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?
[scattered voices] Aye!
It is not confirmed.
It is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!
- [murmuring]
- And will deny him!
I'll have 500 voices of that sound.
- [multiple voices] Yes!
- I twice 500 and their friends!
[crowd] Yes!
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties!
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment, all revoke your ignorant election.
Enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you!
And, presently, when you have drawn the number, repair to the senate.
[low, indistinct chatter]
Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
He has, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
How?
What?
How often he had met you, sword to sword.
That of all things upon the earth, he hated your person most.
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, to oppose his hatred fully.
Come, Rome must know the value of her own.
[low, indistinct chatter]
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, the tongues of the common mouth.
- Pass no further.
- Ah?
What is that?
It will be dangerous to go on.
No further.
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.
- Are these your herd?
- [Menenius] Be calm, be calm.
The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them time-pleasers,
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.
You show too much of that for which the people stir.
If you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit.
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.
This was my speech, and I'll speak it again.
- Not now, not now.
- [Cominius] Not in this heat, sir.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves.
I say again, in soothing them, we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honored number who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
but that which we have given to beggars!
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you.
You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
It were well we let the people know it.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, by Jove, it would be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
Mark you his absolute "shall"?
Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, more worthier than their voices!
By Jove himself, it makes the consuls base, and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other.
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears, which will, in time, break open the locks of the senate, and bring in the crows to peck the eagles!
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure.
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do!
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul?
No!
Seize him!
Hence, old goat!
[crowd shouting]
On both sides more respect!
- [crowd booing] - [yelling]
Shh!
Shh!
Here's he that would take from you all your power!
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you,
Martius, whom late you have named for consul.
[angry shouting]
- What is the city but the people?
!
- [woman] True!
The people are the city!
The people are the city!
[clamoring]
We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,
Martius is worthy of present death!
[clamoring]
Death!
- Guards, seize him!
- No, I'll die here!
[clamoring continuing]
Get you to your house!
Be gone, away!
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!
[clamoring continues]
[sirens wailing nearby]
[clears throat]
[sighs]
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults.
Consul?
What consul?
- The Consul Coriolanus.
- [scoffs] He, consul?
It is decreed he dies tonight.
He's a disease that must be cut away.
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?
Killing our enemies?
[sighs]
The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country.
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more...
Consider this:
He's been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled in graceful language.
Give me leave.
I'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form, in peace, to his utmost peril.
Noble tribunes, it is the humane way.
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.
In you bring not Martius, we'll proceed in our first way.
I'll bring him to you.
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
- yet will I still be thus to them!
- Martius...
I muse my mother does not approve me further.
I talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?
Would you have me false to my nature?
Rather say I play the man I am.
Sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out.
- Let go.
- You might have been enough the man you are, with striving less to be so.
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.
Come, come, you've been too rough, something too rough.
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy, unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst and perish.
Pray, be counseled.
I have a heart as little apt as yours, but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage.
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must I do?
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then?
What then?
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods.
Must I then do it to them?
You are too absolute.
I've heard you say that honor and policy,
like unsevered friends in war, do grow together.
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people, not by your own instruction, nor by the matter your heart prompts you, but with such words that are but roted in your tongue, though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor.
I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles... and you.
I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier.
And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves.
But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours.
I prithee, go and be ruled.
Sir, it is fit you make strong party, or defend yourself by calmness or by absence.
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.
I think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit.
He must.
He will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
Must I, with base tongue, give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I'll do it.
Away, my disposition, and possess me some harlot's spirit.
A beggar's tongue make motion through my lips.
I will not do it.
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth, and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
At thy choice, then.
T o beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them.
Come all to ruin.
Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'st it from me, but owe thy pride thyself.
Pray, be content, Mother, I'm going.
Chide me no more.
Look, I am going.
I'll return consul, or never trust to what my tongue can do
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.
In this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power.
If he evade us there, enforce him with his hatred to the people.
Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll?
I have.
It's ready.
When the people hear me say
"It shall be so in the right and strength of the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then, let them, if they hear me say "Fine," cry "Fine."
- If "Death," cry "Death."
- We shall inform them.
- [man] God preserve thee.
- [light applause]
[indistinct chatter]
- [whistles] - [jeering] [loud jeer]
[shrill whistle]
The people are the city.
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.
Calmly, I beseech you.
[jeering subsides]
[clears throat]
- The honored gods...
- [microphone whines] [crowd laughing]
[clears throat]
The honored gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men, plant love among us, throng our large temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with war.
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, if you submit you to the people's voices.
[scattered voices] Aye.
- I am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
The warlike service he has done, consider.
Think upon the wounds his body bears, which show like graves in the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers, scars to move laughter only.
Consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen,
- you find him like a soldier.
- [inaudible murmurs]
Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as I say, such as become a soldier.
What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again?
We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office, and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical, for which you are a traitor to the people.
How... traitor?
- T raitor!
- Nay, temperately.
Your promise.
The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people.
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.
- [angry shouts] - [man] Traitor!
But since he hath served well for Rome...
What do you prate of service?
- I talk of that, that know it.
- You?
Is this the promise you made your mother?
I'll know no further.
Let them pronounce death, exile, flaying,
I would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word.
In the name of the people, and in the power of us, the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish him our city.
In the people's name, I say...
it shall be so.
- It shall be so!
- He's banished.
It shall be so!
- [crowd shouting]
- It shall be so!
- [chanting] It shall be so!
- [Cominius] Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...
- He's sentenced.
No more hearing.
- [Cominius] Let me speak.
- [overlapping] It shall be so!
- I have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies' marks upon me...
There is no more to be said, but he is banished as enemy
- to the people and his country!
- [crowd] It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
[chanting] It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
You common cry of curs!
Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air.
I... banish... you!
And here remain with your uncertainty.
Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts.
Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair.
Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows.
Despising, for you, the city thus I turn my back.
There is a world... elsewhere.
The people's enemy is gone!
- [applause] - [cheering]
- [laughter]
- Whoo!
[cheering] [children chattering nearby]
[dogs barking]
[indistinct chatter]
[Martius] Nay, Mother, where is your ancient courage?
- [Mother] You are too absolute.
- [birds cawing]
[Martius] Nay, Mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked.
I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.
The gods keep you.
This is a happier and more comely time.
- Yeah.
- Good day.
Good day.
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.
The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love.
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!
I would I had the power to say so to my husband.
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?
I tell thee what, fool, hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words?
[gasping] Blessed heavens...
More noble blows than ever thou wise words, and for Rome's good.
Yet go.
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.
I tell thee what.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!
- Bastards and all.
- Come!
Come, peace!
Well, well, we'll leave you.
Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses!
Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it.
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat.
I sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding.
- Come.
- Come, madam.
[hoofbeats approaching]
[indistinct chatter] [up-tempo music plays nearby]
Hey.
[men calling out] Aufidius!
Ah, general.
Yes.
Well, well.
[bell tolling]
[soldiers chattering, muffled]
- [door opens] - [man] Hey, hey!
- [grunting] - [weapons cocking]
Whence comes thou?
Thy name?
Speak, man.
What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, and harsh in sound to thine.
Say... what's thy name?
Thou has a grim appearance.
What's thy name?
- Know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not.
Thy name?
My name is Caius Martius who hath done to thee, particularly, and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief.
Thereto witness may my surname Coriolanus.
Only that name remains.
The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest, and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome.
Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if I had feared death, of all men in the world
I would have avoided thee.
But, in mere spite, to be full quit of those, my banishers, stand I before thee here.
I will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends.
But if thou dares not this, then I present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice, which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since I have ever followed thee with hate, and cannot live but to thy shame
unless it be to do thee service.
[breathing heavily]
O Martius...
Martius...
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
Let me twine mine arms about that body.
Know thou I loved the maid I married, never man sighed truer breath.
But that I see thee here, thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when I first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold.
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, thou hast beat me out 12 several times, and I have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.
Worthy Martius, had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that thou art thence banished, we would muster all from 12 to 70, and, pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
like a bold flood, overbear it.
[snipping] [buzzing]
Come, go in, and take our friendly senators by the hands.
You bless me, gods.
Therefore, most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission.
And set down as best thou art experienced, since thou knows thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of Rome, or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them, ere destroy.
[indistinct chatter]
- [man] Is this Menenius?
- [man 2] O, 'tis he, 'tis he.
O, he's grown most kind of late.
- Hail, sir.
- Hail to you both.
Your Coriolanus is not much missed, but with his friends.
All's well, and might have been much better
- if he could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?
I hear nothing.
His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.
Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war, but insolent, overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, self-loving...
I think not so.
And Rome sits safe and still without him.
- Shh!
- Shh!
[fanfare plays]
There are reports the Volsces, with two several powers, are entered in the Roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war, destroy what lies before them.
- [patrons] Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius, who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns into the world again. [chuckles]
Come, what talk you of Martius?
It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be?
We have record that it can.
[man] The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House.
Some news is coming that turns their countenances.
Yes, the first report is seconded, and more more fearful is delivered.
Martius has joined with Aufidius.
He leads a power against Rome, and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius, associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories, and have already overborne their way, consumed with fire, and took what lay before them.
Martius has joined with the Volscians.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies.
[men cheering]
[laughter] [rock music playing]
- [clippers buzzing] - [men cheering]
Do they still fly to the Roman?
[man] I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, their talk at table, and their thanks at end.
And you are darkened in this action, sir.
He bears himself more proud, even to my person, than I thought he would when first I did embrace him.
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature.
[cheering]
[rock music continuing]
Whether it was pride, whether defect of judgment or whether nature, not to be other than one thing, made him feared, so hated, and so banished so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time.
One fire drives out one fire one nail, one nail.
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
When, Caius,
Rome is thine, thou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mine.
No, I'll not go.
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banished him.
A mile before his tent, fall down, and kneel the way into his mercy.
[door opens]
He would not seem to know me.
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops that we have bled together.
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to, forbad all names.
He was a kind of nothing.
Titleless.
Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome.
If you refuse your aid in this...
If you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman.
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius.
Well, and say "Martius return me, as Titus is returned, unhurt."
What then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome.
You know the very road into his kindness, and cannot lose your way.
I'll undertake it.
I think he'll hear me.
- He'll never hear him.
- No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold his eye, red, as it would burn Rome.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does.
O Martius, Martius.
Thou art preparing fire for us.
Look thee there's water to quench it.
I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee,
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome.
Away.
How?
Away?
Wife... mother... child...
I know not.
My affairs are servanted to others.
- Sir...
- Therefore be gone.
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.
This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings.
He's more than a creeping thing.
[engines starting]
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.
[car driving away]
[coughs]
[breathes heavily]
[helicopters whirring]
[wolf whistle]
My lord and husband.
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so.
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny, but do not say for that "Forgive our Romans."
O, a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge.
Ye gods, I prate, and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted.
Sink, my knee, in the earth.
Stand up, blest.
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
- I kneel before thee.
- What's this?
Your knees to me?
T o your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior.
I helped to frame thee.
This is a poor epitome of yours, which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may'st prove to shame, invulnerable.
Your knee, sir.
Even he, your wife, this lady and myself,
- are suitors to you.
- I beseech you, peace.
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural.
Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons.
No more, no more.
You have said you will not grant us anything, for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already.
Yet we will ask, that if you fail in our request, the blame may hang upon your hardness.
Therefore hear us.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.
For we'll hear naught from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile.
Think with thyself.
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother, wife, and child
to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out.
And we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win.
For either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles through our streets, or else, triumphantly, tread on thy country's ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood.
For myself... son I purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine.
If I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world.
Aye, and mine, that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time.
You shall not tread on me.
I'll run away till I'm bigger but then I'll fight!
- I have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans, thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve, thou might'st condemn us as poisonous of your honor.
No.
Our suit is that you reconcile them.
So that the Volces may say "This mercy we have showed,"
the Romans, "This we've received,"
and each on either side give the all-hail to thee and cry,
"Be blest for making up this peace!"
Speak to me, son.
Why dost not speak?
Speak you, daughter.
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy.
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons.
There's no man in the world more bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks!
Thou hast never, in thy life, shown thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor.
Say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs.
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees!
Down!
This is the last.
An end.
So we will home to Rome, and die among our neighbors.
Nay.
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot tell what he would have yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship.
Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it.
Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother!
His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance.
Yet give us our dispatch I am hushed until our city be afire, and then I'll speak a little.
O Mother...
Mother...
What have you done?
Behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at.
[sobbing] O my mother!
Mother!
[sobs] O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome.
But for your son, believe it.
O believe it.
Most... dangerously you have prevailed with him.
If not most mortal to him.
But let it come.
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less?
Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.
But, good sir, what peace you'll make, advise me.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.
No, not the expulsion of the T arquins.
We have all great cause to give great thanks.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain.
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction.
I raised him, and I pawned mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened, he watered his new plants with dews of flattery, seducing so my friends.
At the last, I seemed his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary.
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.
And, in the last, when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory...
There was it!
For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor of our great action.
Therefore shall he die...
-...and I'll renew me in his fall.
- [man whistles]
- [vehicle approaching]
- Say no more.
I am returned your soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when I parted hence, but still subsisting under your great command.
We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans.
T ell the traitor, in the highest degree
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor?
How now?
Aye, traitor, Martius.
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.
Caius Martius.
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?
Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome.
I say "your city," for his wife and mother.
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk.
Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory.
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it.
"Boy"?
O slave.
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me!
"Boy"?
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there that, like an eagle in a dovecote,
I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
Alone I did it.
"Boy."
Let him die for it.

Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
[all] Resolved.
First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.
- [all murmur] We know it.
- Let us kill him.
And we'll have corn at our own price.
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, our suffering, is a gain to them.
Aye...
Let us revenge this with our sticks, ere we become rakes.
No more talking on it.
Come!
Soft, soft, who comes here?
...friends, mine honest neighbors...
Worthy Senator Menenius, one that has always loved the people.
I tell you, friends, most charitable care have the patricians of you.
For your wants, your suffering in this dearth, you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the Roman state.
Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain.
Bread!
- [man] Bread!
- [all murmur] Bread.
[all] Bread!
[crowd chanting] Bread, bread, bread...!
[clamoring]
Bread, bread, bread...
- [horn honking] - [people screaming] [grunting]
Stop!
- Stop!
Stop!
- [shouting ceases]
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word.
He that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring.
What would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war?
The one affrights you, the other makes you proud.
He that trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares, where foxes, geese.
Who deserves greatness, deserves your hate.
Hang ye.
Trust ye?
With every minute you do change your mind, and call him noble that was now your hate, him vile that was your garland.
What's the matter, that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?
Go.
Get you home you fragments.
[batons rhythmically pounding shields]
- [man] Go back!
- [man 2] Forward!
[shouts]
- [rhythmic pounding continuing over TV] - [man] Go back!
[clamoring over TV]
[inaudible]
- Please...
- Know you me yet?
I know you well.
Your name, I think, is Aufidius.
It is so.
- I'm a Roman.
- What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections.
- The people against the senators.
- Hath been?
Is it ended then?
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again.
[Aufidius on TV] You have ended my business.
The news is the Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that'll put you to it.
I sin in envying his nobility.
And were I anything but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together?
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt.
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
Lead you on.
So your opinion is, Aufidius, that they of Rome are entered in our counsels
- and know how we proceed.
- [Aufidius] Is it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone since I heard thence.
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim.
And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads on this preparation.
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more.
If ever again I meet him beard to beard, he's mine or I am his.
[bombs whistling]
[rapid gunfire]
[rapid gunfire continues] [grunts]
[grunts]
[man] Mark me!
[screams]
[Martius] They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts.
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge!
Go!
[grunts] [bullets ricochet]
Come on.
Away!
[rapid gunfire]
[grunting]
[gunshot] [can clanking on ground]
[TV plays indistinctly]
[man] The citizens of Corioles have issued and given to Titus and to Martius battle.
We've heard their drums.
I saw our forces to their trenches
- driven, and then I came away...
- [TV clicks off]
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
If my son were my husband,
I would more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb,
I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame.
To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Then his good report should have been my son.
Hear me.
Had I a dozen sons,
I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius.
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum.
I see him stamp thus, cry thus:
"Come on, you cowards!
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome."
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men!
Pluto and hell.
Look to it.
Come on!
Mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe and make my wars on you.
His bloody brow then wiping, forth he goes.
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.
Away, you fool.
It more becomes a man than gold his trophy.
Senator Menenius is come to visit you.
Tell him we are fit to bid him welcome.
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- Indeed, you shall not.
- My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both?
And how does your little son?
I thank you, sir.
Well, good.
He'd rather play with swords and hear a drum
- than look upon his schoolmaster.
- On my word, the father's son.
[both chuckling]
Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.
No, good sir, I will not out of doors.
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.
Indeed, no, by your patience.
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.
- I cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
[chuckling]
No, good sir.
Pardon me.
Indeed, I will not forth.
Go with me, and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
No, good sir, there can be none yet.
- There came news from him last night.
- [woman] Indeed?
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Carioles.
They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars.
This is true, on mine honor.
So, I pray, go out with us.
Give me excuse, good sir.
I will obey you in everything hereafter.
Let her alone.
As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.
[rapid gunfire]
- [panting] - [rapid gunfire]
[panting]
[grunts]
[breathes heavily]
[panting]
[yelling]
[gun fires] [gun clicking]
[both grunting]
[yells]
[yells]
- [Titus] What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless.
He is himself alone, to answer all the city.
[whispers] Thou art lost, Martius.
[rapid gunfire in distance]
Who's yonder, that does appear as he were flayed?
O gods!
He has the stamp of Martius.
Come I too late?
!
Come I too late?
!
Aye, if you come not in the blood of others, but mantled in your own.
Let me hold you in arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done.
[explosion]
There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight.
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.
The blood I drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me.
To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight.
If any such be here, as it were sin to doubt, that love this painting wherein you see me smeared, if any fear lesser his person than an ill report, if any think brave death outweighs bad life,
and that his country is dearer than himself, let him alone, or so many so minded wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow Martius!
O... me alone.
Make you a sword of me!
[all yelling] [rapid gunfire]
Oi!
[Martius] Advance, brave Titus!
[grunts] [rapid gunfire continues]
Away!
Come!
Come!
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee.
We hate alike.
[both grunting]
[grunts] [grunts, yells]
[both yelling]
[yelling]
[groaning]
[explosion]
[bomb whistling] [explosion] [debris clattering]
[wind whistling]
[panting]
Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee.
So often has thou beat me, and would do so, I fear, should we encounter as often as we eat.
For where I thought to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way.
Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.
[Aufidius] Bolder, though not so subtle.
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius.
Where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.
[woman] Honorable Menenius!
My boy, Martius, approaches.
For the love of Juno, let's go.
Is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.
O yes, he is wounded.
I thank the gods for it.
O, so do I too, if it be not too much.
Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius said they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
Gods grant them true.
- True.
- I'll be sworn they're true.
Where is he wounded?
In the shoulder and in the left arm.
There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
He had, before this last expedition,
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.
Every gash was an enemy's grave.
[quietly] Before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm doth lie.
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
[cameras clicking]
[man] Be it known, as to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius wears this war's garland.
And, from this time, for what he did before Corioles, call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host:
"Caius Martius Coriolanus." Bear the addition nobly ever.
[all] Caius Martius Coriolanus!
[applause]
No more of this.
It does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother.
O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods for my prosperity.
Nay, my good soldier, up.
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honor newly named...
What is it?
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife...
My gracious silence, hail.
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home, that weeps to see me triumph?
Aye, my dear, such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, and mothers that lack sons.
- [Menenius] Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh.
I'm light and heavy.
- [laughter]
- I know not where to turn.
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!
- [applause]
- Welcome, Coriolanus!
Welcome!
[man] 'Tis thought that Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and the blind to hear him speak.
Matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed.
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.
And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
[man] Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius?
[man 2] He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people...
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
You blame Martius for being proud?
- We do it not alone, sir.
- I know you can do very little alone.
You talk of pride.
O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves.
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy politicians, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it.
One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning.
What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.
- You're ambitious.
- [chuckles] [sighs]
Good e'en to your worships.
More of your conversation would infect my brain.
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say, but 'tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow, but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people.
There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them.
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition.
And, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see it.
But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him.
Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well.
And would be content to give him good report for it, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.
[clattering] [paper tearing]
[Martius grunts softly] [sighs]
The good senators must be visited, from whom I have received not only greetings, but with them change of honors.
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy.
Only there's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee.
Good mother, I'd rather be their servant in my way, than sway with them in theirs.
[door opens]
Coriolanus will carry it.
He's a worthy man.
He will carry it.
[bell rings]
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, during his power, go asleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end, but will lose those he hath won.
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear in the marketplace, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word.
It shall be to him then, a sure destruction.
So it must fall out to him, or our authorities, for an end.
We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them.
Kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze shall darken him forever.
[low, indistinct chatter]
[Menenius] It remains, as the main point of this our after-meeting, to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country.
Therefore, please you, most grave and reverend elders, to desire the present consul, and last general in our well-found successes, to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.
- [man] Speak, good Cominius.
- [men] Aye.
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.
Never shame to hear what you have nobly done.
Your honor's pardon.
I'd rather have my wounds to heal again
- than hear say how I got them.
- Pray you, sit down.
I'd rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered.
[murmuring]
- [man] Speak, good Cominius.
- [man 2] Aye, proceed.
The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly.
It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver.
If it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
[voice receding] At 16 years, he fought beyond the mark of others.
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man in the field.
[voice echoing] And in the brunt of 17 battles since, he lurched all swords of the garland.
For this last, before and in Corioles, let me say I cannot speak him home.
He stopped the fliers, and by his rare example, made coward turn terror into sport, from face to foot.
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
[voice echoing] Alone, he entered the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny.
- [low rumbling]
- Aidless came off, and with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioles like a planet.
[voice receding] Until we called both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting.
Our spoils he kicked at, and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world.
He covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
[applause] [indistinct salutations]
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
[scattered murmurs] Aye.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you, let me overleap that custom, for I cannot entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage.
Please you that I may pass this doing.
Sir!
The people must have their voices.
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.
It is a part that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken
- from the people.
- Mark you that?
To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, as if I had received them for the hire of their breath only.
To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor!
[applause]
- [laughter] - [applause continues over TV]
[Menenius] The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul!
[Martius] I do owe them still my life and services.
[Menenius] It then remains that you do speak to the people.
[Martius] Let me overleap that custom.
[man] The people must have their voices.
Have you not known the worthiest men have done it?
Custom calls me to it.
What custom wills, in all things should we do it.
What must I say?
"Look, sir, my wounds.
I got them in my country's service."
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that.
You must desire them to think upon you.
Think upon me?
Hang 'em.
I would they would forget me.
[siren chirping]
Pray you, speak to them.
I pray you, in wholesome manner.
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean.
[helicopter passing overhead]
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
We do, sir.
Tell us what hath brought you to it.
- Mine own desert.
- [woman] Your own desert?
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it.
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private.
Your good voice, sir.
What say you?
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged.
Adieu.
But this is something odd.
[Martius] Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voice that I may be consul.
You've deserved nobly of your country, and you've not deserved nobly.
[chuckles]
Your enigma?
You've been a scourge to her enemies, you've been a rod to her friends.
You've not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.
I'll make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.
Your voices!
For your voices I have fought.
Watched for your voices.
For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd.
Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of!
For your voices have done many things, some less, some more.
Your voices!
Indeed, I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!
- [man] Aye.
- [man 2] Aye.
Therefore, let him be consul!
- Amen!
- Amen!
[others join in] Amen!
Amen!
[chanting]
- Amen!
- [chanting continues]
- Worthy voices!
- [chanting continues]
Worthy voices, worthy voices.
[chanting, cheering]
[Menenius] You have stood your limitation.
And the tribunes now endow you with the people's voice.
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged.
The people do admit you, and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation.
- Where?
At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.
I'll keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
[man] God save thee, noble consul!
[crowd chanting] Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, my masters!
My masters!
My masters, how now!
- Have you chose this man?
- [multiple voices] Aye!
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
[woman] Amen, sir.
To my poor, unworthy notice, he mocked us when he begged our voices.
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright.
O, no, no, no, it is his kind of speech.
- [scattered voices] Aye.
- He did not mock us.
He should have showed us his marks of merit,
- wounds received for his country.
- [several shouting] Yes!
- Why, I'm sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't!
No, no, no!
No!
No!
No one saw them!
Was this mockery?
[scattered voices] Yes!
When he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy.
- [scattered assent]
- Ever spake against your liberties.
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?
[scattered voices] Aye!
It is not confirmed.
It is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!
- [murmuring]
- And will deny him!
I'll have 500 voices of that sound.
- [multiple voices] Yes!
- I twice 500 and their friends!
[crowd] Yes!
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties!
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment, all revoke your ignorant election.
Enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you!
And, presently, when you have drawn the number, repair to the senate.
[low, indistinct chatter]
Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
He has, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
How?
What?
How often he had met you, sword to sword.
That of all things upon the earth, he hated your person most.
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, to oppose his hatred fully.
Come, Rome must know the value of her own.
[low, indistinct chatter]
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, the tongues of the common mouth.
- Pass no further.
- Ah?
What is that?
It will be dangerous to go on.
No further.
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.
- Are these your herd?
- [Menenius] Be calm, be calm.
The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them time-pleasers,
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.
You show too much of that for which the people stir.
If you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit.
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.
This was my speech, and I'll speak it again.
- Not now, not now.
- [Cominius] Not in this heat, sir.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves.
I say again, in soothing them, we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honored number who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
but that which we have given to beggars!
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you.
You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
It were well we let the people know it.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, by Jove, it would be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
Mark you his absolute "shall"?
Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, more worthier than their voices!
By Jove himself, it makes the consuls base, and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other.
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears, which will, in time, break open the locks of the senate, and bring in the crows to peck the eagles!
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure.
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do!
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul?
No!
Seize him!
Hence, old goat!
[crowd shouting]
On both sides more respect!
- [crowd booing] - [yelling]
Shh!
Shh!
Here's he that would take from you all your power!
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you,
Martius, whom late you have named for consul.
[angry shouting]
- What is the city but the people?
!
- [woman] True!
The people are the city!
The people are the city!
[clamoring]
We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,
Martius is worthy of present death!
[clamoring]
Death!
- Guards, seize him!
- No, I'll die here!
[clamoring continuing]
Get you to your house!
Be gone, away!
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!
[clamoring continues]
[sirens wailing nearby]
[clears throat]
[sighs]
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults.
Consul?
What consul?
- The Consul Coriolanus.
- [scoffs] He, consul?
It is decreed he dies tonight.
He's a disease that must be cut away.
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?
Killing our enemies?
[sighs]
The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country.
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more...
Consider this:
He's been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled in graceful language.
Give me leave.
I'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form, in peace, to his utmost peril.
Noble tribunes, it is the humane way.
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.
In you bring not Martius, we'll proceed in our first way.
I'll bring him to you.
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
- yet will I still be thus to them!
- Martius...
I muse my mother does not approve me further.
I talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?
Would you have me false to my nature?
Rather say I play the man I am.
Sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out.
- Let go.
- You might have been enough the man you are, with striving less to be so.
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.
Come, come, you've been too rough, something too rough.
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy, unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst and perish.
Pray, be counseled.
I have a heart as little apt as yours, but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage.
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must I do?
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then?
What then?
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods.
Must I then do it to them?
You are too absolute.
I've heard you say that honor and policy, like unsevered friends in war, do grow together.
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people, not by your own instruction, nor by the matter your heart prompts you, but with such words that are but roted in your tongue, though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor.
I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles... and you.
I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier.
And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves.
But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours.
I prithee, go and be ruled.
Sir, it is fit you make strong party, or defend yourself by calmness or by absence.
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.
I think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit.
He must.
He will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
Must I, with base tongue, give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I'll do it.
Away, my disposition, and possess me some harlot's spirit.
A beggar's tongue make motion through my lips.
I will not do it.
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth, and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
At thy choice, then.
To beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them.
Come all to ruin.
Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'st it from me, but owe thy pride thyself.
Pray, be content, Mother, I'm going.
Chide me no more.
Look, I am going.
I'll return consul, or never trust to what my tongue can do
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.
In this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power.
If he evade us there, enforce him with his hatred to the people.
Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll?
I have.
It's ready.
When the people hear me say
"It shall be so in the right and strength of the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then, let them, if they hear me say "Fine," cry "Fine."
- If "Death," cry "Death."
- We shall inform them.
- [man] God preserve thee.

[indistinct chatter]
- [whistles] - [jeering] [loud jeer]
[shrill whistle]
The people are the city.
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.
Calmly, I beseech you.
[jeering subsides]
[clears throat]
- The honored gods...
- [microphone whines] [crowd laughing]
[clears throat]
The honored gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men, plant love among us, throng our large temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with war.
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, if you submit you to the people's voices.
[scattered voices] Aye.
- I am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
The warlike service he has done, consider.
Think upon the wounds his body bears, which show like graves in the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers, scars to move laughter only.
Consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen,
- you find him like a soldier.
- [inaudible murmurs]
Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as I say, such as become a soldier.
What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again?
We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office, and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical, for which you are a traitor to the people.
How... traitor?
- Traitor!
- Nay, temperately.
Your promise.
The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people.
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.
- [angry shouts] - [man] Traitor!
But since he hath served well for Rome...
What do you prate of service?
- I talk of that, that know it.
- You?
Is this the promise you made your mother?
I'll know no further.
Let them pronounce death, exile, flaying,
I would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word.
In the name of the people, and in the power of us, the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish him our city.
In the people's name, I say...
it shall be so.
- It shall be so!
- He's banished.
It shall be so!
- [crowd shouting]
- It shall be so!
- [chanting] It shall be so!
- [Cominius] Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...
- He's sentenced.
No more hearing.
- [Cominius] Let me speak.
- [overlapping] It shall be so!
- I have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies' marks upon me...
There is no more to be said, but he is banished as enemy
- to the people and his country!
- [crowd] It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
[chanting] It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
You common cry of curs!
Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air.
I... banish... you!
And there remain with your uncertainty.
Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts.
Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair.
Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows.
Despising, for you, the city thus I turn my back.
There is a world... elsewhere.
The people's enemy is gone!
- [applause] - [cheering]
- [laughter]
- Whoo!
[cheering] [children chattering nearby]

[indistinct chatter]
[Martius] Nay, Mother, where is your ancient courage?
- [Mother] You are too absolute.
- [birds cawing]
[Martius] Nay, Mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked.
I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.
The gods keep you.
This is a happier and more comely time.
- Yeah.
- Good day.
Good day.
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.
The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love.
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!
I would I had the power to say so to my husband.
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?
I tell thee what, fool, hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words?
[gasping] Blessed heavens...
More noble blows than ever thou wise words, and for Rome's good.
Yet go.
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.
I tell thee what.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!
- Bastards and all.
- Come!
Come, peace!
Well, well, we'll leave you.
Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses!
Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it.
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat.
I sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding.
- Come.
- Come, madam.
[hoofbeats approaching]
[indistinct chatter] [up-tempo music plays nearby]
Hey.
[men calling out] Aufidius!
Ah, general.
Yes.
Well, well.
[bell tolling]
[soldiers chattering, muffled]
- [door opens] - [man] Hey, hey!
- [grunting] - [weapons cocking]
Whence comes thou?
Thy name?
Speak, man.
What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, and harsh in sound to thine.
Say... what's thy name?
Thou has a grim appearance.
What's thy name?
- Know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not.
Thy name?
My name is Caius Martius who hath done to thee, particularly, and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief.
Thereto witness may my surname Coriolanus.
Only that name remains.
The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest, and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome.
Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if I had feared death, of all men in the world
I would have avoided thee.
But, in mere spite, to be full quit of those, my banishers, stand I before thee here.
I will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends.
But if thou dares not this, then I present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice, which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since I have ever followed thee with hate, and cannot live but to thy shame
unless it be to do thee service.
[breathing heavily]
O Martius...
Martius...
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
Let me twine mine arms about that body.
Know thou I loved the maid I married, never man sighed truer breath.
But that I see thee here, thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when I first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold.
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, thou hast beat me out 12 several times.
and I have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.
Worthy Martius, had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that thou art thence banished, we would muster all from 12 to 70, and, pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, like a bold flood, overbear it.
[snipping] [buzzing]
Come, go in, and take our friendly senators by the hands.
You bless me, gods.
Therefore, most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission.
And set down as best thou art experienced, since thou knows thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of Rome, or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them, ere destroy.
[indistinct chatter]
- [man] Is this Menenius?
- [man 2] O, 'tis he, 'tis he.
O, he's grown most kind of late.
- Hail, sir.
- Hail to you both.
Your Coriolanus is not much missed, but with his friends.
All's well, and might have been much better
- if he could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?
I hear nothing.
His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.
Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war, but insolent, overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, self-loving...
I think not so.
And Rome sits safe and still without him.
- Shh!
- Shh!
[fanfare plays]
There are reports the Volsces, with two several powers, are entered in the Roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war, destroy what lies before them.
- [patrons] Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius, who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns into the world again. [chuckles]
Come, what talk you of Martius?
It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be?
We have record that it can.
[man] The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House.
Some news is coming that turns their countenances.
Yes, the first report is seconded, and more more fearful is delivered.
Martius has joined with Aufidius.
He leads a power against Rome, and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius, associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories, and have already overborne their way, consumed with fire, and took what lay before them.
Martius has joined with the Volscians.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies.
[men cheering]
[laughter] [rock music playing]
- [clippers buzzing] - [men cheering]
Do they still fly to the Roman?
[man] I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, their talk at table, and their thanks at end.
And you are darkened in this action, sir.
He bears himself more proud, even to my person, than I thought he would when first I did embrace him.
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature.
[cheering]
[rock music continuing]
Whether it was pride, whether defect of judgment or whether nature, not to be other than one thing, made him feared, so hated, and so banished so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time.
One fire drives out one fire one nail, one nail.
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
When, Caius,
Rome is thine, thou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mine.
No, I'll not go.
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banished him.
A mile before his tent, fall down, and kneel the way into his mercy.
[door opens]
He would not seem to know me.
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops that we have bled together.
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to, forbad all names.
He was a kind of nothing.
Titleless.
Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome.
If you refuse your aid in this...
If you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman.
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius.
Well, and say "Martius return me, as Titus is returned, unhurt."
What then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome.
You know the very road into his kindness, and cannot lose your way.
I'll undertake it.
I think he'll hear me.
- He'll never hear him.
- No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold his eye, red, as it would burn Rome.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does.
O Martius, Martius.
Thou art preparing fire for us.
Look thee there's water to quench it.
I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee,
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome.
Away.
How?
Away?
Wife... mother... child...
I know not.
My affairs are servanted to others.
- Sir...
- Therefore be gone.
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.
This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings.
He's more than a creeping thing.
[engines starting]
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.

My lord and husband.
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so.
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny, but do not say for that "Forgive our Romans."
O, a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge.
Ye gods, I prate, and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted.
Sink, my knee, in the earth.
Stand up, blest.
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
- I kneel before thee.
- What's this?
Your knees to me?
To your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior.
I helped to frame thee.
This is a poor epitome of yours, which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may'st prove to shame, invulnerable.
Your knee, sir.
Even he, your wife, this lady and myself,
- are suitors to you.
- I beseech you, peace.
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural.
Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons.
No more, no more.
You have said you will not grant us anything, for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already.
Yet we will ask, that if you fail in our request, the blame may hang upon your hardness.
Therefore hear us.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.
For we'll hear naught from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile.
Think with thyself.
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother, wife, and child
to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out.
And we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win.
For either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles through our streets, or else, triumphantly, tread on thy country's ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood.
For myself... son I purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine.
If I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world.
Aye, and mine, that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time.
You shall not tread on me.
I'll run away till I'm bigger but then I'll fight!
- I have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans, thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve, thou might'st condemn us as poisonous of your honor.
No.
Our suit is that you reconcile them.
So that the Voices may say "This mercy we have showed,"
the Romans, "This we've received,"
and each on either side give the all-hail to thee and cry,
"Be blest for making up this peace!"
Speak to me, son.
Why dost not speak?
Speak you, daughter.
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy.
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons.
There's no man in the world more bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks!
Thou hast never, in thy life, shown thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor.
Say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs.
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees!
Down!
This is the last.
An end.
So we will home to Rome, and die among our neighbors.
Nay.
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot tell what he would have yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship.
Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it.
Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother!
His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance.
Yet give us our dispatch I am hushed until our city be afire, and then I'll speak a little.
O Mother...
Mother...
What have you done?
Behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at.
[sobbing] O my mother!
Mother!
[sobs] O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome.
But for your son, believe it.
O believe it.
Most... dangerously you have prevailed with him.
If not most mortal to him.
But let it come.
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less?
Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.
But, good sir, what peace you'll make, advise me.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
We have all great cause to give great thanks.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain.
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction.
I raised him, and I pawned mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened, he watered his new plants with dews of flattery, seducing so my friends.
At the last, I seemed his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary.
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.
And, in the last, when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory...
There was it!
For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor of our great action.
Therefore shall he die...
- ...and I'll renew me in his fall.
- [man whistles]
- [vehicle approaching]
- Say no more.
I am returned your soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when I parted hence, but still subsisting under your great command.
We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans.
Tell the traitor, in the highest degree
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor?
How now?
Aye, traitor, Martius.
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.
Caius Martius.
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?
Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome.
I say "your city," for his wife and mother.
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk.
Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory.
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it.
"Boy"?
O slave.
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me!
"Boy"?
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there that, like an eagle in a dovecote,
I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
Alone I did it.
"Boy."
Let him die for it.

[# Lisa Zane: "Sta Pervolia"]
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak,
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
Resolved.
First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people,
- We know it.
- Let us kill him.
And we'll have corn at our own price,
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good,
The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, our suffering, is a gain to them,
Aye,
Let us revenge this with our sticks, ere we become rakes,
No more talking on it, Come!
Soft, soft, who comes here?
...friends, mine honest neighbors...
Worthy Senator Menenius, one that has always loved the people,
I tell you, friends, most charitable care have the patricians of you.
For your wants, your suffering in this dearth, you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the Roman state.
Suffer us to fam ish, and their storehouses crammed with grain,
Bread!
- Bread!
- Bread.
Bread!
Bread, bread, bread...!
Bread, bread, bread,
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word,
He that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring,
What would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war?
The one affrights you, the other makes you proud,
He that trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares, where foxes, geese,
Who deserves greatness, deserves your hate,
Hang ye, Trust ye?
With every minute you do change your mind, and call him noble that was now your hate, him vile that was your garland,
What's the matter, that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?
Go,
Get you home,
,you fragments,
- Go back!
- Forward!
Go back!
- Please,
- Know you me yet?
I know you well,
Your name, I think, is Aufidius,
It is so.
- I'm a Roman,
- What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections,
- The people against the senators,
- Hath been?
Is it ended then?
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again,
You have ended my business.
The news is the Volsces are in arms,
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that'll put you to it,
I sin in envying his nobility,
And were I anything but what I am, I would wish me only he,
You have fought together?
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt,
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face,
Lead you on,
So your opinion is, Aufidius, that they of Rome are entered in our counsels
- and know how we proceed,
- Is it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone since I heard thence,
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim,
And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads on this preparation,
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more,
If ever again I meet him beard to beard, he's mine or I am his,
Mark me!
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge!
Go!
Come on,
Away!
The citizens of Corioles have issued and given to Titus and to Martius battle.
We've heard their drums.
I saw our forces to their trenches driven, and then I came away...
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort,
If my son were my husband,
I would more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love,
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb,
I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame,
To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak,
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Then,
,his good report should have been my son,
Hear me,
Had I a dozen sons,
I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action,
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius,
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck,
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
I see him stamp thus, cry thus:
"Come on, you cowards!
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome."
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men!
Pluto and hell, Look to it, Come on!
Mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe and make my wars on you,
His bloody brow then wiping, forth he goes,
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood,
Away, you fool,
It more becomes a man than gold his trophy,
Senator Menenius is come to visit you,
T ell him we are fit to bid him welcome,
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself,
- Indeed, you shall not,
- My ladies both, good day to you,
How do you both?
And how does your little son?
I thank you, sir, Well, good,
He'd rather play with swords and hear a drum
- than look upon his schoolmaster,
- On my word, the father's son,
Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon,
No, good sir, I will not out of doors,
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall,
Indeed, no, by your patience,
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars,
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably,
- I cannot go hither,
- O you would be another Penelope,
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths,
No, good sir, Pardon me, Indeed, I will not forth,
Go with me, and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband,
No, good sir, there can be none yet,
- There came news from him last night,
- Indeed?
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Carioles,
They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars,
This is true, on mine honor, So, I pray, go out with us,
Give me excuse, good sir, I will obey you in everything hereafter,
Let her alone, As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth,
- What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless,
He is himself alone, to answer all the city,
Thou art lost, Martius.
Who's yonder, that does appear as he were flayed?
O gods!
He has the stamp of Martius,
Come I too late?
!
Come I too late?
!
Aye, if you come not in the blood of others, but mantled in your own,
Let me hold you in arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done,
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius, piercing our Romans,
Worthy sir, thou bleeds,
Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight,
Sir, praise me not, My work hath not yet warmed me,
The blood I drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me,
T o Aufidius thus I will appear and fight,
If any such be here, as it were sin to doubt, that love this painting wherein you see me smeared, if any fear lesser his person than an ill report, if any think brave death outweighs bad life,
and that his country is dearer than himself,
let him alone, or so many so minded wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow Martius!
O, me alone,
Make you a sword of me!
Oi!
Advance, brave Titus!
Away!
Come!
Come!
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee,
We hate alike,
Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee,
So often has thou beat me, and would do so, I fear, should we encounter as often as we eat,
For where I thought to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way,
Or wrath or craft may get him,
He's the devil,
Bolder, though not so subtle,
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius,
Where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, will I wash my fierce hand in his heart,
Honorable Menenius!
My boy, Martius, approaches,
For the love of Juno, let's go,
Is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded,
O yes, he is wounded, I thank the gods for it,
O, so do I too, if it be not too much,
Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him,
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius said they fought together, but Aufidius got off,
In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him,
Gods grant them true,
- True,
- I'll be sworn they're true,
Where is he wounded?
In the shoulder and in the left arm,
There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place,
He had, before this last expedition,
- 25 wounds upon him,
- Now it's 27,
Every gash was an enemy's grave,
Before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears,
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm doth lie,
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die,
Be it known, as to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius wears this war's garland,
And, from this time, for what he did before Corioles, call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host:
"Caius Martius Coriolanus," Bear the addition nobly ever,
Caius Martius Coriolanus!
No more of this, It does offend my heart, Pray now, no more,
Look, sir, your mother,
O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods for my prosperity,
Nay, my good soldier, up,
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honor newly named, What is it?
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife,
My gracious silence, hail,
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home, that weeps to see me triumph?
Aye, my dear, such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, and mothers that lack sons,
- Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh, I'm light and heavy,
I know not where to turn.
O, you are welcome home, You are welcome all,
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!
Welcome, Coriolanus!
Welcome!
'Tis thought that Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and the blind to hear him speak.
Matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed.
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.
And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius?
He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts,
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight,
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius,
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends,
You blame Martius for being proud?
- We do it not alone, sir,
- I know you can do very little alone,
You talk of pride,
O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves,
- O that you could,
- What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy politicians, alias fools, as any in Rome,
Menenius, you are known well enough too,
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it,
One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning,
What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath,
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough,
You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything,
You're ambitious,
Good e'en to your worships,
More of your conversation would infect my brain,
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say, but 'tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it,
That's a brave fellow, but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people,
There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them,
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition,
And, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see it,
But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him,
Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love,
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well, And would be content to give him good report for it, but that he pays himself with being proud,
Nay, but speak not maliciously, He hath deserve worthily of his country,
The good senators must be visited, from whom I have received not only greetings, but with them change of honors,
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy,
Only there's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee,
Good mother, I'd rather be their servant in my way, than sway with them in theirs,
Coriolanus will carry it,
He's a worthy man, He will carry it,
- All tongues speak of him,
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul,
Then our office may, during his power, go asleep,
He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end, but will lose those he hath won,
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear in the marketplace, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths,
It was his word, It shall be to him then, a sure destruction,
So it must fall out to him, or our authorities, for an end,
We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them,
Kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze shall darken him forever,
It remains, as the main point of this our after-meeting, to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country,
Therefore, please you, most grave and reverend elders, to desire the present consul, and last general in our well-found successes, to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus,
- Speak, good Cominius,
- Aye,
- Nay, keep your place,
- Sit, Coriolanus,
Never shame to hear what you have nobly done,
Your honor's pardon, I'd rather have my wounds to heal again
- than hear say how I got them,
- Pray you, sit down,
I'd rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered,
- Speak, good Cominius,
- Aye, proceed,
The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly,
It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver,
If it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised,
At 16 years, he fought beyond the mark of others,
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man in the field,
And in the brunt of 17 battles since, he lurched all swords of the garland,
For this last, before and in Corioles,
let me say I cannot speak him home.
He stopped the fliers, and by his rare example, made coward turn terror into sport, from face to foot.
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
Alone, he entered the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny,
Aidless came off, and with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioles like a planet,
Until we called both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting,
Our spoils he kicked at, and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world,
He covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it,
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul,
Aye.
I do owe them still my life and services,
It then remains that you do speak to the people,
I do beseech you, let me overleap that custom, for I cannot entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage,
Please you that I may pass this doing,
Sir!
The people must have their voices,
Pray you, go fit you to the custom,
It is a part that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken
- from the people,
- Mark you that?
T o brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, as if I had received them for the hire of their breath only,
To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor!
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul!
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
Let me overleap that custom.
The people must have their voices.
Have you not known the worthiest men have done it?
Custom calls me to it,
What custom wills, in all things should we do it,
What must I say?
"Look, sir, my wounds, I got them in my country's service,"
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that,
You must desire them to think upon you,
Think upon me?
Hang 'em, I would they would forget me,
Pray you, speak to them,
I pray you, in wholesome manner,
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean,
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
We do, sir, T ell us what hath brought you to it,
- Mine own desert,
- Your own desert?
- Aye, but not mine own desire,
- How not your own desire?
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging,
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you,
Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly,
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it,
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private,
Your good voice, sir, What say you?
- You shall have it, worthy sir,
- A match, sir,
There's in all two worthy voices begged, Adieu,
But this is something odd,
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voice that I may be consul,
You've deserved nobly of your country, and you've not deserved nobly,
Your enigma?
You've been a scourge to her enemies, you've been a rod to her friends,
You've not indeed loved the common people,
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love,
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily,
I'll make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further,
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily,
Your voices!
For your voices I have fought,
Watched for your voices,
For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd,
Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of!
For your voices have done many things, some less, some more,
Your voices!
Indeed, I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!
- Aye.
- Aye.
Therefore, let him be consul!
- Amen!
- Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Worthy voices!
Worthy voices, worthy voices,
You have stood your limitation,
And the tribunes now endow you with the people's voice,
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged,
The people do admit you, and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation,
- Where?
At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus,
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir,
I'll keep you company, Will you along?
We stay here for the people,
God save thee, noble consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, my masters!
My masters!
My masters, how now!
- Have you chose this man?
- Aye!
He has our voices, sir,
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves,
Amen, sir.
T o my poor, unworthy notice, he mocked us when he begged our voices,
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright,
O, no, no, no, it is his kind of speech,
- Aye,
- He did not mock us,
He should have showed us his marks of merit,
- wounds received for his country,
- Yes!
- Why, I'm sure, so he did,
- No, he didn't!
No, no, no!
No!
No!
No one saw them!
Was this mockery?
Yes!
When he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy,
Ever spake against your liberties,
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?
Aye!
It is not confirmed,
It is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!
And will deny him!
I'll have 500 voices of that sound,
- Yes!
- I twice 500 and their friends!
Yes!
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties!
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment, all revoke your ignorant election,
Enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you!
And, presently, when you have drawn the number, repair to the senate,
Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
He has, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
How?
What?
How often he had met you, sword to sword.
That of all things upon the earth, he hated your person most.
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, to oppose his hatred fully,
Come, Rome must know the value of her own,
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, the tongues of the common mouth,
- Pass no further,
- Ah?
What is that?
It will be dangerous to go on, No further,
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
- Cominius, no,
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give away,
- The people are incensed against him,
- Are these your herd?
- Be calm, be calm,
The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them time-pleasers,
- flatterers, foes to nobleness,
- Why, this was known before,
You show too much of that for which the people stir,
If you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit,
- Let's be calm,
- The people are abused, set on,
This was my speech, and I'll speak it again,
- Not now, not now,
- Not in this heat, sir,
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons,
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves,
I say again, in soothing them, we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honored number who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
but that which we have given to beggars!
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you,
You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity,
It were well we let the people know it,
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, by Jove, it would be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further,
Shall remain, Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
Mark you his absolute "shall"?
Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, more worthier than their voices!
By Jove himself, it makes the consuls base, and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other,
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears, which will, in time, break open the locks of the senate, and bring in the crows to peck the eagles!
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure,
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do!
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul?
No!
Seize him!
Hence, old goat!
On both sides more respect!
Shh!
Shh!
Here's he that would take from you all your power!
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you,
Martius, whom late you have named for consul,
- What is the city but the people?
!
- True!
The people are the city!
The people are the city!
We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,
Martius is worthy of present death!
Death!
- Guards, seize him!
- No, I'll die here!
Get you to your house!
Be gone, away!
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults,
Consul?
What consul?
- The Consul Coriolanus,
- He, consul?
It is decreed he dies tonight,
He's a disease that must be cut away,
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease,
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy,
What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?
Killing our enemies?
The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country,
- This is clean kam,
- We'll hear no more,
Consider this:
He's been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled in graceful language,
Give me leave, I'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form, in peace, to his utmost peril,
Noble tribunes, it is the humane way,
- Menenius,
- Be you then as the people's officer,
In you bring not Martius, we'll proceed in our first way,
I'll bring him to you,
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
- yet will I still be thus to them!
- Martius,
I muse my mother does not approve me further,
I talk of you, Why would you wish me milder?
Would you have me false to my nature?
Rather say I play the man I am,
Sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out,
- Let go,
- You might have been enough the man you are, with striving less to be so,
- Let them hang,
- Aye, and burn, too,
Come, come, you've been too rough, something too rough,
You must return and mend it,
There's no remedy, unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst and perish,
Pray, be counseled,
I have a heart as little apt as yours, but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage,
- Well said, noble woman,
- And what must I do?
- Return to the tribunes,
- What then?
What then?
- Repent what you have spoke,
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods,
Must I then do it to them?
You are too absolute,
I've heard you say that honor and policy,
like unsevered friends in war, do grow together,
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people, not by your own instruction, nor by the matter your heart prompts you, but with such words that are but roted in your tongue, though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth,
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor,
I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles, and you,
I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier,
And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves,
But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs,
This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours,
I prithee, go and be ruled,
Sir, it is fit you make strong party, or defend yourself by calmness or by absence,
- All's in anger,
- Only fair speech,
I think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit,
He must,
He will,
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it,
Must I, with base tongue, give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I'll do it,
Away, my disposition, and possess me some harlot's spirit,
A beggar's tongue make motion through my lips,
I will not do it.
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth, and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness,
At thy choice, then,
T o beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them,
Come all to ruin,
Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death with as big heart as thou, Do as you like,
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'st it from me, but owe thy pride thyself,
Pray, be content, Mother, I'm going,
Chide me no more, Look, I am going,
I'll return consul, or never trust to what my tongue can do
- in the way of flattery further,
- Do your will,
In this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power,
If he evade us there, enforce him with his hatred to the people,
Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll?
I have, It's ready,
When the people hear me say
"It shall be so in the right and strength of the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then, let them, if they hear me say "Fine," cry "Fine,"
- If "Death," cry "Death,"
- We shall inform them,
God preserve thee,
The people are the city,
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue,
Calmly, I beseech you,
The honored gods,
The honored gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men, plant love among us, throng our large temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with war,
- Amen, amen,
- A noble wish,
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, if you submit you to the people's voices,
Aye.
- I am content,
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content,
The warlike service he has done, consider,
Think upon the wounds his body bears, which show like graves in the holy churchyard,
Scratches with briers, scars to move laughter only,
Consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen, you find him like a soldier,
Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as I say, such as become a soldier,
What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again?
We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office, and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical, for which you are a traitor to the people,
How, traitor?
- T raitor!
- Nay, temperately, Your promise,
The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people,
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes,
Traitor!
But since he hath served well for Rome,
What do you prate of service?
- I talk of that, that know it,
- You?
Is this the promise you made your mother?
I'll know no further, Let them pronounce death, exile, flaying,
I would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word,
In the name of the people, and in the power of us, the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish him our city,
In the people's name, I say, it shall be so,
- It shall be so!
- He's banished, It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,
- He's sentenced, No more hearing,
- Let me speak,
- It shall be so!
- I have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies' marks upon me,
There is no more to be said, but he is banished as enemy
- to the people and his country!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
You common cry of curs!
Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air,
I, banish, you!
And here remain with your uncertainty,
Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts,
Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair,
Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows,
Despising, for you, the city,
,thus,
, I turn my back,
There is a world, elsewhere,
The people's enemy is gone!
Whoo!
Nay, Mother, where is your ancient courage?
You are too absolute.
Nay, Mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked.
I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both,
- Good day to you all,
The gods keep you,
This is a happier and more comely time,
- Yeah,
- Good day, Good day,
- O, here comes his mother,
- Let's not meet her,
- They say she's mad,
- O, you're well met,
The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love,
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!
I would I had the power to say so to my husband,
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?
I tell thee what, fool, hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words?
Blessed heavens...
More noble blows than ever thou wise words, and for Rome's good, Yet go,
Nay, thou shalt stay, too,
I tell thee what.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
- his good sword in his hand,
- What then?
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!
- Bastards and all,
- Come!
Come, peace!
Well, well, we'll leave you,
Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses!
Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it,
You have told them home, And, by my troth, you have cause,
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat,
I sup upon myself,
,and so shall starve with feeding,
- Come,
- Come, madam,
Hey,
Aufidius!
Ah, general,
Yes,
Well, well,
Hey, hey!
Whence comes thou?
Thy name?
Speak, man, What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, and harsh in sound to thine,
Say, what's thy name?
Thou has a grim appearance,
What's thy name?
- Know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not,
Thy name?
My name is Caius Martius,
,who hath done to thee, particularly, and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief,
Thereto witness may my surname,
,Coriolanus,
Only that name remains,
The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest, and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome,
Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if I had feared death, of all men in the world
I would have avoided thee.
But, in mere spite, to be full quit of those, my banishers, stand I before thee here,
I will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends,
But if thou dares not this, then I present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice, which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since I have ever followed thee with hate, and cannot live but to thy shame
unless it be to do thee service,
O Martius,
Martius...
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy,
Let me twine mine arms about that body,
Know thou... , I loved the maid I married, never man sighed truer breath,
But that I see thee here, thou noble thing,
,more dances my rapt heart than when I first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold,
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, thou hast beat me out 12 several times, and I have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me,
Worthy Martius, had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that thou art thence banished, we would muster all from 12 to 70, and, pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
like a bold flood, overbear it,
Come, go in, and take our friendly senators by the hands,
You bless me, gods,
Therefore, most absolute sir,
,if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission,
And set down as best thou art experienced, since thou knows thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of Rome, or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them, ere destroy,
- Is this Menenius?
- O, 'tis he, 'tis he,
O, he's grown most kind of late,
- Hail, sir,
- Hail to you both,
Your Coriolanus is not much missed, but with his friends,
All's well, and might have been much better
- if he could have temporized,
- Where is he, hear you?
I hear nothing,
His mother and his wife hear nothing from him,
Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war, but insolent, overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, self-loving,
I think not so.
And Rome sits safe and still without him,
- Shh!
- Shh!
There are reports the Volsces, with two several powers, are entered in the Roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war, destroy what lies before them.
- Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius, who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns into the world again,
Come, what talk you of Martius?
It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us,
Cannot be?
We have record that it can,
The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House.
Some news is coming that turns their countenances.
Yes, the first report is seconded, and more more fearful is delivered.
Martius has joined with Aufidius.
He leads a power against Rome, and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius, associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories, and have already overborne their way, consumed with fire, and took what lay before them.
Martius has joined with the Volscians.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies.
Do they still fly to the Roman?
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, their talk at table, and their thanks at end,
And you are darkened in this action, sir,
He bears himself more proud, even to my person, than I thought he would when first I did embrace him,
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature,
Whether it was pride, whether defect of judgment,
,or whether nature, not to be other than one thing, made him feared, so hated, and so banished,
,so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time,
One fire drives out one fire,
,one nail, one nail,
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail,
When, Caius,
Rome is thine, thou art poorest of all,
,then shortly art thou mine,
No, I'll not go,
- Good Menenius,
- Go, you that banished him,
A mile before his tent, fall down, and kneel the way into his mercy,
He would not seem to know me,
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops that we have bled together,
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to, forbad all names,
He was,
,a kind of nothing,
Titleless,
Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome,
If you refuse your aid in this,
If you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman,
- No, I'll not meddle,
- Pray you, go to him,
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius,
Well, and say "Martius return me, as Titus is returned, unhurt,"
What then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome,
You know the very road into his kindness, and cannot lose your way,
I'll undertake it.
I think he'll hear me.
- He'll never hear him,
- No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold,
,his eye, red, as it would burn Rome,
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity,
,and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does,
O Martius, Martius,
Thou art preparing fire for us,
Look thee... ,there's water to quench it,
I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee,
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs,
,and conjure thee to pardon Rome,
Away,
How?
Away?
Wife, mother, child, I know not,
My affairs are servanted to others,
- Sir,
- Therefore be gone,
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak,
This Martius is grown from man to dragon,
He has wings,
He's more than a creeping thing,
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger,
My lord and husband,
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome,
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so,
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny, but do not say for that "Forgive our Romans,"
O, a kiss,
,long as my exile,
,sweet as my revenge,
Ye gods, I prate, and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted,
Sink, my knee, in the earth,
Stand up, blest,
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
- I kneel before thee,
- What's this?
Your knees to me?
T o your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior, I helped to frame thee,
This is a poor epitome of yours, which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself,
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may'st prove to shame, invulnerable,
Your knee, sir,
Even he, your wife, this lady and myself,
- are suitors to you,
- I beseech you, peace,
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics,
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural,
Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons,
No more, no more,
You have said you will not grant us anything, for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already,
Yet we will ask, that if you fail in our request, the blame may hang upon your hardness, Therefore hear us,
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark,
For we'll hear naught from Rome in private,
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile,
Think with thyself,
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,
,constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,
,making the mother, wife, and child to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out,
And we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win,
For either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles through our streets, or else, triumphantly, tread on thy country's ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood,
For myself, son,
,I purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine,
If I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mother's womb,
,that brought thee to this world,
Aye, and mine, that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time,
You shall not tread on me,
I'll run away till I'm bigger,
,but then I'll fight!
- I have sat too long,
- Nay, go not from us thus,
If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans, thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve, thou might'st condemn us as poisonous of your honor,
No, Our suit is that you reconcile them,
So that the Volces may say "This mercy we have showed,"
the Romans, "This we've received,"
and each on either side give the all-hail to thee and cry,
"Be blest for making up this peace!"
Speak to me, son,
Why dost not speak?
Speak you, daughter,
He cares not for your weeping,
Speak thou, boy,
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons,
There's no man in the world more bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks!
Thou hast never, in thy life, shown thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor,
Say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so,
,thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs,
Down, ladies, Let us shame him with our knees!
Down!
This is the last,
An end,
So we will home to Rome, and die among our neighbors,
Nay,
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot tell what he would have,
,yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it,
Come, let us go,
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother!
His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance,
Yet give us our dispatch I am hushed until our city be afire, and then I'll speak a little,
O Mother,
Mother...
What have you done?
Behold...
,the heavens do ope,
,the gods look down,
,and this unnatural scene they laugh at,
O my mother!
Mother!
O!
You have won,
,a happy victory to Rome,
But for your son, believe it,
O believe it,
Most, dangerously you have prevailed with him,
If not most mortal to him,
But let it come.
Aufidius,
,though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace,
Now, good Aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less?
Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were, And, sir, it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion,
But, good sir, what peace you'll make, advise me,
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
No, not the expulsion of the T arquins,
We have all great cause to give great thanks,
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome,
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain,
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all,
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction,
I raised him, and I pawned mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened, he watered his new plants with dews of flattery, seducing so my friends,
At the last, I seemed his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary,
So he did, my lord, The army marveled at it,
And, in the last, when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory,
There was it!
For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him,
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor of our great action,
Therefore shall he die,
,and I'll renew me in his fall,
Say no more,
I am returned your soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when I parted hence, but still subsisting under your great command,
We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans,
T ell the traitor, in the highest degree
- he hath abused your powers,
- Traitor?
How now?
Aye, traitor, Martius,
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius,
Caius Martius,
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?
Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome,
I say "your city," for his wife and mother,
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk,
Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory,
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears,
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it,
"Boy"?
O slave,
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me!
"Boy"?
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there that, like an eagle in a dovecote,
I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles,
Alone I did it,
"Boy,"
Let him die for it,
Thousands wait for food
Senate declares state of emergency
General Martius Suspends civil liberties
A place calling itself Rome
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
Resolved. resolved.
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
We know't, we know't.
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
the leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery;
our sufferance is a gain to them.
Let us revenge this with our sticks and we become rakes.
No more talking on it, come.
Soft!
soft!
who comes here?
Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved the people.
I tell you, friends, most charitable care Have the patricians of you.
For your wants, Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them Against the Roman state, suffer us to famish, and their store-houses crammed with grain.

What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
Make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word.
He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring.
What would you have, you curs,
That like nor peace nor war?
the one affrights you,
The other makes you proud.
He that trusts to you,
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
Where foxes, geese.
Who deserves greatness, Deserves your hate;
Hang ye!
Trust Ye?
With every minute you do change a mind,
And call him noble that was now your hate,
Him vile that was your garland.
What's the matter,
That in these several places of the city
You cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?
Go!
Get your home, you fragments!
Stand back!
Ancient Volscian border dispute flares
Tullus Aufidius threatens Volscain attack on Rome
Volscian headquarters Antium
Please.
know you me yet?
I know you well, your name, I think, is Aufidius.
It is so.
I am a Roman.
What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections;
the people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
Hath been!
- is it ended, then?
- The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again you have ended my business.
Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
The Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
I sin in envying his nobility,
And were I any thing but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together.
he is a lion that I am proud to hunt.
Titus Lartius, thou Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face
Lead you on.
So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels ...
- And know how we proceed.
- Is it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone Since I heard thence;
By the discovery We shall be shorten'd in our aim.
and it is rumour'd, Marcius your old enemy, lead on this preparation.
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike Till one can do no more.
If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
He's mine, or I am his
Volscian city of Corioles
He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce, And he shall feel mine edge.
Go!
The citizens of Corioli have issued, And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle.
I saw our party to their trenches driven, And then I came away.
I pray you, daughter, sing;
or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
if my son were my husband,
I'm more free with rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour... than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb,
I, considering how honour would become such a person.
was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame.
To a cruel war I sent him;
from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
But had he died in the business, madam; how then?
Then ... his good report should have been my son;
Hear me.
had I a dozen sons,
I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee And tread upon his neck
Methinks I hear ... hither your husband's drum,
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus
'Come on, you cowards!
you were got in fear, Though you were born in Rome'
You souls of geese,
That bear the shapes of men,
Pluto and hell!
look to't, come on.
Mend and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
And make my wars on you

His bloody brow!
O Jupiter, no blood!
Away, you fool!

The Senator Valeria is come to visit you.
Tell Valeria, We are fit to bid her welcome.
- Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- Indeed, you shall not.
My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both?
How does your little son?
Thank you, so well good.
He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than look upon his school-master.
O' my word, the father's son
Come, I must have you play the idle husewife with me this afternoon.
- No signore, non voglio uscire.
- No, I will not out of doors.
- She shall, she shall.
- Indeed, no, by your patience
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably
I cannot go thither.
You would be another Penelope yet, they say, all the yarn she spun in
Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
No, pardon me, indeed, I will not forth go with me and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
- Ma e' troppo presto per averne.
- there came news from him last night.
Indeed?
your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars.
This is true, on mine honour and so, I pray, go out with us.
Give me excuse, But it's Ah...
I will obey you in every thing hereafter.
Let her alone, as she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.
What is become of Marcius?
Slain, sir, doubtless.
he is himself alone, To answer all the city.
Thou art left, Marcius
Who's yonder, that does appear as he were flay'd?
O gods, he has the stamp of Marcius
Come I too late?
Come I too late?
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others, But mantled in your own.
O, let me clip ye In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done
There is the man of my soul's hate,
Aufidius, Piercing my Romans.
Worthy sir, thou bleed'st.
Thy exercise hath been too violent for A second course of fight.
Sir, praise me not;
My work hath yet not warm'd me
The blood I drop is rather physical Than dangerous to me to Aufidius thus I will appear, and fight.
If any such be here-- As it were sin to doubt that love this painting Wherein you see me smear'd if any fear Lesser his person than an ill report
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
And that his country's dearer than himself Let him alone, or so many so minded, Wave thus, to express his disposition,
And follow Marcius!
O, me alone!
make you a sword of me.
Avanza, valoroso Tito!
Away!
- Come!
- Come!
I'll fight with none but thee for I do hate thee
We hate alike
Five times, Marcius, I have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me,
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter As often as we eat.
for where I thought to crush him in an equal force,
True sword to sword,
I'll potch at him some way
Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.
Bolder, though not so subtle.
nor sleep nor sanctuary,
Being naked, sick,
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice, shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst my hate to Marcius
where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard,
even there, would I wash my fierce hand in's heart.
Honourable Menenius!
my boy Marcius approaches;
for the love of Juno, let's go.
Is he not wounded?
he was wont to come home wounded.
O, yes, he is wounded;
I thank the gods for't.
So do I too, if it be not too much brings a' victory in his pocket?
the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
The gods grant them true!
- True?
- I'll be sworn they are true.
- Where is he wounded?
- I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall stand for his place
He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five wounds upon him.
Now it's twenty-seven every gash was an enemy's grave.
before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears
Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
be it known, as to us, to all the world that Caius Marcius Wears this war's garland and from this time, For what he did before Corioli, call him, With all the applause and clamour of the host,
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS!
Bear the addition nobly ever!
CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS
No more of this; it does offend my heart:
Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother!
O, You have, I know, petition'd all the gods For my prosperity!
Nay, my good soldier, up.
My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honour newly named, What is it?
Coriolanus must I call you?
But O, thy wife!
My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home, That weep'st to see me triumph?
Ay, my dear, Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
And mothers that lack sons.
- Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh, I am light and heavy.
I know not where to turn
O, you're welcome home and ye're welcome all.
- A hundred thousand welcomes.
- Welcome home!
Welcome home, welcome!
Benvenuto Coriolano!
Will newly general coriolanus stand for consulship?
'Tis thought that Marcius shall be consul
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to bear him speak matrons flung gloves, Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers, upon him as he pass'd the nobles bended, As to Jove's statue,
and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts I never saw the like.
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people ...
- Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
- Nay. but his taunts.
The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Marcius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
You blame Marcius for being proud?
We do it not alone, sir.
I know you can do very little alone
You talk of pride
O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
O that you could!
What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber in't one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning
what I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing.
You are ambitious
God-den to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain
How many stand for consulships?
Three, they say, but 'tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and loves not the common people.
there had been many great men that have flattered the people, who ne'er loved them therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see't.
but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him
That seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well; and could be content to give him good report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
The good patricians must be visited;
From whom I have received not only greetings,
But with them change of honours.
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Our Rome will cast upon thee.
Know, good mother, I had rather be their servant in my way,
Than sway with them in theirs.
coriolanus wil win.
Well, he's a good man, he'll win.
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, During his power, go sleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honours from where he should begin and end, but will Lose those he hath won.
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear i' the market-place nor on him put the napless vesture of humility
Nor showing, as the manner is his wounds To the people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word, It shall be to him then as our good wills, a sure destruction.
So it must fall out to him or our authorities.
For an end,
We must suggest the people in what hatred He still hath held them
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze Shall darken him for ever.
As the main point of this our after-meeting, To gratify his noble service that
Hath thus stood for his country therefore, please you, Most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul, and last general In our well-found successes to report a little of that worthy work perform'd By Caius Marcius Coriolanus
Speak, good Cominius
Nay, keep your place.
Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear What you have nobly done.
Your horror's pardon, I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them.
Pray now, sit down.
I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monster'd.
- Parla, buon Comino.
- Cominio, procedi.
The deeds of Coriolanus Should not be utter'd feebly.
It is held that valour is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver if it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
At sixteen years, he fought beyond the mark of others
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man i' the field,
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurch'd all swords of the garland.
For this last, Before and in Corioli, let me say, I cannot speak him home he stopp'd the fliers;
and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport from face to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries alone he enter'd The mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny;
aidless came off, and with a sudden reinforcement struck Corioli like a planet and till we call'd Both field and city ours, he never stood To ease his breast with panting.
Our spoils he kick'd at, and look'd upon things precious as they were
And look'd upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world he covets less Than misery itself would give;
rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you, let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot entreat them, for my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage please you that I may pass this doing.
Sir, the people must have their voices
Pray you, go fit you to the custom
It is apart that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken from the people.
- Mark you that?
- To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
As if I had received them for the hire of their breath only!
and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour.
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased To make thee consul.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
- Let me o'erleap that custom,
- The people must have their voices have you not known the worthiest men have done't?
Custom calls me to't:
what custom wills, in all things should we do't,
What must I say?
Look, sir, my wounds!
I got them in my country's service,
O me, the gods!
You must not speak of that
- you must desire them to think upon you.
- Think upon me!
hang 'em!
I would they would forget me
pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you, In wholesome manner.
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean.
You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
- Mine own desert.
- Your own desert!
- Ay, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?
No, 'twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly!
Sir, I pray, let me ha't
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private
Your good voice, sir; what say you?
You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged, adieu.
But this is something odd.
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul,
You have deserved nobly of your country, and you have not deserved nobly.
Your enigma?
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have been a rod to her friends;
you have not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
Noi speriamo d'averti amico
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give you our voices heartily.
I will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
Your voices for your voices I have fought;
Watch'd for your voices;
Your voices bear Of wounds two dozen odd;
battles thrice six I have seen and heard of;
for your voices have Done many things, some less, some more
your voices,
Indeed
I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice.
Therefore let him be consul
Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Worthy voices!
Worthy voices!
Worthy voices!
You have stood your limitation;
and the tribunes endue you with the people's voice
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged
The people do admit you, and are summon'd To meet anon, upon your approbation.
- Where?
at the senate-house?
- There, Coriolanus.
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.
I'll keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
God save thee, noble consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
my masters, my masters!
My masters, how now?
!
have you chose this man?
Yes!
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Amen, sir to my poor unworthy notice, He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
He flouted us downright.
No, no, no, no
No,'tis his kind of speech, he did not mock us.
he should have show'd us His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
Why, I am sure, so he did.
No, he didn't.
No, no; no one saw 'em.
Was not this mockery?
Yes!
yes!
when he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, He was your enemy, ever spake against your liberties
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you, When he hath power to crush?
Yes!
yes!
He's not confirm'd!
He's not confirm'd!
- we may deny him yet.
- Yes!
yes!
And will deny him
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
Yes!
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
Yes!
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends, they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment all revoke Your ignorant election;
enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you
And presently, when you have drawn your number, Repair to the Senate.
- Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
- He had, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- he is retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
- How?
what?
- How often he had met you, sword to sword;
That of all things upon the earth he hated Your person most,
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, To oppose his hatred fully.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, The tongues o' the common mouth
- Pass no further.
- Ha!
what is that?
It will be dangerous to go on
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give way.
- The people are incensed against him.
- Are these your herd?
- Be calm, be calm.
The people cry you mock'd them, They made call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.
- You show too much of that for which the people stir if you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way, with a gentler spirit,
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused; set on.
This was my speech, and I will speak't again--
Not now, not now.
Not in this heat, sir, now.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them Regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves
I say again,
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd,
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number, who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
- but that which they have given to beggars.
- Well, no more.
No more words, we beseech you.
You speak o' the people, as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
'Twere well We let the people know't.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
mark you his absolute 'shall'?
Why, shall the people give One that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, More worthier than their voices.
By Jove himself!
It makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter 'twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other.
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles.
- Come, enough.
- Enough, with over-measure.
Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do.
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This a consul?
no.
Hence, old goat!
On both sides more respect.
Here's he that would take from you all your power.
You are at point to lose your liberties
Marcius would have all from you;
Marcius, whom late you have named for consul.
What is the city but the people?
True, the people are the city.
the people are the city.
We do here pronounce, Upon the part o' the people,
Marcius is worthy of present death.
Death!
Death!
seize him!
No, I'll die here.
Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
All will be naught else.
Come, sir, along with us.
As I do know the consul's worthiness, So can I name his faults,--
Consul!
what consul?
- The consul Coriolanus.
- He consul!
- It is decreed he dies to-night.
- He's a disease that must be cut away.
O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
Killing our enemies?
the blood he hath lost...
he dropp'd it for his country;
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more.
Consider This!
he has been bred i' the wars Since he could draw a sword.
and is ill school'd In bolted language.
Give me leave, I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
Where he shall answer, by a lawful form In peace to his utmost peril.
Noble tribunes, It is the humane way.
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.
if you bring not Marcius... we'll proceed In our first way.
I'll bring him to you.
Let them puff all about mine ears!
present me Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels, yet will I still Be thus to them.
I muse my mother Does not approve me further!
I talk of you Why did you wish me milder?
would you have me False to my nature?
Rather say I play The man I am.
O, sir, sir, sir,
I would have had you put your power well on, Before you had worn it out.
Let go!
You might have been enough the man you are, With striving less to be so
- Let them hang!
- Ay, and burn too!
Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough;
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy; unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst, and perish.
Pray, be counsell'd:
I have a heart as little apt as yours,
But yet a brain... that leads my use of anger To better vantage.
- Well said, noble woman.
- What must I do?
- Return to the tribunes.
- Well, what then?
what then?
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods;
Must I then do't to them?
You are too absolute;
I have heard you say,
Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends, I' the war do grow together
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak To the people ot by your own instruction,
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
But with such words that are but rooted in Your tongue, hough but bastards and syllables Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required I should do so in honour
I am in this, Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
And you.
I prithee now, my son,
Go to them, be with them, say to them,
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils Hast not the soft way
In asking their good loves.
but... thou wilt frame Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
This but done, Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
Prithee now, Go, and be ruled.
sir,'tis fit You make strong party, or defend yourself By calmness or by absence
- all's in anger.
- Only fair speech.
I think 'twill serve, if he Can thereto frame his spirit.
He must do it!
You will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I will do't
Away, my disposition, and possess me Some harlot's spirit!
a beggar's tongue make motion through my lips
I will not do't,
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
And by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
At thy choice, then
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour Than thou of them.
Come all to ruin;
let Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
But owe thy pride thyself.
Pray, be content, Mother I am going,
Chide me no more.
Look!
I am going!
I'll return consul.
Or never trust to what my tongue can do I' the way of flattery further.
Do your will.
In this point charge him home, that he affects Tyrannical power, if he evade us there, Enforce him with his envy to the people,
Have you a catalogue Of all the voices that we have procured Set down by the poll?
I have; 'tis ready.
And the people hither me say 'It shall be so I' the right and strength o' the commons, 'be it either For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them hear me say Fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
I shall inform them.
May God preserve you!
The people are 'the city'.
I'm not been ready for each of common, Calmly, I do beseech you.
The honour'd...
The honour'd gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men!
plant love among 's!
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace, And not our streets with war!
- Amen!
- Amen!
A noble wish.
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, If you submit you to the people's voices,
I am content.
Lo, citizens, he says he is content
The warlike service he has done.
Consider, think upon the wounds his body bears, which show Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers, Scars to move laughter only.
Consider further, That when he speaks not like a citizen,
You find him like a soldier.
do not take His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
But, as I say, such as become a soldier.
What is the matter That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour You take it off again?
We charge you, that you have contrived to take From Rome all season'd office, and to wind Yourself into a power tyrannical;
For which you are a traitor to the people.
traitor?
traitor!
- Nay, temperately; your promise.
- The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
Call me their traitor!
Thou injurious tribune!
Mark you this, people?
Yeah!
Traitor!
he hath Served well for Rome.
What do you prate of service?
- I talk of that, that know it.
- You!
Is this the promise that you made your mother?
I know no further, let them pronounce to the death, Exile, Flame,
I would not buy Their mercy at the price of one fair word!
in the name o' the people and in the power of us The tribunes we even from this instant, banish him our city, I' the people's name i say,
It shall be so, it shall be so.
He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
It shall be so, it shall be so!
It shall be so, it shall be so!
Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...
- He's sentenced; no more hearing.
- Let me speak.
I have been consul, and can show for Rome Her enemies' marks upon me.
There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
As enemy to the people and his country.
It shall be so, it shall be so!
It shall be so, it shall be so!
No!
You common cry of curs!
whose breath I hate as reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
As the dead carcasses of unburied men That do corrupt my air.
I banish you.
And here remain with your uncertainty!
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
Fan you into despair!
Have the power still To banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
Making not reservation of yourselves,
Still your own foes, deliver you, as most abated captives to some nation,
That won you without blows!
Despising,
For you,
The city.
Thus,
I turn my back.
There is a world,
Elsewhere.
The people's enemy is gone!
Nay, mother, Where is your ancient courage?
You are too absolute.
My mother, I shall be loved when I am lack'd.
I go alone.
Like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both!
- God-den to you all.
God-den to you all.
- Today the life and 'more' happy, more 'beautiful.
- Yes.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- Here comes his mother.
- They say she's mad.
O, ye're well met.
The hoarded plague o' the gods Requite your love!
Will you be gone?
You shall stay too, I would I had the power To say so to my husband.
Are you mad?
Ay, fool; is that a shame?
tell me what
Hadst thou craft To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
Than thou hast spoken words?
- O blessed heavens!
- More noble blows than ever thou wise words
And for Rome's good.
Now go 'way.
Nay, but thou shalt stay too.
Tell you what,
I would my son Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him, His good sword in his hand.
- What then?
- What then!
He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
- Bastards and all.
- Come, come, peace.
Well, well, let's go.
Why stay we to be baited With one that wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do,
But to confirm my curses!
Could I meet 'em But once a-day, it would unclog my heart Of what lies heavy to't.
You have told them home;
And, by my troth, you have cause.
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat.
I sup upon myself,
And so shall starve with feeding.
ANTIUM
Oh, Aufidius.
General!
Whence comest thou?
thy name?
Speak, man What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, And harsh in sound to thine.
Say!
What's thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance.
What's thy name?
- know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not.
- thy name?
- My name is Caius Marcius,
Who hath done To thee particularly, and to all the Volsces Great hurt and mischief.
thereto witness may my surname
Coriolanus.
Only that name remains,
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Who have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest.
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be Whoop'd out of Rome.
Now this extremity Hath brought me to thy hearth, ot out of hope-- Mistake me not--to save my life.
for if I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers, Stand I before thee here.
I will fight,
Against my canker'd country with the spleen Of all the under fiends.
But if so be Thou darest not this, and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice.
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
And cannot live but to thy shame,
Unless It be to do thee service.
O Marcius!
Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke, hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
Let me twine Mine arms, about that body,
Know thou,
I loved the maid I married,
Never man Sigh'd truer breath.
but that I see thee here,
Thou noble thing!
More dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw Bestride my threshold.
Why, thou Mars!
I tell thee,
Thou hast beat me out Twelve several times, and I have nightly since Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me
Worthy Marcius,
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that Thou art thence banish'd,
We would muster all From twelve to seventy,
And pouring war Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear.
O, come, go in,
And take our friendly senators by the hands;
You bless me, gods!
Therefore,
Most absolute sir, if thou wilt have The leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission;
and set down...
As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st Thy country's strength and weakness... thine own ways;
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
Or rudely visit them in parts remote, To fright them, ere destroy.
Is this Menenius?
'Tis he,'tis he, O, he is grown most kind of late.
Hail sir!
Hail to you both!
Your Coriolanus Is not much miss'd, but with his friends,
All's well;
and might have been much better, if He could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?
- Nay, I hear nothing
His mother and his wife Hear nothing from him.
Caius Marcius was A worthy officer i' the war... insolent, O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
- Self-loving...
- I think not so.
and Rome Sits safe and still without him.
There are reports the Volsces with two several powers Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
And with the deepest malice of the war Destroy what lies before 'em.
'Tis Aufidius!
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment, Thrusts forth his horns into the world again;
Come what talk you Of Marcius?
It cannot be The Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can,
The nobles in great earnestness are going All to the senate-house some news is come That turns their countenances.
Yes, The slave's report is seconded; and more, More fearful, is deliver'd.
Marcius, Join'd with Aufidius
He leads a power 'gainst Rome, And vows revenge as spacious as between The young'st and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius Associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories; and have already O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took What lay before them.
Marcius, Join'd with The Volsce.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies
Or butchers killing flies.
Do they still fly to the Roman?
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end
And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
He bears himself more proudlier, Even to my person, than I thought he would When first I did embrace him sir,
I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it By sovereignty of nature.
Whether 'twas pride,
Whether defect of judgment or whether nature, Not to be other than one thing, ...made him fear'd,
So hated, and so banish'd
So our virtues Lie in the interpretation of the time
One fire drives out one fire;
one nail, one nail;
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
When,
Caius,
Rome is thine,
Thou art poor'st of all;
then shortly... art thou mine.
No, I'll not go
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banish'd him!
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee The way into his mercy
He would not seem to know me.
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops That we have bled together.
Coriolanus He would not answer to forbad all names.
He was a... kind of nothing,
titleless,
Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire Of burning Rome.
- if you refuse your aid...
- if you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue more than the instant army we can make, Might stop our countryman.
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.
What should I do?
Only make trial what your love can do For Rome, towards Marcius.
Well, and say that Marcius Return me, as Titus is return'd, Unheard; what then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome,
You know the very road into his kindness, And cannot lose your way.
I'll undertake 't
I think he'll hear me.
He'll never hear him.
No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold,
His eye red as 'twould burn Rome;
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does!
O Martius, Martius!
thou art preparing fire for us.
Look thee,
Here's water to quench it.
I was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee,
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs.
and conjure thee to pardon Rome,
Away!
HOW!
Away!
?
Wife, mother, child, I know not.
My affairs are servanted to others
- sir...
- Therefore, be gone.
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.
This Marcius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings;
He's more than a creeping thing.
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.
Coriolanus and Aufidius begin assault on Rome.
My lord and husband!
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed Makes you think so.
Best of my flesh,
Forgive my tyranny.
but do not say For that 'Forgive our Romans'.
O, a kiss
Long as my exile,
Sweet as my revenge!
You gods!
I prate,
And the most noble mother of the world Leave unsaluted.
Sink, my knee, i' the earth;
O, stand up blest!
Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint, I kneel before thee
What is this?
Your knees to me?
To your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior;
I holp to frame thee.
This is a poor epitome of yours,
Which by the interpretation of full time May show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove To shame unvulnerable,
Your knee, sirrah.
Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself, Are suitors to you.
I beseech you, peace!
Or, if you'ld ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.
Tell me not Wherein I seem unnatural
Desire not to ally my rages and revenges with Your colder reasons.
O, no more, no more!
You have said you will not grant us any thing,
For we have nothing else to ask, but that Which you deny already: yet we will ask,
That, if you fail in our request, the blame May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll Hear nought from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life We have led since thy exile.
Think!
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that thy sight which should Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow
Making the mother, wife and child to see
The son, the husband and the father tearing His country's bowels out.
We must find An evident calamity, though we had Our wish, which side should win for either thou.
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led With manacles thorough our streets, or else triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
Thy wife and children's blood.
For myself, son,
I purpose not to wait on fortune till These wars determine.
if I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner March to assault thy country than to tread--on thy mother's womb,
- That brought thee to this world.
- Ay, and mine,
That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name Living to time.
A' shall not tread on me!
I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight!
- I have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us, As poisonous of your honour, no
Our suit Is that you reconcile them
So the Volsces May say 'This mercy we have show'd the Romans, 'This we received;' and each in either side give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest for making up this peace!
'
Speak to me, son
Why dost not speak?
Daughter, speak you
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more Than can our reasons.
There's no man in the world More bound to 's mother, yet here he lets me prate Like one i' the stocks.
Thou hast never in thy life Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy, When she, poor hen, Has cluck'd thee to the wars, and safely home, Loaden with honour.
Say my request's unjust, And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
Thou art not honest.
and the gods will plague thee,
That thou restrain'st from me the duty which To a mother's part belongs.
Down, ladies;
let us shame him with our knees.
Down!
This is the last!
pray.
so we will home to Rome, And die among our neighbours.
Nay, behold 's this boy, that cannot tell what he would have
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
Does reason our petition with more strength
Than thou hast to deny 't.
Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother,
His wife is in Corioli and his child Like him by chance.
Yet give us our dispatch.
I am hush'd until our city be a-fire, And then I'll speak a little.
O mother,
mother!
What have you done?
Behold,
the heavens, do ope,
The gods look down,
and this unnatural scene They laugh at.
O my mother, mother!
O mother!
Ah!
You have won a happy victory to Rome.
But, for your son,--believe it,
O, believe it!
Most,
Dangerously you have prevail'd with him,
If not most mortal to him.
But, let it come.
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, Were you in my stead, would you have heard A mother less?
or granted less, Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were!
And, sir, it is no little thing to make Mine eyes to sweat compassion.
But, good sir, What peace you'll make, advise me.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
we have all Great cause to give great thanks.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain.
His stoutness will remain uncertain whilst 'Twixt you there's difference.
but the fall of either Makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits A good construction.
I raised him, and I pawn'd Mine honour for his truth.
who being so heighten'd,
He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
Seducing so my friends.
at the last, I seem'd his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance, as if I had been mercenary.
So he did, my lord:
The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last, When he had carried Rome and that we look'd For no less spoil than glory...
There was it.
For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour Of our great action.
therefore shall he die
And I'll renew me in his fall.
'tseems he arrived!
I am return'd your soldier,
No more infected with my country's love Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting Under your great command.
We have made peace With no less honour to the Volscians
Than shame to the Romans.
Tell the traitor, in the high'st degree He hath abused your powers.
Traitor?
how now!
Ay, traitor, Marcius!
- Marcius?
- Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius!
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name Coriolanus?
Perfidiously He has betray'd your business, and given up, For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother,
Breaking his oath and resolution like A twist of rotten silk, never admitting Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears.
He whined and roar'd away your victory,
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart Too great for what contains it.
Boy!
O slave!
Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
Stain all your edges on me.
Boy!
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there, That, like an eagle in a dove-cote,
I flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
Alone I did it.
Boy!
Let him die for it.
[exhales]

[overlapping chatter]
[baby screaming in the distance] [siren wailing nearby]
[inaudible dialogue]
[angry shouting]
[indistinct chatter]
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
[all] Resolved.
First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.
- [all murmur] We know it.
- Let us kill him.
And we'll have corn at our own price.
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, our suffering, is a gain to them.
Aye...
Let us revenge this with our sticks, ere we become rakes.
No more talking on it.
Come!
Soft, soft, who comes here?
...friends, mine honest neighbors...
Worthy Senator Menenius, one that has always loved the people.
I tell you, friends, most charitable care have the patricians of you.
For your wants, your suffering in this dearth, you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the Roman state.
Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain.
Bread!
- [man] Bread!
- [all murmur] Bread.
[all] Bread!
[crowd chanting] Bread, bread, bread...!
[clamoring]
Bread, bread, bread...
- [horn honking] - [people screaming] [grunting]
Stop!
- Stop!
Stop!
- [shouting ceases]
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word.
He that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring.
What would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war?
The one affrights you, the other makes you proud.
He that trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares, where foxes, geese.
Who deserves greatness, deserves your hate.
Hang ye.
Trust ye?
With every minute you do change your mind, and call him noble that was now your hate, him vile that was your garland.
What's the matter, that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?
Go.
Get you home you fragments.
[batons rhythmically pounding shields]
- [man] Go back!
- [man 2] Forward!
[shouts]
- [rhythmic pounding continuing over TV] - [man] Go back!
[clamoring over TV]
[inaudible]
- Please...
- Know you me yet?
I know you well.
Your name, I think, is Aufidius.
It is so.
- l'm a Roman.
- What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections.
- The people against the senators.
- Hath been?
is it ended then?
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again.
[Aufidius on TV] You have ended my business.
The news is the Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that'll put you to it.
I sin in envying his nobility.
And were I anything but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together?
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt.
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
Lead you on.
So your opinion is, Aufidius, that they of Rome are entered in our counsels
- and know how we proceed.
- [Aufidius] ls it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone since I heard thence.
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim.
And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads on this preparation.
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more.
If ever again I meet him beard to beard, he's mine or I am his.
[bombs whistling]
[rapid gunfire]
[rapid gunfire continues] [grunts]
[man] Mark me!
[screams]
[Martius] They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts.
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge!
Go!
[grunts] [bullets ricochet]
Come on.
Away!
[rapid gunfire]
[grunting]
[gunshot] [can clanking on ground]
[TV plays indistinctly]
[man] The citizens of Corioles have issued and given to Titus and to Martius battle.
We've heard their drums.
I saw our forces to their trenches
- driven, and then I came away...
- [TV clicks off] I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
If my son were my husband, I would more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame.
To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Then his good report should have been my son.
Hear me.
Had I a dozen sons, I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius.
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum.
I see him stamp thus, cry thus:
"Come on, you cowards!
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome."
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men!
Pluto and hell.
Look to it.
Come on!
Mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe and make my wars on you.
His bloody brow then wiping, forth he goes.
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.
Away, you fool.
It more becomes a man than gold his trophy.
Senator Menenius is come to visit you.
Tell him we are fit to bid him welcome.
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- indeed, you shall not.
- My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both?
And how does your little son?
I thank you, sir.
Well, good.
He'd rather play with swords and hear a drum
- than look upon his schoolmaster.
- On my word, the father's son.
[both chuckling]
Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.
No, good sir, I will not out of doors.
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.
Indeed, no, by your patience.
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.
- l cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
[chuckling]
No, good sir.
Pardon me.
Indeed, I will not forth.
Go with me, and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
No, good sir, there can be none yet.
- There came news from him last night.
- [woman] Indeed?
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Carioles.
They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars.
This is true, on mine honor.
So, I pray, go out with us.
Give me excuse, good sir.
I will obey you in everything hereafter.
Let her alone.
As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.
[rapid gunfire]
- [panting] - [rapid gunfire]
[panting]
[grunts]
[breathes heavily]
[panting]
[yelling]
[gun fires] [gun clicking]
[both grunting]
[yells]
- [Titus] What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless.
He is himself alone, to answer all the city.
[whispers] Thou art lost, Martius.
[rapid gunfire in distance]
Who's yonder, that does appear as he were flayed?
O gods!
He has the stamp of Martius.
Come I too late?
!
Aye, if you come not in the blood of others, but mantled in your own.
Let me hold you in arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done.
[explosion]
There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight.
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.
The blood I drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me.
To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight.
If any such be here, as it were sin to doubt, that love this painting wherein you see me smeared, if any fear lesser his person than an ill report, if any think brave death outweighs bad life,
and that his country is dearer than himself, let him alone, or so many so minded wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow Martius!
O... me alone.
Make you a sword of me!
[all yelling] [rapid gunfire]
Oi!
[Martius] Advance, brave Titus!
[grunts] [rapid gunfire continues]
Away!
Come!
Come!
I'll fight with none but thee, for l do hate thee.
We hate alike.
[both grunting]
[grunts] [grunts, yells]
[both yelling]
[yelling]
[groaning]
[explosion]
[bomb whistling] [explosion] [debris clattering]
[wind whistling]
[panting]
Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee.
So often has thou beat me, and would do so, I fear, should we encounter as often as we eat.
For where l thought to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way.
Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.
[Aufidius] Bolder, though not so subtle.
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius.
Where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.
[woman] Honorable Menenius!
My boy, Martius, approaches.
For the love of Juno, let's go.
is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.
O yes, he is wounded.
I thank the gods for it.
O, so do I too, if it be not too much.
Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius said they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
Gods grant them true.
- True.
- l'll be sworn they're true.
Where is he wounded?
In the shoulder and in the left arm.
There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
He had, before this last expedition,
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.
Every gash was an enemy's grave.
[quietly] Before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm doth lie.
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
[cameras clicking]
[man] Be it known, as to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius wears this war's garland.
And, from this time, for what he did before Corioles, call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host:
"Caius Martius Coriolanus." Bear the addition nobly ever.
[all] Caius Martius Coriolanus!
[applause]
No more of this. lt does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother.
O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods for my prosperity.
Nay, my good soldier, up.
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honor newly named...
What is it?
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife...
My gracious silence, hail.
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home, that weeps to see me triumph?
Aye, my dear, such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, and mothers that lack sons.
- [Menenius] Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh.
I'm light and heavy.
- [laughter] - l know not where to turn.
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!
- [applause]
- Welcome, Coriolanus!
Welcome!
[man] 'Tis thought that Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and the blind to hear him speak.
Matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed.
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.
And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
[man] Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius?
[man 2] He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people...
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
You blame Martius for being proud?
- We do it not alone, sir.
- l know you can do very little alone.
You talk of pride.
O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves.
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy politicians, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it.
One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning.
What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.
- You're ambitious.
- [chuckles] [sighs]
Good e'en to your worships.
More of your conversation would infect my brain.
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say, but 'tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow, but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people.
There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them.
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition.
And, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see it.
But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him.
Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well.
And would be content to give him good report for it, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.
[clattering] [paper tearing]
[Martius grunts softly] [sighs]
The good senators must be visited, from whom I have received not only greetings, but with them change of honors.
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy.
Only there's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee.
Good mother, I'd rather be their servant in my way, than sway with them in theirs.
[door opens]
Coriolanus will carry it.
He's a worthy man.
He will carry it.
[bell rings]
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, during his power, go asleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end, but will lose those he hath won.
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear in the marketplace, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word. lt shall be to him then, a sure destruction.
So it must fall out to him, or our authorities, for an end.
We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them.
Kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze shall darken him forever.
[low, indistinct chatter]
[Menenius] lt remains, as the main point of this our after-meeting, to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country.
Therefore, please you, most grave and reverend elders, to desire the present consul, and last general in our well-found successes, to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.
- [man] Speak, good Cominius.
- [men] Aye.
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.
Never shame to hear what you have nobly done.
Your honor's pardon. I'd rather have my wounds to heal again
- than hear say how I got them.
- Pray you, sit down.
I'd rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered.
[murmuring]
- [man] Speak, good Cominius.
- [man 2] Aye, proceed.
The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly.
It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver.
If it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
[voice receding] At 1 6 years, he fought beyond the mark of others.
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man in the field.
[voice echoing] And in the brunt of 1 7 battles since, he lurched all swords of the garland.
For this last, before and in Corioles, let me say I cannot speak him home.
He stopped the fliers, and by his rare example, made coward turn terror into sport, from face to foot.
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
[voice echoing] Alone, he entered the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny.
- [low rumbling]
- Aidless came off, and with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioles like a planet.
[voice receding] Until we called both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting.
Our spoils he kicked at, and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world.
He covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
[applause] [indistinct salutations]
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
[scattered murmurs] Aye.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you, let me overleap that custom, for l cannot entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage.
Please you that I may pass this doing.
Sir!
The people must have their voices.
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.
It is a part that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken
- from the people.
- Mark you that?
To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, as if I had received them for the hire of their breath only.
To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor!
[applause]
- [laughter] - [applause continues over TV]
[Menenius] The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul!
[Martius] I do owe them still my life and services.
[Menenius] lt then remains that you do speak to the people.
[Martius] Let me overleap that custom.
[man] The people must have their voices.
Have you not known the worthiest men have done it?
Custom calls me to it.
What custom wills, in all things should we do it.
What must I say?
"Look, sir, my wounds.
I got them in my country's service."
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that.
You must desire them to think upon you.
Think upon me?
Hang 'em.
I would they would forget me.
[siren chirping]
Pray you, speak to them.
I pray you, in wholesome manner.
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean.
[helicopter passing overhead]
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
We do, sir.
Tell us what hath brought you to it.
- Mine own desert.
- [woman] Your own desert?
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it.
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private.
Your good voice, sir.
What say you?
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged.
Adieu.
But this is something odd.
[Martius] Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voice that I may be consul.
You've deserved nobly of your country, and you've not deserved nobly.
[chuckles]
Your enigma?
You've been a scourge to her enemies, you've been a rod to her friends.
You've not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.
I'll make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.
Your voices!
For your voices I have fought.
Watched for your voices.
For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd.
Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of!
For your voices have done many things, some less, some more.
Your voices!
Indeed, I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!
- [man] Aye.
- [man 2] Aye.
Therefore, let him be consul!
- Amen!
- Amen!
[others join in] Amen!
Amen!
[chanting]
- Amen!
- [chanting continues]
- Worthy voices!
- [chanting continues]
Worthy voices, worthy voices.
[chanting, cheering]
[Menenius] You have stood your limitation.
And the tribunes now endow you with the people's voice.
is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged.
The people do admit you, and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation.
- Where?
At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.
I'll keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
[man] God save thee, noble consul!
[crowd chanting] Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, my masters!
My masters!
My masters, how now!
- Have you chose this man?
- [multiple voices] Aye!
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
[woman] Amen, sir.
To my poor, unworthy notice, he mocked us when he begged our voices.
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright.
O, no, no, no, it is his kind of speech.
- [scattered voices] Aye.
- He did not mock us.
He should have showed us his marks of merit,
- wounds received for his country.
- [several shouting] Yes!
- Why, I'm sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't!
No, no, no!
No!
No!
No one saw them!
Was this mockery?
[scattered voices] Yes!
When he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy.
- [scattered assent]
- Ever spake against your liberties.
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?
[scattered voices] Aye!
It is not confirmed.
It is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!
- [murmuring]
- And will deny him!
I'll have 500 voices of that sound.
- [multiple voices] Yes!
- l twice 500 and their friends!
[crowd] Yes!
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties!
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment, all revoke your ignorant election.
Enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you!
And, presently, when you have drawn the number, repair to the senate.
[low, indistinct chatter]
Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
He has, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
How?
What?
How often he had met you, sword to sword.
That of all things upon the earth, he hated your person most.
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, to oppose his hatred fully.
Come, Rome must know the value of her own.
[low, indistinct chatter]
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, the tongues of the common mouth.
- Pass no further.
- Ah?
What is that?
It will be dangerous to go on.
No further.
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.
- Are these your herd?
- [Menenius] Be calm, be calm.
The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them time-pleasers,
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.
You show too much of that for which the people stir.
If you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit.
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.
This was my speech, and I'll speak it again.
- Not now, not now.
- [Cominius] Not in this heat, sir.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves.
I say again, in soothing them, we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honored number who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
but that which we have given to beggars!
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you.
You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
It were well we let the people know it.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, by Jove, it would be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
Mark you his absolute "shall"?
Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, more worthier than their voices!
By Jove himself, it makes the consuls base, and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other.
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears, which will, in time, break open the locks of the senate, and bring in the crows to peck the eagles!
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure.
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do!
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul?
No!
Seize him!
Hence, old goat!
[crowd shouting]
On both sides more respect!
- [crowd booing] - [yelling]
Shh!
Shh!
Here's he that would take from you all your power!
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you,
Martius, whom late you have named for consul.
[angry shouting]
- What is the city but the people?
!
- [woman] True!
The people are the city!
The people are the city!
[clamoring]
We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,
Martius is worthy of present death!
[clamoring]
Death!
- Guards, seize him!
- No, I'll die here!
[clamoring continuing]
Get you to your house!
Be gone, away!
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!
[clamoring continues]
[sirens wailing nearby]
[clears throat]
[sighs]
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults.
Consul?
What consul?
- The Consul Coriolanus.
- [scoffs] He, consul?
It is decreed he dies tonight.
He's a disease that must be cut away.
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?
Killing our enemies?
[sighs]
The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country.
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more...
Consider this:
He's been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled in graceful language.
Give me leave. I'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form, in peace, to his utmost peril.
Noble tribunes, it is the humane way.
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.
In you bring not Martius, we'll proceed in our first way.
I'll bring him to you.
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
- yet will I still be thus to them!
- Martius... I muse my mother does not approve me further.
I talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?
Would you have me false to my nature?
Rather say I play the man I am.
Sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out.
- Let go.
- You might have been enough the man you are, with striving less to be so.
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.
Come, come, you've been too rough, something too rough.
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy, unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst and perish.
Pray, be counseled.
I have a heart as little apt as yours, but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage.
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must I do?
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then?
What then?
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods.
Must I then do it to them?
You are too absolute.
I've heard you say that honor and policy, like unsevered friends in war, do grow together.
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people, not by your own instruction, nor by the matter your heart prompts you, but with such words that are but roted in your tongue, though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor.
I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles... and you.
I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier.
And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves.
But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours.
I prithee, go and be ruled.
Sir, it is fit you make strong party, or defend yourself by calmness or by absence.
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.
I think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit.
He must.
He will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
Must I, with base tongue, give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I'll do it.
Away, my disposition, and possess me some harlot's spirit.
A beggar's tongue make motion through my lips.
I will not do it.
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth, and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
At thy choice, then.
To beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them.
Come all to ruin.
Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness, for l mock at death with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'st it from me, but owe thy pride thyself.
Pray, be content, Mother, I'm going.
Chide me no more.
Look, I am going.
I'll return consul, or never trust to what my tongue can do
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.
In this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power.
If he evade us there, enforce him with his hatred to the people.
Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll?
I have. lt's ready.
When the people hear me say
"lt shall be so in the right and strength of the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then, let them, if they hear me say "Fine," cry "Fine."
- lf "Death," cry "Death."
- We shall inform them.
- [man] God preserve thee.
- [light applause]
[indistinct chatter]
- [whistles] - [jeering] [loud jeer]
[shrill whistle]
The people are the city.
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.
Calmly, I beseech you.
[jeering subsides]
[clears throat]
- The honored gods...
- [microphone whines] [crowd laughing]
[clears throat]
The honored gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs ofjustice supplied with worthy men, plant love among us, throng our large temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with war.
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, if you submit you to the people's voices.
[scattered voices] Aye.
- l am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
The warlike service he has done, consider.
Think upon the wounds his body bears, which show like graves in the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers, scars to move laughter only.
Consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen,
- you find him like a soldier.
- [inaudible murmurs]
Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as I say, such as become a soldier.
What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice, I am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again?
We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office, and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical, for which you are a traitor to the people.
How... traitor?
- Traitor!
- Nay, temperately.
Your promise.
The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people.
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.
- [angry shouts] - [man] Traitor!
But since he hath served well for Rome...
What do you prate of service?
- l talk of that, that know it.
- You?
is this the promise you made your mother?
I'll know no further.
Let them pronounce death, exile, flaying, I would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word.
In the name of the people, and in the power of us, the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish him our city.
In the people's name, I say...
it shall be so.
- lt shall be so!
- He's banished. lt shall be so!
- [crowd shouting] - lt shall be so!
- [chanting] lt shall be so!
- [Cominius] Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...
- He's sentenced.
No more hearing.
- [Cominius] Let me speak.
- [overlapping] lt shall be so!
- l have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies' marks upon me...
There is no more to be said, but he is banished as enemy
- to the people and his country!
- [crowd] lt shall be so!
- lt shall be so!
- lt shall be so!
[chanting] lt shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- lt shall be so!
- lt shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
You common cry of curs!
Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air.
I... banish... you!
And here remain with your uncertainty.
Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts.
Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair.
Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows.
Despising, for you, the city thus I turn my back.
There is a world... elsewhere.
The people's enemy is gone!
- [applause] - [cheering]
- [laughter]
- Whoo!
[cheering] [children chattering nearby]
[dogs barking]
[indistinct chatter]
[Martius] Nay, Mother, where is your ancient courage?
- [Mother] You are too absolute.
- [birds cawing]
[Martius] Nay, Mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked.
I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.
The gods keep you.
This is a happier and more comely time.
- Yeah.
- Good day.
Good day.
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.
The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love.
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!
I would I had the power to say so to my husband.
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?
I tell thee what, fool, hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words?
[gasping] Blessed heavens...
More noble blows than ever thou wise words, and for Rome's good.
Yet go.
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.
I tell thee what.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!
- Bastards and all.
- Come!
Come, peace!
Well, well, we'll leave you.
Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses!
Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it.
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat.
I sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding.
- Come.
- Come, madam.
[hoofbeats approaching]
[indistinct chatter] [up-tempo music plays nearby]
Hey.
[men calling out] Aufidius!
Ah, general.
Yes.
Well, well.
[bell tolling]
[soldiers chattering, muffled]
- [door opens] - [man] Hey, hey!
- [grunting] - [weapons cocking]
Whence comes thou?
Thy name?
Speak, man.
What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, and harsh in sound to thine.
Say... what's thy name?
Thou has a grim appearance.
What's thy name?
- Know'st thou me yet?
- l know thee not.
Thy name?
My name is Caius Martius who hath done to thee, particularly, and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief.
Thereto witness may my surname Coriolanus.
Only that name remains.
The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest, and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome.
Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if I had feared death, of all men in the world I would have avoided thee.
But, in mere spite, to be full quit of those, my banishers, stand I before thee here.
I will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends.
But if thou dares not this, then I present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice, which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since I have ever followed thee with hate, and cannot live but to thy shame
unless it be to do thee service.
[breathing heavily]
O Martius...
Martius...
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
Let me twine mine arms about that body.
Know thou I loved the maid I married, never man sighed truer breath.
But that I see thee here, thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when I first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold.
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, thou hast beat me out 1 2 several times, and I have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.
Worthy Martius, had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that thou art thence banished, we would muster all from 1 2 to 70, and, pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, like a bold flood, overbear it.
[snipping] [buzzing]
Come, go in, and take our friendly senators by the hands.
You bless me, gods.
Therefore, most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission.
And set down as best thou art experienced, since thou knows thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of Rome, or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them, ere destroy.
[indistinct chatter]
- [man] ls this Menenius?
- [man 2] O, 'tis he, 'tis he.
O, he's grown most kind of late.
- Hail, sir.
- Hail to you both.
Your Coriolanus is not much missed, but with his friends.
All's well, and might have been much better
- if he could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?
I hear nothing.
His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.
Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war, but insolent, overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, self-loving... I think not so.
And Rome sits safe and still without him.
- Shh!
- Shh!
[fanfare plays]
There are reports the Volsces, with two several powers, are entered in the Roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war, destroy what lies before them.
- [patrons] Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius, who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns into the world again. [chuckles]
Come, what talk you of Martius?
It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be?
We have record that it can.
[man] The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House.
Some news is coming that turns their countenances.
Yes, the first report is seconded, and more more fearful is delivered.
Martius has joined with Aufidius.
He leads a power against Rome, and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius, associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories, and have already overborne their way, consumed with fire, and took what lay before them.
Martius has joined with the Volscians.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies.
[men cheering]
[laughter] [rock music playing]
- [clippers buzzing] - [men cheering]
Do they still fly to the Roman?
[man] I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, their talk at table, and their thanks at end.
And you are darkened in this action, sir.
He bears himself more proud, even to my person, than I thought he would when first I did embrace him.
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature.
[cheering]
[rock music continuing]
Whether it was pride, whether defect ofjudgment or whether nature, not to be other than one thing, made him feared, so hated, and so banished so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time.
One fire drives out one fire one nail, one nail.
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
When, Caius,
Rome is thine, thou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mine.
No, I'll not go.
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banished him.
A mile before his tent, fall down, and kneel the way into his mercy.
[door opens]
He would not seem to know me.
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops that we have bled together.
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to, forbad all names.
He was a kind of nothing.
Titleless.
Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome.
If you refuse your aid in this... lf you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman.
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius.
Well, and say "Martius return me, as Titus is returned, unhurt."
What then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome.
You know the very road into his kindness, and cannot lose your way.
I'll undertake it.
I think he'll hear me.
- He'll never hear him.
- No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold his eye, red, as it would burn Rome.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does.
O Martius, Martius.
Thou art preparing fire for us.
Look thee there's water to quench it.
I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee, I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome.
Away.
How?
Away?
Wife... mother... child...
I know not.
My affairs are servanted to others.
- Sir...
- Therefore be gone.
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.
This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings.
He's more than a creeping thing.
[engines starting]
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.
[car driving away]
[coughs]
[breathes heavily]
[helicopters whirring]
[wolf whistle]
My lord and husband.
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so.
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny, but do not say for that "Forgive our Romans."
O, a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge.
Ye gods, I prate, and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted.
Sink, my knee, in the earth.
Stand up, blest.
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
- l kneel before thee.
- What's this?
Your knees to me?
To your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior.
I helped to frame thee.
This is a poor epitome of yours, which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may'st prove to shame, invulnerable.
Your knee, sir.
Even he, your wife, this lady and myself,
- are suitors to you.
- l beseech you, peace.
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural.
Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons.
No more, no more.
You have said you will not grant us anything, for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already.
Yet we will ask, that if you fail in our request, the blame may hang upon your hardness.
Therefore hear us.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.
For we'll hear naught from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile.
Think with thyself.
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother, wife, and child
to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out.
And we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win.
For either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles through our streets, or else, triumphantly, tread on thy country's ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood.
For myself... son I purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine.
If I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world.
Aye, and mine, that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time.
You shall not tread on me.
I'll run away till I'm bigger but then I'll fight!
- l have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans, thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve, thou might'st condemn us as poisonous of your honor.
No.
Our suit is that you reconcile them.
So that the Volces may say "This mercy we have showed,"
the Romans, "This we've received,"
and each on either side give the all-hail to thee and cry,
"Be blest for making up this peace!"
Speak to me, son.
Why dost not speak?
Speak you, daughter.
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy.
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons.
There's no man in the world more bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks!
Thou hast never, in thy life, shown thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor.
Say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs.
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees!
Down!
This is the last.
An end.
So we will home to Rome, and die among our neighbors.
Nay.
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot tell what he would have yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship.
Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it.
Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother!
His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance.
Yet give us our dispatch I am hushed until our city be afire, and then I'll speak a little.
O Mother...
Mother...
What have you done?
Behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at.
[sobbing] O my mother!
Mother!
[sobs] O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome.
But for your son, believe it.
O believe it.
Most... dangerously you have prevailed with him.
If not most mortal to him.
But let it come.
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less?
Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.
But, good sir, what peace you'll make, advise me.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
We have all great cause to give great thanks.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain.
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction.
I raised him, and I pawned mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened, he watered his new plants with dews of flattery, seducing so my friends.
At the last, I seemed his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary.
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.
And, in the last, when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory...
There was it!
For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor of our great action.
Therefore shall he die...
- ...and I'll renew me in his fall.
- [man whistles]
- [vehicle approaching]
- Say no more.
I am returned your soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when I parted hence, but still subsisting under your great command.
We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans.
Tell the traitor, in the highest degree
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor?
How now?
Aye, traitor, Martius.
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.
Caius Martius.
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?
Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome.
I say "your city," for his wife and mother.
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk.
Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory.
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it.
"Boy"?
O slave.
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me!
"Boy"?
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there that, like an eagle in a dovecote, I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
Alone I did it.
"Boy."
Let him die for it.

Before we proceed any further, hear me speak,
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
[all] Resolved.
First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people,
- [all murmur] We know it.
- Let us kill him.
And we'll have corn at our own price,
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good,
The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, our suffering, is a gain to them,
Aye,
Let us revenge this with our sticks, ere we become rakes,
No more talking on it, Come!
Soft, soft, who comes here?
...friends, mine honest neighbors...
Worthy Senator Menenius, one that has always loved the people,
I tell you, friends, most charitable care have the patricians of you.
For your wants, your suffering in this dearth, you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the Roman state.
Suffer us to fam ish, and their storehouses crammed with grain,
Bread!
- [man] Bread!
- [all murmur] Bread.
[all] Bread!
[crowd chanting] Bread, bread, bread...!
[clamoring]
Bread, bread, bread,
- [horn honking] - [people screaming] [grunting]
Stop!
- Stop!
Stop!
- [shouting ceases]
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word,
He that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring,
What would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war?
The one affrights you, the other makes you proud,
He that trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares, where foxes, geese,
Who deserves greatness, deserves your hate,
Hang ye, Trust ye?
With every minute you do change your mind, and call him noble that was now your hate, him vile that was your garland,
What's the matter, that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?
Go,
Get you home,
,you fragments,
[batons rhythmically pounding shields]
- [man] Go back!
- [man 2] Forward!
[shouts]
- [rhythmic pounding continuing over TV] - [man] Go back!

[inaudible]
- Please,
- Know you me yet?
I know you well,
Your name, I think, is Aufidius,
It is so.
- I'm a Roman,
- What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections,
- The people against the senators,
- Hath been?
Is it ended then?
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again,
[Aufidius on TV] You have ended my business.
The news is the Volsces are in arms,
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that'll put you to it,
I sin in envying his nobility,
And were I anything but what I am, I would wish me only he,
You have fought together?
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt,
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face,
Lead you on,
So your opinion is, Aufidius, that they of Rome are entered in our counsels
- and know how we proceed, - [Aufidius] Is it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone since I heard thence,
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim,
And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads on this preparation,
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more,
If ever again I meet him beard to beard, he's mine or I am his, [bombs whistling]
[rapid gunfire]
[rapid gunfire continues] [grunts]
[grunts]
[man] Mark me!
[screams]
[Martius] They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge!
Go!
[grunts] [bullets ricochet]
Come on,
Away!
[rapid gunfire]
[grunting]
[gunshot] [can clanking on ground]
[TV plays indistinctly]
[man] The citizens of Corioles have issued and given to Titus and to Martius battle.
We've heard their drums.
I saw our forces to their trenches
- driven, and then I came away...
- [TV clicks off]
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort,
If my son were my husband,
I would more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love,
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb,
I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame,
To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak,
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Then,
,his good report should have been my son,
Hear me,
Had I a dozen sons,
I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action,
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius,
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck,
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
I see him stamp thus, cry thus:
"Come on, you cowards!
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome."
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men!
Pluto and hell, Look to it, Come on!
Mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe and make my wars on you,
His bloody brow then wiping, forth he goes,
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood,
Away, you fool,
It more becomes a man than gold his trophy,
Senator Menenius is come to visit you,
T ell him we are fit to bid him welcome,
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself,
- Indeed, you shall not,
- My ladies both, good day to you,
How do you both?
And how does your little son?
I thank you, sir, Well, good,
He'd rather play with swords and hear a drum
- than look upon his schoolmaster,
- On my word, the father's son, [both chuckling]
Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon,
No, good sir, I will not out of doors,
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall,
Indeed, no, by your patience,
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars,
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably,
- I cannot go hither,
- O you would be another Penelope,
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths, [chuckling]
No, good sir, Pardon me, Indeed, I will not forth,
Go with me, and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband,
No, good sir, there can be none yet,
- There came news from him last night, - [woman] Indeed?
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Carioles,
They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars,
This is true, on mine honor, So, I pray, go out with us,
Give me excuse, good sir, I will obey you in everything hereafter,
Let her alone, As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth,
[rapid gunfire]
- [panting] - [rapid gunfire]
[panting]
[grunts]
[breathes heavily]
[panting]
[yelling]
[gun fires] [gun clicking]
[both grunting]
[yells]
[yells]
- [Titus] What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless,
He is himself alone, to answer all the city, [whispers] Thou art lost, Martius.
[rapid gunfire in distance]
Who's yonder, that does appear as he were flayed?
O gods!
He has the stamp of Martius,
Come I too late?
!
Come I too late?
!
Aye, if you come not in the blood of others, but mantled in your own,
Let me hold you in arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done, [explosion]
There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius, piercing our Romans,
Worthy sir, thou bleeds,
Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight,
Sir, praise me not, My work hath not yet warmed me,
The blood I drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me,
T o Aufidius thus I will appear and fight,
If any such be here, as it were sin to doubt, that love this painting wherein you see me smeared, if any fear lesser his person than an ill report, if any think brave death outweighs bad life,
and that his country is dearer than himself,
let him alone, or so many so minded wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow Martius!
O, me alone,
Make you a sword of me!
[all yelling] [rapid gunfire]
Oi!
[Martius] Advance, brave Titus!
[grunts] [rapid gunfire continues]
Away!
Come!
Come!
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee,
We hate alike,
[both grunting]
[grunts] [grunts, yells]
[both yelling]
[yelling]
[groaning]
[explosion]
[bomb whistling] [explosion] [debris clattering]
[wind whistling]
[panting]
Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee,
So often has thou beat me, and would do so, I fear, should we encounter as often as we eat,
For where I thought to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way,
Or wrath or craft may get him,
He's the devil,
[Aufidius] Bolder, though not so subtle,
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius,
Where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, will I wash my fierce hand in his heart,
[woman] Honorable Menenius!
My boy, Martius, approaches,
For the love of Juno, let's go,
Is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded,
O yes, he is wounded, I thank the gods for it,
O, so do I too, if it be not too much,
Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him,
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius said they fought together, but Aufidius got off,
In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him,
Gods grant them true,
- True,
- I'll be sworn they're true,
Where is he wounded?
In the shoulder and in the left arm,
There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place,
He had, before this last expedition,
- 25 wounds upon him,
- Now it's 27,
Every gash was an enemy's grave,
[quietly] Before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears,
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm doth lie,
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die, [cameras clicking]
[man] Be it known, as to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius wears this war's garland,
And, from this time, for what he did before Corioles, call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host:
"Caius Martius Coriolanus," Bear the addition nobly ever, [all] Caius Martius Coriolanus!
[applause]
No more of this, It does offend my heart, Pray now, no more,
Look, sir, your mother,
O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods for my prosperity,
Nay, my good soldier, up,
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honor newly named, What is it?
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife,
My gracious silence, hail,
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home, that weeps to see me triumph?
Aye, my dear, such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, and mothers that lack sons,
- [Menenius] Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh, I'm light and heavy,
- [laughter]
- I know not where to turn.
O, you are welcome home, You are welcome all,
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!
- [applause]
- Welcome, Coriolanus!
Welcome!
[man] 'Tis thought that Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and the blind to hear him speak.
Matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed.
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.
And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
[man] Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius?
[man 2] He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people,
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts,
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight,
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius,
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends,
You blame Martius for being proud?
- We do it not alone, sir,
- I know you can do very little alone,
You talk of pride,
O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves,
- O that you could,
- What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy politicians, alias fools, as any in Rome,
Menenius, you are known well enough too,
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it,
One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning,
What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath,
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough,
You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything,
- You're ambitious, - [chuckles] [sighs]
Good e'en to your worships,
More of your conversation would infect my brain,
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say, but 'tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it,
That's a brave fellow, but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people,
There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them,
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition,
And, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see it,
But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him,
Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love,
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well, And would be content to give him good report for it, but that he pays himself with being proud,
Nay, but speak not maliciously, He hath deserve worthily of his country, [clattering] [paper tearing]
[Martius grunts softly] [sighs]
The good senators must be visited, from whom I have received not only greetings, but with them change of honors,
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy,
Only there's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee,
Good mother, I'd rather be their servant in my way, than sway with them in theirs, [door opens]
Coriolanus will carry it,
He's a worthy man, He will carry it, [bell rings]
- All tongues speak of him,
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul,
Then our office may, during his power, go asleep,
He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end, but will lose those he hath won,
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear in the marketplace, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths,
It was his word, It shall be to him then, a sure destruction,
So it must fall out to him, or our authorities, for an end,
We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them,
Kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze shall darken him forever,
[low, indistinct chatter]
[Menenius] It remains, as the main point of this our after-meeting, to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country,
Therefore, please you, most grave and reverend elders, to desire the present consul, and last general in our well-found successes, to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus,
- [man] Speak, good Cominius, - [men] Aye,
- Nay, keep your place,
- Sit, Coriolanus,
Never shame to hear what you have nobly done,
Your honor's pardon, I'd rather have my wounds to heal again
- than hear say how I got them,
- Pray you, sit down,
I'd rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered,
[murmuring]
- [man] Speak, good Cominius, - [man 2] Aye, proceed,
The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly,
It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver,
If it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised, [voice receding] At 16 years, he fought beyond the mark of others,
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man in the field, [voice echoing] And in the brunt of 17 battles since, he lurched all swords of the garland,
For this last, before and in Corioles,
let me say I cannot speak him home.
He stopped the fliers, and by his rare example, made coward turn terror into sport, from face to foot.
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
[voice echoi ng] Alone, he entered the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny,
- [low rumbling]
- Aidless came off, and with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioles like a planet, [voice receding] Until we called both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting,
Our spoils he kicked at, and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world,
He covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it, [applause]
[indistinct salutations]
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul, [scattered murmurs] Aye.
I do owe them still my life and services,
It then remains that you do speak to the people,
I do beseech you, let me overleap that custom, for I cannot entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage,
Please you that I may pass this doing,
Sir!
The people must have their voices,
Pray you, go fit you to the custom,
It is a part that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken
- from the people,
- Mark you that?
T o brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, as if I had received them for the hire of their breath only,
To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor!
[applause]
- [laughter] - [applause continues over TV]
[Menenius] The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul!
[Martius] I do owe them still my life and services.
[Menenius] It then remains that you do speak to the people.
[Martius] Let me overleap that custom.
[man] The people must have their voices.
Have you not known the worthiest men have done it?
Custom calls me to it,
What custom wills, in all things should we do it,
What must I say?
"Look, sir, my wounds, I got them in my country's service,"
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that,
You must desire them to think upon you,
Think upon me?
Hang 'em, I would they would forget me, [siren chirping]
Pray you, speak to them,
I pray you, in wholesome manner,
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean,
[helicopter passing overhead]
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
We do, sir, T ell us what hath brought you to it,
- Mine own desert, - [woman] Your own desert?
- Aye, but not mine own desire,
- How not your own desire?
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging,
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you,
Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly,
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it,
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private,
Your good voice, sir, What say you?
- You shall have it, worthy sir,
- A match, sir,
There's in all two worthy voices begged, Adieu,
But this is something odd,
[Martius] Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voice that I may be consul,
You've deserved nobly of your country, and you've not deserved nobly, [chuckles]
Your enigma?
You've been a scourge to her enemies, you've been a rod to her friends,
You've not indeed loved the common people,
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love,
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily,
I'll make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further,
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily,
Your voices!
For your voices I have fought,
Watched for your voices,
For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd,
Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of!
For your voices have done many things, some less, some more,
Your voices!
Indeed, I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!
- [man] Aye.
- [man 2] Aye.
Therefore, let him be consul!
- Amen!
- Amen!
[others join in] Amen!
Amen!
[chanting]
- Amen!
- [chanting continues]
- Worthy voices!
- [chanting continues]
Worthy voices, worthy voices, [chanting, cheering]
[Menenius] You have stood your limitation,
And the tribunes now endow you with the people's voice,
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged,
The people do admit you, and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation,
- Where?
At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus,
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir,
I'll keep you company, Will you along?
We stay here for the people, [man] God save thee, noble consul!
[crowd chanting] Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, my masters!
My masters!
My masters, how now!
- Have you chose this man?
- [multiple voices] Aye!
He has our voices, sir,
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves, [woman] Amen, sir.
T o my poor, unworthy notice, he mocked us when he begged our voices,
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright,
O, no, no, no, it is his kind of speech,
- [scattered voices] Aye,
- He did not mock us,
He should have showed us his marks of merit,
- wounds received for his country, - [several shouting] Yes!
- Why, I'm sure, so he did,
- No, he didn't!
No, no, no!
No!
No!
No one saw them!
Was this mockery?
[scattered voices] Yes!
When he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy,
- [scattered assent]
- Ever spake against your liberties,
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?
[scattered voices] Aye!
It is not confirmed,
It is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!
- [murmuring]
- And will deny him!
I'll have 500 voices of that sound,
- [multiple voices] Yes!
- I twice 500 and their friends!
[crowd] Yes!
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties!
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment, all revoke your ignorant election,
Enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you!
And, presently, when you have drawn the number, repair to the senate, [low, indistinct chatter]
Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
He has, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
How?
What?
How often he had met you, sword to sword.
That of all things upon the earth, he hated your person most.
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, to oppose his hatred fully,
Come, Rome must know the value of her own, [low, indistinct chatter]
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, the tongues of the common mouth,
- Pass no further,
- Ah?
What is that?
It will be dangerous to go on, No further,
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
- Cominius, no,
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give away,
- The people are incensed against him,
- Are these your herd?
- [Menenius] Be calm, be calm,
The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them time-pleasers,
- flatterers, foes to nobleness,
- Why, this was known before,
You show too much of that for which the people stir,
If you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit,
- Let's be calm,
- The people are abused, set on,
This was my speech, and I'll speak it again,
- Not now, not now, - [Cominius] Not in this heat, sir,
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons,
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves,
I say again, in soothing them, we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honored number who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
but that which we have given to beggars!
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you,
You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity,
It were well we let the people know it,
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, by Jove, it would be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further,
Shall remain, Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
Mark you his absolute "shall"?
Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, more worthier than their voices!
By Jove himself, it makes the consuls base, and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other,
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears, which will, in time, break open the locks of the senate, and bring in the crows to peck the eagles!
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure,
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do!
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul?
No!
Seize him!
Hence, old goat!
[crowd shouting]
On both sides more respect!
- [crowd booing] - [yelling]
Shh!
Shh!
Here's he that would take from you all your power!
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you,
Martius, whom late you have named for consul, [angry shouting]
- What is the city but the people?
!
- [woman] True!
The people are the city!
The people are the city!
[clamoring]
We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,
Martius is worthy of present death!
[clamoring]
Death!
- Guards, seize him!
- No, I'll die here!
[clamoring continuing]
Get you to your house!
Be gone, away!
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!
[clamoring continues]
[sirens wailing nearby]
[clears throat]
[sighs]
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults,
Consul?
What consul?
- The Consul Coriolanus, - [scoffs] He, consul?
It is decreed he dies tonight,
He's a disease that must be cut away,
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease,
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy,
What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?
Killing our enemies?
[sighs]
The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country,
- This is clean kam,
- We'll hear no more,
Consider this:
He's been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled in graceful language,
Give me leave, I'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form, in peace, to his utmost peril,
Noble tribunes, it is the humane way,
- Menenius,
- Be you then as the people's officer,
In you bring not Martius, we'll proceed in our first way,
I'll bring him to you,
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
- yet will I still be thus to them!
- Martius,
I muse my mother does not approve me further,
I talk of you, Why would you wish me milder?
Would you have me false to my nature?
Rather say I play the man I am,
Sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out,
- Let go,
- You might have been enough the man you are, with striving less to be so,
- Let them hang,
- Aye, and burn, too,
Come, come, you've been too rough, something too rough,
You must return and mend it,
There's no remedy, unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst and perish,
Pray, be counseled,
I have a heart as little apt as yours, but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage,
- Well said, noble woman,
- And what must I do?
- Return to the tribunes,
- What then?
What then?
- Repent what you have spoke,
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods,
Must I then do it to them?
You are too absolute,
I've heard you say that honor and policy,
like unsevered friends in war, do grow together,
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people, not by your own instruction, nor by the matter your heart prompts you, but with such words that are but roted in your tongue, though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth,
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor,
I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles, and you,
I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier,
And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves,
But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs,
This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours,
I prithee, go and be ruled,
Sir, it is fit you make strong party, or defend yourself by calmness or by absence,
- All's in anger,
- Only fair speech,
I think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit,
He must,
He will,
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it,
Must I, with base tongue, give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I'll do it,
Away, my disposition, and possess me some harlot's spirit,
A beggar's tongue make motion through my lips,
I will not do it.
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth, and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness,
At thy choice, then,
T o beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them,
Come all to ruin,
Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death with as big heart as thou, Do as you like,
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'st it from me, but owe thy pride thyself,
Pray, be content, Mother, I'm going,
Chide me no more, Look, I am going,
I'll return consul, or never trust to what my tongue can do
- in the way of flattery further,
- Do your will,
In this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power,
If he evade us there, enforce him with his hatred to the people,
Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll?
I have, It's ready,
When the people hear me say
"It shall be so in the right and strength of the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then, let them, if they hear me say "Fine," cry "Fine,"
- If "Death," cry "Death,"
- We shall inform them,
- [man] God preserve thee, - [light applause]
[indistinct chatter]
- [whistles] - [jeering] [loud jeer]
[shrill whistle]
The people are the city,
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue,
Calmly, I beseech you, [jeering subsides]
[clears throat]
- The honored gods, - [microphone whines] [crowd laughing]
[clears throat]
The honored gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men, plant love among us, throng our large temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with war,
- Amen, amen,
- A noble wish,
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, if you submit you to the people's voices, [scattered voices] Aye.
- I am content,
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content,
The warlike service he has done, consider,
Think upon the wounds his body bears, which show like graves in the holy churchyard,
Scratches with briers, scars to move laughter only,
Consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen,
- you find him like a soldier, - [inaudible murmurs]
Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as I say, such as become a soldier,
What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again?
We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office, and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical, for which you are a traitor to the people,
How, traitor?
- T raitor!
- Nay, temperately, Your promise,
The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people,
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes,
- [angry shouts] - [man] Traitor!
But since he hath served well for Rome,
What do you prate of service?
- I talk of that, that know it,
- You?
Is this the promise you made your mother?
I'll know no further, Let them pronounce death, exile, flaying,
I would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word,
In the name of the people, and in the power of us, the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish him our city,
In the people's name, I say, it shall be so,
- It shall be so!
- He's banished, It shall be so!
- [crowd shouting]
- It shall be so!
- [chanting] It shall be so!
- [Cominius] Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,
- He's sentenced, No more hearing, - [Cominius] Let me speak,
- [overlapping] It shall be so!
- I have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies' marks upon me,
There is no more to be said, but he is banished as enemy
- to the people and his country!
- [crowd] It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
[chanting] It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
You common cry of curs!
Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air,
I, banish, you!
And here remain with your uncertainty,
Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts,
Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair,
Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows,
Despising, for you, the city,
,thus,
, I turn my back,
There is a world, elsewhere,
The people's enemy is gone!
- [applause] - [cheering]
- [laughter]
- Whoo!
[cheering] [children chattering nearby]
[dogs barking]
[indistinct chatter]
[Martius] Nay, Mother, where is your ancient courage?
- [Mother] You are too absolute.
- [birds cawing]
[Martius] Nay, Mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked.
I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both,
- Good day to you all,
The gods keep you,
This is a happier and more comely time,
- Yeah,
- Good day, Good day,
- O, here comes his mother,
- Let's not meet her,
- They say she's mad,
- O, you're well met,
The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love,
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!
I would I had the power to say so to my husband,
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?
I tell thee what, fool, hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words?
[gasping] Blessed heavens...
More noble blows than ever thou wise words, and for Rome's good, Yet go,
Nay, thou shalt stay, too,
I tell thee what.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
- his good sword in his hand,
- What then?
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!
- Bastards and all,
- Come!
Come, peace!
Well, well, we'll leave you,
Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses!
Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it,
You have told them home, And, by my troth, you have cause,
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat,
I sup upon myself,
,and so shall starve with feeding,
- Come,
- Come, madam,
[hoofbeats approaching]
[indistinct chatter] [up-tempo music plays nearby]
Hey,
[men calling out] Aufidius!
Ah, general,
Yes,
Well, well,
[bell tolling]
[soldiers chattering, muffled]
- [door opens] - [man] Hey, hey!
- [grunting] - [weapons cocking]
Whence comes thou?
Thy name?
Speak, man, What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, and harsh in sound to thine,
Say, what's thy name?
Thou has a grim appearance,
What's thy name?
- Know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not,
Thy name?
My name is Caius Martius,
,who hath done to thee, particularly, and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief,
Thereto witness may my surname,
,Coriolanus,
Only that name remains,
The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest, and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome,
Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if I had feared death, of all men in the world
I would have avoided thee.
But, in mere spite, to be full quit of those, my banishers, stand I before thee here,
I will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends,
But if thou dares not this, then I present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice, which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since I have ever followed thee with hate, and cannot live but to thy shame
unless it be to do thee service,
[breathing heavily]
O Martius,
Martius...
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy,
Let me twine mine arms about that body,
Know thou... , I loved the maid I married, never man sighed truer breath,
But that I see thee here, thou noble thing,
,more dances my rapt heart than when I first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold,
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, thou hast beat me out 12 several times, and I have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me,
Worthy Martius, had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that thou art thence banished, we would muster all from 12 to 70, and, pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
like a bold flood, overbear it,
[snipping] [buzzing]
Come, go in, and take our friendly senators by the hands,
You bless me, gods,
Therefore, most absolute sir,
,if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission,
And set down as best thou art experienced, since thou knows thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of Rome, or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them, ere destroy,
[indistinct chatter]
- [man] Is this Menenius?
- [man 2] O, 'tis he, 'tis he,
O, he's grown most kind of late,
- Hail, sir,
- Hail to you both,
Your Coriolanus is not much missed, but with his friends,
All's well, and might have been much better
- if he could have temporized,
- Where is he, hear you?
I hear nothing,
His mother and his wife hear nothing from him,
Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war, but insolent, overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, self-loving,
I think not so.
And Rome sits safe and still without him,
- Shh!
- Shh!
[fanfare plays]
There are reports the Volsces, with two several powers, are entered in the Roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war, destroy what lies before them.
- [patrons] Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius, who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns into the world again, [chuckles]
Come, what talk you of Martius?
It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us,
Cannot be?
We have record that it can, [man] The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House.
Some news is coming that turns their countenances.
Yes, the first report is seconded, and more more fearful is delivered.
Martius has joined with Aufidius.
He leads a power against Rome, and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius, associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories, and have already overborne their way, consumed with fire, and took what lay before them.
Martius has joined with the Volscians.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies.
[men cheering]
[laughter] [rock music playing]
- [clippers buzzing] - [men cheering]
Do they still fly to the Roman?
[man] I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, their talk at table, and their thanks at end,
And you are darkened in this action, sir,
He bears himself more proud, even to my person, than I thought he would when first I did embrace him,
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature,
[cheering]
[rock music continuing]
Whether it was pride, whether defect of judgment,
,or whether nature, not to be other than one thing, made him feared, so hated, and so banished,
,so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time,
One fire drives out one fire,
,one nail, one nail,
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail,
When, Caius,
Rome is thine, thou art poorest of all,
,then shortly art thou mine,
No, I'll not go,
- Good Menenius,
- Go, you that banished him,
A mile before his tent, fall down, and kneel the way into his mercy, [door opens]
He would not seem to know me,
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops that we have bled together,
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to, forbad all names,
He was,
,a kind of nothing,
Titleless,
Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome,
If you refuse your aid in this,
If you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman,
- No, I'll not meddle,
- Pray you, go to him,
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius,
Well, and say "Martius return me, as Titus is returned, unhurt,"
What then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome,
You know the very road into his kindness, and cannot lose your way,
I'll undertake it.
I think he'll hear me.
- He'll never hear him,
- No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold,
,his eye, red, as it would burn Rome,
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity,
,and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does,
O Martius, Martius,
Thou art preparing fire for us,
Look thee... ,there's water to quench it,
I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee,
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs,
,and conjure thee to pardon Rome,
Away,
How?
Away?
Wife, mother, child, I know not,
My affairs are servanted to others,
- Sir,
- Therefore be gone,
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak,
This Martius is grown from man to dragon,
He has wings,
He's more than a creeping thing,
[engines starting]
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger,
[car driving away]
[coughs]
[breathes heavily]
[helicopters whirring]
[wolf whistle]
My lord and husband,
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome,
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so,
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny, but do not say for that "Forgive our Romans,"
O, a kiss,
,long as my exile,
,sweet as my revenge,
Ye gods, I prate, and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted,
Sink, my knee, in the earth,
Stand up, blest,
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
- I kneel before thee,
- What's this?
Your knees to me?
T o your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior, I helped to frame thee,
This is a poor epitome of yours, which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself,
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may'st prove to shame, invulnerable,
Your knee, sir,
Even he, your wife, this lady and myself,
- are suitors to you,
- I beseech you, peace,
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics,
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural,
Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons,
No more, no more,
You have said you will not grant us anything, for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already,
Yet we will ask, that if you fail in our request, the blame may hang upon your hardness, Therefore hear us,
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark,
For we'll hear naught from Rome in private,
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile,
Think with thyself,
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,
,constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,
,making the mother, wife, and child to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out,
And we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win,
For either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles through our streets, or else, triumphantly, tread on thy country's ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood,
For myself, son,
,I purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine,
If I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mother's womb,
,that brought thee to this world,
Aye, and mine, that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time,
You shall not tread on me,
I'll run away till I'm bigger,
,but then I'll fight!
- I have sat too long,
- Nay, go not from us thus,
If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans, thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve, thou might'st condemn us as poisonous of your honor,
No, Our suit is that you reconcile them,
So that the Volces may say "This mercy we have showed,"
the Romans, "This we've received,"
and each on either side give the all-hail to thee and cry,
"Be blest for making up this peace!"
Speak to me, son,
Why dost not speak?
Speak you, daughter,
He cares not for your weeping,
Speak thou, boy,
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons,
There's no man in the world more bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks!
Thou hast never, in thy life, shown thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor,
Say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so,
,thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs,
Down, ladies, Let us shame him with our knees!
Down!
This is the last,
An end,
So we will home to Rome, and die among our neighbors,
Nay,
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot tell what he would have,
,yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it,
Come, let us go,
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother!
His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance,
Yet give us our dispatch I am hushed until our city be afire, and then I'll speak a little,
O Mother,
Mother...
What have you done?
Behold...
,the heavens do ope,
,the gods look down,
,and this unnatural scene they laugh at,
[sobbing] O my mother!
Mother!
[sobs] O!
You have won,
,a happy victory to Rome,
But for your son, believe it,
O believe it,
Most, dangerously you have prevailed with him,
If not most mortal to him,
But let it come.
Aufidius,
,though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace,
Now, good Aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less?
Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were, And, sir, it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion,
But, good sir, what peace you'll make, advise me,
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
No, not the expulsion of the T arquins,
We have all great cause to give great thanks,
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome,
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain,
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all,
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction,
I raised him, and I pawned mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened, he watered his new plants with dews of flattery, seducing so my friends,
At the last, I seemed his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary,
So he did, my lord, The army marveled at it,
And, in the last, when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory,
There was it!
For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him,
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor of our great action,
Therefore shall he die,
-,and I'll renew me in his fall, - [man whistles]
- [vehicle approaching]
- Say no more,
I am returned your soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when I parted hence, but still subsisting under your great command,
We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans,
T ell the traitor, in the highest degree
- he hath abused your powers,
- Traitor?
How now?
Aye, traitor, Martius,
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius,
Caius Martius,
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?
Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome,
I say "your city," for his wife and mother,
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk,
Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory,
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears,
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it,
"Boy"?
O slave,
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me!
"Boy"?
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there that, like an eagle in a dovecote,
I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles,
Alone I did it,
"Boy,"
Let him die for it,
[shouting] [screams]
[yells]
- [moans softly] - [wind whistling softly]
[no audio]
[knife rips out loudly]
[# Lisa Zane: "Sta Pervolia"]
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
Resolved.
First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.
- We know it.
- Let us kill him.
And we'll have corn at our own price.
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, our suffering, is a gain to them.
Aye...
Let us revenge this with our sticks, ere we become rakes.
No more talking on it.
Come!
Soft, soft, who comes here?
...friends, mine honest neighbors...
Worthy Senator Menenius, one that has always loved the people.
I tell you, friends, most charitable care have the patricians of you.
For your wants, your suffering in this dearth, you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the Roman state.
Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain.
Bread!
- Bread!
- Bread.
Bread!
Bread, bread, bread...!
Bread, bread, bread...
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word.
He that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring.
What would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war?
The one affrights you, the other makes you proud.
He that trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares, where foxes, geese.
Who deserves greatness, deserves your hate.
Hang ye.
Trust ye?
With every minute you do change your mind, and call him noble that was now your hate, him vile that was your garland.
What's the matter, that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?
Go.
Get you home... you fragments.
- Go back!
- Forward!
Go back!
- Please...
- Know you me yet?
I know you well.
Your name, I think, is Aufidius.
It is so.
- I'm a Roman.
- What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections.
- The people against the senators.
- Hath been?
Is it ended then?
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again.
You have ended my business.
The news is the Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that'll put you to it.
I sin in envying his nobility.
And were I anything but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together?
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt.
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
Lead you on.
So your opinion is, Aufidius, that they of Rome are entered in our counsels
- and know how we proceed.
- Is it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone since I heard thence.
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim.
And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads on this preparation.
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more.
If ever again I meet him beard to beard, he's mine or I am his.
Mark me!
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts.
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge!
Go!
Come on.
Away!
The citizens of Corioles have issued and given to Titus and to Martius battle.
We've heard their drums.
I saw our forces to their trenches driven, and then I came away...
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
If my son were my husband,
I would more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb,
I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame.
To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Then his good report should have been my son.
Hear me.
Had I a dozen sons,
I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius.
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum.
I see him stamp thus, cry thus:
"Come on, you cowards!
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome".
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men!
Pluto and hell.
Look to it.
Come on!
Mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe and make my wars on you.
His bloody brow then wiping, forth he goes.
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.
Away, you fool.
It more becomes a man than gold his trophy.
Senator Menenius is come to visit you.
Tell him we are fit to bid him welcome.
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- Indeed, you shall not.
- My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both?
And how does your little son?
I thank you, sir.
Well, good.
He'd rather play with swords and hear a drum
- than look upon his schoolmaster.
- On my word, the father's son.
Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.
No, good sir, I will not out of doors.
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.
Indeed, no, by your patience.
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.
- I cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
No, good sir.
Pardon me.
Indeed, I will not forth.
Go with me, and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
No, good sir, there can be none yet.
- There came news from him last night.
- Indeed?
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Carioles.
They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars.
This is true, on mine honor.
So, I pray, go out with us.
Give me excuse, good sir.
I will obey you in everything hereafter.
Let her alone.
As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.
- What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless.
He is himself alone, to answer all the city.
Thou art lost, Martius.
Who's yonder, that does appear as he were flayed?
O gods!
He has the stamp of Martius.
Come I too late?
!
Come I too late?
!
Aye, if you come not in the blood of others, but mantled in your own.
Let me hold you in arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done.
There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight.
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.
The blood I drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me.
To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight.
If any such be here, as it were sin to doubt, that love this painting wherein you see me smeared, if any fear lesser his person than an ill report, if any think brave death outweighs bad life,
and that his country is dearer than himself, let him alone, or so many so minded wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow Martius!
O... me alone.
Make you a sword of me!
Oi!
Advance, brave Titus!
Away!
Come!
Come!
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee.
We hate alike.
Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee.
So often has thou beat me, and would do so, I fear, should we encounter as often as we eat.
For where I thought to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way.
Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.
Bolder, though not so subtle.
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius.
Where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.
Honorable Menenius!
My boy, Martius, approaches.
For the love of Juno, let's go.
Is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.
O yes, he is wounded.
I thank the gods for it.
O, so do I too, if it be not too much.
Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius said they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
Gods grant them true.
- True.
- I'll be sworn they're true.
Where is he wounded?
In the shoulder and in the left arm.
There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
He had, before this last expedition,
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.
Every gash was an enemy's grave.
Before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm doth lie.
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
Be it known, as to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius wears this war's garland.
And, from this time, for what he did before Corioles, call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host:
"Caius Martius Coriolanus".
Bear the addition nobly ever.
Caius Martius Coriolanus!
No more of this.
It does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother.
O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods for my prosperity.
Nay, my good soldier, up.
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honor newly named...
What is it?
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife...
My gracious silence, hail.
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home, that weeps to see me triumph?
Aye, my dear, such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, and mothers that lack sons.
- Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh.
I'm light and heavy.
I know not where to turn.
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!
Welcome, Coriolanus!
Welcome!
'Tis thought that Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and the blind to hear him speak.
Matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed.
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.
And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius?
He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people...
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
You blame Martius for being proud?
- We do it not alone, sir.
- I know you can do very little alone.
You talk of pride.
O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves.
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy politicians, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it.
One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning.
What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.
You're ambitious.
Good e'en to your worships.
More of your conversation would infect my brain.
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say, but 'tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow, but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people.
There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them.
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition.
And, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see it.
But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him.
Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well.
And would be content to give him good report for it, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.
The good senators must be visited, from whom I have received not only greetings, but with them change of honors.
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy.
Only there's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee.
Good mother, I'd rather be their servant in my way, than sway with them in theirs.
Coriolanus will carry it.
He's a worthy man.
He will carry it.
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, during his power, go asleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end, but will lose those he hath won.
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear in the marketplace, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word.
It shall be to him then, a sure destruction.
So it must fall out to him, or our authorities, for an end.
We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them.
Kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze shall darken him forever.
It remains, as the main point of this our after-meeting, to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country.
Therefore, please you, most grave and reverend elders, to desire the present consul, and last general in our well-found successes, to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.
- Speak, good Cominius.
- Aye.
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.
Never shame to hear what you have nobly done.
Your honor's pardon.
I'd rather have my wounds to heal again
- than hear say how I got them.
- Pray you, sit down.
I'd rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered.
- Speak, good Cominius.
- Aye, proceed.
The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly.
It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver.
If it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
At 16 years, he fought beyond the mark of others.
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man in the field.
And in the brunt of 17 battles since, he lurched all swords of the garland.
For this last, before and in Corioles, let me say I cannot speak him home.
He stopped the fliers, and by his rare example, made coward turn terror into sport, from face to foot.
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
Alone, he entered the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny.
Aidless came off, and with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioles like a planet.
Until we called both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting.
Our spoils he kicked at, and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world.
He covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
Aye.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you, let me overleap that custom, for I cannot entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage.
Please you that I may pass this doing.
Sir!
The people must have their voices.
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.
It is a part that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken
- from the people.
- Mark you that?
To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, as if I had received them for the hire of their breath only.
To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor!
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul!
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
Let me overleap that custom.
The people must have their voices.
Have you not known the worthiest men have done it?
Custom calls me to it.
What custom wills, in all things should we do it.
What must I say?
"Look, sir, my wounds.
I got them in my country's service".
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that.
You must desire them to think upon you.
Think upon me?
Hang 'em.
I would they would forget me.
Pray you, speak to them.
I pray you, in wholesome manner.
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean.
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
We do, sir.
Tell us what hath brought you to it.
- Mine own desert.
- Your own desert?
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it.
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private.
Your good voice, sir.
What say you?
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged.
Adieu.
But this is something odd.
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voice that I may be consul.
You've deserved nobly of your country, and you've not deserved nobly.
Your enigma?
You've been a scourge to her enemies, you've been a rod to her friends.
You've not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.
I'll make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.
Your voices!
For your voices I have fought.
Watched for your voices.
For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd.
Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of!
For your voices have done many things, some less, some more.
Your voices!
Indeed, I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!
- Aye.
- Aye.
Therefore, let him be consul!
- Amen!
- Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Worthy voices!
Worthy voices, worthy voices.
You have stood your limitation.
And the tribunes now endow you with the people's voice.
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged.
The people do admit you, and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation.
- Where?
At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.
I'll keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
God save thee, noble consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, my masters!
My masters!
My masters, how now!
- Have you chose this man?
- Aye!
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Amen, sir.
To my poor, unworthy notice, he mocked us when he begged our voices.
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright.
O, no, no, no, it is his kind of speech.
- Aye.
- He did not mock us.
He should have showed us his marks of merit,
- wounds received for his country.
- Yes!
- Why, I'm sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't!
No, no, no!
No!
No!
No one saw them!
Was this mockery?
Yes!
When he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy.
Ever spake against your liberties.
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?
Aye!
It is not confirmed.
It is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!
And will deny him!
I'll have 500 voices of that sound.
- Yes!
- I twice 500 and their friends!
Yes!
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties!
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment, all revoke your ignorant election.
Enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you!
And, presently, when you have drawn the number, repair to the senate.
Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
He has, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
How?
What?
How often he had met you, sword to sword.
That of all things upon the earth, he hated your person most.
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, to oppose his hatred fully.
Come, Rome must know the value of her own.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, the tongues of the common mouth.
- Pass no further.
- Ah?
What is that?
It will be dangerous to go on.
No further.
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.
- Are these your herd?
- Be calm, be calm.
The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them time-pleasers,
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.
You show too much of that for which the people stir.
If you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit.
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.
This was my speech, and I'll speak it again.
- Not now, not now.
- Not in this heat, sir.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves.
I say again, in soothing them, we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honored number who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
but that which we have given to beggars!
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you.
You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
It were well we let the people know it.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, by Jove, it would be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
Mark you his absolute "shall"?
Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, more worthier than their voices!
By Jove himself, it makes the consuls base, and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other.
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears, which will, in time, break open the locks of the senate, and bring in the crows to peck the eagles!
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure.
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do!
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul?
No!
Seize him!
Hence, old goat!
On both sides more respect!
Shh!
Shh!
Here's he that would take from you all your power!
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you,
Martius, whom late you have named for consul.
- What is the city but the people?
!
- True!
The people are the city!
The people are the city!
We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,
Martius is worthy of present death!
Death!
- Guards, seize him!
- No, I'll die here!
Get you to your house!
Be gone, away!
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults.
Consul?
What consul?
- The Consul Coriolanus.
- He, consul?
It is decreed he dies tonight.
He's a disease that must be cut away.
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?
Killing our enemies?
The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country.
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more...
Consider this:
He's been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled in graceful language.
Give me leave.
I'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form, in peace, to his utmost peril.
Noble tribunes, it is the humane way.
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.
In you bring not Martius, we'll proceed in our first way.
I'll bring him to you.
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
- yet will I still be thus to them!
- Martius...
I muse my mother does not approve me further.
I talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?
Would you have me false to my nature?
Rather say I play the man I am.
Sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out.
- Let go.
- You might have been enough the man you are, with striving less to be so.
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.
Come, come, you've been too rough, something too rough.
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy, unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst and perish.
Pray, be counseled.
I have a heart as little apt as yours, but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage.
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must I do?
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then?
What then?
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods.
Must I then do it to them?
You are too absolute.
I've heard you say that honor and policy, like unsevered friends in war, do grow together.
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people, not by your own instruction, nor by the matter your heart prompts you, but with such words that are but roted in your tongue, though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor.
I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles... and you.
I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier.
And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves.
But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours.
I prithee, go and be ruled.
Sir, it is fit you make strong party, or defend yourself by calmness or by absence.
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.
I think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit.
He must.
He will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
Must I, with base tongue, give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I'll do it.
Away, my disposition, and possess me some harlot's spirit.
A beggar's tongue make motion through my lips.
I will not do it.
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth, and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
At thy choice, then.
To beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them.
Come all to ruin.
Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'st it from me, but owe thy pride thyself.
Pray, be content, Mother, I'm going.
Chide me no more.
Look, I am going.
I'll return consul, or never trust to what my tongue can do
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.
In this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power.
If he evade us there, enforce him with his hatred to the people.
Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll?
I have.
It's ready.
When the people hear me say
"It shall be so in the right and strength of the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then, let them, if they hear me say "Fine," cry "Fine".
- If "Death," cry "Death".
- We shall inform them.
God preserve thee.
The people are the city.
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.
Calmly, I beseech you.
The honored gods...
The honored gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men, plant love among us, throng our large temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with war.
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, if you submit you to the people's voices.
Aye.
- I am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
The warlike service he has done, consider.
Think upon the wounds his body bears, which show like graves in the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers, scars to move laughter only.
Consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen, you find him like a soldier.
Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as I say, such as become a soldier.
What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again?
We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office, and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical, for which you are a traitor to the people.
How... traitor?
- Traitor!
- Nay, temperately.
Your promise.
The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people.
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.
Traitor!
But since he hath served well for Rome...
What do you prate of service?
- I talk of that, that know it.
- You?
Is this the promise you made your mother?
I'll know no further.
Let them pronounce death, exile, flaying,
I would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word.
In the name of the people, and in the power of us, the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish him our city.
In the people's name, I say...
it shall be so.
- It shall be so!
- He's banished.
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...
- He's sentenced.
No more hearing.
- Let me speak.
- It shall be so!
- I have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies' marks upon me...
There is no more to be said, but he is banished as enemy
- to the people and his country!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
You common cry of curs!
Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses... of unburied men that do corrupt my air.
I... banish... you!
And there remain with your uncertainty.
Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts.
Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair.
Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows.
Despising, for you, the city thus I turn my back.
There is a world... elsewhere.
The people's enemy is gone!
Whoo!
Nay, Mother, where is your ancient courage?
You are too absolute.
Nay, Mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked.
I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.
The gods keep you.
This is a happier and more comely time.
- Yeah.
- Good day.
Good day.
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.
The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love.
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!
I would I had the power to say so to my husband.
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?
I tell thee what, fool, hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words?
Blessed heavens...
More noble blows than ever thou wise words, and for Rome's good.
Yet go.
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.
I tell thee what.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!
- Bastards and all.
- Come!
Come, peace!
Well, well, we'll leave you.
Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses!
Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it.
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat.
I sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding.
- Come.
- Come, madam.
Hey.
Aufidius!
Ah, general.
Yes.
Well, well.
Hey, hey!
Whence comes thou?
Thy name?
Speak, man.
What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, and harsh in sound to thine.
Say... what's thy name?
Thou has a grim appearance.
What's thy name?
- Know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not.
Thy name?
My name is Caius Martius who hath done to thee, particularly, and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief.
Thereto witness may my surname Coriolanus.
Only that name remains.
The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest, and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome.
Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if I had feared death, of all men in the world
I would have avoided thee.
But, in mere spite, to be full quit of those, my banishers, stand I before thee here.
I will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends.
But if thou dares not this, then I present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice, which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since I have ever followed thee with hate, and cannot live but to thy shame
unless it be to do thee service.
O Martius...
Martius...
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
Let me twine mine arms about that body.
Know thou I loved the maid I married, never man sighed truer breath.
But that I see thee here, thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when I first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold.
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, thou hast beat me out 12 several times.
and I have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.
Worthy Martius, had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that thou art thence banished, we would muster all from 12 to 70, and, pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, like a bold flood, overbear it.
Come, go in, and take our friendly senators by the hands.
You bless me, gods.
Therefore, most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission.
And set down as best thou art experienced, since thou knows thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of Rome, or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them, ere destroy.
- Is this Menenius?
- O, 'tis he, 'tis he.
O, he's grown most kind of late.
- Hail, sir.
- Hail to you both.
Your Coriolanus is not much missed, but with his friends.
All's well, and might have been much better
- if he could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?
I hear nothing.
His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.
Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war, but insolent, overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, self-loving...
I think not so.
And Rome sits safe and still without him.
- Shh!
- Shh!
There are reports the Volsces, with two several powers, are entered in the Roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war, destroy what lies before them.
- Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius, who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns into the world again.
Come, what talk you of Martius?
It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be?
We have record that it can.
The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House.
Some news is coming that turns their countenances.
Yes, the first report is seconded, and more more fearful is delivered.
Martius has joined with Aufidius.
He leads a power against Rome, and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius, associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories, and have already overborne their way, consumed with fire, and took what lay before them.
Martius has joined with the Volscians.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies.
Do they still fly to the Roman?
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, their talk at table, and their thanks at end.
And you are darkened in this action, sir.
He bears himself more proud, even to my person, than I thought he would when first I did embrace him.
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature.
Whether it was pride, whether defect of judgment or whether nature, not to be other than one thing, made him feared, so hated, and so banished so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time.
One fire drives out one fire one nail, one nail.
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
When, Caius,
Rome is thine, thou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mine.
No, I'll not go.
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banished him.
A mile before his tent, fall down, and kneel the way into his mercy.
He would not seem to know me.
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops that we have bled together.
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to, forbad all names.
He was a kind of nothing.
Titleless.
Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome.
If you refuse your aid in this...
If you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman.
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius.
Well, and say "Martius return me, as Titus is returned, unhurt".
What then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome.
You know the very road into his kindness, and cannot lose your way.
I'll undertake it.
I think he'll hear me.
- He'll never hear him.
- No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold his eye, red, as it would burn Rome.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does.
O Martius, Martius.
Thou art preparing fire for us.
Look thee there's water to quench it.
I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee,
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome.
Away.
How?
Away?
Wife... mother... child...
I know not.
My affairs are servanted to others.
- Sir...
- Therefore be gone.
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.
This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings.
He's more than a creeping thing.
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.
My lord and husband.
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so.
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny, but do not say for that "Forgive our Romans".
O, a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge.
Ye gods, I prate, and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted.
Sink, my knee, in the earth.
Stand up, blest.
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
- I kneel before thee.
- What's this?
Your knees to me?
To your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior.
I helped to frame thee.
This is a poor epitome of yours, which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may'st prove to shame, invulnerable.
Your knee, sir.
Even he, your wife, this lady and myself,
- are suitors to you.
- I beseech you, peace.
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural.
Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons.
No more, no more.
You have said you will not grant us anything, for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already.
Yet we will ask, that if you fail in our request, the blame may hang upon your hardness.
Therefore hear us.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.
For we'll hear naught from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile.
Think with thyself.
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother, wife, and child
to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out.
And we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win.
For either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles through our streets, or else, triumphantly, tread on thy country's ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood.
For myself... son I purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine.
If I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world.
Aye, and mine, that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time.
You shall not tread on me.
I'll run away till I'm bigger but then I'll fight!
- I have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans, thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve, thou might'st condemn us as poisonous of your honor.
No.
Our suit is that you reconcile them.
So that the Voices may say "This mercy we have showed,"
the Romans, "This we've received,"
and each on either side give the all-hail to thee and cry,
"Be blest for making up this peace!"
Speak to me, son.
Why dost not speak?
Speak you, daughter.
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy.
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons.
There's no man in the world more bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks!
Thou hast never, in thy life, shown thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor.
Say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs.
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees!
Down!
This is the last.
An end.
So we will home to Rome, and die among our neighbors.
Nay.
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot tell what he would have yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship.
Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it.
Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother!
His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance.
Yet give us our dispatch I am hushed until our city be afire, and then I'll speak a little.
O Mother...
Mother...
What have you done?
Behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at.
O my mother!
Mother!
O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome.
But for your son, believe it.
O believe it.
Most... dangerously you have prevailed with him.
If not most mortal to him.
But let it come.
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less?
Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.
But, good sir, what peace you'll make, advise me.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
We have all great cause to give great thanks.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain.
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction.
I raised him, and I pawned mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened, he watered his new plants with dews of flattery, seducing so my friends.
At the last, I seemed his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary.
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.
And, in the last, when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory...
There was it!
For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor of our great action.
Therefore shall he die... and I'll renew me in his fall.
Say no more.
I am returned your soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when I parted hence, but still subsisting under your great command.
We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans.
Tell the traitor, in the highest degree
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor?
How now?
Aye, traitor, Martius.
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.
Caius Martius.
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?
Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome.
I say "your city," for his wife and mother.
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk.
Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory.
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it.
"Boy"?
O slave.
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me!
"Boy"?
If you have writ your annals true, 'this there that, like an eagle in a dovecote,
I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
Alone I did it.
"Boy".
Let him die for it.

Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
Resolved.
First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.
We know it.
- Let us kill him.
And we'll have corn at our own price.
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, our suffering, is a gain to them.
Aye...
Let us revenge this with our sticks, ere we become rakes.
No more talking on it.
Come!
Soft, soft, who comes here?
...friends, mine honest neighbors...
Worthy Senator Menenius, one that has always loved the people.
I tell you, friends, most charitable care have the patricians of you.
For your wants, your suffering in this dearth, you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the Roman state.
Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain.
Bread!
- Bread!
- Bread.
Bread!
Bread, bread, bread...!
Bread, bread, bread...
Stop!
- Stop!
Stop!
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word.
He that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring.
What would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war?
The one affrights you, the other makes you proud.
He that trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares, where foxes, geese.
Who deserves greatness, deserves your hate.
Hang ye.
Trust ye?
With every minute you do change your mind, and call him noble that was now your hate, him vile that was your garland.
What's the matter, that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?
Go.
Get you home you fragments.
- Go back!
- Forward!
Go back!
- Please...
- Know you me yet?
I know you well.
Your name, I think, is Aufidius.
It is so.
- I'm a Roman.
- What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections.
- The people against the senators.
- Hath been?
Is it ended then?
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again.
You have ended my business.
The news is the Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that'll put you to it.
I sin in envying his nobility.
And were I anything but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together?
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt.
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
Lead you on.
So your opinion is, Aufidius, that they of Rome are entered in our counsels
- and know how we proceed.
- Is it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone since I heard thence.
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim.
And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads on this preparation.
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more.
If ever again I meet him beard to beard, he's mine or I am his.
Mark me!
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts.
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge!
Go!
Come on.
Away!
The citizens of Corioles have issued and given to Titus and to Martius battle.
We've heard their drums.
I saw our forces to their trenches
- driven, and then I came away...
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
If my son were my husband,
I would more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb,
I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame.
To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Then his good report should have been my son.
Hear me.
Had I a dozen sons,
I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius.
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum.
I see him stamp thus, cry thus:
"Come on, you cowards!
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome. "
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men!
Pluto and hell.
Look to it.
Come on!
Mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe and make my wars on you.
His bloody brow then wiping, forth he goes.
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.
Away, you fool.
It more becomes a man than gold his trophy.
Senator Menenius is come to visit you.
Tell him we are fit to bid him welcome.
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- Indeed, you shall not.
- My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both?
And how does your little son?
I thank you, sir.
Well, good.
He'd rather play with swords and hear a drum
- than look upon his schoolmaster.
- On my word, the father's son.
Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.
No, good sir, I will not out of doors.
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.
Indeed, no, by your patience.
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.
- I cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
No, good sir.
Pardon me.
Indeed, I will not forth.
Go with me, and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
No, good sir, there can be none yet.
- There came news from him last night.
- Indeed?
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Carioles.
They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars.
This is true, on mine honor.
So, I pray, go outwith us.
Give me excuse, good sir.
I will obey you in everything hereafter.
Let her alone.
As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.
What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless.
He is himself alone, to answer all the city.
Thou art lost, Martius.
Who's yonder, that does appear as he were flayed?
O gods!
He has the stamp of Martius.
Come I too late?
!
Come I too late?
!
Aye, if you come not in the blood of others, but mantled in your own.
Let me hold you in arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done.
There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight.
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.
The blood I drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me.
To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight.
If any such be here, as it were sin to doubt, that love this painting wherein you see me smeared, if any fear lesser his person than an ill report, if any think brave death outweighs bad life,
and that his country is dearer than himself, let him alone, or so many so minded wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow Martius!
O... me alone.
Make you a sword of me!
Oi!
Advance, brave Titus!
Away!
Come!
Come!
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee.
We hate alike.
Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee.
So often has thou beat me, and would do so, I fear, should we encounter as often as we eat.
For where I thought to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way.
Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.
Bolder, though not so subtle.
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius.
Where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.
Honorable Menenius!
My boy, Martius, approaches.
For the love of Juno, let's go.
Is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.
O yes, he is wounded.
I thank the gods for it.
O, so do I too, if it be not too much.
Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius said they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
Gods grant them true.
- True.
- I'll be sworn they're true.
Where is he wounded?
In the shoulder and in the left arm.
There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
He had, before this last expedition,
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.
Every gash was an enemy's grave.
Before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm doth lie.
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
Be it known, as to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius wears this war's garland.
And, from this time, for what he did before Corioles, call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host:
"Caius Martius Coriolanus." Bear the addition nobly ever.
Caius Martius Coriolanus!
No more of this.
It does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother.
O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods for my prosperity.
Nay, my good soldier, up.
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honor newly named...
What is it?
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife...
My gracious silence, hail.
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home, that weeps to see me triumph?
Aye, my dear, such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, and mothers that lack sons.
Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh.
I'm light and heavy.
- I know not where to turn.
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!
- Welcome, Coriolanus!
Welcome!
'Tis thought that Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and the blind to hear him speak.
Matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed.
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.
And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius?
He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people...
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
You blame Martius for being proud?
- We do it not alone, sir.
- I know you can do very little alone.
You talk of pride.
O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves.
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy politicians, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it.
One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning.
What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.
- You're ambitious.
Good e'en to your worships.
More of your conversation would infect my brain.
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say, but 'tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow, but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people.
There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them.
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition.
And, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see it.
But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him.
Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well.
And would be content to give him good report for it, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.
The good senators must be visited, from whom I have received not only greetings, but with them change of honors.
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy.
Only there's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee.
Good mother, I'd rather be their servant in my way, than sway with them in theirs.
Coriolanus will carry it.
He's a worthy man.
He will carry it.
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, during his power, go asleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end, but will lose those he hath won.
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear in the marketplace, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word.
It shall be to him then, a sure destruction.
So it must fall out to him, or our authorities, for an end.
We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them.
Kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze shall darken him forever.
It remains, as the main point of this our after-meeting, to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country.
Therefore, please you, most grave and reverend elders, to desire the present consul, and last general in our well-found successes, to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.
- Speak, good Cominius.
- Aye.
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.
Never shame to hear what you have nobly done.
Your honor's pardon.
I'd rather have my wounds to heal again
- than hear say how I got them.
- Pray you, sit down.
I'd rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered.
- Speak, good Cominius.
- Aye, proceed.
The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly.
It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver.
If it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
At 16 years, he fought beyond the mark of others.
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man in the field.
And in the brunt of 17 battles since, he lurched all swords of the garland.
For this last, before and in Corioles, let me say I cannot speak him home.
He stopped the fliers, and by his rare example, made coward turn terror into sport, from face to foot.
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
Alone, he entered the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny.
- Aidless came off, and with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioles like a planet.
Until we called both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting.
Our spoils he kicked at, and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world.
He covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
Aye.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you, let me overleap that custom, for I cannot entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage.
Please you that I may pass this doing.
Sir!
The people must have their voices.
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.
It is a part that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken
- from the people.
- Mark you that?
To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, as if I had received them for the hire of their breath only.
To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor!
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul!
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
Let me overleap that custom.
The people must have their voices.
Have you not known the worthiest men have done it?
Custom calls me to it.
What custom wills, in all things should we do it.
What must I say?
"Look, sir, my wounds.
I got them in my country's service."
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that.
You must desire them to think upon you.
Think upon me?
Hang 'em.
I would they would forget me.
Pray you, speak to them.
I pray you, in wholesome manner.
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean.
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
We do, sir.
Tell us what hath brought you to it.
- Mine own desert.
- Your own desert?
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it.
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private.
Your good voice, sir.
What say you?
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged.
Adieu.
But this is something odd.
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voice that I may be consul.
You've deserved nobly of your country, and you've not deserved nobly.
Your enigma?
You've been a scourge to her enemies, you've been a rod to her friends.
You've not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.
I'll make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.
Your voices!
For your voices I have fought.
Watched for your voices.
For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd.
Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of!
For your voices have done many things, some less, some more.
Your voices!
Indeed, I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!
- Aye.
- Aye.
Therefore, let him be consul!
- Amen!
- Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
- Amen!
- Worthy voices!
Worthy voices, worthy voices.
You have stood your limitation.
And the tribunes now endow you with the people's voice.
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged.
The people do admit you, and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation.
- Where?
At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.
I'll keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
God save thee, noble consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, my masters!
My masters!
My masters, how now!
- Have you chose this man?
- Aye!
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Amen, sir.
To my poor, unworthy notice, he mocked us when he begged our voices.
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright.
O, no, no, no, it is his kind of speech.
Aye.
- He did not mock us.
He should have showed us his marks of merit,
- wounds received for his country.
Yes!
- Why, I'm sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't!
No, no, no!
No!
No!
No one saw them!
Was this mockery?
Yes!
When he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy.
- Ever spake against your liberties.
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?
Aye!
It is not confirmed.
It is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!
- And will deny him!
I'll have 500 voices of that sound.
Yes!
- I twice 500 and their friends!
Yes!
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties!
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment, all revoke your ignorant election.
Enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you!
And, presently, when you have drawn the number, repair to the senate.
Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
He has, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
How?
What?
How often he had met you, sword to sword.
That of all things upon the earth, he hated your person most.
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, to oppose his hatred fully.
Come, Rome must know the value of her own.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, the tongues of the common mouth.
- Pass no further.
- Ah?
What is that?
It will be dangerous to go on.
No further.
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.
- Are these your herd?
- Be calm, be calm.
The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them time-pleasers,
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.
You show too much of that for which the people stir.
If you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit.
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.
This was my speech, and I'll speak it again.
- Not now, not now.
- Not in this heat, sir.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves.
I say again, in soothing them, we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honored number who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
but that which we have given to beggars!
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you.
You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
It were well we let the people know it.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, by Jove, it would be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
Mark you his absolute "shall"?
Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, more worthier than their voices!
By Jove himself, it makes the consuls base, and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other.
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears, which will, in time, break open the locks of the senate, and bring in the crows to peck the eagles!
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure.
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do!
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul?
No!
Seize him!
Hence, old goat!
On both sides more respect!
Shh!
Shh!
Here's he that would take from you all your power!
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you,
Martius, whom late you have named for consul.
- What is the city but the people?
!
- True!
The people are the city!
The people are the city!
We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,
Martius is worthy of present death!
Death!
- Guards, seize him!
- No, I'll die here!
Get you to your house!
Be gone, away!
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults.
Consul?
What consul?
- The Consul Coriolanus.
- He, consul?
It is decreed he dies tonight.
He's a disease that must be cut away.
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?
Killing our enemies?
The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country.
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more...
Consider this:
He's been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled in graceful language.
Give me leave.
I'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form, in peace, to his utmost peril.
Noble tribunes, it is the humane way.
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.
In you bring not Martius, we'll proceed in our first way.
I'll bring him to you.
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
- yet will I still be thus to them!
- Martius...
I muse my mother does not approve me further.
I talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?
Would you have me false to my nature?
Rather say I play the man I am.
Sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out.
- Let go.
- You might have been enough the man you are, with striving less to be so.
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.
Come, come, you've been too rough, something too rough.
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy, unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst and perish.
Pray, be counseled.
I have a heart as little apt as yours, but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage.
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must I do?
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then?
What then?
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods.
Must I then do it to them?
You are too absolute.
I've heard you say that honor and policy, like unsevered friends in war, do grow together.
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people, not by your own instruction, nor by the matter your heart prompts you, but with such words that are but roted in your tongue, though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor.
I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles... and you.
I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier.
And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves.
But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours.
I prithee, go and be ruled.
Sir, it is fit you make strong party, or defend yourself by calmness or by absence.
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.
I think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit.
He must.
He will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
Must I, with base tongue, give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I'll do it.
Away, my disposition, and possess me some harlot's spirit.
A beggar's tongue make motion through my lips.
I will not do it.
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth, and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
At thy choice, then.
To beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them.
Come all to ruin.
Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'st it from me, but owe thy pride thyself.
Pray, be content, Mother, I'm going.
Chide me no more.
Look, I am going.
I'll return consul, or never trust to what my tongue can do
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.
That he affects tyrannical power.
If he evade us there, enforce him with his hatred to the people.
Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll?
I have.
It's ready.
When the people hear me say
"it shall be so in the right and strength of the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then, let them, if they hear me say "Fine," cry "Fine."
- If "Death," cry "Death."
- We shall inform them.
God preserve thee.
The people are the city.
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.
Calmly, I beseech you.
- The honored gods...
The honored gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men, plant love among us, throng our large temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with war.
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, if you submit you to the people's voices.
Aye.
- I am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
The warlike service he has done, consider.
Think upon the wounds his body bears, which show like graves in the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers, scars to move laughter only.
Consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen,
- you find him like a soldier.
Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as I say, such as become a soldier.
What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again?
We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office, and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical, for which you are a traitor to the people.
How... traitor?
- Traitor!
- Nay, temperately.
Your promise.
The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people.
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.
Traitor!
But since he hath served well for Rome...
What do you prate of service?
- I talk of that, that know it.
- You?
Is this the promise you made your mother?
I'll know no further.
Let them pronounce death, exile, flaying,
I would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word.
In the name of the people, and in the power of us, the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish him our city.
In the people's name, I say...
it shall be so.
- It shall be so!
- He's banished.
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...
- He's sentenced.
No more hearing.
- Let me speak.
It shall be so!
- I have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies' marks upon me...
There is no more to be said, but he is banished as enemy
- to the people and his country!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
You common cry of curs!
Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air.
I... banish... you!
And here remain with your uncertainty.
Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts.
Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair.
Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows.
Despising, for you, the city... thus.
...I turn my back.
There is a world... elsewhere.
The people's enemy is gone!
- Whoo!
Nay, Mother, where is your ancient courage?
You are too absolute.
Nay, Mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked.
I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.
The gods keep you.
This is a happier and more comely time.
- Yeah.
- Good day.
Good day.
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.
The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love.
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!
I would I had the power to say so to my husband.
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?
I tell thee what, fool, hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words?
Blessed heavens...
More noble blows than ever thou wise words, and for Rome's good.
Yet go.
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.
I tell thee what.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!
- Bastards and all.
- Come!
Come, peace!
Well, well, we'll leave you.
Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses!
Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it.
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat.
I sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding.
- Come.
- Come, madam.
Hey.
Aufidius!
Ah, general.
Yes.
Well, well.
Hey, hey!
Whence comes thou?
Thy name?
Speak, man.
What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, and harsh in sound to thine.
Say... what's thy name?
Thou has a grim appearance.
What's thy name?
- Know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not.
Thy name?
My name is Caius Martius who hath done to thee, particularly, and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief.
Thereto witness may my surname Coriolanus.
Only that name remains.
The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest, and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome.
Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if I had feared death, of all men in the world
I would have avoided thee.
But, in mere spite, to be full quit of those, my banishers, stand I before thee here.
I will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends.
But if thou dares not this, then I present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice, which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since I have ever followed thee with hate, and cannot live but to thy shame
unless it be to do thee service.
O Martius...
Martius...
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
Let me twine mine arms about that body.
Know thou I loved the maid I married, never man sighed truer breath.
But that I see thee here, thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when I first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold.
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, thou hast beat me out 12 several times, and I have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.
Worthy Martius, had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that thou art thence banished, we would muster all from 12 to 70, and, pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, like a bold flood, overbear it.
Come, go in, and take our friendly senators by the hands.
You bless me, gods.
Therefore, most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission.
And set down as best thou art experienced, since thou knows thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of Rome, or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them, ere destroy.
- Is this Menenius?
- O, 'tis he, 'tis he.
O, he's grown most kind of late.
- Hail, sir.
- Hail to you both.
Your Coriolanus is not much missed, but with his friends.
All's well, and might have been much better
- if he could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?
I hear nothing.
His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.
Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war, but insolent, overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, self-loving...
I think not so.
And Rome sits safe and still without him.
- Shh!
- Shh!
There are reports the Volsces with two several powers, are entered in the Roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war, destroy what lies before them.
Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius, who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns into the world again.
Come, what talk you of Martius?
It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be?
We have record that it can.
The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House.
Some news is coming that turns their countenances.
Yes, the first report is seconded, and more more fearful is delivered.
Martius has joined with Aufidius.
He leads a power against Rome, and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories, and have already overborne their way, consumed with fire, and took what lay before them.
Martius has joined with the Volscians.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies.
Do they still fly to the Roman?
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, their talk at table, and their thanks at end.
And you are darkened in this action, sir.
He bears himself more proud, even to my person, than I thought he would when first I did embrace him.
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature.
Whether it was pride, whether defect of judgment or whether nature, not to be other than one thing, made him feared, so hated, and so banished so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time.
One fire drives out one fire one nail, one nail.
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
When, Caius,
Rome is thine, thou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mine.
No, I'll not go.
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banished him.
A mile before his tent, fall down, and kneel the way into his mercy.
He would not seem to know me.
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops that we have bled together.
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to, forbad all names.
He was a kind of nothing.
Titleless.
Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome.
If you refuse your aid in this...
If you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman.
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius.
Well, and say "Martius return me, as Titus is returned, unhurt."
What then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome.
You know the very road into his kindness, and cannot lose your way.
I'll undertake it.
I think he'll hear me.
- He'll never hear him.
- No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold his eye, red, as it would burn Rome.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does.
O Martius, Martius.
Thou art preparing fire for us.
Look thee there's water to quench it.
I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee,
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome.
Away.
How?
Away?
Wife... mother... child...
I know not.
My affairs are servanted to others.
- Sir...
- Therefore be gone.
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.
This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings.
He's more than a creeping thing.
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.
My lord and husband.
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so.
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny, but do not say for that "Forgive our Romans."
O, a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge.
Ye gods, I prate, and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted.
Sink, my knee, in the earth.
Stand up, blest.
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
- I kneel before thee.
- What's this?
Your knees to me?
To your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior.
I helped to frame thee.
This is a poor epitome of yours, which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may'st prove to shame, invulnerable.
Your knee, sir.
Even he, your wife, this lady and myself,
- are suitors to you.
- I beseech you, peace.
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural.
Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons.
No more, no more.
You have said you will not grant us anything, for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already.
Yet we will ask, that if you fail in our request, the blame may hang upon your hardness.
Therefore hear us.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.
For we'll hear naught from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile.
Think with thyself.
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother, wife, and child
to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out.
And we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win.
For either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles through our streets, or else, triumphantly, tread on thy country's ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood.
For myself... son I purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine.
If I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world.
Aye, and mine, that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time.
You shall not tread on me.
I'll run away till I'm bigger but then I'll fight!
- I have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans, thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve, thou might'st condemn us as poisonous of your honor.
No.
Our suit is that you reconcile them.
So that the Voices may say "This mercy we have showed,"
the Romans, "This we've received,"
and each on either side give the all-hail to thee and cry,
"Be blest for making up this peace!"
Speak to me, son.
Why dost not speak?
Speak you, daughter.
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy.
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons.
There's no man in the world more bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks!
Thou hast never, in thy life, shown thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor.
Say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs.
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees!
Down!
This is the last.
An end.
So we will home to Rome, and die among our neighbors.
Nay.
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot tell what he would have yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship.
Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it.
Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother!
His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance.
Yet give us our dispatch I am hushed until our city be afire, and then I'll speak a little.
O Mother...
Mother...
What have you done?
Behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at.
O my mother!
Mother!
O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome.
But for your son, believe it.
O believe it.
Most... dangerously you have prevailed with him.
If not most mortal to him.
But let it come.
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less?
Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.
But, good sir, what peace you'll make, advise me.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
We have all great cause to give great thanks.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain.
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction.
I raised him, and I pawned mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened, he watered his new plants with dews of flattery, seducing so my friends.
At the last, I seemed his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary.
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.
And, in the last, when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory...
There was it!
For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor of our great action.
Therefore shall he die...
- ...and I'll renew me in his fall.
- Say no more.
I am returned your soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when I parted hence, but still subsisting under your great command.
We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans.
Tell the traitor, in the highest degree
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor?
How now?
Aye, traitor, Martius.
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.
Caius Martius.
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?
Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome.
I say "your city," for his wife and mother.
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk.
Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory.
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it.
"Boy"?
O slave.
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me!
"Boy"?
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there that, like an eagle in a dovecote,
I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
Alone I did it.
"Boy."
Let him die for it.
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
Resolved.
First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.
- We know it.
- Let us kill him.
And we'll have corn at our own price.
We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, our suffering, is a gain to them.
Aye...
Let us revenge this with our sticks, ere we become rakes.
No more talking on it.
Come!
Soft, soft, who comes here?
...friends, mine honest neighbors...
Worthy Senator Menenius, one that has always loved the people.
I tell you, friends, most charitable care have the patricians of you.
For your wants, your suffering in this dearth, you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the Roman state.
Suffer us to famish, and their storehouses crammed with grain.
Bread!
- Bread!
- Bread.
Bread!
Bread, bread, bread...!
Bread, bread, bread...
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, make yourselves scabs?
We have ever your good word.
He that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring.
What would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war?
The one affrights you, the other makes you proud.
He that trusts to you, where he should find you lions, finds you hares, where foxes, geese.
Who deserves greatness, deserves your hate.
Hang ye.
Trust ye?
With every minute you do change your mind, and call him noble that was now your hate, him vile that was your garland.
What's the matter, that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate, who, under the gods, keep you in awe, which else would feed on one another?
Go.
Get you home you fragments.
- Go back!
- Forward!
Go back!
- Please...
- Know you me yet?
I know you well.
Your name, I think, is Aufidius.
It is so.
- I'm a Roman.
- What's the news in Rome?
What's the news in Rome?
There hath been in Rome strange insurrections.
- The people against the senators.
- Hath been?
Is it ended then?
The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again.
You have ended my business.
The news is the Volsces are in arms.
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius, that'll put you to it.
I sin in envying his nobility.
And were I anything but what I am, I would wish me only he.
You have fought together?
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt.
Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
Lead you on.
So your opinion is, Aufidius, that they of Rome are entered in our counsels
- and know how we proceed.
- Is it not yours?
'Tis not four days gone since I heard thence.
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim.
And it is rumored Martius, your old enemy, leads on this preparation.
If we and Caius Martius chance to meet, 'tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more.
If ever again I meet him beard to beard, he's mine or I am his.
Mark me!
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts.
He that retires, I'll take him for a Volsce and he shall feel mine edge!
Go!
Come on.
Away!
The citizens of Corioles have issued and given to Titus and to Martius battle.
We've heard their drums.
I saw our forces to their trenches driven, and then I came away...
I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
If my son were my husband,
I would more freely rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb,
I, considering how honor would become such a person, was pleased to let him seek danger, where he was like to find fame.
To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?
Then his good report should have been my son.
Hear me.
Had I a dozen sons,
I had rather eleven die nobly for their country, than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius.
He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee and tread upon his neck.
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum.
I see him stamp thus, cry thus:
"Come on, you cowards!
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome."
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men!
Pluto and hell.
Look to it.
Come on!
Mend and charge home, or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe and make my wars on you.
His bloody brow then wiping, forth he goes.
His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.
Away, you fool.
It more becomes a man than gold his trophy.
Senator Menenius is come to visit you.
Tell him we are fit to bid him welcome.
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
- Indeed, you shall not.
- My ladies both, good day to you.
How do you both?
And how does your little son?
I thank you, sir.
Well, good.
He'd rather play with swords and hear a drum
- than look upon his schoolmaster.
- On my word, the father's son.
Come, I must have you play the idle housewife with me this afternoon.
No, good sir, I will not out of doors.
- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.
Indeed, no, by your patience.
I'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.
- I cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.
No, good sir.
Pardon me.
Indeed, I will not forth.
Go with me, and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.
No, good sir, there can be none yet.
- There came news from him last night.
- Indeed?
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before the Volscian city of Carioles.
They nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars.
This is true, on mine honor.
So, I pray, go out with us.
Give me excuse, good sir.
I will obey you in everything hereafter.
Let her alone.
As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.
- What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless.
He is himself alone, to answer all the city.
Thou art lost, Martius.
Who's yonder, that does appear as he were flayed?
O gods!
He has the stamp of Martius.
Come I too late?
!
Come I too late?
!
Aye, if you come not in the blood of others, but mantled in your own.
Let me hold you in arms as sound as when I wooed, in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done.
There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
Thy exercise has been too violent for a second course of fight.
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.
The blood I drop is more medicinal than dangerous to me.
To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight.
If any such be here, as it were sin to doubt, that love this painting wherein you see me smeared, if any fear lesser his person than an ill report, if any think brave death outweighs bad life,
and that his country is dearer than himself, let him alone, or so many so minded wave thus, to express his disposition, and follow Martius!
O... me alone.
Make you a sword of me!
Oi!
Advance, brave Titus!
Away!
Come!
Come!
I'll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee.
We hate alike.
Five times, Martius, I have fought with thee.
So often has thou beat me, and would do so, I fear, should we encounter as often as we eat.
For where I thought to crush him in an equal force, true sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way.
Or wrath or craft may get him.
He's the devil.
Bolder, though not so subtle.
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom against my hate to Martius.
Where I find him, were it at home, upon my brother's guard, even there, will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.
Honorable Menenius!
My boy, Martius, approaches.
For the love of Juno, let's go.
Is he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.
O yes, he is wounded.
I thank the gods for it.
O, so do I too, if it be not too much.
Brings a victory in his pocket, the wounds become him.
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
Titus Lartius said they fought together, but Aufidius got off.
In truth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
Gods grant them true.
- True.
- I'll be sworn they're true.
Where is he wounded?
In the shoulder and in the left arm.
There will be large scars to show the people when he shall stand for his place.
He had, before this last expedition,
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.
Every gash was an enemy's grave.
Before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears.
Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm doth lie.
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
Be it known, as to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius wears this war's garland.
And, from this time, for what he did before Corioles, call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host:
"Caius Martius Coriolanus." Bear the addition nobly ever.
Caius Martius Coriolanus!
No more of this.
It does offend my heart.
Pray now, no more.
Look, sir, your mother.
O, you have, I know, petitioned all the gods for my prosperity.
Nay, my good soldier, up.
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and by deed-achieving honor newly named...
What is it?
"Coriolanus" must I call thee?
But, O, thy wife...
My gracious silence, hail.
Wouldst thou have laughed had I come coffined home, that weeps to see me triumph?
Aye, my dear, such eyes the widows in Corioles wear, and mothers that lack sons.
- Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?
I could weep and I could laugh.
I'm light and heavy.
I know not where to turn.
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!
Welcome, Coriolanus!
Welcome!
'Tis thought that Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and the blind to hear him speak.
Matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarves and handkerchiefs upon him as he passed.
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.
And the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.
Was ever a man so proud as is this Martius?
He has no equal.
When we were chosen tribunes for the people...
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.
Good or bad?
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
You blame Martius for being proud?
- We do it not alone, sir.
- I know you can do very little alone.
You talk of pride.
O that you could turn your eyes towards the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves.
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy politicians, alias fools, as any in Rome.
Menenius, you are known well enough too.
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it.
One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning.
What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.
You're ambitious.
Good e'en to your worships.
More of your conversation would infect my brain.
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say, but 'tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.
That's a brave fellow, but he is vengeance proud and loves not the common people.
There have been many great men that have flattered the people who never loved them.
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition.
And, out of his noble carelessness, lets them plainly see it.
But he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render at him.
Now to seem to desire the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
Consider you what services he has done for his country?
Very well.
And would be content to give him good report for it, but that he pays himself with being proud.
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.
The good senators must be visited, from whom I have received not only greetings, but with them change of honors.
I have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy.
Only there's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but our Rome will cast upon thee.
Good mother, I'd rather be their servant in my way, than sway with them in theirs.
Coriolanus will carry it.
He's a worthy man.
He will carry it.
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, I warrant him consul.
Then our office may, during his power, go asleep.
He cannot temperately transport his honors from where he should begin and end, but will lose those he hath won.
I heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear in the marketplace, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths.
It was his word.
It shall be to him then, a sure destruction.
So it must fall out to him, or our authorities, for an end.
We must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them.
Kindle their dry stubble, and their blaze shall darken him forever.
It remains, as the main point of this our after-meeting, to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country.
Therefore, please you, most grave and reverend elders, to desire the present consul, and last general in our well-found successes, to report a little of that worthy work performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.
- Speak, good Cominius.
- Aye.
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.
Never shame to hear what you have nobly done.
Your honor's pardon.
I'd rather have my wounds to heal again
- than hear say how I got them.
- Pray you, sit down.
I'd rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered.
- Speak, good Cominius.
- Aye, proceed.
The deeds of Coriolanus should not be uttered feebly.
It is held that valor is the chiefest virtue, and most dignifies the haver.
If it be, the man I speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
At 16 years, he fought beyond the mark of others.
When he might act the woman in the scene, he proved best man in the field.
And in the brunt of 17 battles since, he lurched all swords of the garland.
For this last, before and in Corioles, let me say I cannot speak him home.
He stopped the fliers, and by his rare example, made coward turn terror into sport, from face to foot.
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
Alone, he entered the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny.
Aidless came off, and with a sudden re-enforcement struck Corioles like a planet.
Until we called both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting.
Our spoils he kicked at, and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world.
He covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul.
Aye.
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
I do beseech you, let me overleap that custom, for I cannot entreat them for my wounds' sake to give their suffrage.
Please you that I may pass this doing.
Sir!
The people must have their voices.
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.
It is a part that I shall blush in acting, and might well be taken
- from the people.
- Mark you that?
To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, as if I had received them for the hire of their breath only.
To our noble consul wish we all joy and honor!
The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased to make thee consul!
I do owe them still my life and services.
It then remains that you do speak to the people.
Let me overleap that custom.
The people must have their voices.
Have you not known the worthiest men have done it?
Custom calls me to it.
What custom wills, in all things should we do it.
What must I say?
"Look, sir, my wounds.
I got them in my country's service."
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that.
You must desire them to think upon you.
Think upon me?
Hang 'em.
I would they would forget me.
Pray you, speak to them.
I pray you, in wholesome manner.
Bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean.
You know the cause, sir, of my standing here?
We do, sir.
Tell us what hath brought you to it.
- Mine own desert.
- Your own desert?
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?
No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.
You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.
Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?
The price is to ask it kindly.
Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it.
I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private.
Your good voice, sir.
What say you?
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.
There's in all two worthy voices begged.
Adieu.
But this is something odd.
Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voice that I may be consul.
You've deserved nobly of your country, and you've not deserved nobly.
Your enigma?
You've been a scourge to her enemies, you've been a rod to her friends.
You've not indeed loved the common people.
You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love.
We hope to find you our friend, and therefore give you our voices heartily.
I'll make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.
Your voices!
For your voices I have fought.
Watched for your voices.
For your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd.
Battles thrice six I have seen and heard of!
For your voices have done many things, some less, some more.
Your voices!
Indeed, I would be consul.
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest man's voice!
- Aye.
- Aye.
Therefore, let him be consul!
- Amen!
- Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Amen!
Worthy voices!
Worthy voices, worthy voices.
You have stood your limitation.
And the tribunes now endow you with the people's voice.
Is this done?
The custom of request you have discharged.
The people do admit you, and are summoned to meet anon upon your approbation.
- Where?
At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.
- May I change these garments?
- You may, sir.
I'll keep you company.
Will you along?
We stay here for the people.
God save thee, noble consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
Consul!
How now, my masters!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, my masters!
My masters!
My masters, how now!
- Have you chose this man?
- Aye!
He has our voices, sir.
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
Amen, sir.
To my poor, unworthy notice, he mocked us when he begged our voices.
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright.
O, no, no, no, it is his kind of speech.
- Aye.
- He did not mock us.
He should have showed us his marks of merit,
- wounds received for his country.
- Yes!
- Why, I'm sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't!
No, no, no!
No!
No!
No one saw them!
Was this mockery?
Yes!
When he had no power, but was a petty servant to the state, he was your enemy.
Ever spake against your liberties.
Did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush?
Aye!
It is not confirmed.
It is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!
And will deny him!
I'll have 500 voices of that sound.
- Yes!
- I twice 500 and their friends!
Yes!
Get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties!
Let them assemble, and on a safer judgment, all revoke your ignorant election.
Enforce his pride, and his old hate unto you!
And, presently, when you have drawn the number, repair to the senate.
Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army?
He has, my lord.
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.
How?
What?
How often he had met you, sword to sword.
That of all things upon the earth, he hated your person most.
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.
I wish I had a cause to seek him there, to oppose his hatred fully.
Come, Rome must know the value of her own.
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, the tongues of the common mouth.
- Pass no further.
- Ah?
What is that?
It will be dangerous to go on.
No further.
- What makes this change?
- The matter?
Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons?
- Cominius, no.
- Have I had children's voices?
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.
- Are these your herd?
- Be calm, be calm.
The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them time-pleasers,
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.
You show too much of that for which the people stir.
If you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way with a gentler spirit.
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.
This was my speech, and I'll speak it again.
- Not now, not now.
- Not in this heat, sir.
My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them regard me as I do not flatter, and therein behold themselves.
I say again, in soothing them, we nourish against our senate the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered by mingling them with us, the honored number who lack not virtue, no, nor power,
but that which we have given to beggars!
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you.
You speak of the people as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
It were well we let the people know it.
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, by Jove, it would be my mind!
It is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?
Mark you his absolute "shall"?
Why should the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
I'll give my reasons, more worthier than their voices!
By Jove himself, it makes the consuls base, and my soul aches to know, when two authorities are up, neither supreme, how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other.
Thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears, which will, in time, break open the locks of the senate, and bring in the crows to peck the eagles!
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure.
He has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer as traitors do!
Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul?
No!
Seize him!
Hence, old goat!
On both sides more respect!
Shh!
Shh!
Here's he that would take from you all your power!
You are at point to lose your liberties!
Martius would have all from you,
Martius, whom late you have named for consul.
- What is the city but the people?
!
- True!
The people are the city!
The people are the city!
We do here pronounce, upon the part of the people,
Martius is worthy of present death!
Death!
- Guards, seize him!
- No, I'll die here!
Get you to your house!
Be gone, away!
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults.
Consul?
What consul?
- The Consul Coriolanus.
- He, consul?
It is decreed he dies tonight.
He's a disease that must be cut away.
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.
Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy.
What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?
Killing our enemies?
The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country.
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more...
Consider this:
He's been bred in the wars since he could draw a sword, and is ill-schooled in graceful language.
Give me leave.
I'll go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form, in peace, to his utmost peril.
Noble tribunes, it is the humane way.
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.
In you bring not Martius, we'll proceed in our first way.
I'll bring him to you.
Let them pull all about mine ears, present me death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
- yet will I still be thus to them!
- Martius...
I muse my mother does not approve me further.
I talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?
Would you have me false to my nature?
Rather say I play the man I am.
Sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out.
- Let go.
- You might have been enough the man you are, with striving less to be so.
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.
Come, come, you've been too rough, something too rough.
You must return and mend it.
There's no remedy, unless, by not so doing, our good city cleave in the midst and perish.
Pray, be counseled.
I have a heart as little apt as yours, but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage.
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must I do?
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then?
What then?
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them?
I cannot do it to the gods.
Must I then do it to them?
You are too absolute.
I've heard you say that honor and policy, like unsevered friends in war, do grow together.
Why force you this?
Because that now it lies you on to speak to the people, not by your own instruction, nor by the matter your heart prompts you, but with such words that are but roted in your tongue, though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
I would dissemble with my nature where my fortune and my friends at stake required I should do so in honor.
I am, in this, your wife, your son, the senators, nobles... and you.
I prithee now, my son, go to them, be with them, say to them thou art their soldier.
And being bred in broils has not the soft way in asking their good loves.
But thou wilt frame thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.
This but done, even as she speaks, why their hearts were yours.
I prithee, go and be ruled.
Sir, it is fit you make strong party, or defend yourself by calmness or by absence.
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.
I think it will serve if he can thereto frame his spirit.
He must.
He will.
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
Must I, with base tongue, give my noble heart a lie that it must bear?
Well, I'll do it.
Away, my disposition, and possess me some harlot's spirit.
A beggar's tongue make motion through my lips.
I will not do it.
Lest I cease to honor mine own truth, and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
At thy choice, then.
To beg of thee is more my dishonor than thou of them.
Come all to ruin.
Let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'st it from me, but owe thy pride thyself.
Pray, be content, Mother, I'm going.
Chide me no more.
Look, I am going.
I'll return consul, or never trust to what my tongue can do
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.
In this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power.
If he evade us there, enforce him with his hatred to the people.
Have you a catalog of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll?
I have.
It's ready.
When the people hear me say
"It shall be so in the right and strength of the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then, let them, if they hear me say "Fine," cry "Fine."
- If "Death," cry "Death."
- We shall inform them.
God preserve thee.
The people are the city.
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue.
Calmly, I beseech you.
The honored gods...
The honored gods keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men, plant love among us, throng our large temples with the shows of peace, and not our streets with war.
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.
Shall I be charged no further than this present?
Must all determine here?
I do demand, if you submit you to the people's voices.
Aye.
- I am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
The warlike service he has done, consider.
Think upon the wounds his body bears, which show like graves in the holy churchyard.
Scratches with briers, scars to move laughter only.
Consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen, you find him like a soldier.
Do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as I say, such as become a soldier.
What is the matter that being passed for consul with full voice,
I am so dishonored that the very hour you take it off again?
We charge you that you have contrived to take from Rome all seasoned office, and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical, for which you are a traitor to the people.
How... traitor?
- Traitor!
- Nay, temperately.
Your promise.
The fires in the lowest hell fold in the people.
Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune?
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.
Traitor!
But since he hath served well for Rome...
What do you prate of service?
- I talk of that, that know it.
- You?
Is this the promise you made your mother?
I'll know no further.
Let them pronounce death, exile, flaying,
I would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word.
In the name of the people, and in the power of us, the tribunes, we, even from this instant, banish him our city.
In the people's name, I say...
it shall be so.
- It shall be so!
- He's banished.
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- Hear me, my masters, and my common friends...
- He's sentenced.
No more hearing.
- Let me speak.
- It shall be so!
- I have been consul and can show for Rome her enemies' marks upon me...
There is no more to be said, but he is banished as enemy
- to the people and his country!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
- It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
It shall be so!
You common cry of curs!
Whose breath I hate as reeks of the rotten fens, whose loves I prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air.
I... banish... you!
And there remain with your uncertainty.
Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts.
Your enemies, with nodding of their caps, fan you into despair.
Have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, making but reservation of yourselves, still your own foes deliver you as most abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows.
Despising, for you, the city thus I turn my back.
There is a world... elsewhere.
The people's enemy is gone!
Whoo!
Nay, Mother, where is your ancient courage?
You are too absolute.
Nay, Mother, I shall be loved when I am lacked.
I go alone, like to a lonely dragon.
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.
The gods keep you.
This is a happier and more comely time.
- Yeah.
- Good day.
Good day.
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.
The hoarded plague of the gods requite thy love.
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!
I would I had the power to say so to my husband.
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?
I tell thee what, fool, hadst thou craft to banish him that struck more blows for Rome than thou hast spoken words?
Blessed heavens...
More noble blows than ever thou wise words, and for Rome's good.
Yet go.
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.
I tell thee what.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!
- Bastards and all.
- Come!
Come, peace!
Well, well, we'll leave you.
Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?
I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses!
Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it.
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.
You'll sup with me?
Anger's my meat.
I sup upon myself and so shall starve with feeding.
- Come.
- Come, madam.
Hey.
Aufidius!
Ah, general.
Yes.
Well, well.
Hey, hey!
Whence comes thou?
Thy name?
Speak, man.
What's thy name?
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, and harsh in sound to thine.
Say... what's thy name?
Thou has a grim appearance.
What's thy name?
- Know'st thou me yet?
- I know thee not.
Thy name?
My name is Caius Martius who hath done to thee, particularly, and to all the Volsces great hurt and mischief.
Thereto witness may my surname Coriolanus.
Only that name remains.
The cruelty and envy of the people who have all forsook me hath devoured the rest, and suffered me by the voice of slaves to be whooped out of Rome.
Now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if I had feared death, of all men in the world
I would have avoided thee.
But, in mere spite, to be full quit of those, my banishers, stand I before thee here.
I will fight against my cankered country with the spleen of all the under fiends.
But if thou dares not this, then I present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice, which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since I have ever followed thee with hate, and cannot live but to thy shame
unless it be to do thee service.
O Martius...
Martius...
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
Let me twine mine arms about that body.
Know thou I loved the maid I married, never man sighed truer breath.
But that I see thee here, thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when I first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold.
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee, thou hast beat me out 12 several times.
and I have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.
Worthy Martius, had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that thou art thence banished, we would muster all from 12 to 70, and, pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, like a bold flood, overbear it.
Come, go in, and take our friendly senators by the hands.
You bless me, gods.
Therefore, most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges, take the one half of my commission.
And set down as best thou art experienced, since thou knows thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of Rome, or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them, ere destroy.
- Is this Menenius?
- O, 'tis he, 'tis he.
O, he's grown most kind of late.
- Hail, sir.
- Hail to you both.
Your Coriolanus is not much missed, but with his friends.
All's well, and might have been much better
- if he could have temporized.
- Where is he, hear you?
I hear nothing.
His mother and his wife hear nothing from him.
Caius Martius was a worthy officer in the war, but insolent, overcome with pride, ambitious past all thinking, self-loving...
I think not so.
And Rome sits safe and still without him.
- Shh!
- Shh!
There are reports the Volsces, with two several powers, are entered in the Roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war, destroy what lies before them.
- Shh!
- 'Tis Aufidius, who, hearing of our Martius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns into the world again.
Come, what talk you of Martius?
It cannot be the Volsces dare break with us.
Cannot be?
We have record that it can.
The nobles in great earnestness are going all to the Senate House.
Some news is coming that turns their countenances.
Yes, the first report is seconded, and more more fearful is delivered.
Martius has joined with Aufidius.
He leads a power against Rome, and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngest and oldest thing.
A fearful army, led by Caius Martius, associated with Aufidius, rages upon our territories, and have already overborne their way, consumed with fire, and took what lay before them.
Martius has joined with the Volscians.
He is their god.
He leads them like boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies.
Do they still fly to the Roman?
I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but your soldiers use him as the grace before meat, their talk at table, and their thanks at end.
And you are darkened in this action, sir.
He bears himself more proud, even to my person, than I thought he would when first I did embrace him.
Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
I think he'll be to Rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature.
Whether it was pride, whether defect of judgment or whether nature, not to be other than one thing, made him feared, so hated, and so banished so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time.
One fire drives out one fire one nail, one nail.
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
When, Caius,
Rome is thine, thou art poorest of all then shortly art thou mine.
No, I'll not go.
- Good Menenius...
- Go, you that banished him.
A mile before his tent, fall down, and kneel the way into his mercy.
He would not seem to know me.
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops that we have bled together.
"Coriolanus" he would not answer to, forbad all names.
He was a kind of nothing.
Titleless.
Till he had forged himself a name in the fire of burning Rome.
If you refuse your aid in this...
If you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman.
- No, I'll not meddle.
- Pray you, go to him.
- What should I do?
- Only make trial what your love can do for Rome towards Martius.
Well, and say "Martius return me, as Titus is returned, unhurt."
What then?
Yet your good will must have that thanks from Rome.
You know the very road into his kindness, and cannot lose your way.
I'll undertake it.
I think he'll hear me.
- He'll never hear him.
- No?
I tell you, he does sit in gold his eye, red, as it would burn Rome.
The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old friend Menenius does.
O Martius, Martius.
Thou art preparing fire for us.
Look thee there's water to quench it.
I was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured none but myself could move thee,
I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome.
Away.
How?
Away?
Wife... mother... child...
I know not.
My affairs are servanted to others.
- Sir...
- Therefore be gone.
Another word, Menenius, I will not hear thee speak.
This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
He has wings.
He's more than a creeping thing.
There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.
My lord and husband.
These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
The sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so.
Best of my flesh, forgive my tyranny, but do not say for that "Forgive our Romans."
O, a kiss long as my exile sweet as my revenge.
Ye gods, I prate, and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted.
Sink, my knee, in the earth.
Stand up, blest.
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
- I kneel before thee.
- What's this?
Your knees to me?
To your corrected son?
Thou art my warrior.
I helped to frame thee.
This is a poor epitome of yours, which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself.
The god of soldiers, inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou may'st prove to shame, invulnerable.
Your knee, sir.
Even he, your wife, this lady and myself,
- are suitors to you.
- I beseech you, peace.
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate again with Rome's mechanics.
Tell me not wherein I seem unnatural.
Desire not to allay my rages and revenges with your colder reasons.
No more, no more.
You have said you will not grant us anything, for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already.
Yet we will ask, that if you fail in our request, the blame may hang upon your hardness.
Therefore hear us.
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.
For we'll hear naught from Rome in private.
Your request?
Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment and state of bodies would betray what life we have led since thy exile.
Think with thyself.
How more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother, wife, and child
to see the son, the husband and the father tearing his country's bowels out.
And we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish, which side should win.
For either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles through our streets, or else, triumphantly, tread on thy country's ruin, and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children's blood.
For myself... son I purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine.
If I cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end to one, thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread on thy mother's womb that brought thee to this world.
Aye, and mine, that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time.
You shall not tread on me.
I'll run away till I'm bigger but then I'll fight!
- I have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.
If it were so that our request did tend to save the Romans, thereby to destroy the Volsces whom you serve, thou might'st condemn us as poisonous of your honor.
No.
Our suit is that you reconcile them.
So that the Voices may say "This mercy we have showed,"
the Romans, "This we've received,"
and each on either side give the all-hail to thee and cry,
"Be blest for making up this peace!"
Speak to me, son.
Why dost not speak?
Speak you, daughter.
He cares not for your weeping.
Speak thou, boy.
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons.
There's no man in the world more bound to his mother, yet here he lets me prate like one in the stocks!
Thou hast never, in thy life, shown thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen, has clucked thee to the wars and safely home loaded with honor.
Say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee, that thou restrains from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs.
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees!
Down!
This is the last.
An end.
So we will home to Rome, and die among our neighbors.
Nay.
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot tell what he would have yet kneels and holds up hands for fellowship.
Does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny it.
Come, let us go.
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother!
His wife is in Corioles and his child like him by chance.
Yet give us our dispatch I am hushed until our city be afire, and then I'll speak a little.
O Mother...
Mother...
What have you done?
Behold the heavens do ope the gods look down and this unnatural scene they laugh at.
O my mother!
Mother!
O!
You have won a happy victory to Rome.
But for your son, believe it.
O believe it.
Most... dangerously you have prevailed with him.
If not most mortal to him.
But let it come.
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars, I'll frame convenient peace.
Now, good Aufidius, were you in my stead, would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less?
Aufidius?
I was moved withal.
I dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.
But, good sir, what peace you'll make, advise me.
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
We have all great cause to give great thanks.
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
How is it with our general?
As with a man by his own charity slain.
Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst 'twixt you there's difference, but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all.
I know it.
And my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction.
I raised him, and I pawned mine honor for his truth, who, being so heightened, he watered his new plants with dews of flattery, seducing so my friends.
At the last, I seemed his follower, not partner, and he waged me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary.
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.
And, in the last, when he had carried Rome and that we looked for no less spoil than glory...
There was it!
For which my sinews shall be stretched upon him.
At a few drops of women's rheum, which are as cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor of our great action.
Therefore shall he die and I'll renew me in his fall.
Say no more.
I am returned your soldier, no more infected with my country's love than when I parted hence, but still subsisting under your great command.
We have made peace with no less honor to the Volscians than shame to the Romans.
Tell the traitor, in the highest degree
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor?
How now?
Aye, traitor, Martius.
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.
Caius Martius.
Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?
Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome.
I say "your city," for his wife and mother.
Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk.
Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory.
Hear'st thou, Mars?
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it.
"Boy"?
O slave.
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!
Men and lads, stain all your edges on me!
"Boy"?
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there that, like an eagle in a dovecote,
I fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
Alone I did it.
"Boy."
Let him die for it.

07
- Ambush
The Dofus is on an island from the Crimson Claws Archipelago.
Awesome!
That's him, that's Yugo.
He's straight-out talking with the princess and the king.
I promise we'll be as fast as possible.
The archipelago is at the other end of the World, but with a few zaaps, that should be quick.
By the way, could you remind me why you're the one setting off in search for adventure and I'm the one staying here, playing babysitters?
Because you're the only one powerful enough to contain that little fury, Master Adamaï.
What a firey temper!
Dad, stop stirring him up.
You do know what he's capable of.
Yugo,
I'm really too old to raise a child.
Seriously I...
It's amazing how you two look alike.
Okay then...
I'll take care of him 'till you're back.
Count on me to help you Alibert.
It'll take at least two of us.
Oh, my!
Good ol' Grougal, he's always been as impulsive as he's jealous.
I regret we can't all go together.
It will feel strange to live this adventure without you, Amalia.
Really, don't worry about me, Yugo.
Being a princess is already a real adventure.
Oh, please, don't get worked up about it.
Amalia...
Don't worry Yugo, I'm sure she'll get over it soon.
So, this is it?
It's official between you two?
-Yeah!
And then I told him I was the strongest.
Yeah, you could say so.
Honestly what do you see in him, Evangelyne?
Look at him, he's as thick as two short planks!
This red, is it natural?
And that musculature...
You have to know Grovy, to have fought by his side, and to have seen him put his life at risk for his friends.
If you have had this chance Armand, you too would know how exceptional he is.
Here, I found this for you.
Mint candies!
For your mouth problems...
Thanks...
Sir Sadlygrove, for your thoughtfulness.
And good luck for your adventure.
Eva...
Do you wanna die, Grovy?
!
Such a handsome young man, that would be a shame.
Is everybody ready?
But...
Where's Amalia?
You know Amalia never liked goodbyes.
That's true, my king.
Oh!
And what about Ruel?
Over there.
The most important thing, guys, is to hold the gobball tight.
Ruel!
We're leaving!
Alright, I gotta go.
Practice, it's the secret to success.
But...
My havenbag!
Thank you Junior.
Well, well, well!
Here we go for a new adventure!
Don't pull such a face, dad.
I'll be back before you can say "gobball stew".
Be careful.
Ruel?
Yeah, don't worry!
I'll watch over him.
You know you can count on me.
And you, try to do as good with your youngest.
My, that's quite a change from the Sadida Kingdom.
It's a bit less...
Err...
Verdant?
Yes, it's less... verdant.
Are you confident with your plan, Evangelyne?
Absolutely confident, my dear Yugo.
Two more minutes and you'll understand why.
Give me Grufon please.
Come here guys, I'll explain it to you.
Grufon, show me the route to the Crimson Claws.
No problem, boss!
Here's our route.
To spare Grovy the boat as much as we can, we'll alternate between zaaps and walking.
Our first stage will be the cable-car from the Money-Grubber's Pass.
Ah, the cable-car from the Money-Grubber's Pass...
That will bring back some childhood memories.
Believe it or not, my grandmother happens to be the one who ran it for years.
She sure earned a lot of money.
I wonder who took it over after her death.
My goal is to only take to the sea here, in the little harbor of Mageville, and from there, get to the Crimson Claws Archipelago.
Are you okay with this?
Very well, we can let Amalia out, then.
What?
!
Hey!
But...
My bag!
It's...
It's Amalia!
Seriously, you guys!
Not a single one of you invited me to go adventuring again.
And you!
You still haven't cleaned your havenbag.
Az and your phorror are doing their business everywhere!
Luckily as girls, we know how to help one another!
It's great you decided to come, Amalia.
Without you it wouldn't have been the same.
But, the king and the prince will be furious, won't they?
It's the second time you've pulled that trick on them.
Nah!
We'll be back in 4 or 5 days.
They won't even have time to notice I left.
Did you take care of everything?
Yes indeed.
We filled Ruel's havenbag with food, my king.
And with clothes fitting every situation.
We wouldn't want the princess to catch a bad cold, but...
I'm surprised you let her go so easily.
She's the spitting image of her mother, as adventurous as she is stubborn.
That's where granny ran her business.
She earned quite a lot of Kamas.
She even became the richest in the family.
Well, I mean, the least broke...
I remember when I was a kid, she was always there, sitting on her little stool, counting her Kamas.
By Enutrof...
It's like I'm seeing her again.
I've never known your grandmother, Ruel, but it's like I'm seeing her again too.
What are you saying?
Mou...
Moumoune?
!
Well, if it isn't little Ruel...
Moumoune!
Is...
Is that really you?
Depends...
Do you need money?
That's the proof she's really part of Ruel's family.
But that's impossible.
All the family thinks you've been dead for years.
Oh sure, I bet they mourned me, those lazybones!
Considering how much I earned for the family...
Thou shalt not touch the machine before paying!
So, kid, to what do I owe the pleasure?
Err, I...
We wanted to...
We must reach the Crimson Claws, we wanted to borrow your cable-car.
Wait a minute, miss!
Who taught you to speak that way?
!
Among the Strouds we don't really like the word "borrow".
We prefer...
"Rent" for instance.
She's your grandmother.
She's not really going to make us pay for the ride, is she?
Also...
Have you seen what shape that thing is in?
Are you really gonna get on that thing?
I admit, it's not really reassuring...
Huh?
Why?
This stuff looks solid.
Excellent!
Quiet, Orifan!
Adventure almost stopped earlier than expected for you my little lop.
Are you kidding me?
I was about to skewer him like a tofu-
And how much is the crossing, lovely little granny?
Well, there are several options.
The cheap option, for the brokes, the skinflints and the Enutrofs:
300 Kamas per person.
What?
!
But it's never been so expensive!
You know what it is...
Inflation, equipment maintenance, stuff like that...
Equipment maintenance?
But Moumoune, that's ten times more expensive than before!
You're not really going to make me pay such a sum?
!
It...
It could kill me...
You've always been a really spoiled kid, Ruel.
It's time you behave like a responsible adult.
A really spoiled kid?
Moumoune!
Can you buy me a shovel?
No!
Can I have an ice cream, Moumoune?
No!
It causes stomach aches.
Three peas at once?
It's great Moumoune!
Thank you!
Happy birthday kiddo.
It's hopeless guys...
She's more stubborn than a lousy piglet.
Right, let's go.
Where to?
I can see where you're going with this, old skinflint.
If we don't take that cable-car, we're good for 15 more days of walking.
Oh, 15 days is not that long.
Honestly, you'll never change!
You're really irritating!
By the way, you irritate me so much that I'll pay for everyone except for you.
Yeah, fine...
Not everyone was lucky enough to be born with a silver shovel in their mouth.
Good, let's go friends.
It's prettier than it looks from the outside.
It's red, like my hair.
Cool!
Hey, hey, hey!
This is first class, kid.
It's 500 Kamas!
Moumoune!
Orifan just sat on the first class seat!
My little Ruel, you know I hate bootlickers!
Alright!
When you gotta go...
Say, Mrs Moumoune...
You're not really the one who's gonna pedal?
Of course I am!
It's part of my job, my dear.
Ruel, that's your grandmother we're talking about.
Yeah, but she wants to make me pay.
So what?
Family is more important than money, isn't it?
Your granny's at least 200 years old.
She's past the age for that.
If I pedal instead of you, will you make me a discount on the crossing, Moumoune?
In your dreams!
Fine, I'll take care of it...
Let me do it granny, you're too old for this.
That's my good boy!
You've always been Kama-hearted.
Your mother would be proud of you if she saw you.
Come on Ruel!
Show us what you have in your legs.
But it's...
It's imp...
It's impossible.
You know, little Ruel has always been the weakest of the family.
Very resourceful, but nothing in his legs...
Are you okay Ruel?
G-gre-great...
Here we go!
Dear customers, the weather's clear and the opposite wind won't slow down the crossing.
Scheduled travel time is 30 minutes.
Enjoy the scenery view.
This is great!
Yeah...
-That's beautiful.
At 300 Kamas a crossing, it better be!
They were the last straw!
I have a feeling of deja vu.
Let's hope they're less aggressive than the Black Raven.
Alone he gave us a hard time.
And now there are 5 of them!
Great!
That's one each.
Stay calm, I'll take care of everything.
Hello to you, noble travelers!
Riglesse!
I have an agreement with your boss!
The boss is dead my dear little old lady.
The boss is dead!
Long live the new boss!
Thank you guys, hold your horses, enough is enough.
But let's get back to the point.
I know you had an agreement with the old boss...
The boss is dead!
Long live the new boss!
Okay, okay, we've heard!
He died a week ago, are you gonna keep repeating that forever?
!
Your previous agreement is therefore worthless, my dear little Mrs Old-Lady.
And what do you want?
What do I want?
Everything!
I want everything!
Your cable-car, the Kamas you amassed for years, and your passengers' pretty equipment.
That will cost you more than three menaces!
Let them finish, Grovy!
It's too dangerous to fight here.
Oh...
A blonde with a brain, how uncommon...
You will kindly give us everything, and we will stay friends.
So, what do you think?
What do I think, you boor?
You're gonna find that out right now!
Wha-?
!
But...
What's that thing?
I was wondering exactly the same thing.
That thing, dear friends... is my grandmother!
And you are making her do things she's too old for.
I hope you're ready to receive Moumoune's famous spankings!
They're in for it now!
They deserve a good whacking!
I'll show you blonde!
What do we do?
Go back at your moms!
You'll regret humiliating us that way!
Guys!
Let's cut the rope!
Let the sharks take care of them at the bottom of the ocean.
We'll grab their stuff later.
Boss!
Yes, boss!
Isn't it a bit cruel?
Well, I'm just saying...
Let's go my uglies!
We have to stop them!
But what can we do from here?
Come on!
We'll help Moumoune on the roof.
You'll see...
She's gonna prepare a little surprise.
I'm sure.
Cowards!
But don't think this cable-car is an ordinary cable-car.
See for yourselves!
Come load the machine-gun!
Take that you feathered crooks!
Grovy!
Hold on!
Here I come!
Get off my mount!
...and another one!
I hit the bull's eye!
That granny must have gone through quite a few battles.
They're weakened, we can pick them off now.
I won't let myself be intimidated by your magic tricks!
I'll show you why I'm a real boss!
I'll take care of it.
You can't hold a candle to the Black Raven!
Really?
Let's see which one of us will let go first!
Where are they?
Where are they?
!
Where are they hiding?
Those wimps!
Okay, okay, you won!
Too late, we're going all the way!
Murderer!
Yugo?
Too easy!
Hey, guys!
Where are they?
Where are you, you cowards?
!
Show yourselves if you dare!
C'mon!
Where are you?
This way!
C'mon!
-Hey Moumoune, it's over!
Where are you?
Where are they?
Aww, I was having fun!
-It's over, Moumoune.
Thanks for everything Moumoune.
Ruel is lucky to have a grandmother like you.
You're cute kiddo.
Obviously you didn't spend your childhood with her...
Also, about the crossing's price...
Yeah?
We just saved your cable-car, maybe you'd care to give us a refund?
Give us a discount?
A credit for next time?
You're the best, Moumoune!
I'm proud to be your grandson.
Anyway, thanks to our bandit friends, we will save a lot of time on the road.
Hey, come on nice phorror...
Now that's a good granny's phorror.
He will untie us.
Come on nice phorror, eat the rope.
Come on!
Come on, eat it.
Oh no!
Come back!
Many years ago in Thailand there is a temple that was called the temple of the Golden Buddha.
And there was a huge statue of the Golden Buddha.
And word came to his village where the monastery was that an army from neighboring country was about to invade.
And they've got the brilliant scheme to cover the Golden Buddha which is quite large with mud and concrete so better look basicly like a stone Buddha and the army would perceive no value in it.
Sure enough this army rolled in with its ... arms and weapons and as they passed by the monastery the y saw nothing but a big stone Buddha and they have no reason to plunder it Well years went by because the army continued to occupy
until there was a time in the monestary and the village when no one remembered that the Buddha was golden until one day a young monk was sitting on the Buddha meditating on his knee and as he got up a little piece of concrete
happened to crack off and he saw something shiny.
He realized there was gold under there and so he ran to his fellow monks and said "The Buddha is golden, the Buddha is golden", and they all came out and realized he is telling the truth
they took the pics and harass.
And eventually they unearthed the Golden Buddha.
So what's a metaphor here?
The metaphor is that each of us is golden by nature were born golden we were born high, we were born knowing, were born connected to our bliss, were born knowing truth, we were born knowing everything that every great spiritual master has ever said,
we were one with the Christ, the Buddha, everyone but then we went to school and they said you had to be just like this, and they said these are sweat boys and sweat girls, white people and black people and on and on and on,
and so we developed the casing of stone over the Buddha to ... at a young age, maybe four or five six or seven, we believe that we are the stone Buddha, not the Golden one.
And then, something comes along that cracks that casing, maybe it's an injury, a divorce, financial setbacks, our governmental change, something that really scares us and bugs us (?
HÍ) and knocks off a piece of our armour, and all in that moment that the armour is being knocked off, they get a look inside and see the golden.
Let me tell you friend, that the moment you see that gold the armour and the concrete will never satisfy you again.
At that point you truly enter to the true heroe's adventure an all you want to do for the rest of your life is pick away the stone because the gold is so much more fun.
Finding Joe
- A film by Patrick Takaya Solomon (suggested subtitle instead of this for SEO purposes):
The Hero's Journey Movie
- Joseph Campbell Who is Joseph Campbell and why should we care?
(Robert Walter
- President:
Joseph Campbell Foundation)
A topic that comes up a lot.
Joseph Campbell was one of the leading mythology experts of all time
Joseph Campbell is a philosopher.
The man who had this ability to see the truth in a world where we've lost sight of that in many ways. and actually started by studying
Native American mythology.
He fell in love with it when he was a kid.
This was his bliss.
He went on studying the aboriginal cultures he studied Greek mythology, he studied Arthurian legend,
He dissected and really diagrammed all of our stories.
He compared philosophies, mythic stories of the whole world.
All myths, all movies all novels, all romances
He found this one story within (Chungling Al Huang, Founder-President:
Living Tao Foundation / Tai Ji Master) all the stories, that we can relate to, no matter where you come from.
He recognized that in spite of all the different stories we seem to be telling, there is really only one.
And He called it the Hero's Journey.
There must have been thousands and thousands of hero's stories (Gay Hendricks Ph.D., best selling author, The Hendricks Institute) from every culture, but until Joseph Campbell came along certainly I never realized how they all kind of fit together and how they were
basically the same story.
I was religion major in college.
I was taking my final exam.
(Rashida Jones
- Actress/Screenwriter)
I had a moment where I've just gobsmacked.
It was just like holy crap, it's all the same thing.
I mean it is really all the same thing.
The hero's journey is a pattern.
You can almost think of it as an algorythm, that has three basic parts:
separation, initiation and return.
Separation: you are in one kind of a reality in one kind of a place and you are separated from it.
Initiation: you're put into another place, where you are in some manner initiated.
Return: you come back. A SIMPLE VERSION OF THE HERO'S JOURNEY is, someone starting out in their normal protected world (Catherine Hardwicke, Director of "Twilight")
and then getting a call to adventure.A call to adventure.
There's a vision, there's a quest.
(Deepak Chopra M.D.)
It's the story of the hero enduring some trials, (David L. Miller Ph.D.)
various trials and ordeals, meeting different obstacles along the way.
People that hurt you.
People that help you.
Doors will open as Campbell would say for you where there are no doors for others.
Dragons will appear that are your your dragons alone.
you get to like ?
/meet?
the innermost cave where you're really challenged, like the greatest crisis, in which you find your true self.
The achievement, the glory.
But then that's not the end of it, that he has to bring that back to the community, there's a return to tell the story.
That is a heroic journey.
Separation, initiation, return.
All of the adventures of the human story are in there.
All the heroes, all villains, all the gods and goddesses and all of the nights and of all the fantastic creatures we can conjure up in animation, they're all in there,
Because they're all in here in the heart, because they're all in here in the head.
This is where they come from.
If you look at some of the greatest pieces of literature (Robin Sharma, best selling author, Sharma Leadership International) the greatest works of philosophy, they all have what
Joseph Campbell called The Hero's Journey.
And if you look with a piercing eye you can recognize his outline in just about any move your story you would read.
Star Wars, The Matrix, Harry Potter.
Wizard of Oz: that's a classic story of the hero's journey.
You first see Dorothy and our natural environment and just like out here in regular life a person is operating in their natural environment every day and living in their house and that kind of thing.
And then something happens to shake that world up,
And you go on a journey in which you have to face certain tests and challenges Storytelling is typically about people learning something.
You go to a place which is dark and mysterious, you are faced with yourself there is a relationship between facing fear and this kind of soul game.
You acquire a quality, a hidden strength, a value, moments where somebody is tested somebody moves to a place where it feels like a crisis point and then they are restored, redeemed, made better through that trial.
And we call them heros.
If all of these stories boiled down into one map, ?
we can use that map, because all human beings are the same ?
whether they're going through a war like World War II or going to a war inside ?
it's basically the same kind of process. ?
In other words we're not separate from the characters we see in our movies and our novels, they are us, this one journey.
The whole idea of the hero's journey is a journey of life, clear patterns to guide you through. ]]]
You're born, you have a childhood, you have adolescence and you try to find the place for you to become an adult. ]]]
and you go through adventures, you struggle with the inner conflicts and finally you become a hero: you slay the dragons, you succeed in conquering all the demons and use them (?
) to step over threshold ]]] and finally you have arrived.
We're all born, we die but within this short span we have to have some meaning, some reason for this existence. ]]]
Doesn't have to be higher mighty and fantastic ]]
You can have a very simple life and still go through the very similar pattern We've grown up watching great heros' journey movie, it's that impulse within us that seed of potential that wants to be actualized.
It's being talked to during those movies and being whispered to: ]]]
"It's time for you to do that!"
That's the story here, that's what it's all about.
It is a wonderful narrative, iconography for how to live life.
The idea that "Try hard, you get", the little engine that "I could, I think I can,
I think can, I think I think I can, I CAN!"
This idea that we really can do better, be better that our greatest selves are still hidden and that the future is the prospect of coming to terms with that self.
Dorothy had to confront her inner barriers and so the journey she went on was not just a journey to find out how to deal with the Wicked Witch of the West, ]]] it was how to deal with her own inner resources , how to claim her own inner resources ]]]
and at the end of the movie how did she get back home?
Well, she cicked her heels together, so she had it all the time, the ability to get back home but it didn't get mobilized for her until she went through all of those challenges and was able to kind of test herself.
It's kind of the ordinary moving into the extraordinary.
Its going through the dark to come out to the light.
Going from an unsatisfying life to a satisfying life by pushing through the scariest things you can imagine.
"The funcion of mythological symbols is to give you a sense of Aha!
Yes.
I know what it is, it's myself"
- Joseph Campbell The most important thing that the myths teach us is to go beyond what we perceive as the limits of our possibility.
So mythology needs to be seen for what it is which is: ]]]
which is a metaphor for our human existence.
It's not a history lesson.
It's a metaphor for life and for universal experiences.
Lot of people reading myths and they say it refers to something historical:
the creation of the world or something like.
But Joe didn't think that.
He thought that it's really a narrative about the psyche.
What Jung called the self.
The problem is that many of us are metaphorically impaired.
We don't realize that this thing that they're talking about is actually a metaphor for a transformation process.
Just kind of like the Holy Grail, where it's not the thing, ]]]] it's not the actual concrete Grail, it's an intangible thing, that the Holy Grail is a metaphor for that in tangible (?
) feeling.
And so if you look at a book and it says you will go to heaven, and you don't realize that they're talking about heaven on Earth, heaven in our bodies, heaven right now, in the now, ]]]
you might fall into a trance of thinking that you're literally gonna go some place else if you follow the rules.
Having been brought up in a mythical culture,
I was very familiar with the different motives, and themes that were encapsulated in say a mythical being.
Whether it was the Lord Shiva or Ganesh, or a goddess, just thinking the name of that person, the whole story was evoked.
Carl Jung called these archetypes.
Archetypes of primordial, encapsulated stories or mythologies and they are there in this form of a seed in consciousness.
When you plant that seed in consciousness, that archetypal seed, that mythical journey, in there the seed starts to sprout and as it sprouts, the patterning forces create situation, circumstances, events and relationships for the unfolding of the story.
It's better to have a story to look through life ]]] than an explanation. ]]]
The reason for that is the story is richer.
I say select two or three heros and heroins either in mythology or religion or history and then ask these mythical beings to incarnate through you.
And then don't be surprised when you see situations ,circumstances, coincidences, synchronicities, relationships sure suddenly show up, that actually are part of the story that you have been seeking to express.
Once upon a time in the forest there was this little tiger cub amongst the flock sheep.
And he ate grass, and he wondered around with the sheep, and when he tried to say anything all that came out was a certain a little meow.
Not much of a roar.
And one day through the forest comes a large male tiger And he is just about to pounce on the sheep when he sees this tiger cub.
He says, what are you doing here?
And the tiger cub goes, beeee.
He picks the tiger cub up by the s?
of the neck, and carries him over to pond and he puts his face over and he says: ]]]
"Look, see that face?
]]]
You're not a sheep, you're a tiger!" ]]]
The male tiger says, okay, we need to do something.
He slays a sheep and he grabs a big runk ?
of meet, and he shoves it into the little tiger's mouth.
And the little tiger gagged on it as all do on the truth. ]]]
But it went down. ]]]
And he got a little bit of energy, and pretty soon, ]]] he had a bigger tiger roar.
And eventually he had a full Tiger roar and he went off with the male tiger.
I think the moral here is self-evident:
if you're a tiger living among sheep you' rea a really poor specimen of a tiger .
And we are all Tigers living among sheep.
We are all individuals with a self that we don't even begin to understand and.
And unfortunately, when you can open the metaphor out, the food we get from the culture around us is maybe food for sheep.
It's not food for Tigers. "Your life is the fruit of your own doing.
You have no one to blame but yourself"
- Joseph Campbell
We have to catch at least the spark of what your life is going to be or you may spend those dreary decades in corporate America, climbing the ladder only to discover its against the wrong wall.
You get to the top, who cares?
If this path of the hero's journey is fairly simple in design, why then isn't it that everybody is a living it? Well the answer is that most people on the planet live under a kind of a
mass hypnosis.
There's a tremendous pressure even in the media on really keeping people in their place in the sense of keeping them happy, tranced out consumers.
It's a trance of comfort, it's a trance of not sticking your hand up above the crowd very much.
That keeps the enterprise going.
Most people think it's a luxury and a great privilege to stay home and look at their 800 inch television you're just spaced out, not developoing.
We're stimulated by some images, by some loud noise.
It's about collecting things and stuff, and making a lot of money and doing a lot of things and it's impossible to enjoy that because you end up on that treadmill and you can't get off.
And so most people, unfortunately, because they are so victimized by the environment, they have no time to think, or be themselves, they become bundles of conditioned reflexes and nerves that are constantly being triggered by people and circumstance,
into very predictable outcomes and predictable patterns of behavior, ]]] there's no creativity That's the trance, that's the wasteland, where we're just guided toward this weird sense of what's real on our lives,
and those ideas that are imposed on us from the outside about what we should and should not do.
It usually starts out with something like you shouldn't talk to that person because they're from a different tribe, you certainly shouldn't marry that person ]]] you should go to this school, you should have a certain type of car , you should live in a certain type of house,
you should have a certain number of kids by this type age, should should should should should. ]]]
What I experienced in my own life was I gotta have the degree from this university, I gotta have this advanced degree from this
University preferably either a law degree or a medical degree or something to that effect some letters after my name which would say that I have a stamp of credibility
I can go out and make my six figures in society, ?
kind of deem me worthy ]]]
I have countless examples of young people who go to college because they are expected to go to college and they study biology because ]]] since the time they were six they were supposed to be a doctor. ]]]
It's very difficult for a person who was brought up in this environment of instant gratification with the media and with advertising with all the promises of instant gratification by buying something, for example, or having a certain
level of afluence that you lose contact with this mythical domain which is actually part of your soul.
It's there in everyone.
It's their passion, it's their bliss, it's their unique skills.
it's their unique good ways of expressing themselves, is their soul / song ?
, which if they think, ]]] they could do anything.
If you look at every heroic journey, the hero has been confronted with the fact that the world that they thought was reality was nothing more than illusion.
I go back to The Matrix... what was the matrix?
It was just this big illusion, it was the dominant values and beliefs that the world had put around this guy Neo, the seeker on the hero's journey, and what did he do?
He felt this longing to go beyond the illusion, to go beyond the matrix,
So he took the red pill, and he woke up to reality.
And what was reality?
Reality was he was full of potential. "The call to adventure signifies that destiny has summoned the hero..."
- Joseph Campbell Separation begins with what we call "The call to adventure".
Campbell tells us there's literally almost a phone ringing. ]]]
It's like the universe, the divine, god, whatever you want to call it, literally dialing you up and ringing ]]] and giving you a call asking you to step out into what is your journey. ]]]
Something breaks into the ?
reality and makes it impossible for you to continue.
Well, you can hang up the phone, you can run away.
But he'll ?
keep coming back, it will keep coming back until you finally answer the call.
If you're not paying attention, the wake up calls come in the form of a sledge hammer.
You know if you're paying attention, they might come in a tical ?
feather.
So we don't always get the call as a choir of angels with trumpets singing ?
to his?
beautifully warm sunny morning.
In Star Wars, Luke comes back as his house has been burnt down.
He's gotta go.
Often times it comes in ?
the depth of our despair in losing a job, getting fired, getting divorced, having your house foreclosed on...
These things that you would never want to have happen are ?
often the exact things we need to catapult us, to catalyse us into that next version of ourselves. ]]]
Bad things happen to good people and when that happens to them they typically are thrown for a loop ?
because they frequently have felt everything's going along, I'm doing everything right, what happened.. Well, you know, the universe has just up ended you and it does do that.
The Chinese symbol for crises is too symbols.
The first one is danger and the second one immediately is opportunity.
So crisis both enjoy an opportunity
This idea that if one storyline collapses that that's the end of the movie is not true in human life and never was true in human life.
I know people who have prospered in the most extraordinary way in the worst type of adversity, but actually it revealed something to them about themselves that they didn't know and that became the new journey they took.
Let me put this into really practical hundred-pound terms because if the camera had been pointed at me when I was 24 years old what it would have seen was a person who weighed
320 pounds you would have seen me puffing on two or three packs of Marlboros a day, a relationship that I didn't want to be in and I had a job I hated, everything was wrong in my life and so
those are ripe moment for a wake-up call in life.
You know, if you haven't been paying attention enough so that you end up with a job you hate, a relationship you don't want to be in, a a body you don't like, and you're addicted to a bunch of things, you're ripe
for a sledgehammer blow from the universe and I got it.
You step over a threshold, meaning you move from one world into another, sometimes you're shoved from one world into the other.
I went out for a walk and I stepped on the ice on the road and my feet shot out from under me and I smacked my back of my head on the ground, frozen ground, and it knocked me out just enough I wasn't
completely unconscious but I had a vision while I was semi-knocked out, I could see down through all the layers of myself to this pure consciousness inside and I could see how all the fat I had was organized around a whole ]]]
bunch of feelings I didn't want to let myself feel, ]]] like sadness from childhood ]]] and lot of old grief in my family and anger and things like that and I realized that the fat was there to keep me from
feeling those feelings and so as I began to come back to normal consciousness
I made a vow that I was gonna change my life so that I could live in that state of pure consciousness instead of having to have all of that armour around me.
Once you make the decisions that Joseph Campbell is talking about, about really hearing the call and being willing to take on the challenges of that new awakened life, once you do that you begin to feel a power ]]]
that it's like nothing else I have ever experienced.
And I think a lot of us are just plain very afraid of that. ?
]]] I tend to think that people wake up to the fact ]]] that they're the hero of their own life when they get tired of being the victim of their own life.
At the point that you say "Enough", "I know", "I don't want to listen to my parents anymore" "I have had it with my boss", "I'm really having problems perhaps
the sermon I'm being taught", you can either surrender to victimhood and a lot of people do, ]]] or you can surrender to a fundamentalism: you can basically give your responsibility to someone else and say "Tell me what to do and I'll do it"
or you can say "I have a choice here and I'm responsible"
Now, what does it mean to be the hero of your own life?
It means to be responsible for your own adventure.
Campbell talks about metaphorical death , where something dies ]]] so the something can live and in every hero's journey there is ]]] some death- moment where some old has to go on some new has to stay.
He quotes Nietzsche and he says that "The snake that cannot shed its skin must parish the" When death is a motif in a myth it doesn't refer necessarily to what happens at the end of one's biological
and physical existence.
It's an indication that change has taken place.
I went through that process when I stop ped being [Joseph Marshall III, best selling author] a travel administrator and started becoming a writer
I put that aspect of myself away, it was valuable and I learned a lot and I draw on it, but it enabled me to go on. ]]]
No death, no life.
No death, no transformation.
No death, no change.
Than I said, okay, I don't want that anymore, I want this, put that away made myself into something else.
In essence, resurrected into being a writer.
The whole key to a blessing death is recognizing that it is just the death of one old form that has played itself out and has no use anymore, which always, as the Phoenix, rises and gives way to some new form that has new intrinsic meaning and makes your life even bigger and better.
You want have new birth, new revelations new insight into life as you grow as a human being.
You will learn to keep dying. "We must be willing to get rid of the life we've planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us"
- Joseph Campbell
I think its tricky to afford a proof.
I think there are proofs in our lives
I think the proofs exist in our ability to transcend the worst things that have happened to us.
My proof is I was abused as a little boy not something I chat about typically but in this context, it was the worst thing ever.
It went on for a very long time and... It's who I am, in part, because I had to face that,
Because I had to wrestle with that, because I had to accept that and acknowledge that and forgive and all the terribly difficult things that come with that.
I had to tell my parents... you know it's this... and by the way it's one of the things that you work with for the rest of your life.
But from that most difficult thing also came a kind of understanding
I get high marks on compassion.
I wouldn't wish it on anybody...
But it is part of what made me me.
So the truth is it's not what happens to us, it's what we do with it.
The forest represents the darkness, the unknown, the edge of your world.
And it takes the courage of a hero to go into that forest.
The people in your community don't understand why you want to go into that forest.
In fact, they are pulling you back, asking "Why can't you be happy with what you have here?" But there is this urge that exist within the hero to "Go and explore!"
Joseph often used the Knights of the Round Table.
When they behold golden chalice.
There's a story with King Arthur, and his knights.
After the Knights have seen the grail and decide to go forward on a quest the made a vow.
They decided the knightly thing to do, the noble thing to do as individuals seeking their own inner collective, was to go in to the force at their own points.
Each knight enters the forest where it was darkest and there was no path.
They cannot follow other people.
They have to go in, find their own entry into the dark forest. ]]]
Campbell makes it really clear:
If you go into the forest where there's already a trail, that's the one sure sign that you're not on your path.
Because if you follow somebody else's entry, it's somebody else's path.
That's not going into the forest.
That's not initiation.
You need to find your own path and that kind of comes from that impulse within, to go out and really discover who you are, beyond just the narrow confines of how you have been conditioned what you have been told to do,
and go out and explore for yourself which is true if it is and how you can go out and rock it. "Follow your bliss"
- Joseph Campbell The hero's journey for me is having the courage to look within yourself and say
"What am I here to do?"
"What am I most passionate about in my life?" "What are my greatest gifts?"
"How do I give them to the world?"
Joseph Campbell captured it with the phrase "Follow Your Bliss" "Follow Your Bliss"
- I don't think more profound teachings have ever been given than this one.
"Follow your bliss" means listening to your heart and following your truth.
Just to be specific about the word "bliss", it's not ecstasy, it's not happiness.
There's a serenity in bliss.
I like to talk about your bliss as "the thing you can't not do".
So it's your authentic journey.
I'd heard " follow your bliss" but didn't know where it came from and what's cool is that it's grounded in deep Hindu spirituality and philosophy and it comes from the Upanishads.
There were three launching points into enlightenment:
sat, chit and ananda.
So sat means beingness, chit means consciousness and ananda means bliss or rapture.
Joseph Campbell said to himself "I don't really know what my beingness is, if I'm honest with myself, I don't really know what my consciousness is, but I do know what my bliss is and I can follow my bliss."
And that idea of trusting ourselves and trusting that deep impulse within us to go out and follow our bliss, do what makes us feel most alive:
that's the path, that's the key, that's the essence of the hero's journey. "Follow your bliss" does not mean: get addicted to pleasure.
It's more than just something you wish for.
It doesn't mean escapism, it doesn't mean hedonism.
[Lynne Kaufman, award winning playwright.]
It doesn't mean selfishness.
It doesn't mean listening only to sensory pleasures like having sex with anybody you look at or sticking up a candy store if you want candy... Don't follow what other people think is your bliss!
Don't follow your wallet!
Follow the thing that's presenting itself as your most serene and fulfilling state.
Sometimes it's difficult to let go of that inner resistor and just say "Okay, I accept the possibilities of the present,
I will follow my bliss, I will listen to the call of spirit"
Huhhh, that's a very big deal! Daddy said "What do you wanna do" I said " I need to leave school.
I'm never gonna learn anything.
I'm not going to University.
I want to play drums." I learned to play drums in the attic and [Mick Fleetwood, founder:
Fleetwood Mac]
That's my world and totally naive, like sshhhss...
So Dad sends me off to London.
With the drum kit.
So I went to London, and all of it came true.
Of course, I'm not saying I gotta be rich, I gotta be famous, but I have to be doing something I love to do!
And I have so much passion!
And I didn't even know what that was really all about.
But I do now.
How do we find our bliss?
This is what everybody is asking.
The first thing is, ask yourself, "Where am I passionate about?
What are the things I love doing?
What are the activities, when I engage them, it feels like hours go by in minutes?
That's one big clue about what your bliss is.
What I say is, find out what you most love to do!
And then do more of that thing.
Ask yourself right now:
What was it that made me different as a child?
What set me apart?
What caused me to cry at night on my pillow cause I didn't fit in within the crowd?
That is probably precisely where the door to your bliss is going to open.
Go back and find it.
Let's say you never had to think about money, and you never had to think about dying.
With all the money in the world and all the time in the world how would you express yourself and how would that benefit the ecosystem, the larger web of being?
We have to find a a way of reflecting on those experiences that we've had that engaged us in where we became lost and totally absorbed in them.
So for some people a way to that might be to write these things down, others don't think like that, they don't like to use words all the time, so maybe collect some images or cut some images from magazines,
collect music that's always inspired you.
But some way to bypass that apt of barrier to your own sense of energy.
It's not about being successful, it's not about feeding a family.
Write some bad poetry, do something that gives you that Moment.
You can write in a journal, because writing a journal is a conversation you have with yourself.
You can get to know your gifts, your talents, your weaknesses, your hopes, your dreams, your lessons.
Joseph Campbell always gave the same advice to his students graduating Sarah Lawrence.
Don't do what Daddy/Mommy says!
Because Daddy/Mommy has one interest in mind for you, and that's your security.
And if you bargain away your life for security now, you will never find your bliss! I started skating because my older brother was into it.
[Tony Hawk, professional skateboarder]
And I enjoyed it but
I didn't take it that seriously until the first time into a skatepark and I saw these guys literally flying out of empty swimming pools.
I got so excited that that was even possible as a person to be flying in the air with a skateboard in your hand.
Once I saw what was possible and what you could do with this thing that I would have come to enjoy
I had to keep going, I mean, I just want to fly.
I think is really important to do things that make you happy and I know that sounds very obvious and you know, some reviewed viewers might say, Well, now let's hold hands and sing
Kumbaya but when you look at every great inventor, every great business person, every great scientist, you look at these people who have got to the so called mountain top and almost every single one of them to a person
didn't do it for the money.
They did it because they were chasing their bliss.
If you're following a dream, then you're doing what you love, it's not always going to be a financial success but it will be a personal success because you're still doing this thing that you love doing and that's more important.
I would describe [Laird Hamilton, professional athlete] my discovery of surfing: exposure.
I was just watching surfers, watching what they were doing and what surfing was all about, and the routes that they were taking and the ways they were doing it.
I think I new subconsciously before I knew consciously.
I think I knew that I was gonna do something in surfing, that surfing was gonna be a big part of my life so I wanted to absorb all the information I could.
Just because you don't know what a call on your life is right now, doesn't mean play austrich and stick your head in the sand and say:
"Well just because I don't know then I guess I shouldn't move towards anything."
The very fact that you're looking for you bless means that you're in the process of getting to your bliss.
A part of life and a part of the whole journey is exploration.
Human ?
.......... is often very deep.
You don't know you're there.
And we don't know that we're there often because we don't look for them.
We don't take the journey.
Some people found them.
And many people have not found them.
Because they have not found their talents they think they don't have any.
I believe passionately that we all have deep talents.
Go looking.
Try things you've never done before.
With the things you wish you had done but you never did, well, why didn't you?
Go do it!
Try!
If you always go the same route to work, take some different route.
The people you never speak to go, go and speak to them.
At least, put yourself out there, but don't anticipate what you'll find.
Put yourself in uncomfortable situations at least every seven days.
If at least every seven days people aren't laughing at you or scratching their heads, wondering why you're dreaming so big or doing what you're doing, or have such a fierce resolve to achieving your goalsn,
than I don't think you're stretching enough and ultimately we grow the most when doing the thing that stretches the most.
My personal journey:
I was bright enough I got in the best University but a part of me needed the journey.
I was interested in the West.
So I jumped at the next opportunity to get a scholarship and get on the boat and then I saw my boat to the west.
It took 14 days.
I landed in Portland, Oregon and to be a foreign student.
I stretch ed myself.
I arrived, I knew very little English.
I went to a class called "English for foreign students", I learned English.
And I embraced a Western culture, I stretch my self.
So suddenly I saw a part of me which 757 00:49:08,066 -- 00:49:12,999 I never knew was there.
One of Joe's most beloved quotes about bliss is that "When you follow your bliss, the Universe will open doors where there were only walls."
What a wonderful image and in fact a lot of people's experiences are so like this.
You feel like you're beating your head against a brick wall And then suddenly you shift just a tad ?
and low and behold, there's a passage that opens up. when you truly forth and trust your bliss, unseen forces have the power to rearrange things to accommodate your step of faith.
I took the Robert McKee course, I thought well, that's not that hard and I wrote a screenplay and
I sent it to a friend of mine who was somebody's assistant who left it on his desk and some other agent wandered by and picked it up and read it and said, "Oh, this is good" and so than my friend went "Oh, shit" and
ran to his boss and said you should read this because that guy over there who's a junior agent, liked it and his boss was a senior agent and then
I got a phone call.
It was fantastic.
It was the greatest thing ever.
And so it seems like I sold the first screenplay I ever wrote.
But the truth is, I kept writing untill I got lucky.
If I stopped writing I would never got lucky.
got like
There's no luck coming to my house going, "Hey, here's a book deal."
"Hey, we want to buy it, that screenplay that you haven't written."
Just keep doing it and then eventually, you're likely to get lucky.
Why do most people not follow their bliss?
One word: fear.
Right?
We're literally overwhelmed by fear and primarily we're overwhelmed by the of what other people would think of us.
Campbell says that "What will they think of me, must be put aside for bliss"
One the biggest inhibitors of following our bliss is
"What will they think of me?"
"Am I going to look like an idiot if I follow my bliss and I fail?"
"Am I going to look like a fool?" All these different questions coming to our mind.
Your friends and family, can be very well-meaning.
But really, will collude with you to create a story that is hard for to get out of.
For example,
"Don't do music, you won't be a musician." "There's no point trying to be a dancer, because you'll never make a living there."
I think that's the first step to the journey.
They're the demons, we often have to face them.
We are each our own greatest inhibitors.
People could say "oh yeah, this guy is holding me back" or "this situation", but really, you hold yourself back.
You're deciding, hey, I don't wanna look bad in front of those guys, or I don't want those guys to say some bad things about me so
I'm not gonna do that.
Who made that decision?
You! "I'm not going to do that."
It means you decided.
There's a poem of Rumi, the great mythical poet from the Middle East, in the 12th century, who said "I wanna sing like birds sing Not worrying who listens, or what they think" But if you can do that, then you can achieve the impossible.
For me, one of the most formative times, the first, probably most formative time was when I dropped out of law school.
All of my friends at the time told me at least stay here for the first year.
I could make you the first master I was literally noxious at the idea of completing this,
I burned my resume.
I had no desire to live within the corporate world in any sense.
and in the same 24-hour period of time ended my relationship of five years and I dropped out of law school.
It was an incredibly gut-wrenching, soul wrenching time.
Moved back in with Mom.
There were several months when I just layed in bed and slept and red.
It wasn't a pretty process.
But the only thing I knew I wanted to do was to coach a little league baseball team.
A little bit of instinct that I had, a little bit of bliss I had in my life at that time was to work with these kids.
And I had no idea what would come out of it and then 3-6 months later I had an idea that wow there's an amazing opportunity to serve families and sports.
The internet was just getting going , it was just 1998 and I had a vision of what I could do to serve these families and created a company that there's no way I could have imagined when I dropped
out of law school.
No possible way.
But as it turns out I started this business we won the business plan competition UCLA be raised five million dollars I hired the CEO of ?
to be our CEO and we hired the law firm that I would have wanted to work for before I graduated from law school so this is beautiful, this sense of this is it, this is what happens when we follow our bliss,
magical things happen that we couldn't have imagined when we were going through the tough point of making the decision to take the leap to go for it and to make the difference in our life. ?
There are two roads in life:
the Red Road and the Black Road.
The Red Road is the tough road because it's narrow, it's winding, it's full of storms, it's full of obstacles.
The Black Road is easy.
It's straight and it's wide.
Doesn't offer any challenges.
The storyteller never says, you have to travel this road or you have to travel this road.
They end up telling you the story of the red and black road by saying this:
The choice is yours.
Always the choice is yours.
"Find a place where there is joy and the joy will burn out the pain"
- Joseph Campbell
I was living a spontaneous life with my father the bond, the passions that my father share with me.
We got on a plane, seven in the morning on Santa Monica Airport, flying towards Big Bear where I had won a ski race the day before, we were returning to Big Bear to collect my trophy.
On the way we hit a storm, we crashed head along, right into this rugged out a $200 fee ?
its the level we crash ?
I woke up, our bodies were sprawled ?
in this 45-degree icy chute.
It was a blizzard was harder find everybody took me about half hour for from is peace everybody where they were
My dad's girlfriend Sandra was still alive my dad was hunched over and I was unclear whether he was dead or just so knocked out three you know through like comatose or something ?
I just told myself that he was knocked out
At a certain point I had to admit that he is not gonna ?
help me any more that I was on my own
Sandra and I took shelter under a wing.
Many things happened.
Eventually we started down this initial icy shoet.
She slipt and was killed. ?
An hour later I came across her body.
I covered her with twigs and leaves and stuff.
Even though I knew she was, dead pretty much.
But her eyes were open so it was a bit confusing for me at that age I was 11 and then I continued down in the varied terrain in all kinds of things happening got stuck in snow I had a get through Little Creek cultures and and
broken rocking I E San I just wanted to go away more than anything in the world I want the pain to go away now had I not had I not him gone in there and seen that that thing that that thing I fear the most
I would not have learned to serve find the jam in the treasure pain those answers that were there for me and had I not face up and i not gone and stared in the eyes and think I feared most
that why one run promos I would not be here now this book which is really besides having a kid
P not satisfying experience in my life home this Campbell talks about the fact we go on the hero's journey there's a drag in we must slay world now a dragon is the most challenging fears creature they can ever be created
him mr.
GV my Joe Campbell describes the dragon as being a beast covered with scales and on every scale it says either that shelter but thou shalt not on the so this beach is a constructional all love the rules regulations social obligations cultural creations that have
made you feel that you either have to or can't do certain things I'm no slaying the dragon to me is the most interesting the final moment the time when you are faced with the scariest thing you've been faced with him
you get to take everything we've learned and and not the guy I am that if you were to ask you what's the one thing that keeps people from the mountain tops what's the one thing the keeps people small rather than allowing them to present their genius to
the world it's it's their fears are is Joseph Campbell says its third reagan's the mysterious anything that gets in you the new it's a beast it's a monster the name here yes you know let me face every day you know only fear that we can be
rejected that we're going to be you know no one's gonna answer return our phone call that no one's gonna like well we made a while we did what we said on fear that isn't based om has a tendency to
creep it moves through your experiences it starts to talks if I your perception cuba com scared love is what web along with and fear is what we learn
I think there's a great truth in that
I want to hold a player you know I had this idea I knew it was physically possible million usually do it Hot Wheels do this Labor Day com and so I A presented the idea to my sponsor the time
they said adding it to do this lizard that sounds awesome the around I designed around you know in all this is on paper and it was my idea and I'll never forget driving up and seeing it and this wave fears crash early Ly coming
what tonight are you serious like I made a loop
I'm really in it like and I'm the only one that's even volunteering to do it and at that point I felt like I was so much at stake to not do it you look at the time no was building
extravagant Rams no one really had money to do that kind of thing and there was no psych and I just had asserted internalize and say okay you keep telling yourself this is possible this is the time we got to make this happen and little by little I figured
out my text heavy heavy hits that day the the actually now we own one for Hutchins tour the that we could do into every single night but but that first time you know that was cells is frightening but I had to I had to really step back
in OK you can use the mail fears are very interesting fan first but we need to realize that fear is an inherent part in the human experience but it's not about getting rid of fear where's it going hours now there's
nowhere for it to go the issue is to have courage to move forward in spite a few you feel the new the courage is not a lack of fair the courage is is dealing with a faint and nobody would have a it's not as courageous you didn't and from their own fair
and that's not going to tell that just doing summit if I'm relatively and challenging Curtis when you know what to do can you do it and lack of courage is when you know what to do and don't do it courage is is the ability did to get up
after your phone gigante exploring the unknown and and trying stuff the maybe people have thought was impossible is just like a muscle if you want to get stronger you wanna run a triathlon to run a marathon or do whatever you want to do
physically you know you need to train you need to get stronger current is exactly the same thank you think a bit like courage GM you've got a consistently go up your fears go one step past one step past you'll find your comfort zone expanse each time you do that
things used to freak you out won't freak you out as much and now you have the tools you have the strength literally to lift more in your life as you face your fears one more authentically there is some
power monsters get by being dark in the closet I'll and there is some diminishment arm by facing them facing them head-on and are are suggests Campbell talk to the slaying dragons and with most others do their lives whether it's a difficult assignment at
work when there is a difficult conversation we know we should have with a loved one whether something we're resisting we leave can run in the opposite direction rather than running away we should go closer to you because once we can see
here fierce the death here you know the concern do the things that scare you you know courageous what comes after it is okay to be scared shouldn't stop you a healthy warning election stuff the No of mmm over dragon that hordes all the stories talk in those terms for several reasons
am on the one hand we could call a projection tennis psychological sense so we project out and we create and antagonised that we have to slay more but what's actually happening is we're I'll dealing with the energies inside ourselves what he's outside is in fact a
reflection what's inside that it back you've sorted shows n your 10 the new of course in Star Wars which wasn't pretty much entirely based on camels paradigm blue sky Walker has to go into K where he does battle with Darth Vader
the new we're finally he cuts of Darth Vader's head in the head rolls to his feet and Darth Vader's helmet opens up
North Jersey City but his own face he thinks that is evil outside of him when the struggle between good and evil is understood to be going on inside of us it can be very beneficial this is part is a personal transformation
overcoming I negative aspects emphasizing are good ones but what often happens of course we want to feel that we are good so we don't find the negative within ourselves we're gonna find it somewhere out there the great optional for most
as ready as ourself you know if we can overcome that basic fare about what we might achieve and we take that risk
I think all kinds of things open up in and Campbell stands now we we can all be heroes I'm the hero encounters these obstacles and Wales and the and that's how we react when we find ourselves in a situation where we have
that and cognitive dissonance how do I get out amid the nobel first thing is you have to surrender you have to stop fighting in the mood are the new so slaying the dragon is really coming to terms with that inner part of Use
yourself that you think is bigger than your and in doing that then you grow bigger sent to your cell go however I think dad its loving your to hack that's the much more efficient thing to do it also feels a lot better
theme when you do that then frequently whatever the dragon was hiding reporting this step away and give it to me they give it to you because there's no began when you're fighting you find yourself we stop fighting yourself
then you're no longer engaged in the fight in Europen to what might come true though is a gift in battling demons and overcoming because that's what our soul's journey is about its about facing fear growing beyond
and as we overcome our fears regain power you look at our lives the best most rewarding moment com after stroke as such what we do with our allies is what makes us Europe or not arm and there's grace in knowing and there's a TF yeah
believing hey every minus mishap a plus way the first row cover article where Nash in other words on one level to make it here you had to deploy CA have that health challenge a got fired in a kiln arguing that
has not troublesome but one awareness can you add to it see get a far bigger picture helps you master at a certain point in the hero's journey it's going to become a Down you loving and accepting yourself pension why
that's a powerful moment because that line she worked directly with the universe now there's no more war going on inside yourself and as that gap heels between your unlovable South in your ability to montana lovable self became an awesome power
life the way we think the kindness as linear
I'm born I'm gonna go through these things I'm gonna die here's journey tells us know you're gonna go here you can have this adventure in uni come back and guess what you gonna be right back where you
were now you can go over here have this adventure you come back you're gonna go here you can have this invention unit come back and guess what you gonna be right back where you were now you can go over here have this
adventure you come back and guess what you right here what did you bring back I'm what the hero brings back the No is a story Gomes for example go commission a big he went out any look for the plan to be more challenging
he went through all kinds it runs with the feminine with her the monster and so on but he finally swam to the bottom of the sea and got the plant immortality he came up on the short put it down while he was bathing
the snake serpent came and got that plaintiff immortality but he went home to o'rourke anyway and he had this story to tell for gil comish there was no concrete objective thing widget to give to the community no gold
no treasure and so on the story the train getting the treasures treasure and so the giving this story is the invitation for other people to make the same journey that's why it's a circle and never hit love that idea that there's a circle
and the circle needs to be closed and the way to close the circle is to come back return with something different than you started with and to share that not to me is like a perfect hero's journey deaths
the ultimate in to the US Attorney's not slaying dragons not being the bad guy it's giving back the essence in that journey looks like about how can I make a difference and who can I make a difference
24 and then it gets really easy a kind get a shirt for the future taking he's getting more here's more only my friends star artistic said he's trying to make moving he doesn't have the money
what can we do it visually all love said we're doing things that we are going to do anyway but down so we can make money for him and make him finish the movie and then all since I will let's do that again that was great when I found this success in skating and I never dreamed possible
the first thing I want to do is try to help kids get a facility in and that was the first thing I did I start a foundation for public skate parks it today we've helped build about 500 skate parks
it's my passion it's what I would love to do is provide facilities for these kids to deserve a chance I love talking to young writers about writing there's a scholarship by primed which is up screenwriting scholarship at Wesley
where I went to college the away to up everybody who wants to be what we are with a crow this if you speak to somebody at the level of the mine can you speak to them if you speak to me a hot
you will speak to the hot work if you speak through your life in your life has the story then you changed that's what mythical beings and it's why stories are great because my story right now which is my also my truth
may have an effect on you and therefore
I'm picking the in trouble
I'm making an external and through that
I'm sharing experience no matter how long you get to live life is ultimately for sure before all the silver in the dust and the street sweeper gets buried next to see you know all that really matters at the end of the day is how big
showed up and how courageous were I think when we are on our debt that's what feels are hurt integration crack is not all risks we talk not all the opportunities he sees and all the times we we don't live in look silly
bushels are the bread at the industrialized world responded in taking all the opportunities didn't sees and it's really all you gotta do to get to the next step
I believe we all have in this to think to ourselves okay a choice between our bob is a story you're telling nixon feel the morning it if you like you can overcome and that nixon deal transcend about a week ago room

In the criminal justice system, sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous.
In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit.
These are their stories.
What do you do if it goes to voice mail?
- I leave a message.
- And?
Text.
I can't believe I'm letting you go to school on your own.
Everybody else in fourth grade goes to school on their own.
Who?
The Gentiles, the Jews?
Those gadjos don't love their children.
Mom, I stick out enough as it is.
Can I go now?
Your mittens.
What did your father tell you?
Take the "G" train, then the "J" to Manhattan, two blocks up and one over.
I know, ma.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Dad, stop following me.
What did I tell you about crossing the street when you don't have a walk sign?
Dad, I'm ready.
Let me do it, okay?
Okay, big boy.
Good morning, Sarah.
How are you?
Have a good day, today.
Hey, Nico.
Good morning.
Hey.
You tell fortunes, right?
No.
Thought all you freaks did.
I do.
I see... a long lifeline, a mansion, and-- what's this?
Swimming pool.
Ryan.
See me after class.
Get to class, Nico.
He can be a jerk, sometimes.
Hey, you're flying solo today, champion?
We practiced.
I know the way.
Ten years old, gipsy boy, Nico Grey his parents say he never made it home from Caswell Academy.
And you called Manhattan SVU because?
Last time anybody saw the kid was on school property.
3:30 P.M., lower east side, Manhattan.
Your side of the bridge.
You know what, these people don't really trust our precinct.
Maybe they don't like being called, "these people"
or "Gypsies" even.
Maybe.
If you ask me, the kid's not missing.
It's all just a con.
Oh, look.
The circus is here.
I wonder who called them.
Hey, detectives.
Any word on little Nico?
Yeah, why don't you take, we'll take the parents.
He wanted to do it on his own.
Be a man, stand on his own two feet.
So this is the first time Nico goes to school on his own.
Yeah, we practiced for a week.
Which train to get on, what to do if a stranger-- you know, taught him a few moves.
Your boy should have been here by 4:00, but we didn't get a call by 7:00.
Yeah, I told my wife to call right away.
She said the police probably wouldn't care because of who we are.
He was wearing a light brown jacket, a tan scarf, and a backpack with a rabbit's foot.
It's his good luck charm.
We bought him a cell phone.
I--I keep calling, but he--he doesn't answer.
Okay, who was the last person to see Nico?
His teacher, Mr. Kandel.
Did you check with Nico's friends?
Is it possible that he's with one of them?
Nico doesn't really have a lot of friends.
At school, they... bully him.
He tested real good.
He's a smart kid.
Got a partial scholarship to this private school in the city.
We wanted Nico to be with all kinds of different kids.
Not just Romani.
Mr. Grey, how were things at home?
Is Nico upset about anything late--
No.
He's a happy kid.
A good kid.
What about a favorite hangout?
Some place he likes to go?
You're in it.
We're all distraught, and Nico is such a sweet kid.
I remember seeing him just as he was leaving school.
Was he alone?
He's always alone.
The kids tease him for being Romani.
Uh, we told them not to use the word, "Gypsy."
Okay.
So what's your take on the parents?
Different.
Do you think there's any trouble at home?
Who knows?
They keep to themselves.
Nico just wants to fit in, but he's caught between two worlds.
So you two are friends of Nico's?
We just live on the same block.
Greenpoint.
He's kind of weird.
He's a Gypsy.
His mom's a fortune teller.
Think she would've seen this coming.
And your name is?
Ryan.
I was just kidding.
Okay, Ryan.
Chill.
When's the last time you saw Nico?
That morning.
You didn't see him on the train ride home?
No, the "J" was down.
We took a taxi.
What about you, Ryan?
When was the last time you saw him?
I didn't.
I was in detention.
We can track him from school on his route to the subway.
Then he gets to the closed station-- and we lose him.
Time stamp is 3:37.
All right.
Well, that's 11 hours ago.
You did a full neighborhood canvass?
We ran all the sex offenders in the area.
No witnesses, no leads.
And online?
I mean, how about his computer?
The kid doesn't even have one.
Doesn't have any social media accounts.
His father just bought him his first cell phone this week, so he could get back and forth from school.
Taru's trying to trace that, but there's nothing so far.
So they're not only old world, they're Romani.
After 600 years of being treated like pariahs, they don't trust outsiders.
Parents have a record?
Tomas Grey was arrested for assault three months ago.
He got into an altercation with a co-worker,
Alonso Hearne, at his bike shop.
Guy dropped the charges.
Well, maybe it's payback.
Check with the precinct in Brooklyn.
Tomas isn't in.
Family emergency.
You mean his son's missing.
Kid's not here.
Go ahead and check.
The fight you had with tomas three months ago-- what was that about?
Tomas has trouble.
He brought this on himself.
Detective Dumas.
They call me, "Doom."
Welcome to Brooklyn.
I heard you needed a tour guide.
Hey, Al.
Your friend here-- he's reticent.
I don't know anything.
Well, think harder.
And maybe while you're thinking,
I'll go over every bike in here to make sure none of them got separated from a chain by accident.
Take what you want.
You people call us thieves.
We know you're thieves.
We wanna know if this is a scam.
Your friend, tomas-- did he steal his own kid?
Last chance, Alonso.
Hey, you're not gonna even lie to us?
This gotta be about the Rom Baro, isn't it?
Is that who's got your tongue?
What the hell is a Rom Baro?
So this Rom Baro works for the king of the Gypsies?
Right.
The king lives in Hungary or Serbia or Wherever-stan.
The Rom Baro lives here.
As the king's rep, he settles disputes, collects tithes--
And gets kickbacks.
Yeah.
It's good to be king.
And I'm betting the Rom Baro gets a little taste.
You're in trouble.
Your partner's pretty and smart.
Anybody ever tell you you talk too much?
Where'd you hear that?
Alonso?
That guy just looks out for himself.
Look, if there's a chance that somebody took Nico to get back at you, we need to know.
Look, this got nothing to do with the Rom Baro.
Your son's missing.
And every minute you don't level with us, is another minute he's out there, scared.
And that's the best case.
You didn't pay.
You didn't pay!
I knew something like this was going to happen.
What's going on, Mrs. Grey?
You tell them.
You tell them!
We stopped paying our tithes so that we could pay for Nico's school.
The Rom Baro-- he said that-- that this would not stand.
That we had to be punished.
Can I offer you some păˇlika?
No, thank you.
Do you know the Grey family?
From Meserole Street.
You haven't found their son?
Nico.
You know him?
Bright boy.
When was the last time you saw him?
The Greys-- they don't associate with the community much anymore.
How so?
If the Greys want to be outsiders, that's where they are-- outside.
They'll find out what it's like without a family to protect them.
That sounds like a threat.
Are you using the kid to make them pay you?
I would never hurt a child.
I don't know what you think, but NYPD isn't just going to look the other way because this kid's Romani.
We're going to find him.
Yeah, I know you would never hurt a child.
I'm hoping that we find him safe, and that this is just a family misunderstanding.
We thank you for your help.
You know, that's a happy ending I'd like to see.
Must be nice to believe in happy endings, but I can't help you.
Or the Greys.
Make sure they get an almond candy on the way out, Elba.
We brought up the Rom Baro with the Greys.
They're terrified of him.
He says the Greys are outcasts.
Is there any chance he took the kid?
I wouldn't rule it out, but nobody in his fiefdom is going to go against him.
Detectives, he's alive!
He's out there!
Mr. Grey, slow down.
You heard from Nico?
We've been calling Nico's cell phone every five minutes, practically-- leaving tons of messages, begging him to call--
Hold on.
Did--did he call you back?
No, listen to me.
The last time my wife tried to call, it said, "mailbox full."
Just now, it went straight to voice mail.
He's been checking his messages, deleting them.
He is alive.
I got Nico's cellphone working his last call was to his father,
7:30 the morning he disappeared.
Phone's been shut off since that morning.
It's been shut off?
Maybe it's not Nico checking his voice mail.
Maybe someone else is deleting them.
Why would they do that?
They want to know what the family knows.
Is there any way to trace whoever's calling into his voice mail?
Ooh, thank you,
I never would've thought of that one.
Okay, the only problem here is that it's not coming from a phone number.
It's coming from an IP address.
Whoever's calling the kid's voice mail is doing it from a VOIP.
How about in non-geek?
It means he's using the internet to call, Fin, not a phone line.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
From an account set up an hour after the boy was reported missing.
That's not a coincidence.
So where is this computer?
It's gotta be a laptop.
He's been catching signals wherever he can.
Are there any other numbers that he's been calling regularly?
You can look that up, right?
Oh, a "please" would be nice.
Type.
Okay, only one other number once yesterday, twice today.
A 5-43, 6-20 and... boom.
There's your address.
You have an online ordering system?
Yes.
What is this about?
Look, we need to see your delivery records for tonight.
Thank you.
Here it is.
5-43-- same address again-- it's 6-20--what?
He ordered twice?
No, he called to complain about the order.
Said the food was too spicy for his little boy.
I could hear the kid crying in the background.
Thank you.
Police!
NYPD, search warrant!
Get your hands up!
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
Don't make a mistake.
Put that kid down.
What the bloody hell is going on?
Your hands up!
Don't hurt my daddy!
He's my son, he's my son!
Stand down, stand down!
It's not Nico.
Amaro, it's not Nico.
Get someone to watch your kid.
It's okay.
You're coming with us.
My client is a senior investigative journalist for The Ledger.
His home was invaded, his son was terrorized.
After he hacked into a missing child's voice mail.
Now we can either go to the feds with the wiretapping, or your client can cooperate.
You start by telling us if you know where Nico Grey is.
I don't.
Look, I'm trying to find poor little Nico just like you.
How does deleting his messages help you find him?
I wanted to leave room in his mailbox in case anyone else wanted to call him.
Maybe someone related to his disappearance.
So you're not a scumbag who's trying to scoop the competition on a milk carton case.
You are one of the good guys.
Detective, you think that's funny?
Mr. Griscomb has been a journalist for 15 years.
Journalist?
The Ledger?
That's risible.
Excuse me, does he have to be here?
Mr. Griscomb, we're going to need the notes you have on the deleted messages.
That's covered by the first amendment.
Oh, so now you're trying to hide behind the first amendment?
You led a family to believe that their son was still alive.
Obviously, that wasn't the point.
Okay, are we finished with this moral outrage, sergeant?
We all want to find this missing little boy, and maybe, just maybe, my client has something to offer, so, sweetheart, do me a favor.
Why don't you call your boss?
ADA Cabot.
You want a deal?
Your client tells us what we want to know, and he does time.
And how much is up to you.
What Ledger would love nothing more than to have a test case involving first amendment and NYPD.
Please, go ahead.
Try us.
You three are playing this while there's a missing kid out there?
Yeah, let's cut to the chase, Mr. Exley.
Okay, Griscomb gives you everything he has on the missing boy's phone records, he gets full immunity from prosecution.
No, this is how it works.
Wiretapping is federal.
It's out of our hands.
He gives us something we can use, we'll mis-dee the felony eavesdropping.
Take a minute to think about it.
And by a minute, I mean 59 seconds.
The deleted messages were all from the parents.
I also tapped into their phones.
They don't know where he is.
You cut a deal for this?
He's put a lot more in that rag of his.
The deal is conditional, Mr. Griscomb.
Don't jerk us around.
Right, okay, so let me make this clear.
The feds do not hear what comes next.
I jacked into a few other phones in the neighborhood.
You're familiar with the Rom Baro?
Keep talking.
This woman-- older-- she left the Rom Baro a voice mail, begging for his help.
She says, "people think our son took Nico."
What's their name?
She didn't leave one.
Did she mention her son's name.
Just Marc.
And she was spooked.
Like the villagers were gonna get the pitchforks.
What do you mean it's not Nico?
So sorry.
It wasn't him.
Somebody hacked into his voice mail.
Why?
Who would do something like that?
We're dealing with that now.
We do have a name-- Marc.
And does that mean anything to you?
Mrs. Rajic.
Is your son, Marc, home?
He doesn't live here anymore.
Where is he?
You tell me.
Go away.
I'm watching my shows.
Back to the Rom Baro?
Yeah, and tell him what?
That a reporter hacked his voice mail?
Excuse me, sir.
Do you live around here?
Yeah, down the block.
Is this about the missing kid?
Do you know the Rajics?
They keep to themselves.
They?
She doesn't live alone?
She has a son.
Unfortunate.
Kid's brain stopped growing before his body did.
My daughter and her friends are scared of him.
She keeps him locked in the basement.
Um... we heard he moved away.
If you mean last night.
I was walking the dog, and I saw his mother and two other Gyps-- itinerants hustle him into one of those handicap vans from New Jersey.
They come and they go.
They're Gypsies.
As long as they don't set fire to anything or panhandle, we leave them be.
A great place to hide somebody.
- Watch your back.
- Yeah.
Hey, folks.
How we doing tonight?
Hey, friends.
We're looking for a Marc Rajic.
Anybody know him?
Hey!
Hey, out of the way.
Out of the way, now.
Rollins?
Drop it.
Don't make me shoot you.
I want to go home.
Down on the ground, now.
What are you doing?
I got this.
I got it.
I turn around, and you're gone.
How about a heads-up, huh?
How about you keep up?
I didn't hurt Nico.
So why'd you run?
My mom said stay away from strangers.
That's... good, Marc.
You listened.
You did as you were told.
My mom said not to talk to anyone.
Well, why do you think she said that?
I can't tell you.
She'd be mad.
Well... we don't want her to be mad.
Nico's mom is probably pretty upset right now, too.
So if you know where he is, tell us so we can find him.
And that way, nobody has to be mad anymore.
I saw Nico.
That's good, Marc.
When?
Monday.
Okay, great.
And did you meet him after school?
No, I don't go anywhere without my mom.
So... did he come over to your house?
My mom says I can't have people over.
But...
Hey, hey, hey, easy.
You're not going to get in any trouble.
Just tell us who you had over.
I can't tell you.
I did a bad thing.
Marc, you stop talking now.
Okay, we're almost done here.
You keep asking questions, after his attorney arrives, I'll get it all thrown out.
You're done, now.
Detective, you remember the Rom Baro.
He is also Mr. Rajic's lawyer.
Wonderful.
Marc Rajic has the mental capacity of a child.
He may not even understand--
He understands plenty.
He knows the difference between right and wrong.
That will be decided by a judge at a capacity hearing, but it won't get that far.
Do you have probable cause to hold him?
Well, then I'll be taking Marc home to his mother.
Psst.
We like Rajic for this?
They hid him in the middle of the woods.
He ran when we came for him.
He's guilty about something.
We just-- we need to search the house.
Her mother won't let us in.
We'll need a warrant.
His tribe is circling.
If this guy is what he think he is,
Nico isn't the only kid he eyeballed.
Hmm.
One of his neighbors-- not Romani-- said his daughter and her friends were spooked.
Well, see if they can get us to a warrant.
Excuse me.
Marc's kind of creepy, but I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
So why did you tell your dad you were scared of him?
Well, he stares at the kids on the block.
I kind of worry about Marc.
Yeah?
Why is that?
I mean, what's he going to do when his mother dies?
Hmm.
What about Nico and Marc?
You ever see them together or?
Yeah, sometimes.
Marc--he's... creepy.
You ever seen Marc with Nico?
I should have said something earlier.
What?
But he scared me.
I was afraid he might come after me next.
Go ahead and tell me, sweetheart.
The night Nico didn't come home...
I saw Marc... sitting on his front porch.
He was holding this rabbit's foot.
I'm not sure, but it looked like Nico's.
I don't want them in here.
We got a warrant, Mrs. Rajic.
My Marc didn't do anything.
I keep him locked in the--
Shh.
Ana.
Let the police do what they do.
We've been harassed before.
I'll be right here the whole time.
He always locked in?
Don't answer any questions.
This is my room!
It's all right, Marc.
Come and wait with me while the police do their work.
Hmm.
Two Bridges Donuts.
It's over by East Broadway.
Is that near Nico's school?
It's close enough.
Shh.
Looky here, Metro card.
That's not his.
My boy doesn't know how to take the subway.
Oh, we found him in the backwoods of Jersey, hiding in a pack of goats.
Your son gets around more than you think, Mrs. Rajic.
Looks like your boy's luck just changed.
Called a guy at Two Bridges, thinks Marc looks familiar, but he's not positive.
Okay, MTA says that Marc's Metro card was last swiped
Monday night, 8:00 P.M., East Broadway Station.
So we're looking at East Broadway, that's five blocks south of where we've been searching.
That's by the Manhattan Bridge.
That's no-man's-land.
Tons of construction sites there.
Half of them abandoned since the market tanked.
All right, Fin, relocate the grid search.
Amaro, Rollins, head downtown.
I think we're looking at a recovery.
The stats don't look good for him.
Well, kids are tough.
You never know.
Lividity is fixed and appropriate for his position as found, the construction site where he was recovered is where he was killed.
We got a time of death?
It's been pretty chilly, but rigor's passed through.
Signs of early decomp-- he was under that tarp at least 72 hours.
So he was killed the night he went missing.
- Mm-hmm.
- Cigarette burns?
Dozens.
On the back of his hands, his thighs, and his scrotum.
He was tortured.
Ritualistic, maybe?
I don't think so.
See the half-moon pattern on the burns?
Whoever did this never let the lit end maintain full contact.
It's like they'd never done it before.
Now how much of it did he have to take?
All of it.
Wounds show vital reaction, his clothes were soaked in urine, he was terrified.
This, on his neck, is that cause?
Ligature strangulation with his own scarf.
Any biologicals or DNA on the body?
No, but we may get a hit off the cigarette butts you recovered at the scene.
Hold off on that, Melinda.
The parents are here to make the ID.
Cover him up.
Just tell us when you're ready.
It's not him.
It's not my boy.
Do you see?
Do you see?
It's not Nico.
Baby, baby, please.
He's not my boy.
This is not his face.
His eyes--
Nico's gone, Nadia.
This--this isn't how you're going to remember him... but we need to know.
It's him.
It's our son.
It's her fault.
You should arrest her, too.
She kept him locked up there in a cage!
Nadia, that's enough.
Everybody knows that Marc killed our child.
Why haven't you charged him yet?
We're building our case.
Mr. Grey, we need to go back over every piece--
Rom Baro-- even the NYPD is afraid.
Only my husband is fool enough to defy them.
This isn't about him, but we do need your help now.
If there is any detail that you can remember about Nico's relationship--
Wh-wh-what--what?
What is it?
We don't say his name out loud.
He's-- he's dead.
His spirit won't rest.
I'm--I'm sorry.
I'm--I'm very, very sorry.
You didn't know.
Out.
Get out.
Get out of my house!
- Get out, get out!
- Nadia!
My son!
My son!
Ah, those are very sweet, guys, but now's not a good time.
The kids at school are taking up a collection.
We're going to plant a tree for Nico.
Or something.
We want to tell them.
Are they okay?
They're mourning.
They're probably upset you didn't arrest Marc yet.
Everyone else is.
Well, we heard Marc's kept locked in.
His mother doesn't let him out.
His mom doesn't know.
He can get out through the back.
Tell them.
Yeah, we've seen him on his roof at night, smoking.
Come on.
He had-- he had the rabbit's foot.
He had the Metro card.
But Marc's DNA isn't on those cigarette butts.
All right?
He doesn't show up on any video, we have nothing that ties him to the scene.
We got nothing, but... he has been locked in a basement.
Everyone in the neighborhood thinks he's a freak.
Yeah, okay, so he's touched, but, look, I don't make him for this.
He's a child.
No, he's a man-child.
That's it.
He's a man-child.
I mean, don't tell me you're actually buying this whole, "tell me about the rabbit's foot."
- Yeah, yeah, actually I do--
- Oh, my--
That is enough, you two.
Well, the 6-5 in Brooklyn would love to make Nico's homicide a pro forma.
We're not going to let that happen.
So let's start from jump.
Just get me something that puts Marc or whoever at the crime scene.
Yes, sir.
Rollins.
What?
Oh, my God.
Yeah, keep her-- keep her there.
We're on our way.
Nadia Grey just tried to set Marc Rajic on fire.
She doused him with gasoline through the window.
Tried to spark him.
Marc okay?
Well, God looks after kids and idiots.
Lucky for him, he's both, right?
We'll check on him.
Look, we're going to need to talk to Nadia before you take her in.
All right, hey, do me a favor?
Next time someone tries to tell you how these people are, believe 'em.
Let's go.
Come on.
Nadia.
What happened?
You had him.
And you let him go.
We were watching him.
He's an animal.
He burned my baby.
And you couldn't do anything to him?
The Rom Baro will make sure that he--
He killed my son!
This is justice.
Nadia, just now, you said, "burned."
Why?
With cigarettes.
He burned him.
Nadia, who told you that?
I don't know!
You know what I know?
That my son is dead.
This is what I know.
It wasn't released to the press.
There's no way Nadia could have known.
Unless the parents did it.
The dad was at work.
Mom called the school 20 times from a landline.
All right, then who tipped her off?
I mean, it can't be Marc.
He's been in the box, or locked in his basement.
The girls.
The girls.
And they've been tipping us off all along.
Courtney and Emma are 14 years old.
No, wait a minute.
Who are these people?
Two little girls.
Nico's schoolmates.
They're always around, bringing flowers, asking questions about the Greys.
All right, look, I know we're all tired, but sleep is for closed cases.
Give me something.
There's nothing in juvie, no discipline flags at Caswell Academy.
They were at the school last night passing out fliers.
So were a lot of other kids.
Yeah, but they're the only ones that lied to us.
Remember, the girls told us that the last time they saw Nico, it was that morning, but look at this.
So this is the last image of Nico, time stamp, 3:37.
No Marc Rajic.
No, but... there come our two girls, and it's just a few seconds later.
It is the route to their subway.
Or they did it.
And they stashed the rabbit's foot and the Metro card in Marc's room.
Why didn't he just tell us?
Well, his whole life, his mother told him to stay away from people, not let anyone in his room.
He won't talk.
But there is someone who could get him to tell the truth.
The police on the side of the Romani?
Forgive me if I'm skeptical.
This isn't a con.
We don't think Marc hurt Nico.
But we think he knows who did.
And if this is all a trick, you've already demonized him.
His own people want to kill him.
You've got two victims right now.
Nico Grey and Marc.
Just tell Marc that he can trust us.
Help us get justice for both of them.
The Rom Baro told us someone visited your room.
Who was it?
They snuck in the window.
And I--I told them mom don't like it when strangers are in the house.
Who, Marc?
The pretty girl, Courtney.
She has a nice dog.
And Emma.
Do you remember when?
On Monday night.
They made me stop watching football.
Is that what Marc did?
Burn Nico?
That's horrible.
And you're sure that you didn't tell
Mrs. Grey about that?
No.
She said I did?
She's gone a little... you know.
I didn't say anything.
Okay.
You've been very helpful, Courtney.
Oh, why are you guys talking to Emma?
Right in here.
I don't know why we're here.
Please, have a seat.
My daughter doesn't know anything.
She told us about Marc.
'Cause he did it.
He's the one.
Yeah.
How are you so sure?
'Cause Courtney said...
Is there any chance you saw Marc following Nico after school?
No, we didn't see Nico after school.
You sure?
What did Courtney say?
We know you're lying, Emma.
We have you on video following Nico.
Emma...
You remember that?
What else did they do?
I don't-- I don't want to say.
It's okay, Marc.
Your mom won't know.
Courtney touched me down there.
And I--I--I-- I told her it was wrong.
And...
Go ahead.
Stuff came out, and it felt funny, but nice.
Then they gave me a rabbit's foot.
And they told me if I didn't tell anyone, they'd come back and do it again.
Look, I don't know why you're asking me.
Marc did it, didn't he?
He just told my partner you two were in his room.
Now do you want me to tell your mother what he says you did to him?
No.
Detective, you're frightening my daughter.
Am I?
Are you a little scared now, Emma?
Being here?
How do you think Nico felt?
You think he was scared?
Was he scared when you put out lit cigarettes on him?
Emma, what is this about?
Open your eyes, Emma!
Look at him.
He was so scared, he wet his pants.
And what happened then?
Did you laugh at him?
Or did you burn him again?
No, it was Courtney.
We were just playing around.
We pantsed him, but--
Courtney-- she wouldn't stop.
She lit a cigarette, and...
And you didn't say, "no."
I tried to.
I told her to quit it, that we should just go.
But he was crying, and he said he was going to call his mom.
So Courtney grabbed his scarf.
And I was yelling, "stop, stop."
And she said, "he's just a dumb Gypsy.
Who's going to miss him?"
The stupid little bitch.
Courtney.
It was just a joke.
We were just fooling around with him.
And he started crying, and making like he was going to tell.
So, you made sure he wouldn't.
I shut him up.
And then you went to Marc's.
He snitched?
I gave him the only fun he's ever had.
Okay, my daughter has a perverse sense of humor, but I think it's time to stop.
Now I'm calling my lawyer.
It's a little late, dad.
She's right.
Anything else?
Yeah.
Why?
Why not?
Come on, Sookie, stay with me.
Come on, please!
Sookie?
Sookie?
Sookie, drink.
Come on!
I'm so sorry, I should never have let you come tonight.
Then why did you?
Werewolf, I'm gonna need you to shut the fuck up!
Come on, drink.
Sookie?
Don't look like she's takin' it.
That's because she isn't.
Does she even have a pulse?
Barely.
Come on.
Well, ain't there anything else we can do?
We can pray.
Werewolf and a vampire.
Who's gonna listen?
That, I do not know.
* When you came in the air went out
* And every shadow filled up with doubt
* I don't know who you think you are, but before the night is through
* I want to do bad things with you
* I'm the kind to sit up in his room
* Heartsick and eyes filled up with blue
* I don't know what you've done to me, but I know this much is true
* I want to do bad things with you
* I want to do real bad things with you *
He killed Beverleen!
I silvered the son of a bitch...
She was my favorite ex-sister-in-law.
What in the hell did you bring him back here for?
He is under my control.
Tell them, blond one.
I am yours.
So fuckin' cool!
Wash your face.
Bill offered you an olive branch tonight.
Why didn't you take it?
Everyone join hands.
We must cast a protective spell against the vampires, so we can be safe here.
I said join hands!
Um, I think I speak for everyone here when I say
I don't think this is what any of us signed up for.
Uh, does she speak for everyone?
She sure as hell speaks for me.
Not for me.
I didn't know what I was gettin' into, but I'm pleased as punch that I'm in it.
Good boy, Roy.
Thank you, Antonia.
Anybody else?
I found this stapled to a lamppost out front.
Tomorrow night we are going to go to this, and we are gonna take the blond one with us, so the whole world will see what vampires are capable of,
and what we are capable of doing to them.
Marnie...
My name is Antonia!
Jesus Christ.
Please, I'm begging you.
I got kids.
Nobody leaves.
Or what?
Try it, and you'll find out.
Sookie.
You made it.
Where's Eric?
Sookie, you were shot.
You can't still...
Where is he?
I already have my men out looking for him.
Now that I know that you're all right,
I'll go and join them and I will search for him myself until...
Am I the only one here who thinks this is batshit crazy?
Sookie, you just came this close to dying', because of fuckin' fangers.
Again!
Every minute that we spend not looking for him...
Fine.
I'm done here.
I'm done.
Bill?
Thanks for the blood.
Anytime.
She finally fall asleep?
You should go, Sam.
This is not your problem.
Well, what if I want it to be my problem?
Trust me, you do not want Marcus to be your problem.
Is that why Emma couldn't get to sleep?
She's scared he'll come back?
Are you?
I ain't leaving'.
Well, it'll be worse for everyone if he does come back and you're still here.
Well, then let's nobody be here.
No.
No, I'm trying to teach Emma not to run from her problems.
Well, who said anything about runnin'?
I'm talkin' about the three of us, goin' campin', gettin' back to nature, and getting back to nature is 100% opposite of running away.
I don't wanna have to wake Emma up.
Just carry her from her bed to the back seat.
She won't know anything till she wakes up to breakfast cooked on a campfire.
If it's sharing' a tent that's stoppin' you, you don't have to worry.
I am a multiple tent owner.
Oh, are you?
Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So then, I go over to Jason's house, because I thought maybe he might, like, understand what I was going through, but he just kicked me out also.
And this is just the worst day of my life.
I wish I was dead.
Except I am, and it doesn't even matter.
There have been times, I'll admit, when it's occurred to me that maybe I should put my career on hold and become a maker,
but these last several hours here with you have erased those doubts forever.
You are nothing like you are on TV.
Aw, thanks.
Nan.
I thought it best I go to ground here, what with the Festival of Tolerance event starting so early tomorrow night.
Saw you on the news, by the way.
You did quite well.
Really got in front of the story.
Speaking of, what is the story, my king?
What have you gone and fucked up now?
I almost hesitate to ask, but lest there be more surprises, is there anything else I need to know?
Only that Northman is missing.
What?
How?
Last we spoke, you were about to show him the true death.
I changed my mind.
Decisive leader you've turned out to be.
We'll have to cancel tomorrow night.
It's possible that Eric has fallen under Antonia's influence, just as Luis did.
Canceling is not an option.
What is so important about this event that you are willing to risk your life and mine?
There are factions within...
Factions within what?
The AVL?
The Authority?
Unless you tell me,
I cannot agree to...
Right now crews from CNN, VTV, Fox News and bloggers from across the country are already outside the hotel, waiting.
What would you have me tell them?
Blame the witches.
America's had no problem doing it in the past.
I didn't think it was possible, but you actually make me long for Queen Sophie-Anne.
I mean, what the fuck, Bill?
How did you let it come to this?
It was you that let it come to this!
I don't see how I'm responsible...
And there is the problem in a nutshell!
Everybody can see it but you.
Beyond tomorrow's headline, you are a blind person.
I would just love for you to say that to my face when I'm not chained in silver.
It's what I've been saying all along!
Bolster security if you feel it necessary, but tomorrow's Festival of Tolerance is going forward, and the cameras had damn well better find you in a festive and tolerant fucking mood.
Am I understood?
Perfectly.
Come on, baby.
Ooh, we're home now.
We're home now, baby boy.
Yeah, we home.
Oh, my baby.
Lafayette?
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!
Whoa, man, this ain't your house.
That ain't your baby, either.
That's Mikey!
This is my baby!
Now get out of my house, you.
What the fuck, Lafayette?
This my baby.
It's his daddy that came and took him, I know it was.
Uh, Arlene...
Ain't that his daddy, standing right there?
Well why are you treating us like criminals?
We didn't abduct our own child!
I'm just trying to get the story straight.
Without it, we got no idea where to look.
You hear that, Terry?
We're dealing with amateurs.
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to find him ourselves!
I mean, u know, is he here?
Is he here?
Huh?
Oh, y'all need to stop touching' shit!
Just look everywhere.
This here's crime scene.
Sons of bitches took my gun.
They took my son, cuz.
Deputy Jason Stackhouse.
J, it's me.
Uh, Lafayette just walked through my front door, with Arlene's baby, a doll, and a gun.
Andy.
Arlene?
Arlene.
Hoyt's got the baby.
At his place.
I knew that Fortenberry kid wasn't right.
Stay put, Bubba, we'll be right there.
Anything else I need to know?
Had one just like him in my platoon, just big and wrong.
He says Lafayette nearly took a shot at him.
With my gun?
Lafayette took Mikey?
Hoyt also said he came running out of the house with no pants on, so we need to get him pants.
What?
We don't have time for that!
It won't take but a minute, and I don't wanna see that shit.
Terry!
I'm comin' with you.
No, you ain't.
Stackhouse!
- They ain't.
No.
- Terry.
Damn it.
Arlene?
That is my child.
It's our child.
What?
It's daytime.
Sookie.
Bill?
What are you doing here?
Ask Sookie.
It's her dream.
Sookie?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Yes, you do.
Tell him.
Tell him you never stopped loving me.
Is this true?
What?
Now everyone can hear everyone?
Is it?
Well, yes, but it's not my fault.
He gave me his blood.
And he gave u his.
Sookie is mine.
Eric, don't.
Bullshit!
She's mine!
Guys, I don't want you two fighting' over me, please!
I'm ten times your age.
And I love her twenty times as much!
Goddamn it, stop!
Thank you.
Now, this is my dream, so both y'all need to shut up and listen to me.
Come on.
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Get your butts in the living room.
We need to have a little talk.
"Sam, I came to say goodbye, but you wasn't here, so I'm writin' you instead.
"I fucked up."
I'm lookin' for Sam Merlotte.
He around?
Who's askin'?
Name's Marcus.
Marcus what?
He knows who I am.
Well, he ain't around, Marcus He-knows-who-I-am.
Who are you?
His brother.
No shit.
Shifter got hisself a shifter brother, huh?
All right, then.
You give him this, will you?
I'll be waitin' for him tonight.
You tell him to be there, or else he gonna have a bigger fuckin' problem on his hands than he already got.
I'll be sure and do that.
Our perp still inside?
Yup.
The son of a bitch.
Y'all bring me any pants?
Andy got 'em.
Andy!
Pants.
Oh, I forgot.
You went in the room to get 'em!
Well, indict me for being a little on edge, why don't you?
It's my kin in there!
Stay back.
Lafayette!
Lafayette, you in there?
Goddamn it.
It's Sheriff Bellefleur, Lafayette.
You sound like a white man, you!
You know damn well I'm a white man!
No chance is I openin' no door for no white man, me.
Open the door, you racist shitbag, or I will open it the fuck up for you!
Andy?
You hear me?
Hey!
Protocol is to defuse the situation.
Fuck that!
This situation became pre-un-defused the minute that she-male broke into my house.
Lafayette Reynolds, on behalf of Renard Parish, the state of Louisiana, and Jesus Christ his fuckin' self,
- What are you...
- ready or not, here we come!
Andy!
Don't even think about it, Lafayette.
I ain't gonna let you shoot him.
Drop the weapon.
- Hand over the baby.
- It's my weapon.
Get out of my house!
Andy, come on!
Oh, Jesus, fuck!
Holy shit!
Y'all all right?
How'd you let him get the drop on you, Stackhouse?
What the hell was I supposed to do, shoot him with the baby in his arms?
- Shit.
- Fuck!
What are you doing here?
I told y'all not to me!
Go away, yous!
I got plenty more bullets, me!
Why are you doing this, Lafayette?
My name's Mavis.
He's lost it.
Mavis?
I'm goin' in.
No quarter.
No, no, no, no.
We can't let you do that.
What the hell, cuz?
Let us handle this.
Get the fuck offa me!
Let me go!
- You ain't goin' nowhere!
- Off my goddamn arms!
You're just jealous 'cause I got a wife and a life and a baby to love, and you got nothin' and nobody!
How'd you get so fuckin' strong?
C'mere, bunny!
She seems to have forgotten all about last night's drama.
What is it, Sam, do you need to hear me say it?
I'm a weak man, Luna, I kinda do.
You were right.
Ah.
This was a great idea.
You're the best.
That's what I'm talking about.
At school, we have this regular bunny.
She lets you hold her.
These nature bunnies, all they do is run away.
That's because nature bunnies are smart, and like to exercise.
School bunnies are fat and lazy.
Uh, we don't say "fat."
Oh, sorry.
It's okay.
I hope I turn out to be a shifter instead of a werewolf.
Where'd that come from, bug?
Because if I'm a shifter, one day I can be my own bunny and pet myself whenever I want.
Emma, whatever you wind up being is what you're supposed to be, and you're perfect, understand?
What are you getting all serious for?
I just wanna pet a bunny.
Girl wants to pet a bunny.
I'm gonna go catch her that bunny.
Yay.
Gimme a minute.
One minute.
Come here, little guy.
He's so cute!
Isn't he?
I could be dreaming about anything.
I could be swimming with dolphins, or eating a whole pie without any consequences, but instead I'm here with the two of you.
Now, that's gotta mean something.
I'm afraid to ask what.
I think,
I think I'm in love with both of you.
You can't be.
That's not who you are.
Only because I've always been this self-conscious, good little girl who's too scared to think outside the box, especially when it comes to love and sex.
But as of right now, I'm putting that little girl behind me.
What exactly are you proposing?
That I can love both of you.
That I don't have to be yours, or yours.
I'm proposing that the two of you... be mine.
I'm the king of Louisiana.
I do not share.
You have to choose.
Okay, first of all, you guys are vampires.
What's with all the morality?
And second of all, this is such a double standard.
When it's two women and one guy, everyone's hunky-dory with it, even if they barely know each other.
But when a woman tries to have her way with two men she is totally and completely in love with,
everyone's hemming' and hawing'.
I'm sayin' I love you.
Both of you.
And, I'm asking you to love me back.
Together.
It's either both of you, or nothin' at all.
Take it or leave it.
One drop at a time, girlfriend, okay?
No more.
This shit's a whole other level.
You ever drink V directly from the source?
You ever put your face up against a vampire's cold skin, and just sucked it right out of him?
Fuck no.
Well, I have, so don't be a cunt!
Just breathe.
Breathe.
It's not real.
It's the V. It'll pass.
I'm puttin' you in charge of this.
That's the first good decision you made all day.
Jesus, the hell you doin' here?
I called him.
Hey!
Get, get down!
Why is he doin' this?
I have no idea.
Hey, come here.
Hey, hey.
I got a theory.
When you guys, uh, role-play, does Lafayette ever turn into a woman named Mavis?
I'm gonna forget you just said that, and I'm gonna head on in.
Hey, hey, he's got a gun.
I'm goin' in, Jason.
It's, it's against protocol.
What, you're gonna shoot me?
I'm gonna get your baby back.
I'm goin' with.
Echelon formation.
Right now he's defiladed, but if I approach from the flanks...
Terry, I'm a nurse.
I'm not even gonna pretend to understand what you just said, but I think I should go in by myself.
Okay, but what if I...
Baby, no.
I do not wanna fight fire with fire.
- Don't worry.
I got this.
- Stay here.
Let him go in.
Goddamn it.
He's a nurse.
He's just a nurse.
Oh, fuck.
Just you and me now, you.
Lafayette?
Who you with, you?
Monsieur Virgil?
What's your name?
Is it Mavis?
What you want, you?
I just wanna help.
Okay?
And I think I can.
I'm a brujo.
A practitioner of magic.
I got all the magic I need, me, right here.
I'm sorry, Mavis, but he is not your baby.
You lie!
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Why you come to take my baby, hmm?
That woman out there who's been crying for hours, she is this baby's mami .
You broke into their house and you took him from her!
I would never take another woman's baby.
I know, I know.
I think something happened to you, something you never made peace with.
I don't know what, but whatever it was, it killed you.
I no dead.
Now your spirit is looking for a way back, and since my boyfriend is a medium, you found it by entering his body.
Boyfriend?
Oh!
Oh, no!
How I make the baby with this, me?
You didn't.
My baby.
My baby boy.
He dead?
No!
I'm so sorry, Mavis.
No!
I am so, so sorry.
I just wanna hold him, just one, just one last time.
You.
You got that kind of magic in you?
We can try.
Okay, but if you do find Mr. Northman, please have King Bill call me, or you call me, or, I don't know, something.
Hey there, Sookie.
Hope you like flowers.
Come in.
Alcide was the first, the only, man that I ever loved, if you count out Coot, which believe me, I really wish I could.
So when I saw Alcide with you, and the way he cared about you, I just...
Debbie,
I understand being jealous, but you tried to kill me.
That ain't somethin' you can expect someone to forget.
I don't.
That's not why I came.
I know you're in trouble, and I'm wondering if there's anything I could do to help, that's all.
Did Alcide tell you I was in trouble?
He didn't have to.
He came home last night with your blood on him.
If he didn't tell you, how did you know the blood was mine?
Because I remember the smell.
Look, I ain't asking to be best friends.
You know, I'd be crazy if I expected that, and I ain't crazy.
But can't we try and make things better just a little at a time?
Don't talk.
Just let me listen.
- What?
- Shh.
...love Alcide, love him so much, there ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for him.
Why can't she just believe me?
I need her to see that I wanna help.
Okay.
I believe you.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
Good!
You know, Alcide told me that you think it's a curse, being what you are.
But I think it'd be nice to know what people are thinkin' every once in a while.
He loves you.
He really does.
Thank you.
So, you really wanna help?
'Cause I sure as heck could use some.
Please, just let me hold him one last time!
Please!
Tell me the last thing you remember.
Him, me was outside fighting'.
"I wanna see my baby."
I tell him I wanna hold him, but he say I couldn't.
He want to get away from me, but I followed him inside the house, me.
Why?
Why can't I hold him?
And then he told me,
"Because, Sugar, I already done buried him."
He already buried my...
I don't want to go through this again, you.
I just wanna know where my baby is.
Which is why you have to go through this.
Monsieur Virgil went into the kitchen.
Please...
Stop!
- He was standin' by the sink.
- Please...
He wouldn't look at me.
...and look me in the eyes!
So I started tugging on him to make him look!
Look at me!
And then it was inside of me.
What was it?
The knife.
Then I just fell to the floor, floated up and watched myself die.
What happened next?
He started shoveling.
I couldn't take it no more, me, so I left.
Where was he shoveling?
Out there, yonder, under the tree.
Don't shoot!
We're comin' out!
Mikey?
You got the shot, Stackhouse, take him out.
They ain't even got the gun no more, Andy.
- Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.
- Hoyt, we need a shovel.
A shovel?
What the hell for?
Just get it.
Hi, sweet boy.
Come here, Sweet Pea.
Oh, hey, sweet boy.
I can't say how sorry I am 'bout all this, me.
Don't worry about it.
Sometimes these things happen.
We still love you, Lafayette.
My name's Mavis.
My boy.
My sweet baby boy.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Oh, my heart hurts, I love you so much.
What you said, about me movin' up in the pack?
I want in.
Well, what changed 'tween then and now?
You want honesty or you just want me to kiss the ring?
Well, I'll take honesty every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
It's important to Debbie.
That's it?
What's important to Debbie's gotta be important to me, now more than ever.
I mean it.
Whatever you need, I'm there.
Well, you know what I call a dude that'll admit there ain't nothin' he won't do for the woman he loves?
What?
A man.
To Shreveport.
To Shreveport.
Hey, what are you up to the rest of the night?
Wide open.
Well, you might have heard me talk about my wife before.
We're, uh, separated, going through a rough patch.
And now some fuckin' shifter is lookin' to replace me.
Shit.
Right?
Anyways, I got this son of a bitch of hers stopping' by a little later on for a talk.
I was hopin' you wouldn't mind sticking' around.
It ain't my style to go beatin' on people I got no beef with.
Now that's, that's not what I'm askin' for,
I swear.
I just need to communicate with him that I can, and I will, hurt him if I have to.
Since you're about six-six and wider than a door, he might be more inclined to listen with you standin' behind me.
To communicating' shit.
To communicating' shit.
I want you to know how sorry I am, Stackhouse.
And I want you to know how little that means to me, 'cause I heard it all before, too many times.
Why don't you do something useful and turn on the lights, 'cause we can't see shit down there.
Think I got somethin'.
What?
What down there?
I don't know.
You think it's him, you?
I think it's both of you.
My baby.
It's time.
You found him and you held him, but now I need my Lafayette back.
Oh, where, where I go?
It's not for us to know.
Holy fuck.
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle.
Monsieur Lafayette, thank you for everything.
You got it, bitch.
We are closed for the evening.
I know what you're up against.
I know who you're up against.
I said we're closed.
I represent the Shreveport pack of werewolves.
I come to pledge our allegiance to your cause.
So tell me, young lady, exactly what are you offering?
Support.
Hmm.
Muscle.
Hmm.
We hate vampires every bit as much as you do.
Well, I doubt that.
How so?
What else?
Money, drugs.
Got to the point where pretty much my entire pack is...
Eric!
Sookie.
Hey, come on, let's get you out of here.
You should go.
You're under her spell, aren't you?
What is she making you do?
Kill the king.
Kill the king?
You mean Bill?
Goddamn it, Sook.
How fuckin' stupid can you be?
What little I know about werewolves is that werewolves do not like to be known.
Why are you making yourselves known to me now?
Uh, like, like I said, you know, on account of your cause and all.
Sookie Stackhouse!
The telepath?
Yes, who aids vampires.
I brought her to you.
Tara!
Do not shoot!
This one could be of use to us.
Uh, okay.
Oh, Sookie.
Just drop the gun!
Sookie.
Shoot her, shoot her, shoot her!
Fucking chill, Roy!
You always been stupid, but comin' here has gotta be about the stupidest shit I ever heard of.
Are you even listenin' to me?
We're all being held hostage.
Bill's at the Dorcester Hotel.
Keep her here.
Charge me, Sookie.
Charge me now!
No!
No, no, no!
I'm really fuckin' sorry, Antonia, but she charged me
Y'all saw it!
Fuckin' werewolf.
Debbie!
Shit.
You had me worried sick.
Shreveport, Dorcester.
Now.
Mr. Northman, it's time to go.
Yes, Antonia.
Uh, Roy, you come with.
Yes.
The rest of you stay here.
I can't take this anymore, I can't, I mean,
I mean, I don't even think I'm a real Wiccan!
I was just doing this to piss off my parents!
Let's get the fuck outta here!
Are you all right?
Try the front door!
I'm already on it!
Oh, fuck.
I am risking' life and limb here tonight, so that all of you across this great country of ours can witness Shreveport, Louisiana's pre-Halloween pageantry of vamp bullshit.
So without further ado...
And now, our special guest tonight, Joyce Watney.
I founded the LSU chapter of the Living Dead Alliance after having a deeply personal experience with a vampire.
My big sister, Julie Watney.
When I was 12 and she was 19, Julie disappeared.
We never saw her again until three years ago, when vampires came out of the coffin.
Mom, Dad, and I were having Sunday night dinner, and the doorbell rings, and it's Julie, wanting to know if she could watch us eat.
Are we the only vampires here?
Other than this one's sister we're about to trot out, yes, we are.
How can you have an event in honor of the living dead without any living dead?
It's like having a civil rights protest without any black people.
They're called African Americans, and maybe those protests wouldn't have turned into the bloodbaths they became if they hadn't been there.
Ever consider that?
...but you know what we say?
We say vampires gave us our Julie back.
They gave us a miracle.
So, put your hands together, please, for my big sister, and our family's miracle,
Ms. Julie Watney.
Watch it.
See that?
Place don't look worse for the wear.
Yeah, yeah, no, if you, I mean, if you ignore the frame d, uh, the bullet holes, and the general fucked-up-ness of everything.
Don't be bitter.
Hoyt, we witnessed a miracle tonight.
Mmm-hmm.
Is this yours?
No.
No, that goes in the monster box.
The monster box?
Yeah, I packed all her shit up.
Well, she ain't a monster.
Sometimes things just... don't work out.
Man, I gave her my heart, I gave her my soul, I gave her my life.
Wanna see what I got in return?
These.
It's the only thing I got out of the year we spent together, so take the monster's CD, and put it in the monster's monster box, and you take it to her for me, will you?
You want me to take it to her?
Yeah.
She's at vampire Bill's house.
Just swing it by on your way home.
The thing is, it ain't... it ain't my place, getting mixed up in all this, so, uh...
Man, you're my best friend in the whole world, so if it ain't your place, whose place is it?
Please?
I don't wanna see her, all right?
Ever again.
Hey.
She fall asleep already?
Shh.
Can I help you?
My name is Sam Merlotte.
Is Marcus here?
We been expectin' you.
Well, I'm glad you came.
Nate here bet me 50 bucks you wouldn't.
Said you didn't have the balls.
Live and learn, Nate.
Ain't never smart betting' against me.
I reckon it wasn't.
Why am I here?
Stop fuckin' my wife.
First off, she ain't your wife no more.
Not really.
We're workin' shit out!
And second, you can't stop fuckin' somebody, when you ain't fuckin' 'em in the first place!
Now, screwing' another man's wife, well, that's one thing, but lookin 'him in the eye and lyin' about it...
I ain't lying'.
I ain't even touched her.
Yeah, right.
Nice try.
Can't say the same about my brother, though, 'cause he had her every which way.
Told me she was sweet, too.
Shit.
Don't bet against you, huh?
Goddamn it, Marcus, call 'em off!
Who's the smart money on now?
Hey, Marcus, you gave me your word!
He mouthed off to me!
So the fuck what?
Look at him!
Oh, Jesus.
How'd the hell he do that?
That ain't Merlotte.
That's his brother.
Fuck.
Get him outta here.
Come on, Debbie.
I have to say, for a badass werewolf, you drive like a girl.
Sorry.
Today's media landscape is ratings-driven, and unfortunately, it's the Russell Edgingtons of the world who drive ratings.
But facts are facts, even if the fact is that facts are almost never heard.
So let's hear some, shall we?
Fact.
From July of last year...
Fact.
Human-on-vampire crime was also down almost 20%.
You have cornered me.
I surrender.
This is great!
...and I share your beliefs.
Jason.
Uh, where's the security?
Bill had an event at some hotel.
What are you doing here?
Um,
this box is for you.
It's all your stuff.
Hoyt said, he said he wanted you to have 'em, so.
That how he said it?
I might be parrot-phrasing a little.
Jessie, you all right?
Oh, I'm just fine.
If you ever need to talk...
Would you maybe wanna come in?
You know, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Okay.
Yeah.
So, I'm...
I'm, I'm gonna go.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh!
Thank you.
Do you want me to come in with you?
No.
No need to get into any more trouble on my account.
Go on, go home to Alcide.
And now I'd like to introduce to you one of the most generous benefactors the state of Louisiana has ever known,
Bon Temps entrepreneur and philanthropist, Mr. William Compton.
Can you even breathe?
'Cause I can't.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
What a wonderful night, for a wonderful cause.
But make no mistake, there is still much work to be done, for history teaches us that war can sound a louder call to action than can peace.
Right.
Yeah.
That a message of hate can seduce an impressionable mind far more readily than a message of love.
Which means we must remain vigilant...
Bill!
Sookie?
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Bill!
They're comin' for you, Bill!
Run!
I just wanted to inform you that I have Sheriff
Northman in custody.
Good work.
I'll see you at that tolerance thing on the 29th.
The King set me free.
(CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) There's a witch spell comin'...
That's supposed to make all the vampires walk out into the sun.
(JASON WHISPERING) Jess.
(FIRE EXPLODING) (CHANTING CONTINUES)
(SCREAMING)
(GRUNTING)
You just saved my life.
(MOANING)
- Let us meet.
- Where?
- The cemetery in Bon Temps.
- Midnight.
I wish you would have told me your brother was a skinwalker.
I can't forgive him for what he did to you.
I just kicked him out of my life for good.
(SADLY) I broke up with Hoyt.
So you just break his heart?
I can't help the way I feel.
No, I don't want any part of this!
Word is, something big's goin' down tonight with the witches and vampires.
You're a member of this pack, now,
- You gotta stay away from Sookie.
- Can't argue with that.
My baby be dead!
And you, the killer!
(DISTORTED VOICES) Huh?
(LOUD BANGING) (GASPING)
(TV PLAYING)
(SNORING)
- Who's he?
- Friend of mine.
I got a problem with that.
If we need to take this outside, let's do it.
You just pissed on the wrong boots, my friend.
I come in peace.
(CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Bill, she's casting a spell!
Demoness!
(YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
We meet again.
(GROWLING)
(GRUNTS)
Sookie!
Take that, fanger!
(YELLING)
(GROANS)
(GROWLING)
(PANTING)
Come on, Sookie, stay with me.
Come on, please!
(GRUNTS)

Sookie?
Sookie?
(GASPS)
Sookie, drink.
Come on!
I'm so sorry, I should never have let you come tonight.
Then why did you?
Werewolf, I'm gonna need you to shut the fuck up!
Come on, drink.
Sookie?
Don't look like she's takin' it.
That's because she isn't.
Does she even have a pulse?
Barely.
Come on.
Well, ain't there anything else we can do?
We can pray.
Werewolf and a vampire.
Who's gonna listen?
That, I do not know.

(WOMAN 1) He killed Beverleen!
MAN:
I silvered the son of a bitch... (WOMAN 2) She was my favorite ex-sister-in-law.
What in the hell did you bring him back here for?
He is under my control.
Tell them, blond one.
I am yours.
So fuckin' cool!
Wash your face.
TARA:
Bill offered you an olive branch tonight.
Why didn't you take it?
Everyone join hands.
We must cast a protective spell against the vampires, so we can be safe here.
I said join hands!
Um, I think I speak for everyone here when I say
I don't think this is what any of us signed up for.
Uh, does she speak for everyone?
She sure as hell speaks for me.
Not for me.
I didn't know what I was gettin' into, but I'm pleased as punch that I'm in it.
Good boy, Roy.
Thank you, Antonia.
Anybody else?
I found this stapled to a lamppost out front.
Tomorrow night we are going to go to this, and we are gonna take the blond one with us, so the whole world will see what vampires are capable of,
and what we are capable of doing to them.
Marnie...
My name is Antonia!
Jesus Christ.
Please, I'm begging you.
I got kids.
(RASPING) Nobody leaves.
Or what?
Try it, and you'll find out.
BILL:
Sookie.
You made it.
Where's Eric?
Sookie, you were shot.
You can't still...
Where is he?
I already have my men out looking for him.
Now that I know that you're all right,
I'll go and join them and I will search for him myself until...
Am I the only one here who thinks this is batshit crazy?
Sookie, you just came this close to dying', because of fuckin' fangers.
Again!
Every minute that we spend not looking for him...
ALCIDE:
Fine.
I'm done here.
I'm done.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR SHUTS)
Bill?
Thanks for the blood.
Anytime.
(SIGHS)
She finally fall asleep?
You should go, Sam.
This is not your problem.
Well, what if I want it to be my problem?
Trust me, you do not want Marcus to be your problem.
Is that why Emma couldn't get to sleep?
She's scared he'll come back?
Are you?
I ain't leaving'.
Well, it'll be worse for everyone if he does come back and you're still here.
Well, then let's nobody be here.
No.
No, I'm trying to teach Emma not to run from her problems.
Well, who said anything about runnin'?
I'm talkin' about the three of us, goin' campin', gettin' back to nature, and getting back to nature is 100% opposite of running away.
(SIGHS)
I don't wanna have to wake Emma up.
Just carry her from her bed to the back seat.
She won't know anything till she wakes up to breakfast cooked on a campfire.
If it's sharing' a tent that's stoppin' you, you don't have to worry.
I am a multiple tent owner.
Oh, are you?
Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal.
(CHUCKLES)
(INHALES)
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
(DIALOGUE ON TV)
(SNIFFS)
(DOOR OPENS)
(SNIFFING)
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TV TURNS OFF)
(SNIFFLING) So then, I go over to Jason's house, because I thought maybe he might, like, understand what I was going through, but he just kicked me out also.
(SNIFFS)
And this is just the worst day of my life.
I wish I was dead.
Except I am, and it doesn't even matter.
(SNIFFS)
There have been times, I'll admit, (CRYING) when it's occurred to me that maybe I should put my career on hold and become a maker,
but these last several hours here with you have erased those doubts forever.
You are nothing like you are on TV.
(DOOR OPENS)
Aw, thanks.
Nan.
NAN:
I thought it best I go to ground here, what with the Festival of Tolerance event starting so early tomorrow night.
Saw you on the news, by the way.
You did quite well.
Really got in front of the story.
Speaking of, what is the story, my king?
What have you gone and fucked up now?
(JESSICA CRYING)
I almost hesitate to ask, but lest there be more surprises, is there anything else I need to know?
Only that Northman is missing.
What?
How?
Last we spoke, you were about to show him the true death.
I changed my mind.
Decisive leader you've turned out to be.
We'll have to cancel tomorrow night.
It's possible that Eric has fallen under Antonia's influence, just as Luis did.
Canceling is not an option.
What is so important about this event that you are willing to risk your life and mine?
There are factions within...
Factions within what?
The AVL?
The Authority?
Unless you tell me,
I cannot agree to...
Right now crews from CNN, VTV, Fox News and bloggers from across the country are already outside the hotel, waiting.
What would you have me tell them?
Blame the witches.
America's had no problem doing it in the past.
I didn't think it was possible, but you actually make me long for Queen Sophie-Anne.
I mean, what the fuck, Bill?
How did you let it come to this?
It was you that let it come to this!
I don't see how I'm responsible...
And there is the problem in a nutshell!
Everybody can see it but you.
Beyond tomorrow's headline, u are a blind person.
(GROWLS)
I would just love for you to say that to my face when I'm not chained in silver.
It's what I've been saying all along!
Bolster security if you feel it necessary, but tomorrow's Festival of Tolerance is going forward, and the cameras had damn well better find you in a festive and tolerant fucking mood.
Am I understood?
Perfectly.

Come on, baby.
Ooh, we're home now.
We're home now, baby boy.
(COOS)
Yeah, we home.
Oh, my baby.
Lafayette?
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!
Whoa, man, this ain't your house.
That ain't your baby, either.
That's Mikey!
This is my baby!
Now get out of my house, you.
What the fuck, Lafayette?
This my baby.
It's his daddy that came and took him, I know it was.
Uh, Arlene...
Ain't that his daddy, standing right there?
Well why are you treating us like criminals?
We didn't abduct our own child!
I'm just trying to get the story straight.
Without it, we got no idea where to look.
You hear that, Terry?
We're dealing with amateurs.
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to find him ourselves!
I mean, u know, is he here?
Is he here?
Huh?
(GASPS) Oh, y'all need to stop touching' shit!
ARLENE:
Just look everywhere.
ANDY:
This here's crime scene.
Sons of bitches took my gun.
They took my son, cuz.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Deputy Jason Stackhouse.
(HOYT ON PHONE) J, it's me.
Uh, Lafayette just walked through my front door, with Arlene's baby, a doll, and a gun.
JASON:
Andy.
Arlene?
Arlene.
Hoyt's got the baby.
(GASPS) At his place.
I knew that Fortenberry kid wasn't right.
Stay put, Bubba, we'll be right there.
JASON:
Anything else I need to know?
Had one just like him in my platoon, just big and wrong.
He says Lafayette nearly took a shot at him.
With my gun?
Lafayette took Mikey?
Hoyt also said he came running out of the house with no pants on, so we need to get him pants.
What?
We don't have time for that!
It won't take but a minute, and I don't wanna see that shit.
ARLENE:
Terry!
I'm comin' with you.
No, you ain't.
Stackhouse!
They ain't.
No.
JASON:
Terry.
Damn it.
JASON:
Arlene?
ARLENE:
That is my child.
TERRY:
It's our child.

Sookie.
Bill?
What are you doing here?
Ask Sookie.
It's her dream.
Sookie?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Yes, you do.
Tell him.
BILL:
Tell him you never stopped loving me.
Is this true?
What?
Now everyone can hear everyone?
Is it?
Well, yes, but it's not my fault.
He gave me his blood.
And he gave u his.
(GROWLS) Sookie is mine.
Eric, don't.
(GROWLS) Bullshit!
She's mine!
Guys, I don't want you two fighting' over me, please!
I'm ten times your age.
And I love her twenty times as much!
Goddamn it, stop!
Thank you.
Now, this is my dream, so both y'all need to shut up and listen to me.
Come on.
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Get your butts in the living room.
We need to have a little talk.
"Sam, I came to say goodbye, but you wasn't here, so I'm writin' you instead.
"I fucked up."
(SNIFFING)
I'm lookin' for Sam Merlotte.
He around?
Who's askin'?
Name's Marcus.
Marcus what?
He knows who I am.
Well, he ain't around, Marcus He-knows-who-I-am.
(CHUCKLES)
Who are you?
His brother.
No shit.
Shifter got hisself a shifter brother, huh?
(LAUGHS)
All right, then.
You give him this, will you?
I'll be waitin' for him tonight.
You tell him to be there, or else he gonna have a bigger fuckin' problem on his hands than he already got.
I'll be sure and do that.
Our perp still inside?
Yup.
The son of a bitch.
Y'all bring me any pants?
Andy got 'em.
Andy!
Pants.
Oh, I forgot.
You went in the room to get 'em!
Well, indict me for being a little on edge, why don't you?
It's my kin in there!
Stay back.
Lafayette!
ANDY:
Lafayette, you in there?
Goddamn it.
It's Sheriff Bellefleur, Lafayette.
LAFAYETTE:
You sound like a white man, you!
You know damn well I'm a white man!
LAFAYETTE:
No chance is I openin' no door for no white man, me.
Open the door, you racist shitbag, or I will open it the fuck up for you!
Andy?
You hear me?
Hey!
Protocol is to defuse the situation.
Fuck that!
This situation became pre-un-defused the minute that she-male broke into my house.
Lafayette Reynolds, on behalf of Renard Parish, the state of Louisiana, and Jesus Christ his fuckin' self,
- What are you...
- ready or not, here we come!
Andy!
Don't even think about it, Lafayette.
I ain't gonna let you shoot him.
Drop the weapon.
Hand over the baby.
ANDY:
It's my weapon.
Get out of my house!
JASON:
Andy, come on!
(GLASS BREAKING)
(GRUNTS)
ANDY:
Oh, Jesus, fuck!
Holy shit!
Y'all all right?
How'd you let him get the drop on you, Stackhouse?
What the hell was I supposed to do, shoot him with the baby in his arms?
ANDY:
Shit.
JASON:
Fuck!
JASON:
What are you doing here?
I told y'all not to me!
Go away, yous!
I got plenty more bullets, me!
Why are you doing this, Lafayette?
My name's Mavis.
ANDY:
He's lost it.
Mavis?
I'm goin' in.
No quarter.
JASON:
No, no, no, no.
We can't let you do that.
(GRUNTING)
What the hell, cuz?
Let us handle this.
Get the fuck offa me!
Let me go!
ANDY:
You ain't goin' nowhere!
TERRY:
Off my goddamn arms!
You're just jealous 'cause I got a wife and a life and a baby to love, and you got nothin' and nobody!
(GROANING)
TERRY:
How'd you get so fuckin' strong?
(TERRY GROANS)
C'mere, bunny!
She seems to have forgotten all about last night's drama.
What is it, Sam, do you need to hear me say it?
I'm a weak man, Luna, I kinda do.
You were right.
Ah.
This was a great idea.
You're the best.
(CHUCKLES)
That's what I'm talking about.
(CHUCKLES)
At school, we have this regular bunny.
She lets you hold her.
These nature bunnies, all they do is run away.
That's because nature bunnies are smart, and like to exercise.
School bunnies are fat and lazy.
Uh, we don't say "fat."
(WHISPERING) Oh, sorry.
(WHISPERING) It's okay.
I hope I turn out to be a shifter instead of a werewolf.
Where'd that come from, bug?
Because if I'm a shifter, one day I can be my own bunny and pet myself whenever I want.
Emma, whatever you wind up being is what you're supposed to be, and you're perfect, understand?
What are you getting all serious for?
I just wanna pet a bunny.
Girl wants to pet a bunny.
I'm gonna go catch her that bunny.
EMMA:
Yay.
Gimme a minute.
SAM:
One minute.
SAM:
Come here, little guy.
He's so cute!
Isn't he?
I could be dreaming about anything.
I could be swimming with dolphins, or eating a whole pie without any consequences, but instead I'm here with the two of you.
Now, that's gotta mean something.
I'm afraid to ask what.
I think,
I think I'm in love with both of you.
You can't be.
That's not who you are.
Only because I've always been this self-conscious, good little girl who's too scared to think outside the box, especially when it comes to love and sex.
But as of right now, I'm putting that little girl behind me.
What exactly are you proposing?
That I can love both of you.
That I don't have to be yours, or yours.
I'm proposing that the two of you... be mine.
I'm the king of Louisiana.
I do not share.
You have to choose.
(LAUGHING) Okay, first of all, you guys are vampires.
What's with all the morality?
And second of all, this is such a double standard.
When it's two women and one guy, everyone's hunky-dory with it, even if they barely know each other.
But when a woman tries to have her way with two men she is totally and completely in love with,
everyone's hemming' and hawing'.
I'm sayin' I love you.
Both of you.
And, I'm asking you to love me back.
Together.
It's either both of you, or nothin' at all.
Take it or leave it.
(MOANING)
(GASPS)
(SIGHS)
One drop at a time, girlfriend, okay?
No more.
This shit's a whole other level.
You ever drink V directly from the source?
You ever put your face up against a vampire's cold skin, and just sucked it right out of him?
Fuck no.
Well, I have, so don't be a cunt!
(GRUNTING)
Just breathe.
Breathe.
(GASPS)
It's not real.
It's the V. It'll pass.
I'm puttin' you in charge of this.
That's the first good decision you made all day.
Jesus, the hell you doin' here?
I called him.
Hey!
Get, get down!
Why is he doin' this?
I have no idea.
Hey, come here.
Hey, hey.
I got a theory.
When you guys, uh, role-play, does Lafayette ever turn into a woman named Mavis?
I'm gonna forget you just said that, and I'm gonna head on in.
JASON:
Hey, hey, he's got a gun.
JESUS:
I'm goin' in, Jason.
It's, it's against protocol.
What, you're gonna shoot me?
I'm gonna get your baby back.
I'm goin' with.
Echelon formation.
Right now he's defiladed, but if I approach from the flanks...
Terry, I'm a nurse.
I'm not even gonna pretend to understand what you just said, but I think I should go in by myself.
Okay, but what if I...
Baby, no.
I do not wanna fight fire with fire.
Don't worry.
I got this.
ARLENE:
Stay here.
ARLENE:
Let him go in.
Goddamn it.
He's a nurse.
He's just a nurse.
Oh, fuck.
(LAFAYETTE SINGING SOFTLY IN FRENCH)
(COOING)
(LAFAYETTE SPEAKING IN FRENCH)
LAFAYETTE:
Just you and me now, you.
Lafayette?
Who you with, you?
Monsieur Virgil?
What's your name?
Is it Mavis?
What you want, you?
I just wanna help.
(COOING)
Okay?
And I think I can.
I'm a brujo.
A practitioner of magic.
I got all the magic I need, me, right here.
I'm sorry, Mavis, but he is not your baby.
You lie!
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Why you come to take my baby, hmm?
That woman out there who's been crying for hours, she is this baby's mami .
You broke into their house and you took him from her!
I would never take another woman's baby.
I know, I know.
I think something happened to you, something you never made peace with.
I don't know what, but whatever it was, it killed you.
I no dead.
Now your spirit is looking for a way back, and since my boyfriend is a medium, you found it by entering his body.
Boyfriend?
Oh!
Oh, no!
How I make the baby with this, me?
You didn't.
(GASPING)
(WHIMPERING) My baby.
My baby boy.
He dead?
No!
I'm so sorry, Mavis.
No!
I am so, so sorry.
(SOBBING)
I just wanna hold him, just one, just one last time.
(BABY COOING)
You.
You got that kind of magic in you?
We can try.
(INHALES)
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
Okay, but if you do find Mr. Northman, please have King Bill call me, or you call me, or, I don't know, something.
(KNOCKING)
Hey there, Sookie.
Hope you like flowers.
Come in.
Alcide was the first, the only, man that I ever loved, if you count out Coot, which believe me, I really wish I could.
(CHUCKLES)
(CLEARS THROAT)
So when I saw Alcide with you, and the way he cared about you, I just...
Debbie,
I understand being jealous, but you tried to kill me.
That ain't somethin' you can expect someone to forget.
(WHISPERING) I don't.
That's not why I came.
I know you're in trouble, and I'm wondering if there's anything I could do to help, that's all.
Did Alcide tell you I was in trouble?
He didn't have to.
He came home last night with your blood on him.
If he didn't tell you, how did you know the blood was mine?
Because I remember the smell.
Look, I ain't asking to be best friends.
You know, I'd be crazy if I expected that, and I ain't crazy.
But can't we try and make things better just a little at a time?
Don't talk.
Just let me listen.
- What?
- Shh.
...love Alcide, love him so much, there ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for him.
Why can't she just believe me?
I need her to see that I wanna help.
Okay.
I believe you.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay. (CHUCKLES)
Good!
(CHUCKLES)
You know, Alcide told me that you think it's a curse, being what you are.
But I think it'd be nice to know what people are thinkin' every once in a while.
He loves you.
He really does.
Thank you.
So, you really wanna help?
'Cause I sure as heck could use some.
(CHUCKLES)
(JESUS SPEAKING SPANISH)
Please, just let me hold him one last time!
Please!
Tell me the last thing you remember.
Him, me was outside fighting'.
"I wanna see my baby."
I tell him I wanna hold him, but he say I couldn't.
He want to get away from me, but I followed him inside the house, me.
Why?
Why can't I hold him?
And then he told me,
"Because, Sugar, I already done buried him."
(CRYING) He already buried my...
I don't want to go through this again, you.
I just wanna know where my baby is.
Which is why you have to go through this.
Monsieur Virgil went into the kitchen.
(MAVIS WAILING) Please... (MR. VIRGIL) Stop!
He was standin' by the sink.
MAVIS:
Please...
He wouldn't look at me.
(MR. VIRGIL AND MAVIS YELLING)
MAVIS: ...and look me in the eyes!
So I started tugging on him to make him look!
MAVIS:
Look at me!
And then it was inside of me.
(SLASHING SOUND)
What was it?
The knife.
Then I just fell to the floor, (BODY THUDDING TO FLOOR) floated up and watched myself die.
What happened next?
He started shoveling.
I couldn't take it no more, me, so I left.
Where was he shoveling?
Out there, yonder, under the tree.
JESUS:
Don't shoot!
(BABY CRYING)
We're comin' out!
Mikey?
You got the shot, Stackhouse, take him out.
They ain't even got the gun no more, Andy.
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.
JESUS:
Hoyt, we need a shovel.
HOYT:
A shovel?
What the hell for?
Just get it.
(BABY CRYING) Hi, sweet boy.
Come here, Sweet Pea.
(CRYING)
ARLENE:
Oh, hey, sweet boy.
I can't say how sorry I am 'bout all this, me.
Don't worry about it.
Sometimes these things happen.
We still love you, Lafayette.
My name's Mavis.
My boy.
My sweet baby boy.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
ARLENE:
Oh, my heart hurts, I love you so much.
What you said, about me movin' up in the pack?
I want in.
Well, what changed 'tween then and now?
You want honesty or you just want me to kiss the ring?
Well, I'll take honesty every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
It's important to Debbie.
That's it?
What's important to Debbie's gotta be important to me, now more than ever.
I mean it.
Whatever you need, I'm there.
Well, you know what I call a dude that'll admit there ain't nothin' he won't do for the woman he loves?
What?
A man.
(CHUCKLES)
To Shreveport.
To Shreveport.
Hey, what are you up to the rest of the night?
Wide open.
Well, you might have heard me talk about my wife before.
We're, uh, separated, going through a rough patch.
And now some fuckin' shifter is lookin' to replace me.
Shit.
Right?
Anyways, I got this son of a bitch of hers stopping' by a little later on for a talk.
(SIGHS)
I was hopin' you wouldn't mind sticking' around.
It ain't my style to go beatin' on people I got no beef with.
Now that's, that's not what I'm askin' for,
I swear.
I just need to communicate with him that I can, and I will, hurt him if I have to.
Since you're about six-six and wider than a door, he might be more inclined to listen with you standin' behind me.
To communicating' shit.
To communicating' shit.
(CHUCKLES)
(JASON GRUNTING)
I want you to know how sorry I am, Stackhouse.
And I want you to know how little that means to me, 'cause I heard it all before, too many times.
Why don't you do something useful and turn on the lights, 'cause we can't see shit down there.
Think I got somethin'.
JESUS:
What?
What down there?
I don't know.
You think it's him, you?
I think it's both of you.
(SINGING IN FRENCH)
(COOS)
LAFAYETTE:
My baby.
It's time.
You found him and you held him, but now I need my Lafayette back.
Oh, where, where I go?
It's not for us to know.
(CHANTING IN SPANISH)
Holy fuck.
ARLENE:
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle.
(STOPS CHANTING)
MAVIS:
Monsieur Lafayette, thank you for everything.
You got it, bitch.
(SINGING IN FRENCH)
(KNOCKING)
We are closed for the evening.
I know what you're up against.
I know who you're up against.
I said we're closed.
(GROWLING)
I represent the Shreveport pack of werewolves.
(GROWLS)
I come to pledge our allegiance to your cause.
MARNIE (ANTONIA):
So tell me, young lady, exactly what are you offering?
Support.
Hmm.
Muscle.
Hmm.
We hate vampires every bit as much as you do.
Well, I doubt that.
(DIALOGUE CONTINUES UNINTELLIGIBLY)
MARNIE (ANTONIA):
How so?
DEBBIE:
What else?
Money, drugs.
DEBBIE:
Got to the point where pretty much my entire pack is... (DIALOGUE CONTINUES UNINTELLIGIBLY)
(WHISPERING) Eric!
Sookie.
Hey, come on, let's get you out of here.
You should go.
You're under her spell, aren't you?
What is she making you do?
Kill the king.
Kill the king?
You mean Bill?
Goddamn it, Sook.
How fuckin' stupid can you be?
What little I know about werewolves is that werewolves do not like to be known.
Why are you making yourselves known to me now?
Uh, like, like I said, you know, on account of your cause and all.
(WHISPERING) Sookie Stackhouse!
The telepath?
Yes, who aids vampires.
I brought her to you.
Tara!
Do not shoot!
This one could be of use to us.
Uh, okay.
Oh, Sookie.
Just drop the gun!
HOLLY:
Sookie.
Shoot her, shoot her, shoot her!
Fucking chill, Roy!
You always been stupid, but comin' here has gotta be about the stupidest shit I ever heard of.
Are you even listenin' to me?
We're all being held hostage.
Bill's at the Dorcester Hotel.
Keep her here.
Charge me, Sookie.
Charge me now!
(GUN FIRES)
No!
No, no, no!
(ANTONIA YELLING)
I'm really fuckin' sorry, Antonia, but she charged me
Y'all saw it!
Fuckin' werewolf.
SOOKIE:
Debbie!
Shit.
(CAR STARTING)
You had me worried sick.
Shreveport, Dorcester.
Now.
Mr. Northman, it's time to go.
Yes, Antonia.
Uh, Roy, you come with.
(WHISPERING) Yes.
The rest of you stay here.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
WOMAN:
I can't take this anymore, I can't, I mean,
I mean, I don't even think I'm a real Wiccan!
I was just doing this to piss off my parents!
Let's get the fuck outta here!
(SCREAMS)
(AGONIZED MOANING)
Are you all right?
Try the front door!
(WOMAN 2) I'm already on it!
(WOMAN 2 SCREAMING IN PAIN)
Oh, fuck.
MAN:
I am risking' life and limb here tonight, so that all of you across this great country of ours can witness Shreveport, Louisiana's pre-Halloween pageantry of vamp bullshit.
So without further ado...
EMCEE:
And now, our special guest tonight, Joyce Watney.
(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
I founded the LSU chapter of the Living Dead Alliance after having a deeply personal experience with a vampire.
My big sister, Julie Watney.
(CAMERA SNAPS)
When I was 12 and she was 19, Julie disappeared.
We never saw her again until three years ago, when vampires came out of the coffin.
Mom, Dad, and I were having Sunday night dinner, and the doorbell rings,
(CHOKING UP) and it's Julie, wanting to know if she could watch us eat.
(APPLAUSE)
Are we the only vampires here?
Other than this one's sister we're about to trot out, yes, we are.
How can you have an event in honor of the living dead without any living dead?
It's like having a civil rights protest without any black people.
They're called African Americans, and maybe those protests wouldn't have turned into the bloodbaths they became if they hadn't been there.
Ever consider that?
JOYCE WATNEY: ...but you know what we say?
We say vampires gave us our Julie back.
They gave us a miracle.
So, put your hands together, please, for my big sister, and our family's miracle,
Ms. Julie Watney.
Watch it.
See that?
Place don't look worse for the wear.
Yeah, yeah, no, if you, I mean, if you ignore the frame d, uh, the bullet holes, and the general fucked-up-ness of everything.
Don't be bitter.
Hoyt, we witnessed a miracle tonight.
Mmm-hmm.
Is this yours?
No.
No, that goes in the monster box.
The monster box?
Yeah, I packed all her shit up.
Well, she ain't a monster.
Sometimes things just... don't work out.
Man, I gave her my heart, I gave her my soul, I gave her my life.
Wanna see what I got in return?
These.
It's the only thing I got out of the year we spent together, so take the monster's CD, and put it in the monster's monster box, and you take it to her for me, will you?
You want me to take it to her?
Yeah.
She's at vampire Bill's house.
Just swing it by on your way home.
The thing is, it ain't... it ain't my place, getting mixed up in all this, so, uh...
Man, you're my best friend in the whole world, so if it ain't your place, whose place is it?
Please?
I don't wanna see her, all right?
Ever again.
(TENT UNZIPPING)
Hey.
She fall asleep already?
Shh.
Can I help you?
My name is Sam Merlotte.
Is Marcus here?
We been expectin' you.
(MEN CHATTERING)
MARCUS:
Well, I'm glad you came.
Nate here bet me 50 bucks you wouldn't.
Said you didn't have the balls.
Live and learn, Nate.
Ain't never smart betting' against me.
I reckon it wasn't.
Why am I here?
Stop fuckin' my wife.
First off, she ain't your wife no more.
Not really.
We're workin' shit out!
And second, you can't stop fuckin' somebody, when you ain't fuckin' 'em in the first place!
Now, screwing' another man's wife, well, that's one thing, but lookin 'him in the eye and lyin' about it...
I ain't lying'.
I ain't even touched her.
BIKER:
Yeah, right.
Nice try.
Can't say the same about my brother, though, 'cause he had her every which way.
Told me she was sweet, too.
(ROARS)
(GRUNTING)
Shit.
(MOANING)
NATE:
Don't bet against you, huh?
Goddamn it, Marcus, call 'em off!
NATE:
Who's the smart money on now?
(MOANING)
(GROWLING)
Hey, Marcus, you gave me your word!
He mouthed off to me!
So the fuck what?
(MOANING LOUDLY)
Look at him!
(CHOKING SOUNDS)
Oh, Jesus.
BIKER:
How'd the hell he do that?
That ain't Merlotte.
That's his brother.
Fuck.
Get him outta here.
(GROWLING)
Come on, Debbie.
I have to say, for a badass werewolf, you drive like a girl.
Sorry.
NAN:
Today's media landscape is ratings-driven, and unfortunately, it's the Russell Edgingtons of the world who drive ratings.
But facts are facts, even if the fact is that facts are almost never heard.
So let's hear some, shall we?
NAN:
Fact.
From July of last year...
Fact.
Human-on-vampire crime was also down almost 20%.
You have cornered me.
I surrender.
(CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
This is great!
...and I share your beliefs.
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)
Jason.
Uh, where's the security?
Bill had an event at some hotel.
What are you doing here?
Um,
this box is for you.
It's all your stuff.
Hoyt said, he said he wanted you to have 'em, so.
That how he said it?
I might be parrot-phrasing a little.
Jessie, you all right?
Oh, I'm just fine.
If you ever need to talk...
Would you maybe wanna come in?
You know, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Okay.
Yeah.
So, I'm...
I'm, I'm gonna go.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh!
(MOANING)
Thank you.
Do you want me to come in with you?
No.
No need to get into any more trouble on my account.
Go on, go home to Alcide.
And now I'd like to introduce to you one of the most generous benefactors the state of Louisiana has ever known,
Bon Temps entrepreneur and philanthropist, Mr. William Compton.
Can you even breathe?
'Cause I can't.
BILL:
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
What a wonderful night, for a wonderful cause.
But make no mistake, there is still much work to be done, for history teaches us that war can sound a louder call to action than can peace.
CROWD:
Right.
Yeah.
That a message of hate can seduce an impressionable mind far more readily than a message of love.
Which means we must remain vigilant...
SOOKIE:
Bill!
Sookie?
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
(LOUD GRUNT)
(SCREAMING)
Bill!
SOOKIE:
They're comin' for you, Bill!
Run!
(ROCK SONG PLAYING)
( theme music playing )
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Come on, Sookie, stay with me.
Come on, please.
Sookie?
Sookie?
Sookie, drink.
Come on.
I'm so sorry, I should never have let you come tonight.
Then why did you?
Werewolf, I'm gonna need you to shut the fuck up.
Come on, drink.
Sookie?
- Don't look like she's taking it.
- Because she isn't.
- Does she even have a pulse?
- Barely.
Come on.
Well, ain't there anything else we can do?
We can pray.
Werewolf and a vampire.
Who's gonna listen?
That, I do not know.
- He killed Beverleen.
- The son of a bitch!
- She was my favorite ex-sister-in-law.
- What did you bring him back here for?
He is under my control.
Tell them, blond one.
- I am yours.
- So fucking cool.
Wash your face.
Bill offered you an olive branch tonight.
Why didn't you take it?
Everyone join hands.
We must cast a protective spell against the vampires so we can be safe here.
I said, join hands.
I think I speak for everyone here when I say I don't think this is what any of us signed up for.
Does she speak for everyone?
She sure as hell speaks for me.
Not for me.
I didn't know what I was getting into, but I'm pleased as punch that I'm in it.
- Good boy, Roy.
- Thank you, Antonia.
Anybody else?
I found this stapled to a lamppost out front.
Tomorrow night we are going to go to this and we are gonna take the blond one with us so the whole world will see what vampires are capable of.
And what we are capable of doing to them.
- Marnie?
- My name is Antonia.
Jesus Christ.
Please, I'm begging you.
I got kids.
Nobody leaves.
Or what?
Try it, and you'll find out.
Sookie.
You made it.
Where's Eric?
Sookie, you were shot.
- You can't still--
- Where is he?
I have my men out looking for him.
Now that you're all right I'll go and join them and search myself--
Am I the only one here who thinks this is batshit crazy?
Sookie, you just came this close to dying because of fucking fangers.
Again.
Every minute that we spend not looking for him--
Fine.
I'm done here.
I'm done.
Bill?
Thanks for the blood.
Anytime.
She finally fall asleep?
You should go, Sam.
This is not your problem.
Well, what if I want it to be my problem?
Trust me, you do not want Marcus to be your problem.
Is that why Emma couldn't get to sleep?
She's scared he'll come back?
Are you?
I ain't leaving.
Well, it'll be worse for everyone if he does come back and you're still here.
Well, then let's nobody be here.
No.
No, I'm trying to teach Emma not to run from her problems.
Well, who said anything about running?
I'm talking about the three of us going camping, getting back to nature, and getting back to nature is the 100 percent opposite of running away.
I don't wanna have to wake Emma up.
Just carry her from her bed to the back seat.
She won't know anything till she wakes up to breakfast cooked on a campfire.
If it's sharing a tent that's stopping you, you don't have to worry.
- I am a multiple tent owner.
- Oh, are you?
Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
From this point they travel to a costume shop.
Now they seem to make some selections at the costume shop.
- Leave--
- Wait.
- For a drink.
It's a very difficult--
- Oh, my God!
That is my sister!
She gets into his vehicle and it's difficult to see.
They spend some time in there before he gets out, straightens himself up....
On this day we again had our detective outside of Jake's place.
Tonight he leaves--
So then I go over to Jason's house, because I thought maybe he might, like understand what I was going through, but he just kicked me out also.
And this is-- This is the worst day of my life.
I wish I was dead.
Except I am, and it doesn't even matter.
There have been times, I'll admit, when it's occurred to me that maybe I should put my career on hold and become a maker.
But these last several hours here with you have erased those doubts forever.
You are nothing like you are on TV.
Oh, thanks.
Nan.
I thought it best I go to ground here, what with the Festival of Tolerance event starting so early tomorrow night.
Saw you on the news, by the way.
You did quite well.
Really got in front of the story.
Speaking of, what is the story, my king?
What have you gone and fucked up now?
I almost hesitate to ask, but lest there be more surprises is there anything else I need to know?
Only that Northman is missing.
What?
How?
Last we spoke, you were about to show him the true death.
I changed my mind.
What a decisive leader you've turned out to be.
We'll have to cancel tomorrow night.
It's possible that Eric has fallen under Antonia's influence, just as Luis did.
Canceling is not an option.
What is so important about this event that you are willing to risk your life?
- There are factions within--
- Factions within what?
The AVL?
The Authority?
Unless you tell me, I cannot agree to--
Right now, crews from CNN, VTV, Fox News and bloggers from across the country are already outside the hotel waiting.
What would you have me tell them?
Blame the witches.
America's had no problem doing it in the past.
I didn't think it was possible but you actually make me long for Queen Sophie Anne.
I mean, what the fuck, Bill?
How did you let it come to this?
- It was you that let it come to this.
- I don't see how--
And there is the problem in a nutshell.
Everybody can see it but you.
Beyond tomorrow's headline, you are a blind person.
I would just love for you to say that to my face when I'm not chained in silver.
It's what I've been saying all along.
Bolster security if you feel it necessary but tomorrow's Festival of Tolerance is going forward and the cameras had damn well better find you in a festive and tolerant fucking mood.
Am I understood?
Perfectly.
Come on, baby.
We're home now.
We're home now, baby boy.
Yeah, we home.
Oh, my baby.
Lafayette?
Get out of my house.
- Get out of my house.
- Man, this ain't your house.
That ain't your baby, either.
That's Mikey.
This is my baby.
Now get out of my house, you.
What the fuck, Lafayette?
This my baby.
It's his daddy that came and took him, I know it was.
- Arlene?
- Ain't that his daddy, standing right there?
Well, why are you treating us like criminals?
We didn't abduct our own child.
I'm just trying to get the story straight.
Without it, we got no idea where to look.
Hear that?
We're dealing with amateurs.
We're just gonna have to find him ourselves.
I mean, you know, is he here?
Is he here?
Y'all need to stop touching shit.
- Just look everywhere.
- This here's a crime scene.
- Sons of bitches took my gun.
- They took my son, coz.
Deputy Jason Stackhouse.
J, it's me.
Lafayette just walked through my front door with Arlene's baby...
- ...a doll and a gun.
- Arlene?
Arlene?
Hoyt's got the baby.
I knew that Fortenberry kid wasn't right.
Be right there.
Anything else I need to know?
Had one just like him in my platoon, just big and wrong.
He says Lafayette nearly took a shot at him.
- With my gun?
- Lafayette took Mikey?
Hoyt also said he came running out of the house with no pants on.
- We need to get him pants.
- We don't have time.
Won't take but a minute.
I don't wanna see that shit.
- I'm coming with you.
- You ain't.
Stackhouse, he ain't.
- No.
- Terry.
- Damn it.
- Arlene?
- That is my child.
- It's our child.
Our child....
What?
It's daytime.
Sookie.
Bill?
What are you doing here?
Ask Sookie.
It's her dream.
- Sookie?
- I don't know what he's doing here.
Yes, you do.
Tell him.
Tell him you never stopped loving me.
Is this true?
What?
Now everyone can hear everyone?
- Is it?
- Well, yes.
But it's not my fault.
He gave me his blood.
He gave you his.
- Sookie is mine.
- Eric, don't.
Bullshit.
She's mine.
Guys, I don't want you two fighting over me, please.
- I'm 10 times your age.
- And I love her 20 times as much.
Goddamn it, stop.
Thank you.
Now, this is my dream, so both y'all need to shut up and listen to me.
Come on.
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Get your butts in the living room.
We need to have a little talk.
"Sam, I came to say goodbye but you wasn't here so I'm writing you instead.
I fucked up."
I'm looking for Sam Merlotte.
He around?
- Who's asking?
- Name's Marcus.
- Marcus what?
- He knows who I am.
Well, he ain't around, Marcus He-Knows-Who-l-Am.
- Who are you?
- His brother.
No shit.
Shifter got his self a shifter brother, huh?
All right, then.
You give him this, will you?
I'll be waiting for him tonight.
You tell him to be there or else he gonna have a bigger fucking problem on his hands than he already got.
I'll be sure and do that.
- Our perp still inside?
- Yup.
- The son of a bitch.
- Y'all bring me any pants?
Andy got them.
Andy.
Pants.
- I forgot.
- You went in the room to get them.
Well, indict me for being a little on edge, why don't you?
It's my kin in there.
Stay back.
Lafayette.
Lafayette, you in there?
Goddamn it.
It's Sheriff Bellefleur, Lafayette.
You sound like a white man, you!
You know damn well I'm a white man.
No chances I opening no door for no white man, me.
Open the door, you racist shitbag, or I will open it the fuck up for you.
- Andy?
- You hear me?
- Hey.
Protocol is to defuse the situation.
- Fuck that.
This situation became pre-undefused the minute that she-male broke into my house.
Lafayette Reynolds, on behalf of Renard Parish the state of Louisiana and Jesus Christ his fucking self...
- ...ready or not, here we come.
- What--?
Andy!
Don't even think about it, Lafayette.
I ain't gonna let you shoot him.
Drop the weapon.
- My weapon.
- Hand over the baby.
Get out of my house.
- Shit.
- Andy, come on, come on.
Fuck!
Jesus fuck!
Holy shit, you all right?
How'd you let him get the drop, Stackhouse?
What the hell was I supposed to do, shoot him with the baby in his arms?
- Shit.
- Fuck.
What are you doing here?
- I told y'all not to come.
- Go away, youse.
I got plenty more bullets, me.
- Why are you doing this, Lafayette?
- My name's Mavis.
- He's lost it.
- Mavis?
- I'm going in.
No quarter.
- No, no, no, no.
We can't let you do that.
- What the hell, coz?
- Let us handle this.
Get the fuck off of me.
Let me go.
- You ain't going nowhere.
- Get off my goddamn arms.
You're jealous because I got a wife and a life and a baby to love and you got nothing and nobody.
How'd you get so fucking strong?
Come here, bunny.
She seems to have forgotten all about last night's drama.
What is it, Sam, do you need to hear me say it?
I'm a weak man, Luna, I kind of do.
You were right.
This is a great idea.
You're the best.
That's what I'm talking about.
At school, we have this regular bunny.
She lets you hold her.
These nature bunnies, all they do is run away.
That's because nature bunnies are smart and like to exercise.
- School bunnies are fat and lazy.
- We don't say "fat."
- Oh, sorry.
- It's okay.
I hope I turn out to be a shifter instead of a werewolf.
Where'd that come from, bug?
Because if I'm a shifter, one day I can be my own bunny and pet myself whenever I want.
Emma, whatever you wind up being is what you're supposed to be and you're perfect, understand?
Why are you getting all serious for?
I just wanna pet a bunny.
Girl wants to pet a bunny.
I'm gonna go catch her that bunny.
Give me a minute.
One minute.
Come here, little guy.
- He's so cute.
- Isn't he?
I could be dreaming about anything.
I could be swimming with dolphins or eating a whole pie without any consequences but instead I'm here with the two of you.
Now, that's gotta mean something.
I'm afraid to ask what.
I think--
I think I'm in love with both of you.
You can't be.
That's not who you are.
Because I've always been this self-conscious good little girl who's too scared to think outside the box especially when it comes to love and sex.
But as of right now I'm putting that little girl behind me.
- What exactly are you proposing?
- That I can love both of you.
That I don't have to be yours or yours.
I'm proposing that the two of you be mine.
I'm the king of Louisiana.
I do not share.
You have to choose.
Okay, first of all, you guys are vampires.
What's with all the morality?
And second of all, this is such a double standard.
When it's two women and one guy everyone's hunky-dory with it even if they barely know each other.
But when a woman tries to have her way with two men she is totally and completely in love with everyone's hemming and hawing.
I'm saying I love you.
Both of you.
And I'm asking you to love me back.
Together.
It's either both of you, or nothing at all.
Take it or leave it.
One drop at a time, girlfriend, okay?
No more.
This shit's a whole other level.
You ever drink V directly from the source?
You ever push your face up against a vampire's cold skin...
- ...and just sucked it right out of him?
- Fuck no.
Well, I have.
So don't be a cunt.
Just breathe.
Breathe.
It's not real.
It's the V. It'll pass.
I'm putting you in charge of this.
That's the first good decision you made all day.
Jesus, what the hell you doing here?
I called him.
- Get down.
- Why is he doing this?
I have no idea.
Hey, come here.
Hey, hey.
I got a theory.
When you guys role-play does Lafayette ever turn into a woman named Mavis?
I'm gonna forget you said that, and I'm gonna head on in.
- Hey, hey, he's got a gun.
- I'm going in, Jason.
- It's against protocol.
- What, you're gonna shoot me?
I'm gonna get your baby back.
I'm going with.
Echelon formation.
Now he's defiladed.
If I approach from the flanks--
I'm a nurse.
I'm not even gonna pretend I understand what you just said.
- I should go in by myself.
- What if--?
- No.
I do not wanna fight fire with fire.
- Don't worry.
- I got this.
- Stay here.
Let him go in.
Goddamn it.
He's a nurse.
He's just a nurse.
Oh, fuck.
- Just you and me now, you.
- Lafayette?
Who you with, you?
Monsieur Virgil?
What's your name?
Is it Mavis?
- What you want, you?
- I just wanna help.
Okay?
And I think I can.
I'm a brujo.
- A practitioner of magic.
- I got all the magic I need, me, right here.
- I'm sorry, Mavis, but he is not your baby.
- You lie!
- No, no.
No, no.
- Why you come to take my baby?
That woman who's been crying, she is this baby's mommy.
You broke into their house and took him from her.
- I would never take another woman's baby.
- I know, I know.
I think something happened to you something you never made peace with.
And I don't know what, but whatever it was, it killed you.
I no dead.
Now your spirit is looking for a way back, and since my boyfriend is a medium you found it by entering his body.
Boyfriend?
How I make the baby with this, me?
- You didn't.
- No.
My baby, my baby boy.
He dead?
No.
I'm so sorry, Mavis.
I am so, so sorry.
I just wanna hold him.
Just one-
- Just one last time.
You, you got that kind of magic in you?
We can try.
Okay, but if you do find Mr. Northman, please have King Bill call me or you call me, or I don't know, something.
Hey there, Sookie.
Hope you like flowers.
Come in.
Alcide was the first, the only, man that I ever loved if you count out Coot, which believe me, I really wish I could.
So when I saw Alcide with you and the way he cared about you, I just--
Debbie, I understand being jealous, but you tried to kill me.
That ain't something you can expect someone to forget.
I don't.
That's not why I came.
I know you're in trouble and I'm wondering if there's anything I could do to help, that's all.
Did Alcide tell you I was in trouble?
He didn't have to.
He came home last night with your blood on him.
If he didn't tell you, how did you know the blood was mine?
Because I remember the smell.
Look, I ain't asking to be best friends.
You know, I'd be crazy if I expected that, and I ain't crazy.
But can't we try and make things better just a little at a time.
Don't talk.
Just let me listen.
What?
Love Alcide, love him so much.
Nothing I wouldn't do for him.
Why can't she believe me?
I need her to see that I wanna help.
Okay.
I believe you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Good.
You know, Alcide told me that you think it's a curse, being what you are.
But I think it'd be nice to know what people are thinking every once in a while.
He loves you.
He really does.
- Thank you.
- So....
You really wanna help?
Because I sure as heck could use some.
Please just let me hold him one last time!
Please!
Tell me the last thing you remember.
Him and me was outside fighting.
I wanna see my baby.
I tell him I wanna hold him but he say I couldn't.
He want to get away from me but I followed them inside.
Why?
Why can't I hold him?
And then he told me.
"Because, sugar, I already done buried him."
He already buried my boy.
I don't want to go through this again, you.
I just wanna know where my baby is.
Which is why you have to go through this.
Mr. Virgil went into the kitchen.
- Please.
- Stop!
- He was standing by the sink.
- Please!
He wouldn't look at me.
- And look me in the eyes.
- I started tugging on him to make him look.
- Look at me!
- And then it was inside of me.
- What was it?
- The knife.
Then I just fell to the floor, floated up and watched myself die.
- What happened next?
- He started shoveling.
I couldn't take it no more, me, so I left.
Where was he shoveling?
Out there, yonder, under the tree.
Don't shoot!
We're coming out!
Mikey.
You got the shot, Stackhouse, take him out.
They ain't even got the gun no more, Andy.
- Fuck me.
- Hoyt, we need a shovel.
- A shovel?
What the hell for?
- Just get it.
Hi, sweet boy.
I can't say how sorry I am about all this, me.
Don't worry about it.
Sometimes these things happen.
We still love you, Lafayette.
My name's Mavis.
My boy.
My sweet baby boy.
- It's gonna be okay.
- My heart hurts, I love you so much.
What you said, about me moving up in the pack?
I want in.
Well, what changed between then and now?
You want honesty or you just want me to kiss the ring?
Well, I'll take honesty every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
- It's important to Debbie.
- That's it?
What's important to Debbie's gotta be important to me, now more than ever.
I mean it.
Whatever you need, I'm there.
Well, you know what I call a dude that'll admit there ain't nothing he won't do for the woman he loves?
- What?
- A man.
- To Shreveport.
- To Shreveport.
Hey, what are you up to the rest of the night?
- Wide open.
- Well, you might have heard me talk about my wife before.
We're separated.
Going through a rough patch and now some fucking shifter is looking to replace me.
- Shit.
- Right?
Anyways, I got this son of a bitch of hers stopping by a little later on for a talk.
I was hoping you wouldn't mind sticking around.
It ain't my style to go beating on people I got no beef with.
Now that's-- That's not what I'm asking for, I swear.
I just need to communicate with him that I can and I will hurt him if I have to.
Since you're about 6'6" and wider than a door he might be more inclined to listen with you standing behind me.
- To communicating shit.
- To communicating shit.
I want you to know how sorry I am, Stackhouse.
And I want you to know how little that means to me because I heard it all before, too many times.
Do something useful and turn on the lights because we can't see shit down there.
Think I got something.
- What?
- What down there?
- I don't know.
- You think it's him, you?
I think it's both of you.
My baby.
It's time.
You found him and you held him but now I need my Lafayette back.
Where I go?
It's not for us to know.
Holy fuck.
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle.
Monsieur Lafayette.
- Thank you for everything.
- You got it, bitch.
We are closed for the evening.
I know what you're up against.
I know who you're up against.
I said, we're closed.
I represent the Shreveport pack of werewolves.
I come to pledge our allegiance to your cause.
So tell me, young lady, exactly what are you offering?
Support.
Muscle.
We hate vampires every bit as much as you do.
Well, I doubt that.
Look in my eyes.
Look in my soul.
If you don't see hatred....
All right, then.
I'll hear you out.
What's your sad vampire story?
Vampires kept their business from us, and we kept our business from them.
But when they came out of the coffin, the lines got blurred.
How so?
Well, money, drugs.
Got to the point where pretty much my entire pack was on some vampire's payroll.
We did all his dirty work while he slept all day.
In exchange he'd supply us with vampire blood.
- What does it do?
- What?
Vampire blood.
How does it make you feel?
Eric!
- Sookie.
- Hey, come on, let's get you out of here.
You should go.
You're under her spell, aren't you?
What is she making you do?
- Kill the king.
- Kill the king?
You mean Bill?
Goddamn it, Sook, how fucking stupid can you be?
What little I know about werewolves is that werewolves do not like to be known.
Why are you making yourselves known to me now?
Like I said, you know, on account of your cause and all.
Sookie Stackhouse.
- The telepath?
- Yes, who aids vampires.
I brought her to you.
Tara, do not shoot!
This one could be of use to us.
- Okay.
- Oh, Sookie.
- Just drop the gun.
- Sookie.
Shoot her, shoot her, shoot her!
- Fucking chill, Roy.
- You always been stupid but coming here has gotta be the stupidest shit I ever heard of.
Are you even listening to me?
We're all being held hostage.
Bill's at the Dorchester Hotel.
Charge me, Sookie.
Charge me now!
No!
No, no, no!
Tara, stop!
No!
I'm really fucking sorry, Antonia, but she charged me.
Y'all saw it!
Fucking werewolf.
- Debbie!
- Shit.
- You had me worried sick.
- Shreveport, Dorchester.
Now.
Mr. Northman, it's time to go.
Yes, Antonia.
Roy, you come with.
- Yes.
- The rest of you stay here.
I can't take this anymore.
I can't.
I mean, I mean--
I don't even think I'm a real Wiccan.
I was just doing this to piss off my parents.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Are you all right?
- Try the front door!
I'm already on it!
Oh, fuck.
I am risking life and limb here tonight so that all of you across this great country of ours can witness Shreveport Louisiana's pre-Halloween pageantry of vamp bullshit.
- So without further ado....
- Our special guest tonight, Joyce Watney.
I founded the LSU chapter of the Living Dead Alliance after having a deeply personal experience with a vampire.
My big sister, Julie Watney.
When I was 12 and she was 19, Julie disappeared.
We never saw her again, until three years ago when vampires came out of the coffin.
Mom, Dad and I were having Sunday night dinner and the doorbell rings, and it's Julie wanting to know if she could watch us eat.
Are we the only vampires here?
Other than this one's sister we're about to trot out, yes, we are.
How can you have an event in honor of the living dead without any living dead?
It's like having a civil rights protest without any black people.
They're called African-Americans.
Maybe those protests wouldn't have turned into bloodbaths if they hadn't been there.
Ever consider that?
But you know what we say?
We say vampires gave us our Julie back.
They gave us a miracle, so put your hands together, please for my big sister and our family's miracle, Ms. Julie Watney.
Watch it.
See that?
Place don't look worse for the wear.
Yeah, I mean, if you ignore the frame and the bullet holes and the general fucked-upness of everything.
Don't be bitter.
Hoyt, we witnessed a miracle tonight.
- Is this yours?
- No.
No, that goes in the monster box.
The monster box?
- Yeah, I packed all her shit up.
- Well, she ain't a monster.
Sometimes things just don't work out.
Man, I gave her my heart, I gave her my soul, I gave her my life.
Wanna see what I got in return?
These.
It's the only thing I got out of the year we spent together.
Take the monster's CD and put it in the monster's box and you take it to her for me, will you?
You want me to take it to her?
Yeah.
She's at Vampire Bill's house.
Just swing it by on your way home.
The thing is, it ain't--
It ain't my place, getting mixed up in all this, so--
Man, you're my best friend in the whole world so if it ain't your place, whose place is it?
Please?
I don't wanna see her, all right?
Ever again.
Hey.
She fall asleep already?
Can I help you?
My name is Sam Merlotte.
Is Marcus here?
We've been expecting you.
Who we got here?
About time.
Well, I'm glad you came.
Nate here bet me 50 bucks you wouldn't.
Said you didn't have the balls.
Live and learn, Nate.
Ain't never smart betting against me.
I reckon it wasn't.
- Why am I here?
- Stop fucking my wife.
First off, she ain't your wife no more.
Not really.
We're working shit out.
Second, you can't stop fucking somebody when you ain't fucking in the first place.
Now, screwing another man's wife, well, that's one thing but looking him in the eye and lying about it--
I ain't lying.
- I ain't even touched her.
- Yeah, right.
Nice try.
Can't say the same about my brother, though because he had her every which way.
Told me she was sweet too.
Shit.
- Don't bet against you, huh?
- Goddamn it, Marcus, call them off!
Who's the smart money on now?
Hey, Marcus, you gave me your word.
- He mouthed off to me.
- So the fuck what?
Look at him.
- Jesus.
- How the hell he do that?
That ain't Merlotte.
That's his brother.
Fuck.
Get him out of here.
Come on, Debbie.
I have to say, for a badass werewolf, you drive like a girl.
Sorry.
Today's media landscape is ratings-driven and unfortunately it's the Russell Edgingtons of the world who drive ratings.
But facts are facts even if the fact is that facts are almost never heard.
So let's hear some, shall we?
Fact: from July of....
Fact: human-on-vampire crime was also down almost 20 percent.
You have cornered me.
I surrender.
This is great.
And I share your beliefs.
Jason.
Where's the security?
Bill had an event at some hotel.
What are you doing here?
This box is for you.
It's all your stuff.
Hoyt said....
He said he wanted you to have them, so....
That how he said it?
I might be parrot-phrasing a little.
Jessie, you all right?
I'm just fine.
If you ever needed to talk....
Would you maybe wanna come in?
You know, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Okay.
Yeah.
So I'm....
I'm gonna go.
Okay.
Okay.
- Thank you.
- Do you want me to come in with you?
No.
No need to get into any more trouble on my account.
Go on, go home to Alcide.
And now I'd like to introduce to you one of the most generous benefactors the state of Louisiana has ever known.
Bon Temps entrepreneur and philanthropist Mr. William Compton.
Can you even breathe?
Because I can't.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
What a wonderful night for a wonderful cause.
But make no mistake.
There is still much work to be done for history teaches us that war can sound a louder call to action than can peace.
That's right, Bill.
That a message of hate can seduce an impressionable mind far more readily than a message of love.
- Which means we must remain vigilant--
- Bill!
- Sookie?
- Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Bill!
They're coming for you, Bill.
Run!
Come on, Sookie, stay with me.
Come on, please!
Sookie?
Sookie?
Sookie, drink.
Come on!
I'm so sorry, I should never have let you come tonight.
Then why did you?
Werewolf, I'm gonna need you to shut the fuck up!
Come on, drink.
Sookie?
Don't look like she's takin' it.
That's because she isn't.
Does she even have a pulse?
Barely.
Come on.
Well, ain't there anything else we can do?
We can pray.
Werewolf and a vampire.
Who's gonna listen?
That, I do not know.
He killed Beverleen!
I silvered the son of a bitch...
She was my favorite ex-sister-in-law.
What in the hell did you bring him back here for?
He is under my control.
Tell them, blond one.
I am yours.
So fuckin' cool!
Wash your face.
Bill offered you an olive branch tonight.
Why didn't you take it?
Everyone join hands.
We must cast a protective spell against the vampires, so we can be safe here.
I said join hands!
Um, I think I speak for everyone here when I say
I don't think this is what any of us signed up for.
Uh, does she speak for everyone?
She sure as hell speaks for me.
Not for me.
I didn't know what I was gettin' into, but I'm pleased as punch that I'm in it.
Good boy, Roy.
Thank you, Antonia.
Anybody else?
I found this stapled to a lamppost out front.
Tomorrow night we are going to go to this, and we are gonna take the blond one with us, so the whole world will see what vampires are capable of,
and what we are capable of doing to them.
Marnie...
My name is Antonia!
Jesus Christ.
Please, I'm begging you.
I got kids.
Nobody leaves.
Or what?
Try it, and you'll find out.
Sookie.
You made it.
Where's Eric?
Sookie, you were shot.
You can't still...
Where is he?
I already have my men out looking for him.
Now that I know that you're all right,
I'll go and join them and I will search for him myself until...
Am I the only one here who thinks this is batshit crazy?
Sookie, you just came this close to dying', because of fuckin' fangers.
Again!
Every minute that we spend not looking for him...
Fine.
I'm done here.
I'm done.
Bill?
Thanks for the blood.
Anytime.
She finally fall asleep?
You should go, Sam.
This is not your problem.
Well, what if I want it to be my problem?
Trust me, you do not want Marcus to be your problem.
Is that why Emma couldn't get to sleep?
She's scared he'll come back?
Are you?
I ain't leaving'.
Well, it'll be worse for everyone if he does come back and you're still here.
Well, then let's nobody be here.
No.
No, I'm trying to teach Emma not to run from her problems.
Well, who said anything about runnin'?
I'm talkin' about the three of us, goin' campin', gettin' back to nature, and getting back to nature is 100% opposite of running away.
I don't wanna have to wake Emma up.
Just carry her from her bed to the back seat.
She won't know anything till she wakes up to breakfast cooked on a campfire.
If it's sharing' a tent that's stoppin' you, you don't have to worry.
I am a multiple tent owner.
Oh, are you?
Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So then, I go over to Jason's house, because I thought maybe he might, like, understand what I was going through, but he just kicked me out also.
And this is just the worst day of my life.
I wish I was dead.
Except I am, and it doesn't even matter.
There have been times, I'll admit, when it's occurred to me that maybe I should put my career on hold and become a maker,
but these last several hours here with you have erased those doubts forever.
You are nothing like you are on TV.
Aw, thanks.
Nan.
I thought it best I go to ground here, what with the Festival of Tolerance event starting so early tomorrow night.
Saw you on the news, by the way.
You did quite well.
Really got in front of the story.
Speaking of, what is the story, my king?
What have you gone and fucked up now?
I almost hesitate to ask, but lest there be more surprises, is there anything else I need to know?
Only that Northman is missing.
What?
How?
Last we spoke, you were about to show him the true death.
I changed my mind.
Decisive leader you've turned out to be.
We'll have to cancel tomorrow night.
It's possible that Eric has fallen under Antonia's influence, just as Luis did.
Canceling is not an option.
What is so important about this event that you are willing to risk your life and mine?
There are factions within...
Factions within what?
The AVL?
The Authority?
Unless you tell me,
I cannot agree to...
Right now crews from CNN, VTV, Fox News and bloggers from across the country are already outside the hotel, waiting.
What would you have me tell them?
Blame the witches.
America's had no problem doing it in the past.
I didn't think it was possible, but you actually make me long for Queen Sophie-Anne.
I mean, what the fuck, Bill?
How did you let it come to this?
It was you that let it come to this!
I don't see how I'm responsible...
And there is the problem in a nutshell!
Everybody can see it but you.
Beyond tomorrow's headline, you are a blind person.
I would just love for you to say that to my face when I'm not chained in silver.
It's what I've been saying all along!
Bolster security if you feel it necessary, but tomorrow's Festival of Tolerance is going forward, and the cameras had damn well better find you in a festive and tolerant fucking mood.
Am I understood?
Perfectly.
Come on, baby.
Ooh, we're home now.
We're home now, baby boy.
Yeah, we home.
Oh, my baby.
Lafayette?
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!
Whoa, man, this ain't your house.
That ain't your baby, either.
That's Mikey!
This is my baby!
Now get out of my house, you.
What the fuck, Lafayette?
This my baby.
It's his daddy that came and took him, I know it was.
Uh, Arlene...
Ain't that his daddy, standing right there?
Well why are you treating us like criminals?
We didn't abduct our own child!
I'm just trying to get the story straight.
Without it, we got no idea where to look.
You hear that, Terry?
We're dealing with amateurs.
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to find him ourselves!
I mean, u know, is he here?
Is he here?
Huh?
Oh, y'all need to stop touching' shit!
Just look everywhere.
This here's crime scene.
Sons of bitches took my gun.
They took my son, cuz.
Deputy Jason Stackhouse.
J, it's me.
Uh, Lafayette just walked through my front door, with Arlene's baby, a doll, and a gun.
Andy.
Arlene?
Arlene.
Hoyt's got the baby.
At his place.
I knew that Fortenberry kid wasn't right.
Stay put, Bubba, we'll be right there.
Anything else I need to know?
Had one just like him in my platoon, just big and wrong.
He says Lafayette nearly took a shot at him.
With my gun?
Lafayette took Mikey?
Hoyt also said he came running out of the house with no pants on, so we need to get him pants.
What?
We don't have time for that!
It won't take but a minute, and I don't wanna see that shit.
Terry!
I'm comin' with you.
No, you ain't.
Stackhouse!
- They ain't.
No.
- Terry.
Damn it.
Arlene?
That is my child.
It's our child.
What?
It's daytime.
Sookie.
Bill?
What are you doing here?
Ask Sookie.
It's her dream.
Sookie?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Yes, you do.
Tell him.
Tell him you never stopped loving me.
Is this true?
What?
Now everyone can hear everyone?
Is it?
Well, yes, but it's not my fault.
He gave me his blood.
And he gave u his.
Sookie is mine.
Eric, don't.
Bullshit!
She's mine!
Guys, I don't want you two fighting' over me, please!
I'm ten times your age.
And I love her twenty times as much!
Goddamn it, stop!
Thank you.
Now, this is my dream, so both y'all need to shut up and listen to me.
Come on.
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Get your butts in the living room.
We need to have a little talk.
"Sam, I came to say goodbye, but you wasn't here, so I'm writin' you instead.
"I fucked up."
I'm lookin' for Sam Merlotte.
He around?
Who's askin'?
Name's Marcus.
Marcus what?
He knows who I am.
Well, he ain't around, Marcus He-knows-who-I-am.
Who are you?
His brother.
No shit.
Shifter got hisself a shifter brother, huh?
All right, then.
You give him this, will you?
I'll be waitin' for him tonight.
You tell him to be there, or else he gonna have a bigger fuckin' problem on his hands than he already got.
I'll be sure and do that.
Our perp still inside?
Yup.
The son of a bitch.
Y'all bring me any pants?
Andy got 'em.
Andy!
Pants.
Oh, I forgot.
You went in the room to get 'em!
Well, indict me for being a little on edge, why don't you?
It's my kin in there!
Stay back.
Lafayette!
Lafayette, you in there?
Goddamn it.
It's Sheriff Bellefleur, Lafayette.
You sound like a white man, you!
You know damn well I'm a white man!
No chance is I openin' no door for no white man, me.
Open the door, you racist shitbag, or I will open it the fuck up for you!
Andy?
You hear me?
Hey!
Protocol is to defuse the situation.
Fuck that!
This situation became pre-un-defused the minute that she-male broke into my house.
Lafayette Reynolds, on behalf of Renard Parish, the state of Louisiana, and Jesus Christ his fuckin' self,
- What are you...
- ready or not, here we come!
Andy!
Don't even think about it, Lafayette.
I ain't gonna let you shoot him.
Drop the weapon.
- Hand over the baby.
- It's my weapon.
Get out of my house!
Andy, come on!
Oh, Jesus, fuck!
Holy shit!
Y'all all right?
How'd you let him get the drop on you, Stackhouse?
What the hell was I supposed to do, shoot him with the baby in his arms?
- Shit.
- Fuck!
What are you doing here?
I told y'all not to me!
Go away, yous!
I got plenty more bullets, me!
Why are you doing this, Lafayette?
My name's Mavis.
He's lost it.
Mavis?
I'm goin' in.
No quarter.
No, no, no, no.
We can't let you do that.
What the hell, cuz?
Let us handle this.
Get the fuck offa me!
Let me go!
- You ain't goin' nowhere!
- Off my goddamn arms!
You're just jealous 'cause I got a wife and a life and a baby to love, and you got nothin' and nobody!
How'd you get so fuckin' strong?
C'mere, bunny!
She seems to have forgotten all about last night's drama.
What is it, Sam, do you need to hear me say it?
I'm a weak man, Luna, I kinda do.
You were right.
Ah.
This was a great idea.
You're the best.
That's what I'm talking about.
At school, we have this regular bunny.
She lets you hold her.
These nature bunnies, all they do is run away.
That's because nature bunnies are smart, and like to exercise.
School bunnies are fat and lazy.
Uh, we don't say "fat."
Oh, sorry.
It's okay.
I hope I turn out to be a shifter instead of a werewolf.
Where'd that come from, bug?
Because if I'm a shifter, one day I can be my own bunny and pet myself whenever I want.
Emma, whatever you wind up being is what you're supposed to be, and you're perfect, understand?
What are you getting all serious for?
I just wanna pet a bunny.
Girl wants to pet a bunny.
I'm gonna go catch her that bunny.
Yay.
Gimme a minute.
One minute.
Come here, little guy.
He's so cute!
Isn't he?
I could be dreaming about anything.
I could be swimming with dolphins, or eating a whole pie without any consequences, but instead I'm here with the two of you.
Now, that's gotta mean something.
I'm afraid to ask what.
I think,
I think I'm in love with both of you.
You can't be.
That's not who you are.
Only because I've always been this self-conscious, good little girl who's too scared to think outside the box, especially when it comes to love and sex.
But as of right now, I'm putting that little girl behind me.
What exactly are you proposing?
That I can love both of you.
That I don't have to be yours, or yours.
I'm proposing that the two of you... be mine.
I'm the king of Louisiana.
I do not share.
You have to choose.
Okay, first of all, you guys are vampires.
What's with all the morality?
And second of all, this is such a double standard.
When it's two women and one guy, everyone's hunky-dory with it, even if they barely know each other.
But when a woman tries to have her way with two men she is totally and completely in love with,
everyone's hemming' and hawing'.
I'm sayin' I love you.
Both of you.
And, I'm asking you to love me back.
Together.
It's either both of you, or nothin' at all.
Take it or leave it.
One drop at a time, girlfriend, okay?
No more.
This shit's a whole other level.
You ever drink V directly from the source?
You ever put your face up against a vampire's cold skin, and just sucked it right out of him?
Fuck no.
Well, I have, so don't be a cunt!
Just breathe.
Breathe.
It's not real.
It's the V. It'll pass.
I'm puttin' you in charge of this.
That's the first good decision you made all day.
Jesus, the hell you doin' here?
I called him.
Hey!
Get, get down!
Why is he doin' this?
I have no idea.
Hey, come here.
Hey, hey.
I got a theory.
When you guys, uh, role-play, does Lafayette ever turn into a woman named Mavis?
I'm gonna forget you just said that, and I'm gonna head on in.
Hey, hey, he's got a gun.
I'm goin' in, Jason.
It's, it's against protocol.
What, you're gonna shoot me?
I'm gonna get your baby back.
I'm goin' with.
Echelon formation.
Right now he's defiladed, but if I approach from the flanks...
Terry, I'm a nurse.
I'm not even gonna pretend to understand what you just said, but I think I should go in by myself.
Okay, but what if I...
Baby, no.
I do not wanna fight fire with fire.
- Don't worry.
I got this.
- Stay here.
Let him go in.
Goddamn it.
He's a nurse.
He's just a nurse.
Oh, fuck.
Just you and me now, you.
Lafayette?
Who you with, you?
Monsieur Virgil?
What's your name?
Is it Mavis?
What you want, you?
I just wanna help.
Okay?
And I think I can.
I'm a brujo.
A practitioner of magic.
I got all the magic I need, me, right here.
I'm sorry, Mavis, but he is not your baby.
You lie!
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Why you come to take my baby, hmm?
That woman out there who's been crying for hours, she is this baby's mami .
You broke into their house and you took him from her!
I would never take another woman's baby.
I know, I know.
I think something happened to you, something you never made peace with.
I don't know what, but whatever it was, it killed you.
I no dead.
Now your spirit is looking for a way back, and since my boyfriend is a medium, you found it by entering his body.
Boyfriend?
Oh!
Oh, no!
How I make the baby with this, me?
You didn't.
My baby.
My baby boy.
He dead?
No!
I'm so sorry, Mavis.
No!
I am so, so sorry.
I just wanna hold him, just one, just one last time.
You.
You got that kind of magic in you?
We can try.
Okay, but if you do find Mr. Northman, please have King Bill call me, or you call me, or, I don't know, something.
Hey there, Sookie.
Hope you like flowers.
Come in.
Alcide was the first, the only, man that I ever loved, if you count out Coot, which believe me, I really wish I could.
So when I saw Alcide with you, and the way he cared about you, I just...
Debbie,
I understand being jealous, but you tried to kill me.
That ain't somethin' you can expect someone to forget.
I don't.
That's not why I came.
I know you're in trouble, and I'm wondering if there's anything I could do to help, that's all.
Did Alcide tell you I was in trouble?
He didn't have to.
He came home last night with your blood on him.
If he didn't tell you, how did you know the blood was mine?
Because I remember the smell.
Look, I ain't asking to be best friends.
You know, I'd be crazy if I expected that, and I ain't crazy.
But can't we try and make things better just a little at a time?
Don't talk.
Just let me listen.
- What?
- Shh.
...love Alcide, love him so much, there ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for him.
Why can't she just believe me?
I need her to see that I wanna help.
Okay.
I believe you.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
Good!
You know, Alcide told me that you think it's a curse, being what you are.
But I think it'd be nice to know what people are thinkin' every once in a while.
He loves you.
He really does.
Thank you.
So, you really wanna help?
'Cause I sure as heck could use some.
Please, just let me hold him one last time!
Please!
Tell me the last thing you remember.
Him, me was outside fighting'.
"I wanna see my baby."
I tell him I wanna hold him, but he say I couldn't.
He want to get away from me, but I followed him inside the house, me.
Why?
Why can't I hold him?
And then he told me,
"Because, Sugar, I already done buried him."
He already buried my...
I don't want to go through this again, you.
I just wanna know where my baby is.
Which is why you have to go through this.
Monsieur Virgil went into the kitchen.
Please...
Stop!
- He was standin' by the sink.
- Please...
He wouldn't look at me.
...and look me in the eyes!
So I started tugging on him to make him look!
Look at me!
And then it was inside of me.
What was it?
The knife.
Then I just fell to the floor, floated up and watched myself die.
What happened next?
He started shoveling.
I couldn't take it no more, me, so I left.
Where was he shoveling?
Out there, yonder, under the tree.
Don't shoot!
We're comin' out!
Mikey?
You got the shot, Stackhouse, take him out.
They ain't even got the gun no more, Andy.
- Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.
- Hoyt, we need a shovel.
A shovel?
What the hell for?
Just get it.
Hi, sweet boy.
Come here, Sweet Pea.
Oh, hey, sweet boy.
I can't say how sorry I am 'bout all this, me.
Don't worry about it.
Sometimes these things happen.
We still love you, Lafayette.
My name's Mavis.
My boy.
My sweet baby boy.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Oh, my heart hurts, I love you so much.
What you said, about me movin' up in the pack?
I want in.
Well, what changed 'tween then and now?
You want honesty or you just want me to kiss the ring?
Well, I'll take honesty every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
It's important to Debbie.
That's it?
What's important to Debbie's gotta be important to me, now more than ever.
I mean it.
Whatever you need, I'm there.
Well, you know what I call a dude that'll admit there ain't nothin' he won't do for the woman he loves?
What?
A man.
To Shreveport.
To Shreveport.
Hey, what are you up to the rest of the night?
Wide open.
Well, you might have heard me talk about my wife before.
We're, uh, separated, going through a rough patch.
And now some fuckin' shifter is lookin' to replace me.
Shit.
Right?
Anyways, I got this son of a bitch of hers stopping' by a little later on for a talk.
I was hopin' you wouldn't mind sticking' around.
It ain't my style to go beatin' on people I got no beef with.
Now that's, that's not what I'm askin' for,
I swear.
I just need to communicate with him that I can, and I will, hurt him if I have to.
Since you're about six-six and wider than a door, he might be more inclined to listen with you standin' behind me.
To communicating' shit.
To communicating' shit.
I want you to know how sorry I am, Stackhouse.
And I want you to know how little that means to me, 'cause I heard it all before, too many times.
Why don't you do something useful and turn on the lights, 'cause we can't see shit down there.
Think I got somethin'.
What?
What down there?
I don't know.
You think it's him, you?
I think it's both of you.
My baby.
It's time.
You found him and you held him, but now I need my Lafayette back.
Oh, where, where I go?
It's not for us to know.
Holy fuck.
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle.
Monsieur Lafayette, thank you for everything.
You got it, bitch.
We are closed for the evening.
I know what you're up against.
I know who you're up against.
I said we're closed.
I represent the Shreveport pack of werewolves.
I come to pledge our allegiance to your cause.
So tell me, young lady, exactly what are you offering?
Support.
Hmm.
Muscle.
Hmm.
We hate vampires every bit as much as you do.
Well, I doubt that.
How so?
What else?
Money, drugs.
Got to the point where pretty much my entire pack is...
Eric!
Sookie.
Hey, come on, let's get you out of here.
You should go.
You're under her spell, aren't you?
What is she making you do?
Kill the king.
Kill the king?
You mean Bill?
Goddamn it, Sook.
How fuckin' stupid can you be?
What little I know about werewolves is that werewolves do not like to be known.
Why are you making yourselves known to me now?
Uh, like, like I said, you know, on account of your cause and all.
Sookie Stackhouse!
The telepath?
Yes, who aids vampires.
I brought her to you.
Tara!
Do not shoot!
This one could be of use to us.
Uh, okay.
Oh, Sookie.
Just drop the gun!
Sookie.
Shoot her, shoot her, shoot her!
Fucking chill, Roy!
You always been stupid, but comin' here has gotta be about the stupidest shit I ever heard of.
Are you even listenin' to me?
We're all being held hostage.
Bill's at the Dorcester Hotel.
Keep her here.
Charge me, Sookie.
Charge me now!
No!
No, no, no!
I'm really fuckin' sorry, Antonia, but she charged me
Y'all saw it!
Fuckin' werewolf.
Debbie!
Shit.
You had me worried sick.
Shreveport, Dorcester.
Now.
Mr. Northman, it's time to go.
Yes, Antonia.
Uh, Roy, you come with.
Yes.
The rest of you stay here.
I can't take this anymore, I can't, I mean,
I mean, I don't even think I'm a real Wiccan!
I was just doing this to piss off my parents!
Let's get the fuck outta here!
Are you all right?
Try the front door!
I'm already on it!
Oh, fuck.
I am risking' life and limb here tonight, so that all of you across this great country of ours can witness Shreveport, Louisiana's pre-Halloween pageantry of vamp bullshit.
So without further ado...
And now, our special guest tonight, Joyce Watney.
I founded the LSU chapter of the Living Dead Alliance after having a deeply personal experience with a vampire.
My big sister, Julie Watney.
When I was 12 and she was 19, Julie disappeared.
We never saw her again until three years ago, when vampires came out of the coffin.
Mom, Dad, and I were having Sunday night dinner, and the doorbell rings, and it's Julie, wanting to know if she could watch us eat.
Are we the only vampires here?
Other than this one's sister we're about to trot out, yes, we are.
How can you have an event in honor of the living dead without any living dead?
It's like having a civil rights protest without any black people.
They're called African Americans, and maybe those protests wouldn't have turned into the bloodbaths they became if they hadn't been there.
Ever consider that?
...but you know what we say?
We say vampires gave us our Julie back.
They gave us a miracle.
So, put your hands together, please, for my big sister, and our family's miracle,
Ms. Julie Watney.
Watch it.
See that?
Place don't look worse for the wear.
Yeah, yeah, no, if you, I mean, if you ignore the frame d, uh, the bullet holes, and the general fucked-up-ness of everything.
Don't be bitter.
Hoyt, we witnessed a miracle tonight.
Mmm-hmm.
Is this yours?
No.
No, that goes in the monster box.
The monster box?
Yeah, I packed all her shit up.
Well, she ain't a monster.
Sometimes things just... don't work out.
Man, I gave her my heart, I gave her my soul, I gave her my life.
Wanna see what I got in return?
These.
It's the only thing I got out of the year we spent together, so take the monster's CD, and put it in the monster's monster box, and you take it to her for me, will you?
You want me to take it to her?
Yeah.
She's at vampire Bill's house.
Just swing it by on your way home.
The thing is, it ain't... it ain't my place, getting mixed up in all this, so, uh...
Man, you're my best friend in the whole world, so if it ain't your place, whose place is it?
Please?
I don't wanna see her, all right?
Ever again.
Hey.
She fall asleep already?
Shh.
Can I help you?
My name is Sam Merlotte.
Is Marcus here?
We been expectin' you.
Well, I'm glad you came.
Nate here bet me 50 bucks you wouldn't.
Said you didn't have the balls.
Live and learn, Nate.
Ain't never smart betting' against me.
I reckon it wasn't.
Why am I here?
Stop fuckin' my wife.
First off, she ain't your wife no more.
Not really.
We're workin' shit out!
And second, you can't stop fuckin' somebody, when you ain't fuckin' 'em in the first place!
Now, screwing' another man's wife, well, that's one thing, but lookin 'him in the eye and lyin' about it...
I ain't lying'.
I ain't even touched her.
Yeah, right.
Nice try.
Can't say the same about my brother, though, 'cause he had her every which way.
Told me she was sweet, too.
Shit.
Don't bet against you, huh?
Goddamn it, Marcus, call 'em off!
Who's the smart money on now?
Hey, Marcus, you gave me your word!
He mouthed off to me!
So the fuck what?
Look at him!
Oh, Jesus.
How'd the hell he do that?
That ain't Merlotte.
That's his brother.
Fuck.
Get him outta here.
Come on, Debbie.
I have to say, for a badass werewolf, you drive like a girl.
Sorry.
Today's media landscape is ratings-driven, and unfortunately, it's the Russell Edgingtons of the world who drive ratings.
But facts are facts, even if the fact is that facts are almost never heard.
So let's hear some, shall we?
Fact.
From July of last year...
Fact.
Human-on-vampire crime was also down almost 20%.
You have cornered me.
I surrender.
This is great!
...and I share your beliefs.
Jason.
Uh, where's the security?
Bill had an event at some hotel.
What are you doing here?
Um,
this box is for you.
It's all your stuff.
Hoyt said, he said he wanted you to have 'em, so.
That how he said it?
I might be parrot-phrasing a little.
Jessie, you all right?
Oh, I'm just fine.
If you ever need to talk...
Would you maybe wanna come in?
You know, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Okay.
Yeah.
So, I'm...
I'm, I'm gonna go.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh!
Thank you.
Do you want me to come in with you?
No.
No need to get into any more trouble on my account.
Go on, go home to Alcide.
And now I'd like to introduce to you one of the most generous benefactors the state of Louisiana has ever known,
Bon Temps entrepreneur and philanthropist, Mr. William Compton.
Can you even breathe?
'Cause I can't.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
What a wonderful night, for a wonderful cause.
But make no mistake, there is still much work to be done, for history teaches us that war can sound a louder call to action than can peace.
Right.
Yeah.
That a message of hate can seduce an impressionable mind far more readily than a message of love.
Which means we must remain vigilant...
Bill!
Sookie?
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Bill!
They're comin' for you, Bill!
Run!
I just wanted to inform you that I have Sheriff
Northman in custody.
Good work.
I'll see you at that tolerance thing on the 29th.
The King set me free.
There's a witch spell comin'...
That's supposed to make all the vampires walk out into the sun.
Jess.
You just saved my life.
- Let us meet.
- Where?
- The cemetery in Bon Temps.
- Midnight.
I wish you would have told me your brother was a skinwalker.
I can't forgive him for what he did to you.
I just kicked him out of my life for good.
I broke up with Hoyt.
So you just break his heart?
I can't help the way I feel.
No, I don't want any part of this!
Word is, something big's goin' down tonight with the witches and vampires.
You're a member of this pack, now,
- You gotta stay away from Sookie.
- Can't argue with that.
My baby be dead!
And you, the killer!
Huh?
- Who's he?
- Friend of mine.
I got a problem with that.
If we need to take this outside, let's do it.
You just pissed on the wrong boots, my friend.
I come in peace.
Bill, she's casting a spell!
Demoness!
We meet again.
Sookie!
Take that, fanger!
Come on, Sookie, stay with me.
Come on, please!
Sookie?
Sookie?
Sookie, drink.
Come on!
I'm so sorry, I should never have let you come tonight.
Then why did you?
Werewolf, I'm gonna need you to shut the fuck up!
Come on, drink.
Sookie?
Don't look like she's takin' it.
That's because she isn't.
Does she even have a pulse?
Barely.
Come on.
Well, ain't there anything else we can do?
We can pray.
Werewolf and a vampire.
Who's gonna listen?
That, I do not know.

He killed Beverleen!
I silvered the son of a bitch...
She was my favorite ex-sister-in-law.
What in the hell did you bring him back here for?
He is under my control.
Tell them, blond one.
I am yours.
So fuckin' cool!
Wash your face.
Bill offered you an olive branch tonight.
Why didn't you take it?
Everyone join hands.
We must cast a protective spell against the vampires, so we can be safe here.
I said join hands!
Um, I think I speak for everyone here when I say
I don't think this is what any of us signed up for.
Uh, does she speak for everyone?
She sure as hell speaks for me.
Not for me.
I didn't know what I was gettin' into, but I'm pleased as punch that I'm in it.
Good boy, Roy.
Thank you, Antonia.
Anybody else?
I found this stapled to a lamppost out front.
Tomorrow night we are going to go to this, and we are gonna take the blond one with us, so the whole world will see what vampires are capable of,
and what we are capable of doing to them.
Marnie...
My name is Antonia!
Jesus Christ.
Please, I'm begging you.
I got kids.
Nobody leaves.
Or what?
Try it, and you'll find out.
Sookie.
You made it.
Where's Eric?
Sookie, you were shot.
You can't still...
Where is he?
I already have my men out looking for him.
Now that I know that you're all right,
I'll go and join them and I will search for him myself until...
Am I the only one here who thinks this is batshit crazy?
Sookie, you just came this close to dying', because of fuckin' fangers.
Again!
Every minute that we spend not looking for him...
Fine.
I'm done here.
I'm done.
Bill?
Thanks for the blood.
Anytime.
She finally fall asleep?
You should go, Sam.
This is not your problem.
Well, what if I want it to be my problem?
Trust me, you do not want Marcus to be your problem.
Is that why Emma couldn't get to sleep?
She's scared he'll come back?
Are you?
I ain't leaving'.
Well, it'll be worse for everyone if he does come back and you're still here.
Well, then let's nobody be here.
No.
No, I'm trying to teach Emma not to run from her problems.
Well, who said anything about runnin'?
I'm talkin' about the three of us, goin' campin', gettin' back to nature, and getting back to nature is 100% opposite of running away.
I don't wanna have to wake Emma up.
Just carry her from her bed to the back seat.
She won't know anything till she wakes up to breakfast cooked on a campfire.
If it's sharing' a tent that's stoppin' you, you don't have to worry.
I am a multiple tent owner.
Oh, are you?
Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So then, I go over to Jason's house, because I thought maybe he might, like, understand what I was going through, but he just kicked me out also.
And this is just the worst day of my life.
I wish I was dead.
Except I am, and it doesn't even matter.
There have been times, I'll admit, when it's occurred to me that maybe I should put my career on hold and become a maker,
but these last several hours here with you have erased those doubts forever.
You are nothing like you are on TV.
Aw, thanks.
Nan.
I thought it best I go to ground here, what with the Festival of Tolerance event starting so early tomorrow night.
Saw you on the news, by the way.
You did quite well.
Really got in front of the story.
Speaking of, what is the story, my king?
What have you gone and fucked up now?
I almost hesitate to ask, but lest there be more surprises, is there anything else I need to know?
Only that Northman is missing.
What?
How?
Last we spoke, you were about to show him the true death.
I changed my mind.
Decisive leader you've turned out to be.
We'll have to cancel tomorrow night.
It's possible that Eric has fallen under Antonia's influence, just as Luis did.
Canceling is not an option.
What is so important about this event that you are willing to risk your life and mine?
There are factions within...
Factions within what?
The AVL?
The Authority?
Unless you tell me,
I cannot agree to...
Right now crews from CNN, VTV, Fox News and bloggers from across the country are already outside the hotel, waiting.
What would you have me tell them?
Blame the witches.
America's had no problem doing it in the past.
I didn't think it was possible, but you actually make me long for Queen Sophie-Anne.
I mean, what the fuck, Bill?
How did you let it come to this?
It was you that let it come to this!
I don't see how I'm responsible...
And there is the problem in a nutshell!
Everybody can see it but you.
Beyond tomorrow's headline, u are a blind person.
I would just love for you to say that to my face when I'm not chained in silver.
It's what I've been saying all along!
Bolster security if you feel it necessary, but tomorrow's Festival of Tolerance is going forward, and the cameras had damn well better find you in a festive and tolerant fucking mood.
Am I understood?
Perfectly.
Come on, baby.
Ooh, we're home now.
We're home now, baby boy.
Yeah, we home.
Oh, my baby.
Lafayette?
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!
Whoa, man, this ain't your house.
That ain't your baby, either.
That's Mikey!
This is my baby!
Now get out of my house, you.
What the fuck, Lafayette?
This my baby.
It's his daddy that came and took him, I know it was.
Uh, Arlene...
Ain't that his daddy, standing right there?
Well why are you treating us like criminals?
We didn't abduct our own child!
I'm just trying to get the story straight.
Without it, we got no idea where to look.
You hear that, Terry?
We're dealing with amateurs.
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to find him ourselves!
I mean, u know, is he here?
Is he here?
Huh?
Oh, y'all need to stop touching' shit!
Just look everywhere.
This here's crime scene.
Sons of bitches took my gun.
They took my son, cuz.
Deputy Jason Stackhouse.
J, it's me.
Uh, Lafayette just walked through my front door, with Arlene's baby, a doll, and a gun.
Andy.
Arlene?
Arlene.
Hoyt's got the baby.
At his place.
I knew that Fortenberry kid wasn't right.
Stay put, Bubba, we'll be right there.
Anything else I need to know?
Had one just like him in my platoon, just big and wrong.
He says Lafayette nearly took a shot at him.
With my gun?
Lafayette took Mikey?
Hoyt also said he came running out of the house with no pants on, so we need to get him pants.
What?
We don't have time for that!
It won't take but a minute, and I don't wanna see that shit.
Terry!
I'm comin' with you.
No, you ain't.
Stackhouse!
They ain't.
No.
Terry.
Damn it.
Arlene?
That is my child.
It's our child.
What?
It's daytime.
Sookie.
Bill?
What are you doing here?
Ask Sookie.
It's her dream.
Sookie?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Yes, you do.
Tell him.
Tell him you never stopped loving me.
Is this true?
What?
Now everyone can hear everyone?
Is it?
Well, yes, but it's not my fault.
He gave me his blood.
And he gave u his.
Sookie is mine.
Eric, don't.
Bullshit!
She's mine!
Guys, I don't want you two fighting' over me, please!
I'm ten times your age.
And I love her twenty times as much!
Goddamn it, stop!
Thank you.
Now, this is my dream, so both y'all need to shut up and listen to me.
Come on.
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Get your butts in the living room.
We need to have a little talk.
"Sam, I came to say goodbye, but you wasn't here, so I'm writin' you instead.
"I fucked up."
I'm lookin' for Sam Merlotte.
He around?
Who's askin'?
Name's Marcus.
Marcus what?
He knows who I am.
Well, he ain't around, Marcus He-knows-who-I-am.
Who are you?
His brother.
No shit.
Shifter got hisself a shifter brother, huh?
All right, then.
You give him this, will you?
I'll be waitin' for him tonight.
You tell him to be there, or else he gonna have a bigger fuckin' problem on his hands than he already got.
I'll be sure and do that.
Our perp still inside?
Yup.
The son of a bitch.
Y'all bring me any pants?
Andy got 'em.
Andy!
Pants.
Oh, I forgot.
You went in the room to get 'em!
Well, indict me for being a little on edge, why don't you?
It's my kin in there!
Stay back.
Lafayette!
Lafayette, you in there?
Goddamn it.
It's Sheriff Bellefleur, Lafayette.
You sound like a white man, you!
You know damn well I'm a white man!
No chance is I openin' no door for no white man, me.
Open the door, you racist shitbag, or I will open it the fuck up for you!
Andy?
You hear me?
Hey!
Protocol is to defuse the situation.
Fuck that!
This situation became pre-un-defused the minute that she-male broke into my house.
Lafayette Reynolds, on behalf of Renard Parish, the state of Louisiana, and Jesus Christ his fuckin' self,
- What are you...
- ready or not, here we come!
Andy!
Don't even think about it, Lafayette.
I ain't gonna let you shoot him.
Drop the weapon.
Hand over the baby.
It's my weapon.
Get out of my house!
Andy, come on!
Oh, Jesus, fuck!
Holy shit!
Y'all all right?
How'd you let him get the drop on you, Stackhouse?
What the hell was I supposed to do, shoot him with the baby in his arms?
- Shit.
- Fuck!
What are you doing here?
I told y'all not to me!
Go away, yous!
I got plenty more bullets, me!
Why are you doing this, Lafayette?
My name's Mavis.
He's lost it.
Mavis?
I'm goin' in.
No quarter.
No, no, no, no.
We can't let you do that.
What the hell, cuz?
Let us handle this.
Get the fuck offa me!
Let me go!
- You ain't goin' nowhere!
- Off my goddamn arms!
You're just jealous 'cause I got a wife and a life and a baby to love, and you got nothin' and nobody!
How'd you get so fuckin' strong?
C'mere, bunny!
She seems to have forgotten all about last night's drama.
What is it, Sam, do you need to hear me say it?
I'm a weak man, Luna, I kinda do.
You were right.
Ah.
This was a great idea.
You're the best.
That's what I'm talking about.
At school, we have this regular bunny.
She lets you hold her.
These nature bunnies, all they do is run away.
That's because nature bunnies are smart, and like to exercise.
School bunnies are fat and lazy.
Uh, we don't say "fat."
Oh, sorry.
It's okay.
I hope I turn out to be a shifter instead of a werewolf.
Where'd that come from, bug?
Because if I'm a shifter, one day I can be my own bunny and pet myself whenever I want.
Emma, whatever you wind up being is what you're supposed to be, and you're perfect, understand?
What are you getting all serious for?
I just wanna pet a bunny.
Girl wants to pet a bunny.
I'm gonna go catch her that bunny.
Yay.
Gimme a minute.
One minute.
Come here, little guy.
He's so cute!
Isn't he?
I could be dreaming about anything.
I could be swimming with dolphins, or eating a whole pie without any consequences, but instead I'm here with the two of you.
Now, that's gotta mean something.
I'm afraid to ask what.
I think,
I think I'm in love with both of you.
You can't be.
That's not who you are.
Only because I've always been this self-conscious, good little girl who's too scared to think outside the box, especially when it comes to love and sex.
But as of right now, I'm putting that little girl behind me.
What exactly are you proposing?
That I can love both of you.
That I don't have to be yours, or yours.
I'm proposing that the two of you... be mine.
I'm the king of Louisiana.
I do not share.
You have to choose.
Okay, first of all, you guys are vampires.
What's with all the morality?
And second of all, this is such a double standard.
When it's two women and one guy, everyone's hunky-dory with it, even if they barely know each other.
But when a woman tries to have her way with two men she is totally and completely in love with,
everyone's hemming' and hawing'.
I'm sayin' I love you.
Both of you.
And, I'm asking you to love me back.
Together.
It's either both of you, or nothin' at all.
Take it or leave it.
One drop at a time, girlfriend, okay?
No more.
This shit's a whole other level.
You ever drink V directly from the source?
You ever put your face up against a vampire's cold skin, and just sucked it right out of him?
Fuck no.
Well, I have, so don't be a cunt!
Just breathe.
Breathe.
It's not real.
It's the V. It'll pass.
I'm puttin' you in charge of this.
That's the first good decision you made all day.
Jesus, the hell you doin' here?
I called him.
Hey!
Get, get down!
Why is he doin' this?
I have no idea.
Hey, come here.
Hey, hey.
I got a theory.
When you guys, uh, role-play, does Lafayette ever turn into a woman named Mavis?
I'm gonna forget you just said that, and I'm gonna head on in.
Hey, hey, he's got a gun.
I'm goin' in, Jason.
It's, it's against protocol.
What, you're gonna shoot me?
I'm gonna get your baby back.
I'm goin' with.
Echelon formation.
Right now he's defiladed, but if I approach from the flanks...
Terry, I'm a nurse.
I'm not even gonna pretend to understand what you just said, but I think I should go in by myself.
Okay, but what if I...
Baby, no.
I do not wanna fight fire with fire.
Don't worry.
I got this.
Stay here.
Let him go in.
Goddamn it.
He's a nurse.
He's just a nurse.
Oh, fuck.
Just you and me now, you.
Lafayette?
Who you with, you?
Monsieur Virgil?
What's your name?
Is it Mavis?
What you want, you?
I just wanna help.
Okay?
And I think I can.
I'm a brujo.
A practitioner of magic.
I got all the magic I need, me, right here.
I'm sorry, Mavis, but he is not your baby.
You lie!
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Why you come to take my baby, hmm?
That woman out there who's been crying for hours, she is this baby's mami .
You broke into their house and you took him from her!
I would never take another woman's baby.
I know, I know.
I think something happened to you, something you never made peace with.
I don't know what, but whatever it was, it killed you.
I no dead.
Now your spirit is looking for a way back, and since my boyfriend is a medium, you found it by entering his body.
Boyfriend?
Oh!
Oh, no!
How I make the baby with this, me?
You didn't.
My baby.
My baby boy.
He dead?
No!
I'm so sorry, Mavis.
No!
I am so, so sorry.
I just wanna hold him, just one, just one last time.
You.
You got that kind of magic in you?
We can try.
Okay, but if you do find Mr. Northman, please have King Bill call me, or you call me, or, I don't know, something.
Hey there, Sookie.
Hope you like flowers.
Come in.
Alcide was the first, the only, man that I ever loved, if you count out Coot, which believe me, I really wish I could.
So when I saw Alcide with you, and the way he cared about you, I just...
Debbie,
I understand being jealous, but you tried to kill me.
That ain't somethin' you can expect someone to forget.
I don't.
That's not why I came.
I know you're in trouble, and I'm wondering if there's anything I could do to help, that's all.
Did Alcide tell you I was in trouble?
He didn't have to.
He came home last night with your blood on him.
If he didn't tell you, how did you know the blood was mine?
Because I remember the smell.
Look, I ain't asking to be best friends.
You know, I'd be crazy if I expected that, and I ain't crazy.
But can't we try and make things better just a little at a time?
Don't talk.
Just let me listen.
- What?
- Shh.
...love Alcide, love him so much, there ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for him.
Why can't she just believe me?
I need her to see that I wanna help.
Okay.
I believe you.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
Good!
You know, Alcide told me that you think it's a curse, being what you are.
But I think it'd be nice to know what people are thinkin' every once in a while.
He loves you.
He really does.
Thank you.
So, you really wanna help?
'Cause I sure as heck could use some.
Please, just let me hold him one last time!
Please!
Tell me the last thing you remember.
Him, me was outside fighting'.
"I wanna see my baby."
I tell him I wanna hold him, but he say I couldn't.
He want to get away from me, but I followed him inside the house, me.
Why?
Why can't I hold him?
And then he told me,
"Because, Sugar, I already done buried him."
He already buried my...
I don't want to go through this again, you.
I just wanna know where my baby is.
Which is why you have to go through this.
Monsieur Virgil went into the kitchen.
Please...
Stop!
He was standin' by the sink.
Please...
He wouldn't look at me.
...and look me in the eyes!
So I started tugging on him to make him look!
Look at me!
And then it was inside of me.
What was it?
The knife.
Then I just fell to the floor, floated up and watched myself die.
What happened next?
He started shoveling.
I couldn't take it no more, me, so I left.
Where was he shoveling?
Out there, yonder, under the tree.
Don't shoot!
We're comin' out!
Mikey?
You got the shot, Stackhouse, take him out.
They ain't even got the gun no more, Andy.
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.
Hoyt, we need a shovel.
A shovel?
What the hell for?
Just get it.
Hi, sweet boy.
Come here, Sweet Pea.
Oh, hey, sweet boy.
I can't say how sorry I am 'bout all this, me.
Don't worry about it.
Sometimes these things happen.
We still love you, Lafayette.
My name's Mavis.
My boy.
My sweet baby boy.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Oh, my heart hurts, I love you so much.
What you said, about me movin' up in the pack?
I want in.
Well, what changed 'tween then and now?
You want honesty or you just want me to kiss the ring?
Well, I'll take honesty every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
It's important to Debbie.
That's it?
What's important to Debbie's gotta be important to me, now more than ever.
I mean it.
Whatever you need, I'm there.
Well, you know what I call a dude that'll admit there ain't nothin' he won't do for the woman he loves?
What?
A man.
To Shreveport.
To Shreveport.
Hey, what are you up to the rest of the night?
Wide open.
Well, you might have heard me talk about my wife before.
We're, uh, separated, going through a rough patch.
And now some fuckin' shifter is lookin' to replace me.
Shit.
Right?
Anyways, I got this son of a bitch of hers stopping' by a little later on for a talk.
I was hopin' you wouldn't mind sticking' around.
It ain't my style to go beatin' on people I got no beef with.
Now that's, that's not what I'm askin' for,
I swear.
I just need to communicate with him that I can, and I will, hurt him if I have to.
Since you're about six-six and wider than a door, he might be more inclined to listen with you standin' behind me.
To communicating' shit.
To communicating' shit.
I want you to know how sorry I am, Stackhouse.
And I want you to know how little that means to me, 'cause I heard it all before, too many times.
Why don't you do something useful and turn on the lights, 'cause we can't see shit down there.
Think I got somethin'.
What?
What down there?
I don't know.
You think it's him, you?
I think it's both of you.
My baby.
It's time.
You found him and you held him, but now I need my Lafayette back.
Oh, where, where I go?
It's not for us to know.
Holy fuck.
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle.
Monsieur Lafayette, thank you for everything.
You got it, bitch.
We are closed for the evening.
I know what you're up against.
I know who you're up against.
I said we're closed.
I represent the Shreveport pack of werewolves.
I come to pledge our allegiance to your cause.
MARNIE So tell me, young lady, exactly what are you offering?
Support.
Hmm.
Muscle.
Hmm.
We hate vampires every bit as much as you do.
Well, I doubt that.
MARNIE How so?
What else?
Money, drugs.
Got to the point where pretty much my entire pack is...
Eric!
Sookie.
Hey, come on, let's get you out of here.
You should go.
You're under her spell, aren't you?
What is she making you do?
Kill the king.
Kill the king?
You mean Bill?
Goddamn it, Sook.
How fuckin' stupid can you be?
What little I know about werewolves is that werewolves do not like to be known.
Why are you making yourselves known to me now?
Uh, like, like I said, you know, on account of your cause and all.
Sookie Stackhouse!
The telepath?
Yes, who aids vampires.
I brought her to you.
Tara!
Do not shoot!
This one could be of use to us.
Uh, okay.
Oh, Sookie.
Just drop the gun!
Sookie.
Shoot her, shoot her, shoot her!
Fucking chill, Roy!
You always been stupid, but comin' here has gotta be about the stupidest shit I ever heard of.
Are you even listenin' to me?
We're all being held hostage.
Bill's at the Dorcester Hotel.
Keep her here.
Charge me, Sookie.
Charge me now!
No!
No, no, no!
I'm really fuckin' sorry, Antonia, but she charged me
Y'all saw it!
Fuckin' werewolf.
Debbie!
Shit.
You had me worried sick.
Shreveport, Dorcester.
Now.
Mr. Northman, it's time to go.
Yes, Antonia.
Uh, Roy, you come with.
Yes.
The rest of you stay here.
I can't take this anymore, I can't, I mean,
I mean, I don't even think I'm a real Wiccan!
I was just doing this to piss off my parents!
Let's get the fuck outta here!
Are you all right?
Try the front door!
I'm already on it!
Oh, fuck.
I am risking' life and limb here tonight, so that all of you across this great country of ours can witness Shreveport, Louisiana's pre-Halloween pageantry of vamp bullshit.
So without further ado...
And now, our special guest tonight, Joyce Watney.
I founded the LSU chapter of the Living Dead Alliance after having a deeply personal experience with a vampire.
My big sister, Julie Watney.
When I was 12 and she was 19, Julie disappeared.
We never saw her again until three years ago, when vampires came out of the coffin.
Mom, Dad, and I were having Sunday night dinner, and the doorbell rings, and it's Julie, wanting to know if she could watch us eat.
Are we the only vampires here?
Other than this one's sister we're about to trot out, yes, we are.
How can you have an event in honor of the living dead without any living dead?
It's like having a civil rights protest without any black people.
They're called African Americans, and maybe those protests wouldn't have turned into the bloodbaths they became if they hadn't been there.
Ever consider that?
JOYCE WATNEY: ...but you know what we say?
We say vampires gave us our Julie back.
They gave us a miracle.
So, put your hands together, please, for my big sister, and our family's miracle,
Ms. Julie Watney.
Watch it.
See that?
Place don't look worse for the wear.
Yeah, yeah, no, if you, I mean, if you ignore the frame d, uh, the bullet holes, and the general fucked-up-ness of everything.
Don't be bitter.
Hoyt, we witnessed a miracle tonight.
Mmm-hmm.
Is this yours?
No.
No, that goes in the monster box.
The monster box?
Yeah, I packed all her shit up.
Well, she ain't a monster.
Sometimes things just... don't work out.
Man, I gave her my heart, I gave her my soul, I gave her my life.
Wanna see what I got in return?
These.
It's the only thing I got out of the year we spent together, so take the monster's CD, and put it in the monster's monster box, and you take it to her for me, will you?
You want me to take it to her?
Yeah.
She's at vampire Bill's house.
Just swing it by on your way home.
The thing is, it ain't... it ain't my place, getting mixed up in all this, so, uh...
Man, you're my best friend in the whole world, so if it ain't your place, whose place is it?
Please?
I don't wanna see her, all right?
Ever again.
Hey.
She fall asleep already?
Shh.
Can I help you?
My name is Sam Merlotte.
Is Marcus here?
We been expectin' you.
Well, I'm glad you came.
Nate here bet me 50 bucks you wouldn't.
Said you didn't have the balls.
Live and learn, Nate.
Ain't never smart betting' against me.
I reckon it wasn't.
Why am I here?
Stop fuckin' my wife.
First off, she ain't your wife no more.
Not really.
We're workin' shit out!
And second, you can't stop fuckin' somebody, when you ain't fuckin' 'em in the first place!
Now, screwing' another man's wife, well, that's one thing, but lookin 'him in the eye and lyin' about it...
I ain't lying'.
I ain't even touched her.
Yeah, right.
Nice try.
Can't say the same about my brother, though, 'cause he had her every which way.
Told me she was sweet, too.
Shit.
Don't bet against you, huh?
Goddamn it, Marcus, call 'em off!
Who's the smart money on now?
Hey, Marcus, you gave me your word!
He mouthed off to me!
So the fuck what?
Look at him!
Oh, Jesus.
How'd the hell he do that?
That ain't Merlotte.
That's his brother.
Fuck.
Get him outta here.
Come on, Debbie.
I have to say, for a badass werewolf, you drive like a girl.
Sorry.
Today's media landscape is ratings-driven, and unfortunately, it's the Russell Edgingtons of the world who drive ratings.
But facts are facts, even if the fact is that facts are almost never heard.
So let's hear some, shall we?
Fact.
From July of last year...
Fact.
Human-on-vampire crime was also down almost 20%.
You have cornered me.
I surrender.
This is great!
...and I share your beliefs.
Jason.
Uh, where's the security?
Bill had an event at some hotel.
What are you doing here?
Um,
this box is for you.
It's all your stuff.
Hoyt said, he said he wanted you to have 'em, so.
That how he said it?
I might be parrot-phrasing a little.
Jessie, you all right?
Oh, I'm just fine.
If you ever need to talk...
Would you maybe wanna come in?
You know, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Okay.
Yeah.
So, I'm...
I'm, I'm gonna go.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh!
Thank you.
Do you want me to come in with you?
No.
No need to get into any more trouble on my account.
Go on, go home to Alcide.
And now I'd like to introduce to you one of the most generous benefactors the state of Louisiana has ever known,
Bon Temps entrepreneur and philanthropist, Mr. William Compton.
Can you even breathe?
'Cause I can't.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
What a wonderful night, for a wonderful cause.
But make no mistake, there is still much work to be done, for history teaches us that war can sound a louder call to action than can peace.
Right.
Yeah.
That a message of hate can seduce an impressionable mind far more readily than a message of love.
Which means we must remain vigilant...
Bill!
Sookie?
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Bill!
They're comin' for you, Bill!
Run!
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
(PANTING)
Come on, Sookie, stay with me.
Come on, please!
(GRUNTS)
(GROWLING)
Sookie?
Sookie?
(GASPS)
Sookie, drink.
Come on!
I'm so sorry, I should never have let you come tonight.
Then why did you?
Werewolf, I'm gonna need you to shut the fuck up!
Come on, drink.
Sookie?
Don't look like she's takin' it.
That's because she isn't.
Does she even have a pulse?
Barely.
Come on.
Well, ain't there anything else we can do?
We can pray.
Werewolf and a vampire.
Who's gonna listen?
That, I do not know.

(WOMAN 1) He killed Beverleen!
MAN:
I silvered the son of a bitch... (WOMAN 2) She was my favorite ex-sister-in-law.
What in the hell did you bring him back here for?
He is under my control.
Tell them, blond one.
I am yours.
So fuckin' cool!
Wash your face.
TARA:
Bill offered you an olive branch tonight.
Why didn't you take it?
Everyone join hands.
We must cast a protective spell against the vampires, so we can be safe here.
I said join hands!
Um, I think I speak for everyone here when I say
I don't think this is what any of us signed up for.
Uh, does she speak for everyone?
She sure as hell speaks for me.
Not for me.
I didn't know what I was gettin' into, but I'm pleased as punch that I'm in it.
Good boy, Roy.
Thank you, Antonia.
Anybody else?
I found this stapled to a lamppost out front.
Tomorrow night we are going to go to this, and we are gonna take the blond one with us, so the whole world will see what vampires are capable of,
and what we are capable of doing to them.
Marnie...
My name is Antonia!
Jesus Christ.
Please, I'm begging you.
I got kids.
(RASPING) Nobody leaves.
Or what?
Try it, and you'll find out.
BILL:
Sookie.
You made it.
Where's Eric?
Sookie, you were shot.
You can't still...
Where is he?
I already have my men out looking for him.
Now that I know that you're all right,
I'll go and join them and I will search for him myself until...
Am I the only one here who thinks this is batshit crazy?
Sookie, you just came this close to dying', because of fuckin' fangers.
Again!
Every minute that we spend not looking for him...
ALCIDE:
Fine.
I'm done here.
I'm done.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR SHUTS)
Bill?
Thanks for the blood.
Anytime.
(SIGHS)
She finally fall asleep?
You should go, Sam.
This is not your problem.
Well, what if I want it to be my problem?
Trust me, you do not want Marcus to be your problem.
Is that why Emma couldn't get to sleep?
She's scared he'll come back?
Are you?
I ain't leaving'.
Well, it'll be worse for everyone if he does come back and you're still here.
Well, then let's nobody be here.
No.
No, I'm trying to teach Emma not to run from her problems.
Well, who said anything about runnin'?
I'm talkin' about the three of us, goin' campin', gettin' back to nature, and getting back to nature is 100% opposite of running away.
(SIGHS)
I don't wanna have to wake Emma up.
Just carry her from her bed to the back seat.
She won't know anything till she wakes up to breakfast cooked on a campfire.
If it's sharing' a tent that's stoppin' you, you don't have to worry.
I am a multiple tent owner.
Oh, are you?
Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal.
(CHUCKLES)
(INHALES)
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
(DIALOGUE ON TV)
(SNIFFS)
(DOOR OPENS)
(SNIFFING)
(DOOR CLOSES)
(TV TURNS OFF)
(SNIFFLING) So then, I go over to Jason's house, because I thought maybe he might, like, understand what I was going through, but he just kicked me out also.
(SNIFFS)
And this is just the worst day of my life.
I wish I was dead.
Except I am, and it doesn't even matter.
(SNIFFS)
There have been times, I'll admit, (CRYING) when it's occurred to me that maybe I should put my career on hold and become a maker,
but these last several hours here with you have erased those doubts forever.
You are nothing like you are on TV.
(DOOR OPENS)
Aw, thanks.
Nan.
NAN:
I thought it best I go to ground here, what with the Festival of Tolerance event starting so early tomorrow night.
Saw you on the news, by the way.
You did quite well.
Really got in front of the story.
Speaking of, what is the story, my king?
What have you gone and fucked up now?
(JESSICA CRYING)
I almost hesitate to ask, but lest there be more surprises, is there anything else I need to know?
Only that Northman is missing.
What?
How?
Last we spoke, you were about to show him the true death.
I changed my mind.
Decisive leader you've turned out to be.
We'll have to cancel tomorrow night.
It's possible that Eric has fallen under Antonia's influence, just as Luis did.
Canceling is not an option.
What is so important about this event that you are willing to risk your life and mine?
There are factions within...
Factions within what?
The AVL?
The Authority?
Unless you tell me,
I cannot agree to...
Right now crews from CNN, VTV, Fox News and bloggers from across the country are already outside the hotel, waiting.
What would you have me tell them?
Blame the witches.
America's had no problem doing it in the past.
I didn't think it was possible, but you actually make me long for Queen Sophie-Anne.
I mean, what the fuck, Bill?
How did you let it come to this?
It was you that let it come to this!
I don't see how I'm responsible...
And there is the problem in a nutshell!
Everybody can see it but you.
Beyond tomorrow's headline, u are a blind person.
(GROWLS)
I would just love for you to say that to my face when I'm not chained in silver.
It's what I've been saying all along!
Bolster security if you feel it necessary, but tomorrow's Festival of Tolerance is going forward, and the cameras had damn well better find you in a festive and tolerant fucking mood.
Am I understood?
Perfectly.

That's Mikey!
This is my baby!
Now get out of my house, you.
What the fuck, Lafayette?
This my baby.
It's his daddy that came and took him, I know it was.
Uh, Arlene...
Ain't that his daddy, standing right there?
Well why are you treating us like criminals?
We didn't abduct our own child!
I'm just trying to get the story straight.
Without it, we got no idea where to look.
You hear that, Terry?
We're dealing with amateurs.
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to find him ourselves!
I mean, u know, is he here?
Is he here?
Huh?
(GASPS) Oh, y'all need to stop touching' shit!

Uh, Lafayette just walked through my front door, with Arlene's baby, a doll, and a gun.
JASON:
Andy.
Arlene?
Arlene.
Hoyt's got the baby.
(GASPS) At his place.
I knew that Fortenberry kid wasn't right.
Stay put, Bubba, we'll be right there.
JASON:
Anything else I need to know?
Had one just like him in my platoon, just big and wrong.
He says Lafayette nearly took a shot at him.
With my gun?
Lafayette took Mikey?
Hoyt also said he came running out of the house with no pants on, so we need to get him pants.
What?
We don't have time for that!
It won't take but a minute, and I don't wanna see that shit.
ARLENE:
Terry!
I'm comin' with you.
No, you ain't.

You know damn well I'm a white man!
LAFAYETTE:
No chance is I openin' no door for no white man, me.
Open the door, you racist shitbag, or I will open it the fuck up for you!
Andy?
You hear me?
Hey!
Protocol is to defuse the situation.
Fuck that!
This situation became pre-un-defused the minute that she-male broke into my house.
Lafayette Reynolds, on behalf of Renard Parish, the state of Louisiana, and Jesus Christ his fuckin' self,
- What are you...
- ready or not, here we come!
Andy!
Don't even think about it, Lafayette.
I ain't gonna let you shoot him.
Drop the weapon.
Hand over the baby.
ANDY:
It's my weapon.
Get out of my house!
JASON:
Andy, come on!
(GLASS BREAKING)
(GRUNTS)
ANDY:
Oh, Jesus, fuck!
Holy shit!
Y'all all right?
How'd you let him get the drop on you, Stackhouse?
What the hell was I supposed to do, shoot him with the baby in his arms?
ANDY:
Shit.
JASON:
Fuck!
JASON:
What are you doing here?
I told y'all not to me!
Go away, yous!
I got plenty more bullets, me!
Why are you doing this, Lafayette?
My name's Mavis.
ANDY:
He's lost it.
Mavis?
I'm goin' in.
No quarter.
JASON:
No, no, no, no.
We can't let you do that.
(GRUNTING)
What the hell, cuz?
Let us handle this.
Get the fuck offa me!
Let me go!
ANDY:
You ain't goin' nowhere!
TERRY:
Off my goddamn arms!
You're just jealous 'cause I got a wife and a life and a baby to love, and you got nothin' and nobody!
(GROANING)
TERRY:
How'd you get so fuckin' strong?
(TERRY GROANS)
C'mere, bunny!
She seems to have forgotten all about last night's drama.
What is it, Sam, do you need to hear me say it?
I'm a weak man, Luna, I kinda do.
You were right.
Ah.
This was a great idea.
You're the best.
(CHUCKLES)
That's what I'm talking about.
(CHUCKLES)
At school, we have this regular bunny.
She lets you hold her.
These nature bunnies, all they do is run away.
That's because nature bunnies are smart, and like to exercise.
School bunnies are fat and lazy.
Uh, we don't say "fat."
(WHISPERING) Oh, sorry.
(WHISPERING) It's okay.
I hope I turn out to be a shifter instead of a werewolf.
Where'd that come from, bug?
Because if I'm a shifter, one day I can be my own bunny and pet myself whenever I want.
Emma, whatever you wind up being is what you're supposed to be, and you're perfect, understand?
What are you getting all serious for?
I just wanna pet a bunny.
Girl wants to pet a bunny.
I'm gonna go catch her that bunny.
EMMA:
Yay.
Gimme a minute.
SAM:
One minute.
SAM:
Come here, little guy.
He's so cute!
Isn't he?
I could be dreaming about anything.
I could be swimming with dolphins, or eating a whole pie without any consequences, but instead I'm here with the two of you.
Now, that's gotta mean something.
I'm afraid to ask what.
I think,
I think I'm in love with both of you.
You can't be.
That's not who you are.
Only because I've always been this self-conscious, good little girl who's too scared to think outside the box, especially when it comes to love and sex.
But as of right now, I'm putting that little girl behind me.
What exactly are you proposing?
That I can love both of you.
That I don't have to be yours, or yours.
I'm proposing that the two of you... be mine.
I'm the king of Louisiana.
I do not share.
You have to choose.
(LAUGHING) Okay, first of all, you guys are vampires.
What's with all the morality?
And second of all, this is such a double standard.
When it's two women and one guy, everyone's hunky-dory with it, even if they barely know each other.
But when a woman tries to have her way with two men she is totally and completely in love with,
everyone's hemming' and hawing'.
I'm sayin' I love you.
Both of you.
And, I'm asking you to love me back.
Together.
It's either both of you, or nothin' at all.
Take it or leave it.
(MOANING)
(GASPS)
(SIGHS)
One drop at a time, girlfriend, okay?
No more.
This shit's a whole other level.
You ever drink V directly from the source?
You ever put your face up against a vampire's cold skin, and just sucked it right out of him?
Fuck no.
Well, I have, so don't be a cunt!
(GRUNTING)
Just breathe.
Breathe.
(GASPS)
It's not real.
It's the V. It'll pass.
I'm puttin' you in charge of this.
That's the first good decision you made all day.
Jesus, the hell you doin' here?
I called him.
Hey!
Get, get down!
Why is he doin' this?
I have no idea.
Hey, come here.
Hey, hey.
I got a theory.
When you guys, uh, role-play, does Lafayette ever turn into a woman named Mavis?
I'm gonna forget you just said that, and I'm gonna head on in.
JASON:
Hey, hey, he's got a gun.
JESUS:
I'm goin' in, Jason.
It's, it's against protocol.
What, you're gonna shoot me?
I'm gonna get your baby back.
I'm goin' with.
Echelon formation.
Right now he's defiladed, but if I approach from the flanks...
Terry, I'm a nurse.
I'm not even gonna pretend to understand what you just said, but I think I should go in by myself.
Okay, but what if I...
Baby, no.
I do not wanna fight fire with fire.
Don't worry.
I got this.
ARLENE:
Stay here.
ARLENE:
Let him go in.
Goddamn it.
He's a nurse.
He's just a nurse.
Oh, fuck.
(LAFAYETTE SINGING SOFTLY IN FRENCH)
(COOING)
(LAFAYETTE SPEAKING IN FRENCH)
LAFAYETTE:
Just you and me now, you.
Lafayette?
Who you with, you?
Monsieur Virgil?
What's your name?
Is it Mavis?
What you want, you?
I just wanna help.
(COOING)
Okay?
And I think I can.
I'm a brujo.
A practitioner of magic.
I got all the magic I need, me, right here.
I'm sorry, Mavis, but he is not your baby.
You lie!
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Why you come to take my baby, hmm?
That woman out there who's been crying for hours, she is this baby's mami .
You broke into their house and you took him from her!
I would never take another woman's baby.
I know, I know.
I think something happened to you, something you never made peace with.
I don't know what, but whatever it was, it killed you.
I no dead.
Now your spirit is looking for a way back, and since my boyfriend is a medium, you found it by entering his body.
Boyfriend?
Oh!
Oh, no!
How I make the baby with this, me?
You didn't.
(GASPING)
(WHIMPERING) My baby.
My baby boy.
He dead?
No!
I'm so sorry, Mavis.
No!
I am so, so sorry.
(SOBBING)
I just wanna hold him, just one, just one last time.
(BABY COOING)
You.
You got that kind of magic in you?
We can try.
(INHALES)
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
Okay, but if you do find Mr. Northman, please have King Bill call me, or you call me, or, I don't know, something.
(KNOCKING)
Hey there, Sookie.
Hope you like flowers.
Come in.
Alcide was the first, the only, man that I ever loved, if you count out Coot, which believe me, I really wish I could.
(CHUCKLES)
(CLEARS THROAT)
So when I saw Alcide with you, and the way he cared about you, I just...
Debbie,
I understand being jealous, but you tried to kill me.
That ain't somethin' you can expect someone to forget.
(WHISPERING) I don't.
That's not why I came.
I know you're in trouble, and I'm wondering if there's anything I could do to help, that's all.
Did Alcide tell you I was in trouble?
He didn't have to.
He came home last night with your blood on him.
If he didn't tell you, how did you know the blood was mine?
Because I remember the smell.
Look, I ain't asking to be best friends.
You know, I'd be crazy if I expected that, and I ain't crazy.
But can't we try and make things better just a little at a time?
Don't talk.
Just let me listen.
- What?
- Shh.
...love Alcide, love him so much, there ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for him.
Why can't she just believe me?
I need her to see that I wanna help.
Okay.
I believe you.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay. (CHUCKLES)
Good!
(CHUCKLES)
You know, Alcide told me that you think it's a curse, being what you are.
But I think it'd be nice to know what people are thinkin' every once in a while.
He loves you.
He really does.
Thank you.
So, you really wanna help?
'Cause I sure as heck could use some.
(CHUCKLES)
(JESUS SPEAKING SPANISH)
Please, just let me hold him one last time!
Please!
Tell me the last thing you remember.
Him, me was outside fighting'.
"I wanna see my baby."
I tell him I wanna hold him, but he say I couldn't.
He want to get away from me, but I followed him inside the house, me.
Why?
Why can't I hold him?
And then he told me,
"Because, Sugar, I already done buried him."
(CRYING) He already buried my...
I don't want to go through this again, you.
I just wanna know where my baby is.
Which is why you have to go through this.
Monsieur Virgil went into the kitchen.
(MAVIS WAILING) Please... (MR. VIRGIL) Stop!
He was standin' by the sink.
MAVIS:
Please...
He wouldn't look at me.
(MR. VIRGIL AND MAVIS YELLING)
MAVIS: ...and look me in the eyes!
So I started tugging on him to make him look!
MAVIS:
Look at me!
And then it was inside of me.
(SLASHING SOUND)
What was it?
The knife.
Then I just fell to the floor, (BODY THUDDING TO FLOOR) floated up and watched myself die.
What happened next?
He started shoveling.
I couldn't take it no more, me, so I left.
Where was he shoveling?
Out there, yonder, under the tree.
JESUS:
Don't shoot!
(BABY CRYING)
We're comin' out!
Mikey?
You got the shot, Stackhouse, take him out.
They ain't even got the gun no more, Andy.
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.
JESUS:
Hoyt, we need a shovel.
HOYT:
A shovel?
What the hell for?
Just get it.
(BABY CRYING) Hi, sweet boy.
Come here, Sweet Pea.
(CRYING)
ARLENE:
Oh, hey, sweet boy.
I can't say how sorry I am 'bout all this, me.
Don't worry about it.
Sometimes these things happen.
We still love you, Lafayette.
My name's Mavis.
My boy.
My sweet baby boy.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
ARLENE:
Oh, my heart hurts, I love you so much.
What you said, about me movin' up in the pack?
I want in.
Well, what changed 'tween then and now?
You want honesty or you just want me to kiss the ring?
Well, I'll take honesty every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
It's important to Debbie.
That's it?
What's important to Debbie's gotta be important to me, now more than ever.
I mean it.
Whatever you need, I'm there.
Well, you know what I call a dude that'll admit there ain't nothin' he won't do for the woman he loves?
What?
A man.
(CHUCKLES)
To Shreveport.
To Shreveport.
Hey, what are you up to the rest of the night?
Wide open.
Well, you might have heard me talk about my wife before.
We're, uh, separated, going through a rough patch.
And now some fuckin' shifter is lookin' to replace me.
Shit.
Right?
Anyways, I got this son of a bitch of hers stopping' by a little later on for a talk.
(SIGHS)
I was hopin' you wouldn't mind sticking' around.
It ain't my style to go beatin' on people I got no beef with.
Now that's, that's not what I'm askin' for,
I swear.
I just need to communicate with him that I can, and I will, hurt him if I have to.
Since you're about six-six and wider than a door, he might be more inclined to listen with you standin' behind me.
To communicating' shit.
To communicating' shit.
(CHUCKLES)
(JASON GRUNTING)
I want you to know how sorry I am, Stackhouse.
And I want you to know how little that means to me, 'cause I heard it all before, too many times.
Why don't you do something useful and turn on the lights, 'cause we can't see shit down there.
Think I got somethin'.
JESUS:
What?
What down there?
I don't know.
You think it's him, you?
I think it's both of you.
(SINGING IN FRENCH)
(COOS)
LAFAYETTE:
My baby.
It's time.
You found him and you held him, but now I need my Lafayette back.
Oh, where, where I go?
It's not for us to know.
(CHANTING IN SPANISH)
Holy fuck.
ARLENE:
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle.
(STOPS CHANTING)
MAVIS:
Monsieur Lafayette, thank you for everything.
You got it, bitch.
(SINGING IN FRENCH)
(KNOCKING)
We are closed for the evening.
I know what you're up against.
I know who you're up against.
I said we're closed.
(GROWLING)
I represent the Shreveport pack of werewolves.
(GROWLS)
I come to pledge our allegiance to your cause.
MARNIE (ANTONIA):
So tell me, young lady, exactly what are you offering?
Support.
Hmm.
Muscle.
Hmm.
We hate vampires every bit as much as you do.
Well, I doubt that.
(DIALOGUE CONTINUES UNINTELLIGIBLY)
MARNIE (ANTONIA):
How so?
DEBBIE:
What else?
Money, drugs.
DEBBIE:
Got to the point where pretty much my entire pack is... (DIALOGUE CONTINUES UNINTELLIGIBLY)
(WHISPERING) Eric!
Sookie.
Hey, come on, let's get you out of here.
You should go.
You're under her spell, aren't you?
What is she making you do?
Kill the king.
Kill the king?
You mean Bill?
Goddamn it, Sook.
How fuckin' stupid can you be?
What little I know about werewolves is that werewolves do not like to be known.
Why are you making yourselves known to me now?
Uh, like, like I said, you know, on account of your cause and all.
(WHISPERING) Sookie Stackhouse!
The telepath?
Yes, who aids vampires.
I brought her to you.
Tara!
Do not shoot!
This one could be of use to us.
Uh, okay.
Oh, Sookie.
Just drop the gun!
HOLLY:
Sookie.
Shoot her, shoot her, shoot her!
Fucking chill, Roy!
You always been stupid, but comin' here has gotta be about the stupidest shit I ever heard of.
Are you even listenin' to me?
We're all being held hostage.
Bill's at the Dorcester Hotel.
Keep her here.
Charge me, Sookie.
Charge me now!
(GUN FIRES)
No!
No, no, no!
(ANTONIA YELLING)
I'm really fuckin' sorry, Antonia, but she charged me
Y'all saw it!
Fuckin' werewolf.
SOOKIE:
Debbie!
Shit.
(CAR STARTING)
You had me worried sick.
Shreveport, Dorcester.
Now.
Mr. Northman, it's time to go.
Yes, Antonia.
Uh, Roy, you come with.
(WHISPERING) Yes.
The rest of you stay here.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
WOMAN:
I can't take this anymore, I can't, I mean,
I mean, I don't even think I'm a real Wiccan!
I was just doing this to piss off my parents!
Let's get the fuck outta here!
(SCREAMS)
(AGONIZED MOANING)
Are you all right?
Try the front door!
(WOMAN 2) I'm already on it!
(WOMAN 2 SCREAMING IN PAIN)
Oh, fuck.
MAN:
I am risking' life and limb here tonight, so that all of you across this great country of ours can witness Shreveport, Louisiana's pre-Halloween pageantry of vamp bullshit.
So without further ado...
EMCEE:
And now, our special guest tonight, Joyce Watney.
(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
I founded the LSU chapter of the Living Dead Alliance after having a deeply personal experience with a vampire.
My big sister, Julie Watney.
(CAMERA SNAPS)
When I was 12 and she was 19, Julie disappeared.
We never saw her again until three years ago, when vampires came out of the coffin.
Mom, Dad, and I were having Sunday night dinner, and the doorbell rings,
(CHOKING UP) and it's Julie, wanting to know if she could watch us eat.
(APPLAUSE)
Are we the only vampires here?
Other than this one's sister we're about to trot out, yes, we are.
How can you have an event in honor of the living dead without any living dead?
It's like having a civil rights protest without any black people.
They're called African Americans, and maybe those protests wouldn't have turned into the bloodbaths they became if they hadn't been there.
Ever consider that?
JOYCE WATNEY: ...but you know what we say?
We say vampires gave us our Julie back.
They gave us a miracle.
So, put your hands together, please, for my big sister, and our family's miracle,
Ms. Julie Watney.
Watch it.
See that?
Place don't look worse for the wear.
Yeah, yeah, no, if you, I mean, if you ignore the frame d, uh, the bullet holes, and the general fucked-up-ness of everything.
Don't be bitter.
Hoyt, we witnessed a miracle tonight.
Mmm-hmm.
Is this yours?
No.
No, that goes in the monster box.
The monster box?
Yeah, I packed all her shit up.
Well, she ain't a monster.
Sometimes things just... don't work out.
Man, I gave her my heart, I gave her my soul, I gave her my life.
Wanna see what I got in return?
These.
It's the only thing I got out of the year we spent together, so take the monster's CD, and put it in the monster's monster box, and you take it to her for me, will you?
You want me to take it to her?
Yeah.
She's at vampire Bill's house.
Just swing it by on your way home.
The thing is, it ain't... it ain't my place, getting mixed up in all this, so, uh...
Man, you're my best friend in the whole world, so if it ain't your place, whose place is it?
Please?
I don't wanna see her, all right?
Ever again.
(TENT UNZIPPING)
Hey.
She fall asleep already?
Shh.
Can I help you?
My name is Sam Merlotte.
Is Marcus here?
We been expectin' you.
(MEN CHATTERING)
MARCUS:
Well, I'm glad you came.
Nate here bet me 50 bucks you wouldn't.
Said you didn't have the balls.
Live and learn, Nate.
Ain't never smart betting' against me.
I reckon it wasn't.
Why am I here?
Stop fuckin' my wife.
First off, she ain't your wife no more.
Not really.
We're workin' shit out!
And second, you can't stop fuckin' somebody, when you ain't fuckin' 'em in the first place!
Now, screwing' another man's wife, well, that's one thing, but lookin 'him in the eye and lyin' about it...
I ain't lying'.
I ain't even touched her.
BIKER:
Yeah, right.
Nice try.
Can't say the same about my brother, though, 'cause he had her every which way.
Told me she was sweet, too.
(ROARS)
(GRUNTING)
Shit.
(MOANING)
NATE:
Don't bet against you, huh?
Goddamn it, Marcus, call 'em off!
NATE:
Who's the smart money on now?
(MOANING)
(GROWLING)
Hey, Marcus, you gave me your word!
He mouthed off to me!
So the fuck what?
(MOANING LOUDLY)
Look at him!
(CHOKING SOUNDS)
Oh, Jesus.
BIKER:
How'd the hell he do that?
That ain't Merlotte.
That's his brother.
Fuck.
Get him outta here.
(GROWLING)
Come on, Debbie.
I have to say, for a badass werewolf, you drive like a girl.
Sorry.
NAN:
Today's media landscape is ratings-driven, and unfortunately, it's the Russell Edgingtons of the world who drive ratings.
But facts are facts, even if the fact is that facts are almost never heard.
So let's hear some, shall we?
NAN:
Fact.
From July of last year...
Fact.
Human-on-vampire crime was also down almost 20%.
You have cornered me.
I surrender.
(CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
This is great!
...and I share your beliefs.
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)
Jason.
Uh, where's the security?
Bill had an event at some hotel.
What are you doing here?
Um,
this box is for you.
It's all your stuff.
Hoyt said, he said he wanted you to have 'em, so.
That how he said it?
I might be parrot-phrasing a little.
Jessie, you all right?
Oh, I'm just fine.
If you ever need to talk...
Would you maybe wanna come in?
You know, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Okay.
Yeah.
So, I'm...
I'm, I'm gonna go.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh!
(MOANING)
Thank you.
Do you want me to come in with you?
No.
No need to get into any more trouble on my account.
Go on, go home to Alcide.
And now I'd like to introduce to you one of the most generous benefactors the state of Louisiana has ever known,
Bon Temps entrepreneur and philanthropist, Mr. William Compton.
Can you even breathe?
'Cause I can't.
BILL:
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
What a wonderful night, for a wonderful cause.
But make no mistake, there is still much work to be done, for history teaches us that war can sound a louder call to action than can peace.
CROWD:
Right.
Yeah.
That a message of hate can seduce an impressionable mind far more readily than a message of love.
Which means we must remain vigilant...
SOOKIE:
Bill!
Sookie?
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
(LOUD GRUNT)
(SCREAMING)
Bill!
SOOKIE:
They're comin' for you, Bill!
Run!
(ROCK SONG PLAYING)
( theme music playing )
Come on, Sookie, stay with me.
Come on, please!
(GRUNTS)
(GROWLING)
Sookie?
Sookie?
(GASPS)
Sookie, drink.
Come on!
I'm so sorry, I should never have let you come tonight.
Then why did you?
Werewolf, I'm gonna need you to shut the fuck up!
Come on, drink.
Sookie?
Don't look like she's takin' it.
That's because she isn't.
Does she even have a pulse?
Barely.
Come on.
Well, ain't there anything else we can do?
We can pray.
Werewolf and a vampire.
Who's gonna listen?
That, I do not know.
* When you came in the air went out
* And every shadow filled up with doubt
* I don't know who you think you are, but before the night is through
* I want to do bad things with you
* I'm the kind to sit up in his room
* Heartsick and eyes filled up with blue
* I don't know what you've done to me, but I know this much is true
* I want to do bad things with you
* I want to do real bad things with you *
(WOMAN 1) He killed Beverleen!
MAN:
I silvered the son of a bitch... (WOMAN 2) She was my favorite ex-sister-in-law.
What in the hell did you bring him back here for?
He is under my control.
Tell them, blond one.
I am yours.
So fuckin' cool!
Wash your face.
TARA:
Bill offered you an olive branch tonight.
Why didn't you take it?
Everyone join hands.
We must cast a protective spell against the vampires, so we can be safe here.
I said join hands!
Um, I think I speak for everyone here when I say
I don't think this is what any of us signed up for.
Uh, does she speak for everyone?
She sure as hell speaks for me.
Not for me.
I didn't know what I was gettin' into, but I'm pleased as punch that I'm in it.
Good boy, Roy.
Thank you, Antonia.
Anybody else?
I found this stapled to a lamppost out front.
Tomorrow night we are going to go to this, and we are gonna take the blond one with us, so the whole world will see what vampires are capable of,
and what we are capable of doing to them.
Marnie...
My name is Antonia!
Jesus Christ.
Please, I'm begging you.
I got kids.
(RASPING) Nobody leaves.
Or what?
Try it, and you'll find out.
BILL:
Sookie.
You made it.
Where's Eric?
Sookie, you were shot.
You can't still...
Where is he?
I already have my men out looking for him.
Now that I know that you're all right,
I'll go and join them and I will search for him myself until...
Am I the only one here who thinks this is batshit crazy?
Sookie, you just came this close to dying', because of fuckin' fangers.
Again!
Every minute that we spend not looking for him...
ALCIDE:
Fine.
I'm done here.
I'm done.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR SHUTS)
Bill?
Thanks for the blood.
Anytime.
(SIGHS)
She finally fall asleep?
You should go, Sam.
This is not your problem.
Well, what if I want it to be my problem?
Trust me, you do not want Marcus to be your problem.
Is that why Emma couldn't get to sleep?
She's scared he'll come back?
Are you?
I ain't leaving'.
Well, it'll be worse for everyone if he does come back and you're still here.
Well, then let's nobody be here.
No.
No, I'm trying to teach Emma not to run from her problems.
Well, who said anything about runnin'?
I'm talkin' about the three of us, goin' campin', gettin' back to nature, and getting back to nature is 100% opposite of running away.
(SIGHS)
I don't wanna have to wake Emma up.
Just carry her from her bed to the back seat.
She won't know anything till she wakes up to breakfast cooked on a campfire.
If it's sharing' a tent that's stoppin' you, you don't have to worry.
I am a multiple tent owner.
Oh, are you?
Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal.
(CHUCKLES)
(INHALES)
Okay.

(SNIFFLING) So then, I go over to Jason's house, because I thought maybe he might, like, understand what I was going through, but he just kicked me out also.
(SNIFFS)
And this is just the worst day of my life.
I wish I was dead.
Except I am, and it doesn't even matter.
(SNIFFS)
There have been times, I'll admit, (CRYING) when it's occurred to me that maybe I should put my career on hold and become a maker,
but these last several hours here with you have erased those doubts forever.
You are nothing like you are on TV.
(DOOR OPENS)
Aw, thanks.
Nan.
NAN:
I thought it best I go to ground here, what with the Festival of Tolerance event starting so early tomorrow night.
Saw you on the news, by the way.
You did quite well.
Really got in front of the story.
Speaking of, what is the story, my king?
What have you gone and fucked up now?
(JESSICA CRYING)
I almost hesitate to ask, but lest there be more surprises, is there anything else I need to know?
Only that Northman is missing.
What?
How?
Last we spoke, you were about to show him the true death.
I changed my mind.
Decisive leader you've turned out to be.
We'll have to cancel tomorrow night.
It's possible that Eric has fallen under Antonia's influence, just as Luis did.
Canceling is not an option.
What is so important about this event that you are willing to risk your life and mine?
There are factions within...
Factions within what?
The AVL?
The Authority?
Unless you tell me,
I cannot agree to...
Right now crews from CNN, VTV, Fox News and bloggers from across the country are already outside the hotel, waiting.
What would you have me tell them?
Blame the witches.
America's had no problem doing it in the past.
I didn't think it was possible, but you actually make me long for Queen Sophie-Anne.
I mean, what the fuck, Bill?
How did you let it come to this?
It was you that let it come to this!
I don't see how I'm responsible...
And there is the problem in a nutshell!
Everybody can see it but you.
Beyond tomorrow's headline, you are a blind person.
(GROWLS)
I would just love for you to say that to my face when I'm not chained in silver.
It's what I've been saying all along!
Bolster security if you feel it necessary, but tomorrow's Festival of Tolerance is going forward, and the cameras had damn well better find you in a festive and tolerant fucking mood.
Am I understood?
Perfectly.

LAFAYETTE:
Come on, baby.
Ooh, we're home now.
We're home now, baby boy.
(COOS)
Yeah, we home.
Oh, my baby.
Lafayette?
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!
Whoa, man, this ain't your house.
That ain't your baby, either.
That's Mikey!
This is my baby!
Now get out of my house, you.
What the fuck, Lafayette?
This my baby.
It's his daddy that came and took him, I know it was.
Uh, Arlene...
Ain't that his daddy, standing right there?
Well why are you treating us like criminals?
We didn't abduct our own child!
I'm just trying to get the story straight.
Without it, we got no idea where to look.
You hear that, Terry?
We're dealing with amateurs.
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to find him ourselves!
I mean, u know, is he here?
Is he here?
Huh?
(GASPS) Oh, y'all need to stop touching' shit!
ARLENE:
Just look everywhere.
ANDY:
This here's crime scene.
Sons of bitches took my gun.
They took my son, cuz.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Deputy Jason Stackhouse.
(HOYT ON PHONE) J, it's me.
Uh, Lafayette just walked through my front door, with Arlene's baby, a doll, and a gun.
JASON:
Andy.
Arlene?
Arlene.
Hoyt's got the baby.
(GASPS) At his place.
I knew that Fortenberry kid wasn't right.
Stay put, Bubba, we'll be right there.
JASON:
Anything else I need to know?
Had one just like him in my platoon, just big and wrong.
He says Lafayette nearly took a shot at him.
With my gun?
Lafayette took Mikey?
Hoyt also said he came running out of the house with no pants on, so we need to get him pants.
What?
We don't have time for that!
It won't take but a minute, and I don't wanna see that shit.
ARLENE:
Terry!
I'm comin' with you.
No, you ain't.
Stackhouse!
They ain't.
No.
JASON:
Terry.
Damn it.
JASON:
Arlene?
ARLENE:
That is my child.
TERRY:
It's our child.

What?
It's daytime.
(MOANS)
Sookie.
Bill?
What are you doing here?
Ask Sookie.
It's her dream.
Sookie?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Yes, you do.
Tell him.
BILL:
Tell him you never stopped loving me.
Is this true?
What?
Now everyone can hear everyone?
Is it?
Well, yes, but it's not my fault.
He gave me his blood.
And he gave u his.
(GROWLS) Sookie is mine.
Eric, don't.
(GROWLS) Bullshit!
She's mine!
Guys, I don't want you two fighting' over me, please!
I'm ten times your age.
And I love her twenty times as much!
Goddamn it, stop!
Thank you.
Now, this is my dream, so both y'all need to shut up and listen to me.
Come on.
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Get your butts in the living room.
We need to have a little talk.
"Sam, I came to say goodbye, but you wasn't here, so I'm writin' you instead.
"I fucked up."
(SNIFFING)
I'm lookin' for Sam Merlotte.
He around?
Who's askin'?
Name's Marcus.
Marcus what?
He knows who I am.
Well, he ain't around, Marcus He-knows-who-I-am.
(CHUCKLES)
Who are you?
His brother.
No shit.
Shifter got hisself a shifter brother, huh?
(LAUGHS)
All right, then.
You give him this, will you?
I'll be waitin' for him tonight.
You tell him to be there, or else he gonna have a bigger fuckin' problem on his hands than he already got.
I'll be sure and do that.
Our perp still inside?
Yup.
The son of a bitch.
Y'all bring me any pants?
Andy got 'em.
Andy!
Pants.
Oh, I forgot.
You went in the room to get 'em!
Well, indict me for being a little on edge, why don't you?
It's my kin in there!
Stay back.
Lafayette!
ANDY:
Lafayette, you in there?
Goddamn it.
It's Sheriff Bellefleur, Lafayette.
LAFAYETTE:
You sound like a white man, you!
You know damn well I'm a white man!
LAFAYETTE:
No chance is I openin' no door for no white man, me.
Open the door, you racist shitbag, or I will open it the fuck up for you!
Andy?
You hear me?
Hey!
Protocol is to defuse the situation.
Fuck that!
This situation became pre-un-defused the minute that she-male broke into my house.
Lafayette Reynolds, on behalf of Renard Parish, the state of Louisiana, and Jesus Christ his fuckin' self,
- What are you...
- ready or not, here we come!
Andy!
Don't even think about it, Lafayette.
I ain't gonna let you shoot him.
Drop the weapon.
Hand over the baby.
ANDY:
It's my weapon.
Get out of my house!
JASON:
Andy, come on!
(GLASS BREAKING)
(GRUNTS)
ANDY:
Oh, Jesus, fuck!
Holy shit!
Y'all all right?
How'd you let him get the drop on you, Stackhouse?
What the hell was I supposed to do, shoot him with the baby in his arms?
ANDY:
Shit.
JASON:
Fuck!
JASON:
What are you doing here?
I told y'all not to me!
Go away, yous!
I got plenty more bullets, me!
Why are you doing this, Lafayette?
My name's Mavis.
ANDY:
He's lost it.
Mavis?
I'm goin' in.
No quarter.
JASON:
No, no, no, no.
We can't let you do that.
(GRUNTING)
What the hell, cuz?
Let us handle this.
Get the fuck offa me!
Let me go!
ANDY:
You ain't goin' nowhere!
TERRY:
Off my goddamn arms!
You're just jealous 'cause I got a wife and a life and a baby to love, and you got nothin' and nobody!
(GROANING)
TERRY:
How'd you get so fuckin' strong?
(TERRY GROANS)
C'mere, bunny!
She seems to have forgotten all about last night's drama.
What is it, Sam, do you need to hear me say it?
I'm a weak man, Luna, I kinda do.
You were right.
Ah.
This was a great idea.
You're the best.
(CHUCKLES)
That's what I'm talking about.
(CHUCKLES)
At school, we have this regular bunny.
She lets you hold her.
These nature bunnies, all they do is run away.
That's because nature bunnies are smart, and like to exercise.
School bunnies are fat and lazy.
Uh, we don't say "fat."
(WHISPERING) Oh, sorry.
(WHISPERING) It's okay.
I hope I turn out to be a shifter instead of a werewolf.
Where'd that come from, bug?
Because if I'm a shifter, one day I can be my own bunny and pet myself whenever I want.
Emma, whatever you wind up being is what you're supposed to be, and you're perfect, understand?
What are you getting all serious for?
I just wanna pet a bunny.
Girl wants to pet a bunny.
I'm gonna go catch her that bunny.
EMMA:
Yay.
Gimme a minute.
SAM:
One minute.
SAM:
Come here, little guy.
He's so cute!
Isn't he?
I could be dreaming about anything.
I could be swimming with dolphins, or eating a whole pie without any consequences, but instead I'm here with the two of you.
Now, that's gotta mean something.
I'm afraid to ask what.
I think,
I think I'm in love with both of you.
You can't be.
That's not who you are.
Only because I've always been this self-conscious, good little girl who's too scared to think outside the box, especially when it comes to love and sex.
But as of right now, I'm putting that little girl behind me.
What exactly are you proposing?
That I can love both of you.
That I don't have to be yours, or yours.
I'm proposing that the two of you... be mine.
I'm the king of Louisiana.
I do not share.
You have to choose.
(LAUGHING) Okay, first of all, you guys are vampires.
What's with all the morality?
And second of all, this is such a double standard.
When it's two women and one guy, everyone's hunky-dory with it, even if they barely know each other.
But when a woman tries to have her way with two men she is totally and completely in love with,
everyone's hemming' and hawing'.
I'm sayin' I love you.
Both of you.
And, I'm asking you to love me back.
Together.
It's either both of you, or nothin' at all.
Take it or leave it.
(MOANING)
(GASPS)
(SIGHS)
One drop at a time, girlfriend, okay?
No more.
This shit's a whole other level.
You ever drink V directly from the source?
You ever put your face up against a vampire's cold skin, and just sucked it right out of him?
Fuck no.
Well, I have, so don't be a cunt!
(GRUNTING)
Just breathe.
Breathe.
(GASPS)
It's not real.
It's the V. It'll pass.
I'm puttin' you in charge of this.
That's the first good decision you made all day.
Jesus, the hell you doin' here?
I called him.
Hey!
Get, get down!
Why is he doin' this?
I have no idea.
Hey, come here.
Hey, hey.
I got a theory.
When you guys, uh, role-play, does Lafayette ever turn into a woman named Mavis?
I'm gonna forget you just said that, and I'm gonna head on in.
JASON:
Hey, hey, he's got a gun.
JESUS:
I'm goin' in, Jason.
It's, it's against protocol.
What, you're gonna shoot me?
I'm gonna get your baby back.
I'm goin' with.
Echelon formation.
Right now he's defiladed, but if I approach from the flanks...
Terry, I'm a nurse.
I'm not even gonna pretend to understand what you just said, but I think I should go in by myself.
Okay, but what if I...
Baby, no.
I do not wanna fight fire with fire.
Don't worry.
I got this.
ARLENE:
Stay here.
ARLENE:
Let him go in.
Goddamn it.
He's a nurse.
He's just a nurse.
Oh, fuck.
(LAFAYETTE SINGING SOFTLY IN FRENCH)
(COOING)
(LAFAYETTE SPEAKING IN FRENCH)
LAFAYETTE:
Just you and me now, you.
Lafayette?
Who you with, you?
Monsieur Virgil?
What's your name?
Is it Mavis?
What you want, you?
I just wanna help.
(COOING)
Okay?
And I think I can.
I'm a brujo.
A practitioner of magic.
I got all the magic I need, me, right here.
I'm sorry, Mavis, but he is not your baby.
You lie!
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Why you come to take my baby, hmm?
That woman out there who's been crying for hours, she is this baby's mami .
You broke into their house and you took him from her!
I would never take another woman's baby.
I know, I know.
I think something happened to you, something you never made peace with.
I don't know what, but whatever it was, it killed you.
I no dead.
Now your spirit is looking for a way back, and since my boyfriend is a medium, you found it by entering his body.
Boyfriend?
Oh!
Oh, no!
How I make the baby with this, me?
You didn't.
(GASPING)
(WHIMPERING) My baby.
My baby boy.
He dead?
No!
I'm so sorry, Mavis.
No!
I am so, so sorry.
(SOBBING)
I just wanna hold him, just one, just one last time.
(BABY COOING)
You.
You got that kind of magic in you?
We can try.
(INHALES)
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
Okay, but if you do find Mr. Northman, please have King Bill call me, or you call me, or, I don't know, something.
(KNOCKING)
Hey there, Sookie.
Hope you like flowers.
Come in.
Alcide was the first, the only, man that I ever loved, if you count out Coot, which believe me, I really wish I could.
(CHUCKLES)
(CLEARS THROAT)
So when I saw Alcide with you, and the way he cared about you, I just...
Debbie,
I understand being jealous, but you tried to kill me.
That ain't somethin' you can expect someone to forget.
(WHISPERING) I don't.
That's not why I came.
I know you're in trouble, and I'm wondering if there's anything I could do to help, that's all.
Did Alcide tell you I was in trouble?
He didn't have to.
He came home last night with your blood on him.
If he didn't tell you, how did you know the blood was mine?
Because I remember the smell.
Look, I ain't asking to be best friends.
You know, I'd be crazy if I expected that, and I ain't crazy.
But can't we try and make things better just a little at a time?
Don't talk.
Just let me listen.
- What?
- Shh.
...love Alcide, love him so much, there ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for him.
Why can't she just believe me?
I need her to see that I wanna help.
Okay.
I believe you.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay. (CHUCKLES)
Good!
(CHUCKLES)
You know, Alcide told me that you think it's a curse, being what you are.
But I think it'd be nice to know what people are thinkin' every once in a while.
He loves you.
He really does.
Thank you.
So, you really wanna help?
'Cause I sure as heck could use some.
(CHUCKLES)
(JESUS SPEAKING SPANISH)
Please, just let me hold him one last time!
Please!
Tell me the last thing you remember.
Him, me was outside fighting'.
"I wanna see my baby."
I tell him I wanna hold him, but he say I couldn't.
He want to get away from me, but I followed him inside the house, me.
Why?
Why can't I hold him?
And then he told me,
"Because, Sugar, I already done buried him."
(CRYING) He already buried my...
I don't want to go through this again, you.
I just wanna know where my baby is.
Which is why you have to go through this.
Monsieur Virgil went into the kitchen.
(MAVIS WAILING) Please... (MR. VIRGIL) Stop!
He was standin' by the sink.
MAVIS:
Please...
He wouldn't look at me.
(MR. VIRGIL AND MAVIS YELLING)
MAVIS: ...and look me in the eyes!
So I started tugging on him to make him look!
MAVIS:
Look at me!
And then it was inside of me.
(SLASHING SOUND)
What was it?
The knife.
Then I just fell to the floor, (BODY THUDDING TO FLOOR) floated up and watched myself die.
What happened next?
He started shoveling.
I couldn't take it no more, me, so I left.
Where was he shoveling?
Out there, yonder, under the tree.
JESUS:
Don't shoot!
(BABY CRYING)
We're comin' out!
Mikey?
You got the shot, Stackhouse, take him out.
They ain't even got the gun no more, Andy.
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.
JESUS:
Hoyt, we need a shovel.
HOYT:
A shovel?
What the hell for?
Just get it.
(BABY CRYING) Hi, sweet boy.
Come here, Sweet Pea.
(CRYING)
ARLENE:
Oh, hey, sweet boy.
I can't say how sorry I am 'bout all this, me.
Don't worry about it.
Sometimes these things happen.
We still love you, Lafayette.
My name's Mavis.
My boy.
My sweet baby boy.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
ARLENE:
Oh, my heart hurts, I love you so much.
What you said, about me movin' up in the pack?
I want in.
Well, what changed 'tween then and now?
You want honesty or you just want me to kiss the ring?
Well, I'll take honesty every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
It's important to Debbie.
That's it?
What's important to Debbie's gotta be important to me, now more than ever.
I mean it.
Whatever you need, I'm there.
Well, you know what I call a dude that'll admit there ain't nothin' he won't do for the woman he loves?
What?
A man.
(CHUCKLES)
To Shreveport.
To Shreveport.
Hey, what are you up to the rest of the night?
Wide open.
Well, you might have heard me talk about my wife before.
We're, uh, separated, going through a rough patch.
And now some fuckin' shifter is lookin' to replace me.
Shit.
Right?
Anyways, I got this son of a bitch of hers stopping' by a little later on for a talk.
(SIGHS)
I was hopin' you wouldn't mind sticking' around.
It ain't my style to go beatin' on people I got no beef with.
Now that's, that's not what I'm askin' for,
I swear.
I just need to communicate with him that I can, and I will, hurt him if I have to.
Since you're about six-six and wider than a door, he might be more inclined to listen with you standin' behind me.
To communicating' shit.
To communicating' shit.
(CHUCKLES)
(JASON GRUNTING)
I want you to know how sorry I am, Stackhouse.
And I want you to know how little that means to me, 'cause I heard it all before, too many times.
Why don't you do something useful and turn on the lights, 'cause we can't see shit down there.
Think I got somethin'.
JESUS:
What?
What down there?
I don't know.
You think it's him, you?
I think it's both of you.
(SINGING IN FRENCH)
(COOS)
LAFAYETTE:
My baby.
It's time.
You found him and you held him, but now I need my Lafayette back.
Oh, where, where I go?
It's not for us to know.
(CHANTING IN SPANISH)
Holy fuck.
ARLENE:
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle.
(STOPS CHANTING)
MAVIS:
Monsieur Lafayette, thank you for everything.
You got it, bitch.
(SINGING IN FRENCH)
(KNOCKING)
We are closed for the evening.
I know what you're up against.
I know who you're up against.
I said we're closed.
(GROWLING)
I represent the Shreveport pack of werewolves.
(GROWLS)
I come to pledge our allegiance to your cause.
MARNIE (ANTONIA):
So tell me, young lady, exactly what are you offering?
Support.
Hmm.
Muscle.
Hmm.
We hate vampires every bit as much as you do.
Well, I doubt that.
(DIALOGUE CONTINUES UNINTELLIGIBLY)
MARNIE (ANTONIA):
How so?
DEBBIE:
What else?
Money, drugs.
DEBBIE:
Got to the point where pretty much my entire pack is... (DIALOGUE CONTINUES UNINTELLIGIBLY)
(WHISPERING) Eric!
Sookie.
Hey, come on, let's get you out of here.
You should go.
You're under her spell, aren't you?
What is she making you do?
Kill the king.
Kill the king?
You mean Bill?
Goddamn it, Sook.
How fuckin' stupid can you be?
What little I know about werewolves is that werewolves do not like to be known.
Why are you making yourselves known to me now?
Uh, like, like I said, you know, on account of your cause and all.
(WHISPERING) Sookie Stackhouse!
The telepath?
Yes, who aids vampires.
I brought her to you.
Tara!
Do not shoot!
This one could be of use to us.
Uh, okay.
Oh, Sookie.
Just drop the gun!
HOLLY:
Sookie.
Shoot her, shoot her, shoot her!
Fucking chill, Roy!
You always been stupid, but comin' here has gotta be about the stupidest shit I ever heard of.
Are you even listenin' to me?
We're all being held hostage.
Bill's at the Dorcester Hotel.
Keep her here.
Charge me, Sookie.
Charge me now!
(GUN FIRES)
No!
No, no, no!
(ANTONIA YELLING)
I'm really fuckin' sorry, Antonia, but she charged me
Y'all saw it!
Fuckin' werewolf.
SOOKIE:
Debbie!
Shit.
(CAR STARTING)
You had me worried sick.
Shreveport, Dorcester.
Now.
Mr. Northman, it's time to go.
Yes, Antonia.
Uh, Roy, you come with.
(WHISPERING) Yes.
The rest of you stay here.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
WOMAN:
I can't take this anymore, I can't, I mean,
I mean, I don't even think I'm a real Wiccan!
I was just doing this to piss off my parents!
Let's get the fuck outta here!
(SCREAMS)
(AGONIZED MOANING)
Are you all right?
Try the front door!
(WOMAN 2) I'm already on it!
(WOMAN 2 SCREAMING IN PAIN)
Oh, fuck.
MAN:
I am risking' life and limb here tonight, so that all of you across this great country of ours can witness Shreveport, Louisiana's pre-Halloween pageantry of vamp bullshit.
So without further ado...
EMCEE:
And now, our special guest tonight, Joyce Watney.
(CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING)
I founded the LSU chapter of the Living Dead Alliance after having a deeply personal experience with a vampire.
My big sister, Julie Watney.
(CAMERA SNAPS)
When I was 12 and she was 19, Julie disappeared.
We never saw her again until three years ago, when vampires came out of the coffin.
Mom, Dad, and I were having Sunday night dinner, and the doorbell rings,
(CHOKING UP) and it's Julie, wanting to know if she could watch us eat.
(APPLAUSE)
Are we the only vampires here?
Other than this one's sister we're about to trot out, yes, we are.
How can you have an event in honor of the living dead without any living dead?
It's like having a civil rights protest without any black people.
They're called African Americans, and maybe those protests wouldn't have turned into the bloodbaths they became if they hadn't been there.
Ever consider that?
JOYCE WATNEY: ...but you know what we say?
We say vampires gave us our Julie back.
They gave us a miracle.
So, put your hands together, please, for my big sister, and our family's miracle,
Ms. Julie Watney.
Watch it.
See that?
Place don't look worse for the wear.
Yeah, yeah, no, if you, I mean, if you ignore the frame d, uh, the bullet holes, and the general fucked-up-ness of everything.
Don't be bitter.
Hoyt, we witnessed a miracle tonight.
Mmm-hmm.
Is this yours?
No.
No, that goes in the monster box.
The monster box?
Yeah, I packed all her shit up.
Well, she ain't a monster.
Sometimes things just... don't work out.
Man, I gave her my heart, I gave her my soul, I gave her my life.
Wanna see what I got in return?
These.
It's the only thing I got out of the year we spent together, so take the monster's CD, and put it in the monster's monster box, and you take it to her for me, will you?
You want me to take it to her?
Yeah.
She's at vampire Bill's house.
Just swing it by on your way home.
The thing is, it ain't... it ain't my place, getting mixed up in all this, so, uh...
Man, you're my best friend in the whole world, so if it ain't your place, whose place is it?
Please?
I don't wanna see her, all right?
Ever again.
(TENT UNZIPPING)
Hey.
She fall asleep already?
Shh.
Can I help you?
My name is Sam Merlotte.
Is Marcus here?
We been expectin' you.
(MEN CHATTERING)
MARCUS:
Well, I'm glad you came.
Nate here bet me 50 bucks you wouldn't.
Said you didn't have the balls.
Live and learn, Nate.
Ain't never smart betting' against me.
I reckon it wasn't.
Why am I here?
Stop fuckin' my wife.
First off, she ain't your wife no more.
Not really.
We're workin' shit out!
And second, you can't stop fuckin' somebody, when you ain't fuckin' 'em in the first place!
Now, screwing' another man's wife, well, that's one thing, but lookin 'him in the eye and lyin' about it...
I ain't lying'.
I ain't even touched her.
BIKER:
Yeah, right.
Nice try.
Can't say the same about my brother, though, 'cause he had her every which way.
Told me she was sweet, too.
(ROARS)
(GRUNTING)
Shit.
(MOANING)
NATE:
Don't bet against you, huh?
Goddamn it, Marcus, call 'em off!
NATE:
Who's the smart money on now?
(MOANING)
(GROWLING)
Hey, Marcus, you gave me your word!
He mouthed off to me!
So the fuck what?
(MOANING LOUDLY)
Look at him!
(CHOKING SOUNDS)
Oh, Jesus.
BIKER:
How'd the hell he do that?
That ain't Merlotte.
That's his brother.
Fuck.
Get him outta here.
(GROWLING)
Come on, Debbie.
I have to say, for a badass werewolf, you drive like a girl.
Sorry.
NAN:
Today's media landscape is ratings-driven, and unfortunately, it's the Russell Edgingtons of the world who drive ratings.
But facts are facts, even if the fact is that facts are almost never heard.
So let's hear some, shall we?
NAN:
Fact.
From July of last year...
Fact.
Human-on-vampire crime was also down almost 20%.
You have cornered me.
I surrender.
(CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
This is great!
...and I share your beliefs.
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)
Jason.
Uh, where's the security?
Bill had an event at some hotel.
What are you doing here?
Um,
this box is for you.
It's all your stuff.
Hoyt said, he said he wanted you to have 'em, so.
That how he said it?
I might be parrot-phrasing a little.
Jessie, you all right?
Oh, I'm just fine.
If you ever need to talk...
Would you maybe wanna come in?
You know, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Okay.
Yeah.
So, I'm...
I'm, I'm gonna go.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh!
(MOANING)
Thank you.
Do you want me to come in with you?
No.
No need to get into any more trouble on my account.
Go on, go home to Alcide.
And now I'd like to introduce to you one of the most generous benefactors the state of Louisiana has ever known,
Bon Temps entrepreneur and philanthropist, Mr. William Compton.
Can you even breathe?
'Cause I can't.
BILL:
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
What a wonderful night, for a wonderful cause.
But make no mistake, there is still much work to be done, for history teaches us that war can sound a louder call to action than can peace.
CROWD:
Right.
Yeah.
That a message of hate can seduce an impressionable mind far more readily than a message of love.
Which means we must remain vigilant...
SOOKIE:
Bill!
Sookie?
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
(LOUD GRUNT)
(SCREAMING)
Bill!
SOOKIE:
They're comin' for you, Bill!
Run!
Come on, Sookie, stay with me.
Come on, please.
Sookie?
Sookie?
Sookie, drink.
Come on.
I'm so sorry, I should never have let you come tonight.
Then why did you?
Werewolf, I'm gonna need you to shut the fuck up.
Come on, drink.
Sookie?
- Don't look like she's taking it.
- Because she isn't.
- Does she even have a pulse?
- Barely.
Come on.
Well, ain't there anything else we can do?
We can pray.
Werewolf and a vampire.
Who's gonna listen?
That, I do not know.
- He killed Beverleen.
- The son of a bitch!
- She was my favorite ex-sister-in-law.
- What did you bring him back here for?
He is under my control.
Tell them, blond one.
- I am yours.
- So fucking cool.
Wash your face.
Bill offered you an olive branch tonight.
Why didn't you take it?
Everyone join hands.
We must cast a protective spell against the vampires so we can be safe here.
I said, join hands.
I think I speak for everyone here when I say I don't think this is what any of us signed up for.
Does she speak for everyone?
She sure as hell speaks for me.
Not for me.
I didn't know what I was getting into, but I'm pleased as punch that I'm in it.
- Good boy, Roy.
- Thank you, Antonia.
Anybody else?
I found this stapled to a lamppost out front.
Tomorrow night we are going to go to this and we are gonna take the blond one with us so the whole world will see what vampires are capable of.
And what we are capable of doing to them.
- Marnie?
- My name is Antonia.
Jesus Christ.
Please, I'm begging you.
I got kids.
Nobody leaves.
Or what?
Try it, and you'll find out.
Sookie.
You made it.
Where's Eric?
Sookie, you were shot.
- You can't still--
- Where is he?
I have my men out looking for him.
Now that you're all right I'll go and join them and search myself--
Am I the only one here who thinks this is batshit crazy?
Sookie, you just came this close to dying because of fucking fangers.
Again.
Every minute that we spend not looking for him--
Fine.
I'm done here.
I'm done.
Bill?
Thanks for the blood.
Anytime.
She finally fall asleep?
You should go, Sam.
This is not your problem.
Well, what if I want it to be my problem?
Trust me, you do not want Marcus to be your problem.
Is that why Emma couldn't get to sleep?
She's scared he'll come back?
Are you?
I ain't leaving.
Well, it'll be worse for everyone if he does come back and you're still here.
Well, then let's nobody be here.
No.
No, I'm trying to teach Emma not to run from her problems.
Well, who said anything about running?
I'm talking about the three of us going camping, getting back to nature, and getting back to nature is the 100 percent opposite of running away.
I don't wanna have to wake Emma up.
Just carry her from her bed to the back seat.
She won't know anything till she wakes up to breakfast cooked on a campfire.
If it's sharing a tent that's stopping you, you don't have to worry.
- I am a multiple tent owner.
- Oh, are you?
Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
From this point they travel to a costume shop.
Now they seem to make some selections at the costume shop.
- Leave--
- Wait.
- For a drink.
It's a very difficult--
- Oh, my God!
That is my sister!
She gets into his vehicle and it's difficult to see.
They spend some time in there before he gets out, straightens himself up....
On this day we again had our detective outside of Jake's place.
Tonight he leaves--
So then I go over to Jason's house, because I thought maybe he might, like understand what I was going through, but he just kicked me out also.
And this is-- This is the worst day of my life.
I wish I was dead.
Except I am, and it doesn't even matter.
There have been times, I'll admit, when it's occurred to me that maybe I should put my career on hold and become a maker.
But these last several hours here with you have erased those doubts forever.
You are nothing like you are on TV.
Oh, thanks.
Nan.
I thought it best I go to ground here, what with the Festival of Tolerance event starting so early tomorrow night.
Saw you on the news, by the way.
You did quite well.
Really got in front of the story.
Speaking of, what is the story, my king?
What have you gone and fucked up now?
I almost hesitate to ask, but lest there be more surprises is there anything else I need to know?
Only that Northman is missing.
What?
How?
Last we spoke, you were about to show him the true death.
I changed my mind.
What a decisive leader you've turned out to be.
We'll have to cancel tomorrow night.
It's possible that Eric has fallen under Antonia's influence, just as Luis did.
Canceling is not an option.
What is so important about this event that you are willing to risk your life?
- There are factions within--
- Factions within what?
The AVL?
The Authority?
Unless you tell me, I cannot agree to--
Right now, crews from CNN, VTV, Fox News and bloggers from across the country are already outside the hotel waiting.
What would you have me tell them?
Blame the witches.
America's had no problem doing it in the past.
I didn't think it was possible but you actually make me long for Queen Sophie Anne.
I mean, what the fuck, Bill?
How did you let it come to this?
- It was you that let it come to this.
- I don't see how--
And there is the problem in a nutshell.
Everybody can see it but you.
Beyond tomorrow's headline, you are a blind person.
I would just love for you to say that to my face when I'm not chained in silver.
It's what I've been saying all along.
Bolster security if you feel it necessary but tomorrow's Festival of Tolerance is going forward and the cameras had damn well better find you in a festive and tolerant fucking mood.
Am I understood?
Perfectly.
Come on, baby.
We're home now.
We're home now, baby boy.
Yeah, we home.
Oh, my baby.
Lafayette?
Get out of my house.
- Get out of my house.
- Man, this ain't your house.
That ain't your baby, either.
That's Mikey.
This is my baby.
Now get out of my house, you.
What the fuck, Lafayette?
This my baby.
It's his daddy that came and took him, I know it was.
- Arlene?
- Ain't that his daddy, standing right there?
Well, why are you treating us like criminals?
We didn't abduct our own child.
I'm just trying to get the story straight.
Without it, we got no idea where to look.
Hear that?
We're dealing with amateurs.
We're just gonna have to find him ourselves.
I mean, you know, is he here?
Is he here?
Y'all need to stop touching shit.
- Just look everywhere.
- This here's a crime scene.
- Sons of bitches took my gun.
- They took my son, coz.
Deputy Jason Stackhouse.
J, it's me.
Lafayette just walked through my front door with Arlene's baby...
- ...a doll and a gun.
- Arlene?
Arlene?
Hoyt's got the baby.
I knew that Fortenberry kid wasn't right.
Be right there.
Anything else I need to know?
Had one just like him in my platoon, just big and wrong.
He says Lafayette nearly took a shot at him.
- With my gun?
- Lafayette took Mikey?
Hoyt also said he came running out of the house with no pants on.
- We need to get him pants.
- We don't have time.
Won't take but a minute.
I don't wanna see that shit.
- I'm coming with you.
- You ain't.
Stackhouse, he ain't.
- No.
- Terry.
- Damn it.
- Arlene?
- That is my child.
- It's our child.
Our child....
What?
It's daytime.
Sookie.
Bill?
What are you doing here?
Ask Sookie.
It's her dream.
- Sookie?
- I don't know what he's doing here.
Yes, you do.
Tell him.
Tell him you never stopped loving me.
Is this true?
What?
Now everyone can hear everyone?
- Is it?
- Well, yes.
But it's not my fault.
He gave me his blood.
He gave you his.
- Sookie is mine.
- Eric, don't.
Bullshit.
She's mine.
Guys, I don't want you two fighting over me, please.
- I'm 10 times your age.
- And I love her 20 times as much.
Goddamn it, stop.
Thank you.
Now, this is my dream, so both y'all need to shut up and listen to me.
Come on.
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Get your butts in the living room.
We need to have a little talk.
"Sam, I came to say goodbye but you wasn't here so I'm writing you instead.
I fucked up."
I'm looking for Sam Merlotte.
He around?
- Who's asking?
- Name's Marcus.
- Marcus what?
- He knows who I am.
Well, he ain't around, Marcus He-Knows-Who-l-Am.
- Who are you?
- His brother.
No shit.
Shifter got his self a shifter brother, huh?
All right, then.
You give him this, will you?
I'll be waiting for him tonight.
You tell him to be there or else he gonna have a bigger fucking problem on his hands than he already got.
I'll be sure and do that.
- Our perp still inside?
- Yup.
- The son of a bitch.
- Y'all bring me any pants?
Andy got them.
Andy.
Pants.
- I forgot.
- You went in the room to get them.
Well, indict me for being a little on edge, why don't you?
It's my kin in there.
Stay back.
Lafayette.
Lafayette, you in there?
Goddamn it.
It's Sheriff Bellefleur, Lafayette.
You sound like a white man, you!
You know damn well I'm a white man.
No chances I opening no door for no white man, me.
Open the door, you racist shitbag, or I will open it the fuck up for you.
- Andy?
- You hear me?
- Hey.
Protocol is to defuse the situation.
- Fuck that.
This situation became pre-undefused the minute that she-male broke into my house.
Lafayette Reynolds, on behalf of Renard Parish the state of Louisiana and Jesus Christ his fucking self...
- ...ready or not, here we come.
- What--?
Andy!
Don't even think about it, Lafayette.
I ain't gonna let you shoot him.
Drop the weapon.
- My weapon.
- Hand over the baby.
Get out of my house.
- Shit.
- Andy, come on, come on.
Fuck!
Jesus fuck!
Holy shit, you all right?
How'd you let him get the drop, Stackhouse?
What the hell was I supposed to do, shoot him with the baby in his arms?
- Shit.
- Fuck.
What are you doing here?
- I told y'all not to come.
- Go away, youse.
I got plenty more bullets, me.
- Why are you doing this, Lafayette?
- My name's Mavis.
- He's lost it.
- Mavis?
- I'm going in.
No quarter.
- No, no, no, no.
We can't let you do that.
- What the hell, coz?
- Let us handle this.
Get the fuck off of me.
Let me go.
- You ain't going nowhere.
- Get off my goddamn arms.
You're jealous because I got a wife and a life and a baby to love and you got nothing and nobody.
How'd you get so fucking strong?
Come here, bunny.
She seems to have forgotten all about last night's drama.
What is it, Sam, do you need to hear me say it?
I'm a weak man, Luna, I kind of do.
You were right.
This is a great idea.
You're the best.
That's what I'm talking about.
At school, we have this regular bunny.
She lets you hold her.
These nature bunnies, all they do is run away.
That's because nature bunnies are smart and like to exercise.
- School bunnies are fat and lazy.
- We don't say "fat."
- Oh, sorry.
- It's okay.
I hope I turn out to be a shifter instead of a werewolf.
Where'd that come from, bug?
Because if I'm a shifter, one day I can be my own bunny and pet myself whenever I want.
Emma, whatever you wind up being is what you're supposed to be and you're perfect, understand?
Why are you getting all serious for?
I just wanna pet a bunny.
Girl wants to pet a bunny.
I'm gonna go catch her that bunny.
Give me a minute.
One minute.
Come here, little guy.
- He's so cute.
- Isn't he?
I could be dreaming about anything.
I could be swimming with dolphins or eating a whole pie without any consequences but instead I'm here with the two of you.
Now, that's gotta mean something.
I'm afraid to ask what.
I think--
I think I'm in love with both of you.
You can't be.
That's not who you are.
Because I've always been this self-conscious good little girl who's too scared to think outside the box especially when it comes to love and sex.
But as of right now I'm putting that little girl behind me.
- What exactly are you proposing?
- That I can love both of you.
That I don't have to be yours or yours.
I'm proposing that the two of you be mine.
I'm the king of Louisiana.
I do not share.
You have to choose.
Okay, first of all, you guys are vampires.
What's with all the morality?
And second of all, this is such a double standard.
When it's two women and one guy everyone's hunky-dory with it even if they barely know each other.
But when a woman tries to have her way with two men she is totally and completely in love with everyone's hemming and hawing.
I'm saying I love you.
Both of you.
And I'm asking you to love me back.
Together.
It's either both of you, or nothing at all.
Take it or leave it.
One drop at a time, girlfriend, okay?
No more.
This shit's a whole other level.
You ever drink V directly from the source?
You ever push your face up against a vampire's cold skin...
- ...and just sucked it right out of him?
- Fuck no.
Well, I have.
So don't be a cunt.
Just breathe.
Breathe.
It's not real.
It's the V. It'll pass.
I'm putting you in charge of this.
That's the first good decision you made all day.
Jesus, what the hell you doing here?
I called him.
- Get down.
- Why is he doing this?
I have no idea.
Hey, come here.
Hey, hey.
I got a theory.
When you guys role-play does Lafayette ever turn into a woman named Mavis?
I'm gonna forget you said that, and I'm gonna head on in.
- Hey, hey, he's got a gun.
- I'm going in, Jason.
- It's against protocol.
- What, you're gonna shoot me?
I'm gonna get your baby back.
I'm going with.
Echelon formation.
Now he's defiladed.
If I approach from the flanks--
I'm a nurse.
I'm not even gonna pretend I understand what you just said.
- I should go in by myself.
- What if--?
- No.
I do not wanna fight fire with fire.
- Don't worry.
- I got this.
- Stay here.
Let him go in.
Goddamn it.
He's a nurse.
He's just a nurse.
Oh, fuck.
- Just you and me now, you.
- Lafayette?
Who you with, you?
Monsieur Virgil?
What's your name?
Is it Mavis?
- What you want, you?
- I just wanna help.
Okay?
And I think I can.
I'm a brujo.
- A practitioner of magic.
- I got all the magic I need, me, right here.
- I'm sorry, Mavis, but he is not your baby.
- You lie!
- No, no.
No, no.
- Why you come to take my baby?
That woman who's been crying, she is this baby's mommy.
You broke into their house and took him from her.
- I would never take another woman's baby.
- I know, I know.
I think something happened to you something you never made peace with.
And I don't know what, but whatever it was, it killed you.
I no dead.
Now your spirit is looking for a way back, and since my boyfriend is a medium you found it by entering his body.
Boyfriend?
How I make the baby with this, me?
- You didn't.
- No.
My baby, my baby boy.
He dead?
No.
I'm so sorry, Mavis.
I am so, so sorry.
I just wanna hold him.
Just one-
- Just one last time.
You, you got that kind of magic in you?
We can try.
Okay, but if you do find Mr. Northman, please have King Bill call me or you call me, or I don't know, something.
Hey there, Sookie.
Hope you like flowers.
Come in.
Alcide was the first, the only, man that I ever loved if you count out Coot, which believe me, I really wish I could.
So when I saw Alcide with you and the way he cared about you, I just--
Debbie, I understand being jealous, but you tried to kill me.
That ain't something you can expect someone to forget.
I don't.
That's not why I came.
I know you're in trouble and I'm wondering if there's anything I could do to help, that's all.
Did Alcide tell you I was in trouble?
He didn't have to.
He came home last night with your blood on him.
If he didn't tell you, how did you know the blood was mine?
Because I remember the smell.
Look, I ain't asking to be best friends.
You know, I'd be crazy if I expected that, and I ain't crazy.
But can't we try and make things better just a little at a time.
Don't talk.
Just let me listen.
What?
Love Alcide, love him so much.
Nothing I wouldn't do for him.
Why can't she believe me?
I need her to see that I wanna help.
Okay.
I believe you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Good.
You know, Alcide told me that you think it's a curse, being what you are.
But I think it'd be nice to know what people are thinking every once in a while.
He loves you.
He really does.
- Thank you.
- So....
You really wanna help?
Because I sure as heck could use some.
Please just let me hold him one last time!
Please!
Tell me the last thing you remember.
Him and me was outside fighting.
I wanna see my baby.
I tell him I wanna hold him but he say I couldn't.
He want to get away from me but I followed them inside.
Why?
Why can't I hold him?
And then he told me.
"Because, sugar, I already done buried him."
He already buried my boy.
I don't want to go through this again, you.
I just wanna know where my baby is.
Which is why you have to go through this.
Mr. Virgil went into the kitchen.
- Please.
- Stop!
- He was standing by the sink.
- Please!
He wouldn't look at me.
- And look me in the eyes.
- I started tugging on him to make him look.
- Look at me!
- And then it was inside of me.
- What was it?
- The knife.
Then I just fell to the floor, floated up and watched myself die.
- What happened next?
- He started shoveling.
I couldn't take it no more, me, so I left.
Where was he shoveling?
Out there, yonder, under the tree.
Don't shoot!
We're coming out!
Mikey.
You got the shot, Stackhouse, take him out.
They ain't even got the gun no more, Andy.
- Fuck me.
- Hoyt, we need a shovel.
- A shovel?
What the hell for?
- Just get it.
Hi, sweet boy.
I can't say how sorry I am about all this, me.
Don't worry about it.
Sometimes these things happen.
We still love you, Lafayette.
My name's Mavis.
My boy.
My sweet baby boy.
- It's gonna be okay.
- My heart hurts, I love you so much.
What you said, about me moving up in the pack?
I want in.
Well, what changed between then and now?
You want honesty or you just want me to kiss the ring?
Well, I'll take honesty every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
- It's important to Debbie.
- That's it?
What's important to Debbie's gotta be important to me, now more than ever.
I mean it.
Whatever you need, I'm there.
Well, you know what I call a dude that'll admit there ain't nothing he won't do for the woman he loves?
- What?
- A man.
- To Shreveport.
- To Shreveport.
Hey, what are you up to the rest of the night?
- Wide open.
- Well, you might have heard me talk about my wife before.
We're separated.
Going through a rough patch and now some fucking shifter is looking to replace me.
- Shit.
- Right?
Anyways, I got this son of a bitch of hers stopping by a little later on for a talk.
I was hoping you wouldn't mind sticking around.
It ain't my style to go beating on people I got no beef with.
Now that's-- That's not what I'm asking for, I swear.
I just need to communicate with him that I can and I will hurt him if I have to.
Since you're about 6'6" and wider than a door he might be more inclined to listen with you standing behind me.
- To communicating shit.
- To communicating shit.
I want you to know how sorry I am, Stackhouse.
And I want you to know how little that means to me because I heard it all before, too many times.
Do something useful and turn on the lights because we can't see shit down there.
Think I got something.
- What?
- What down there?
- I don't know.
- You think it's him, you?
I think it's both of you.
My baby.
It's time.
You found him and you held him but now I need my Lafayette back.
Where I go?
It's not for us to know.
Holy fuck.
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle.
Monsieur Lafayette.
- Thank you for everything.
- You got it, bitch.
We are closed for the evening.
I know what you're up against.
I know who you're up against.
I said, we're closed.
I represent the Shreveport pack of werewolves.
I come to pledge our allegiance to your cause.
So tell me, young lady, exactly what are you offering?
Support.
Muscle.
We hate vampires every bit as much as you do.
Well, I doubt that.
Look in my eyes.
Look in my soul.
If you don't see hatred....
All right, then.
I'll hear you out.
What's your sad vampire story?
Vampires kept their business from us, and we kept our business from them.
But when they came out of the coffin, the lines got blurred.
How so?
Well, money, drugs.
Got to the point where pretty much my entire pack was on some vampire's payroll.
We did all his dirty work while he slept all day.
In exchange he'd supply us with vampire blood.
- What does it do?
- What?
Vampire blood.
How does it make you feel?
Eric!
- Sookie.
- Hey, come on, let's get you out of here.
You should go.
You're under her spell, aren't you?
What is she making you do?
- Kill the king.
- Kill the king?
You mean Bill?
Goddamn it, Sook, how fucking stupid can you be?
What little I know about werewolves is that werewolves do not like to be known.
Why are you making yourselves known to me now?
Like I said, you know, on account of your cause and all.
Sookie Stackhouse.
- The telepath?
- Yes, who aids vampires.
I brought her to you.
Tara, do not shoot!
This one could be of use to us.
- Okay.
- Oh, Sookie.
- Just drop the gun.
- Sookie.
Shoot her, shoot her, shoot her!
- Fucking chill, Roy.
- You always been stupid but coming here has gotta be the stupidest shit I ever heard of.
Are you even listening to me?
We're all being held hostage.
Bill's at the Dorchester Hotel.
Charge me, Sookie.
Charge me now!
No!
No, no, no!
Tara, stop!
No!
I'm really fucking sorry, Antonia, but she charged me.
Y'all saw it!
Fucking werewolf.
- Debbie!
- Shit.
- You had me worried sick.
- Shreveport, Dorchester.
Now.
Mr. Northman, it's time to go.
Yes, Antonia.
Roy, you come with.
- Yes.
- The rest of you stay here.
I can't take this anymore.
I can't.
I mean, I mean--
I don't even think I'm a real Wiccan.
I was just doing this to piss off my parents.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Are you all right?
- Try the front door!
I'm already on it!
Oh, fuck.
I am risking life and limb here tonight so that all of you across this great country of ours can witness Shreveport Louisiana's pre-Halloween pageantry of vamp bullshit.
- So without further ado....
- Our special guest tonight, Joyce Watney.
I founded the LSU chapter of the Living Dead Alliance after having a deeply personal experience with a vampire.
My big sister, Julie Watney.
When I was 12 and she was 19, Julie disappeared.
We never saw her again, until three years ago when vampires came out of the coffin.
Mom, Dad and I were having Sunday night dinner and the doorbell rings, and it's Julie wanting to know if she could watch us eat.
Are we the only vampires here?
Other than this one's sister we're about to trot out, yes, we are.
How can you have an event in honor of the living dead without any living dead?
It's like having a civil rights protest without any black people.
They're called African-Americans.
Maybe those protests wouldn't have turned into bloodbaths if they hadn't been there.
Ever consider that?
But you know what we say?
We say vampires gave us our Julie back.
They gave us a miracle, so put your hands together, please for my big sister and our family's miracle, Ms. Julie Watney.
Watch it.
See that?
Place don't look worse for the wear.
Yeah, I mean, if you ignore the frame and the bullet holes and the general fucked-upness of everything.
Don't be bitter.
Hoyt, we witnessed a miracle tonight.
- Is this yours?
- No.
No, that goes in the monster box.
The monster box?
- Yeah, I packed all her shit up.
- Well, she ain't a monster.
Sometimes things just don't work out.
Man, I gave her my heart, I gave her my soul, I gave her my life.
Wanna see what I got in return?
These.
It's the only thing I got out of the year we spent together.
Take the monster's CD and put it in the monster's box and you take it to her for me, will you?
You want me to take it to her?
Yeah.
She's at Vampire Bill's house.
Just swing it by on your way home.
The thing is, it ain't--
It ain't my place, getting mixed up in all this, so--
Man, you're my best friend in the whole world so if it ain't your place, whose place is it?
Please?
I don't wanna see her, all right?
Ever again.
Hey.
She fall asleep already?
Can I help you?
My name is Sam Merlotte.
Is Marcus here?
We've been expecting you.
Who we got here?
About time.
Well, I'm glad you came.
Nate here bet me 50 bucks you wouldn't.
Said you didn't have the balls.
Live and learn, Nate.
Ain't never smart betting against me.
I reckon it wasn't.
- Why am I here?
- Stop fucking my wife.
First off, she ain't your wife no more.
Not really.
We're working shit out.
Second, you can't stop fucking somebody when you ain't fucking in the first place.
Now, screwing another man's wife, well, that's one thing but looking him in the eye and lying about it--
I ain't lying.
- I ain't even touched her.
- Yeah, right.
Nice try.
Can't say the same about my brother, though because he had her every which way.
Told me she was sweet too.
Shit.
- Don't bet against you, huh?
- Goddamn it, Marcus, call them off!
Who's the smart money on now?
Hey, Marcus, you gave me your word.
- He mouthed off to me.
- So the fuck what?
Look at him.
- Jesus.
- How the hell he do that?
That ain't Merlotte.
That's his brother.
Fuck.
Get him out of here.
Come on, Debbie.
I have to say, for a badass werewolf, you drive like a girl.
Sorry.
Today's media landscape is ratings-driven and unfortunately it's the Russell Edgingtons of the world who drive ratings.
But facts are facts even if the fact is that facts are almost never heard.
So let's hear some, shall we?
Fact: from July of....
Fact: human-on-vampire crime was also down almost 20 percent.
You have cornered me.
I surrender.
This is great.
And I share your beliefs.
Jason.
Where's the security?
Bill had an event at some hotel.
What are you doing here?
This box is for you.
It's all your stuff.
Hoyt said....
He said he wanted you to have them, so....
That how he said it?
I might be parrot-phrasing a little.
Jessie, you all right?
I'm just fine.
If you ever needed to talk....
Would you maybe wanna come in?
You know, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Okay.
Yeah.
So I'm....
I'm gonna go.
Okay.
Okay.
- Thank you.
- Do you want me to come in with you?
No.
No need to get into any more trouble on my account.
Go on, go home to Alcide.
And now I'd like to introduce to you one of the most generous benefactors the state of Louisiana has ever known.
Bon Temps entrepreneur and philanthropist Mr. William Compton.
Can you even breathe?
Because I can't.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
What a wonderful night for a wonderful cause.
But make no mistake.
There is still much work to be done for history teaches us that war can sound a louder call to action than can peace.
That's right, Bill.
That a message of hate can seduce an impressionable mind far more readily than a message of love.
- Which means we must remain vigilant--
- Bill!
- Sookie?
- Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Bill!
They're coming for you, Bill.
Run!
Come on, Sookie, stay with me.
Come on, please!
Sookie?
Sookie?
Sookie, drink.
Come on!
I'm so sorry, I should never have let you come tonight.
Then why did you?
Werewolf, I'm gonna need you to shut the fuck up!
Come on, drink.
Sookie?
Don't look like she's takin' it.
That's because she isn't.
Does she even have a pulse?
Barely.
Come on.
Well, ain't there anything else we can do?
We can pray.
Werewolf and a vampire.
Who's gonna listen?
That, I do not know.
♪ When you came in the air went out
♪ And every shadow filled up with doubt
♪ I don't know who you think you are, but before the night is through
♪ I want to do bad things with you
♪ I'm the kind to sit up in his room
♪ Heartsick and eyes filled up with blue
♪ I don't know what you've done to me, but I know this much is true
♪ I want to do bad things with you
♪ I want to do real bad things with you ♪
He killed Beverleen!
I silvered the son of a bitch...
She was my favorite ex-sister-in-law.
What in the hell did you bring him back here for?
He is under my control.
Tell them, blond one.
I am yours.
So fuckin' cool!
Wash your face.
Bill offered you an olive branch tonight.
Why didn't you take it?
Everyone join hands.
We must cast a protective spell against the vampires, so we can be safe here.
I said join hands!
Um, I think I speak for everyone here when I say
I don't think this is what any of us signed up for.
Uh, does she speak for everyone?
She sure as hell speaks for me.
Not for me.
I didn't know what I was gettin' into, but I'm pleased as punch that I'm in it.
Good boy, Roy.
Thank you, Antonia.
Anybody else?
I found this stapled to a lamppost out front.
Tomorrow night we are going to go to this, and we are gonna take the blond one with us, so the whole world will see what vampires are capable of,
and what we are capable of doing to them.
Marnie...
My name is Antonia!
Jesus Christ.
Please, I'm begging you.
I got kids.
Nobody leaves.
Or what?
Try it, and you'll find out.
Sookie.
You made it.
Where's Eric?
Sookie, you were shot.
You can't still...
Where is he?
I already have my men out looking for him.
Now that I know that you're all right,
I'll go and join them and I will search for him myself until...
Am I the only one here who thinks this is batshit crazy?
Sookie, you just came this close to dying', because of fuckin' fangers.
Again!
Every minute that we spend not looking for him...
Fine.
I'm done here.
I'm done.
Bill?
Thanks for the blood.
Anytime.
She finally fall asleep?
You should go, Sam.
This is not your problem.
Well, what if I want it to be my problem?
Trust me, you do not want Marcus to be your problem.
Is that why Emma couldn't get to sleep?
She's scared he'll come back?
Are you?
I ain't leaving'.
Well, it'll be worse for everyone if he does come back and you're still here.
Well, then let's nobody be here.
No.
No, I'm trying to teach Emma not to run from her problems.
Well, who said anything about runnin'?
I'm talkin' about the three of us, goin' campin', gettin' back to nature, and getting back to nature is 100% opposite of running away.
I don't wanna have to wake Emma up.
Just carry her from her bed to the back seat.
She won't know anything till she wakes up to breakfast cooked on a campfire.
If it's sharing' a tent that's stoppin' you, you don't have to worry.
I am a multiple tent owner.
Oh, are you?
Yeah, I'm kind of a big deal.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So then, I go over to Jason's house, because I thought maybe he might, like, understand what I was going through, but he just kicked me out also.
And this is just the worst day of my life.
I wish I was dead.
Except I am, and it doesn't even matter.
There have been times, I'll admit, when it's occurred to me that maybe I should put my career on hold and become a maker,
but these last several hours here with you have erased those doubts forever.
You are nothing like you are on TV.
Aw, thanks.
Nan.
I thought it best I go to ground here, what with the Festival of Tolerance event starting so early tomorrow night.
Saw you on the news, by the way.
You did quite well.
Really got in front of the story.
Speaking of, what is the story, my king?
What have you gone and fucked up now?
I almost hesitate to ask, but lest there be more surprises, is there anything else I need to know?
Only that Northman is missing.
What?
How?
Last we spoke, you were about to show him the true death.
I changed my mind.
Decisive leader you've turned out to be.
We'll have to cancel tomorrow night.
It's possible that Eric has fallen under Antonia's influence, just as Luis did.
Canceling is not an option.
What is so important about this event that you are willing to risk your life and mine?
There are factions within...
Factions within what?
The AVL?
The Authority?
Unless you tell me,
I cannot agree to...
Right now crews from CNN, VTV, Fox News and bloggers from across the country are already outside the hotel, waiting.
What would you have me tell them?
Blame the witches.
America's had no problem doing it in the past.
I didn't think it was possible, but you actually make me long for Queen Sophie-Anne.
I mean, what the fuck, Bill?
How did you let it come to this?
It was you that let it come to this!
I don't see how I'm responsible...
And there is the problem in a nutshell!
Everybody can see it but you.
Beyond tomorrow's headline, u are a blind person.
I would just love for you to say that to my face when I'm not chained in silver.
It's what I've been saying all along!
Bolster security if you feel it necessary, but tomorrow's Festival of Tolerance is going forward, and the cameras had damn well better find you in a festive and tolerant fucking mood.
Am I understood?
Perfectly.
Come on, baby.
Ooh, we're home now.
We're home now, baby boy.
Yeah, we home.
Oh, my baby.
Lafayette?
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!
Whoa, man, this ain't your house.
That ain't your baby, either.
That's Mikey!
This is my baby!
Now get out of my house, you.
What the fuck, Lafayette?
This my baby.
It's his daddy that came and took him, I know it was.
Uh, Arlene...
Ain't that his daddy, standing right there?
Well why are you treating us like criminals?
We didn't abduct our own child!
I'm just trying to get the story straight.
Without it, we got no idea where to look.
You hear that, Terry?
We're dealing with amateurs.
Well, I guess we're just gonna have to find him ourselves!
I mean, u know, is he here?
Is he here?
Huh?
Oh, y'all need to stop touching' shit!
Just look everywhere.
This here's crime scene.
Sons of bitches took my gun.
They took my son, cuz.
Deputy Jason Stackhouse.
J, it's me.
Uh, Lafayette just walked through my front door, with Arlene's baby, a doll, and a gun.
Andy.
Arlene?
Arlene.
Hoyt's got the baby.
At his place.
I knew that Fortenberry kid wasn't right.
Stay put, Bubba, we'll be right there.
Anything else I need to know?
Had one just like him in my platoon, just big and wrong.
He says Lafayette nearly took a shot at him.
With my gun?
Lafayette took Mikey?
Hoyt also said he came running out of the house with no pants on, so we need to get him pants.
What?
We don't have time for that!
It won't take but a minute, and I don't wanna see that shit.
Terry!
I'm comin' with you.
No, you ain't.
Stackhouse!
They ain't.
No.
Terry.
Damn it.
Arlene?
That is my child.
It's our child.
What?
It's daytime.
Sookie.
Bill?
What are you doing here?
Ask Sookie.
It's her dream.
Sookie?
I don't know what he's doing here.
Yes, you do.
Tell him.
Tell him you never stopped loving me.
Is this true?
What?
Now everyone can hear everyone?
Is it?
Well, yes, but it's not my fault.
He gave me his blood.
And he gave u his.
Sookie is mine.
Eric, don't.
Bullshit!
She's mine!
Guys, I don't want you two fighting' over me, please!
I'm ten times your age.
And I love her twenty times as much!
Goddamn it, stop!
Thank you.
Now, this is my dream, so both y'all need to shut up and listen to me.
Come on.
Well?
What are you waiting for?
Get your butts in the living room.
We need to have a little talk.
"Sam, I came to say goodbye, but you wasn't here, so I'm writin' you instead.
"I fucked up."
I'm lookin' for Sam Merlotte.
He around?
Who's askin'?
Name's Marcus.
Marcus what?
He knows who I am.
Well, he ain't around, Marcus He-knows-who-I-am.
Who are you?
His brother.
No shit.
Shifter got hisself a shifter brother, huh?
All right, then.
You give him this, will you?
I'll be waitin' for him tonight.
You tell him to be there, or else he gonna have a bigger fuckin' problem on his hands than he already got.
I'll be sure and do that.
Our perp still inside?
Yup.
The son of a bitch.
Y'all bring me any pants?
Andy got 'em.
Andy!
Pants.
Oh, I forgot.
You went in the room to get 'em!
Well, indict me for being a little on edge, why don't you?
It's my kin in there!
Stay back.
Lafayette!
Lafayette, you in there?
Goddamn it.
It's Sheriff Bellefleur, Lafayette.
You sound like a white man, you!
You know damn well I'm a white man!
No chance is I openin' no door for no white man, me.
Open the door, you racist shitbag, or I will open it the fuck up for you!
Andy?
You hear me?
Hey!
Protocol is to defuse the situation.
Fuck that!
This situation became pre-un-defused the minute that she-male broke into my house.
Lafayette Reynolds, on behalf of Renard Parish, the state of Louisiana, and Jesus Christ his fuckin' self,
- What are you...
- ready or not, here we come!
Andy!
Don't even think about it, Lafayette.
I ain't gonna let you shoot him.
Drop the weapon.
Hand over the baby.
It's my weapon.
Get out of my house!
Andy, come on!
Oh, Jesus, fuck!
Holy shit!
Y'all all right?
How'd you let him get the drop on you, Stackhouse?
What the hell was I supposed to do, shoot him with the baby in his arms?
- Shit.
- Fuck!
What are you doing here?
I told y'all not to me!
Go away, yous!
I got plenty more bullets, me!
Why are you doing this, Lafayette?
My name's Mavis.
He's lost it.
Mavis?
I'm goin' in.
No quarter.
No, no, no, no.
We can't let you do that.
What the hell, cuz?
Let us handle this.
Get the fuck offa me!
Let me go!
- You ain't goin' nowhere!
- Off my goddamn arms!
You're just jealous 'cause I got a wife and a life and a baby to love, and you got nothin' and nobody!
How'd you get so fuckin' strong?
C'mere, bunny!
She seems to have forgotten all about last night's drama.
What is it, Sam, do you need to hear me say it?
I'm a weak man, Luna, I kinda do.
You were right.
Ah.
This was a great idea.
You're the best.
That's what I'm talking about.
At school, we have this regular bunny.
She lets you hold her.
These nature bunnies, all they do is run away.
That's because nature bunnies are smart, and like to exercise.
School bunnies are fat and lazy.
Uh, we don't say "fat."
Oh, sorry.
It's okay.
I hope I turn out to be a shifter instead of a werewolf.
Where'd that come from, bug?
Because if I'm a shifter, one day I can be my own bunny and pet myself whenever I want.
Emma, whatever you wind up being is what you're supposed to be, and you're perfect, understand?
What are you getting all serious for?
I just wanna pet a bunny.
Girl wants to pet a bunny.
I'm gonna go catch her that bunny.
Yay.
Gimme a minute.
One minute.
Come here, little guy.
He's so cute!
Isn't he?
I could be dreaming about anything.
I could be swimming with dolphins, or eating a whole pie without any consequences, but instead I'm here with the two of you.
Now, that's gotta mean something.
I'm afraid to ask what.
I think,
I think I'm in love with both of you.
You can't be.
That's not who you are.
Only because I've always been this self-conscious, good little girl who's too scared to think outside the box, especially when it comes to love and sex.
But as of right now, I'm putting that little girl behind me.
What exactly are you proposing?
That I can love both of you.
That I don't have to be yours, or yours.
I'm proposing that the two of you... be mine.
I'm the king of Louisiana.
I do not share.
You have to choose.
Okay, first of all, you guys are vampires.
What's with all the morality?
And second of all, this is such a double standard.
When it's two women and one guy, everyone's hunky-dory with it, even if they barely know each other.
But when a woman tries to have her way with two men she is totally and completely in love with,
everyone's hemming' and hawing'.
I'm sayin' I love you.
Both of you.
And, I'm asking you to love me back.
Together.
It's either both of you, or nothin' at all.
Take it or leave it.
One drop at a time, girlfriend, okay?
No more.
This shit's a whole other level.
You ever drink V directly from the source?
You ever put your face up against a vampire's cold skin, and just sucked it right out of him?
Fuck no.
Well, I have, so don't be a cunt!
Just breathe.
Breathe.
It's not real.
It's the V. It'll pass.
I'm puttin' you in charge of this.
That's the first good decision you made all day.
Jesus, the hell you doin' here?
I called him.
Hey!
Get, get down!
Why is he doin' this?
I have no idea.
Hey, come here.
Hey, hey.
I got a theory.
When you guys, uh, role-play, does Lafayette ever turn into a woman named Mavis?
I'm gonna forget you just said that, and I'm gonna head on in.
Hey, hey, he's got a gun.
I'm goin' in, Jason.
It's, it's against protocol.
What, you're gonna shoot me?
I'm gonna get your baby back.
I'm goin' with.
Echelon formation.
Right now he's defiladed, but if I approach from the flanks...
Terry, I'm a nurse.
I'm not even gonna pretend to understand what you just said, but I think I should go in by myself.
Okay, but what if I...
Baby, no.
I do not wanna fight fire with fire.
Don't worry.
I got this.
Stay here.
Let him go in.
Goddamn it.
He's a nurse.
He's just a nurse.
Oh, fuck.
Just you and me now, you.
Lafayette?
Who you with, you?
Monsieur Virgil?
What's your name?
Is it Mavis?
What you want, you?
I just wanna help.
Okay?
And I think I can.
I'm a brujo.
A practitioner of magic.
I got all the magic I need, me, right here.
I'm sorry, Mavis, but he is not your baby.
You lie!
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Why you come to take my baby, hmm?
That woman out there who's been crying for hours, she is this baby's mami .
You broke into their house and you took him from her!
I would never take another woman's baby.
I know, I know.
I think something happened to you, something you never made peace with.
I don't know what, but whatever it was, it killed you.
I no dead.
Now your spirit is looking for a way back, and since my boyfriend is a medium, you found it by entering his body.
Boyfriend?
Oh!
Oh, no!
How I make the baby with this, me?
You didn't.
My baby.
My baby boy.
He dead?
No!
I'm so sorry, Mavis.
No!
I am so, so sorry.
I just wanna hold him, just one, just one last time.
You.
You got that kind of magic in you?
We can try.
Okay, but if you do find Mr. Northman, please have King Bill call me, or you call me, or, I don't know, something.
Hey there, Sookie.
Hope you like flowers.
Come in.
Alcide was the first, the only, man that I ever loved, if you count out Coot, which believe me, I really wish I could.
So when I saw Alcide with you, and the way he cared about you, I just...
Debbie,
I understand being jealous, but you tried to kill me.
That ain't somethin' you can expect someone to forget.
I don't.
That's not why I came.
I know you're in trouble, and I'm wondering if there's anything I could do to help, that's all.
Did Alcide tell you I was in trouble?
He didn't have to.
He came home last night with your blood on him.
If he didn't tell you, how did you know the blood was mine?
Because I remember the smell.
Look, I ain't asking to be best friends.
You know, I'd be crazy if I expected that, and I ain't crazy.
But can't we try and make things better just a little at a time?
Don't talk.
Just let me listen.
- What?
- Shh.
...love Alcide, love him so much, there ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for him.
Why can't she just believe me?
I need her to see that I wanna help.
Okay.
I believe you.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
Good!
You know, Alcide told me that you think it's a curse, being what you are.
But I think it'd be nice to know what people are thinkin' every once in a while.
He loves you.
He really does.
Thank you.
So, you really wanna help?
'Cause I sure as heck could use some.
Please, just let me hold him one last time!
Please!
Tell me the last thing you remember.
Him, me was outside fighting'.
"I wanna see my baby."
I tell him I wanna hold him, but he say I couldn't.
He want to get away from me, but I followed him inside the house, me.
Why?
Why can't I hold him?
And then he told me,
"Because, Sugar, I already done buried him."
He already buried my...
I don't want to go through this again, you.
I just wanna know where my baby is.
Which is why you have to go through this.
Monsieur Virgil went into the kitchen.
Please...
Stop!
He was standin' by the sink.
Please...
He wouldn't look at me.
...and look me in the eyes!
So I started tugging on him to make him look!
Look at me!
And then it was inside of me.
What was it?
The knife.
Then I just fell to the floor, floated up and watched myself die.
What happened next?
He started shoveling.
I couldn't take it no more, me, so I left.
Where was he shoveling?
Out there, yonder, under the tree.
Don't shoot!
We're comin' out!
Mikey?
You got the shot, Stackhouse, take him out.
They ain't even got the gun no more, Andy.
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.
Hoyt, we need a shovel.
A shovel?
What the hell for?
Just get it.
Hi, sweet boy.
Come here, Sweet Pea.
Oh, hey, sweet boy.
I can't say how sorry I am 'bout all this, me.
Don't worry about it.
Sometimes these things happen.
We still love you, Lafayette.
My name's Mavis.
My boy.
My sweet baby boy.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Oh, my heart hurts, I love you so much.
What you said, about me movin' up in the pack?
I want in.
Well, what changed 'tween then and now?
You want honesty or you just want me to kiss the ring?
Well, I'll take honesty every day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
It's important to Debbie.
That's it?
What's important to Debbie's gotta be important to me, now more than ever.
I mean it.
Whatever you need, I'm there.
Well, you know what I call a dude that'll admit there ain't nothin' he won't do for the woman he loves?
What?
A man.
To Shreveport.
To Shreveport.
Hey, what are you up to the rest of the night?
Wide open.
Well, you might have heard me talk about my wife before.
We're, uh, separated, going through a rough patch.
And now some fuckin' shifter is lookin' to replace me.
Shit.
Right?
Anyways, I got this son of a bitch of hers stopping' by a little later on for a talk.
I was hopin' you wouldn't mind sticking' around.
It ain't my style to go beatin' on people I got no beef with.
Now that's, that's not what I'm askin' for,
I swear.
I just need to communicate with him that I can, and I will, hurt him if I have to.
Since you're about six-six and wider than a door, he might be more inclined to listen with you standin' behind me.
To communicating' shit.
To communicating' shit.
I want you to know how sorry I am, Stackhouse.
And I want you to know how little that means to me, 'cause I heard it all before, too many times.
Why don't you do something useful and turn on the lights, 'cause we can't see shit down there.
Think I got somethin'.
What?
What down there?
I don't know.
You think it's him, you?
I think it's both of you.
My baby.
It's time.
You found him and you held him, but now I need my Lafayette back.
Oh, where, where I go?
It's not for us to know.
Holy fuck.
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle.
Monsieur Lafayette, thank you for everything.
You got it, bitch.
We are closed for the evening.
I know what you're up against.
I know who you're up against.
I said we're closed.
I represent the Shreveport pack of werewolves.
I come to pledge our allegiance to your cause.
MARNIE So tell me, young lady, exactly what are you offering?
Support.
Hmm.
Muscle.
Hmm.
We hate vampires every bit as much as you do.
Well, I doubt that.
MARNIE How so?
What else?
Money, drugs.
Got to the point where pretty much my entire pack is...
Eric!
Sookie.
Hey, come on, let's get you out of here.
You should go.
You're under her spell, aren't you?
What is she making you do?
Kill the king.
Kill the king?
You mean Bill?
Goddamn it, Sook.
How fuckin' stupid can you be?
What little I know about werewolves is that werewolves do not like to be known.
Why are you making yourselves known to me now?
Uh, like, like I said, you know, on account of your cause and all.
Sookie Stackhouse!
The telepath?
Yes, who aids vampires.
I brought her to you.
Tara!
Do not shoot!
This one could be of use to us.
Uh, okay.
Oh, Sookie.
Just drop the gun!
Sookie.
Shoot her, shoot her, shoot her!
Fucking chill, Roy!
You always been stupid, but comin' here has gotta be about the stupidest shit I ever heard of.
Are you even listenin' to me?
We're all being held hostage.
Bill's at the Dorcester Hotel.
Keep her here.
Charge me, Sookie.
Charge me now!
No!
No, no, no!
I'm really fuckin' sorry, Antonia, but she charged me
Y'all saw it!
Fuckin' werewolf.
Debbie!
Shit.
You had me worried sick.
Shreveport, Dorcester.
Now.
Mr. Northman, it's time to go.
Yes, Antonia.
Uh, Roy, you come with.
Yes.
The rest of you stay here.
I can't take this anymore, I can't, I mean,
I mean, I don't even think I'm a real Wiccan!
I was just doing this to piss off my parents!
Let's get the fuck outta here!
Are you all right?
Try the front door!
I'm already on it!
Oh, fuck.
I am risking' life and limb here tonight, so that all of you across this great country of ours can witness Shreveport, Louisiana's pre-Halloween pageantry of vamp bullshit.
So without further ado...
And now, our special guest tonight, Joyce Watney.
I founded the LSU chapter of the Living Dead Alliance after having a deeply personal experience with a vampire.
My big sister, Julie Watney.
When I was 12 and she was 19, Julie disappeared.
We never saw her again until three years ago, when vampires came out of the coffin.
Mom, Dad, and I were having Sunday night dinner, and the doorbell rings, and it's Julie, wanting to know if she could watch us eat.
Are we the only vampires here?
Other than this one's sister we're about to trot out, yes, we are.
How can you have an event in honor of the living dead without any living dead?
It's like having a civil rights protest without any black people.
They're called African Americans, and maybe those protests wouldn't have turned into the bloodbaths they became if they hadn't been there.
Ever consider that?
JOYCE WATNEY: ...but you know what we say?
We say vampires gave us our Julie back.
They gave us a miracle.
So, put your hands together, please, for my big sister, and our family's miracle,
Ms. Julie Watney.
Watch it.
See that?
Place don't look worse for the wear.
Yeah, yeah, no, if you, I mean, if you ignore the frame d, uh, the bullet holes, and the general fucked-up-ness of everything.
Don't be bitter.
Hoyt, we witnessed a miracle tonight.
Mmm-hmm.
Is this yours?
No.
No, that goes in the monster box.
The monster box?
Yeah, I packed all her shit up.
Well, she ain't a monster.
Sometimes things just... don't work out.
Man, I gave her my heart, I gave her my soul, I gave her my life.
Wanna see what I got in return?
These.
It's the only thing I got out of the year we spent together, so take the monster's CD, and put it in the monster's monster box, and you take it to her for me, will you?
You want me to take it to her?
Yeah.
She's at vampire Bill's house.
Just swing it by on your way home.
The thing is, it ain't... it ain't my place, getting mixed up in all this, so, uh...
Man, you're my best friend in the whole world, so if it ain't your place, whose place is it?
Please?
I don't wanna see her, all right?
Ever again.
Hey.
She fall asleep already?
Shh.
Can I help you?
My name is Sam Merlotte.
Is Marcus here?
We been expectin' you.
Well, I'm glad you came.
Nate here bet me 50 bucks you wouldn't.
Said you didn't have the balls.
Live and learn, Nate.
Ain't never smart betting' against me.
I reckon it wasn't.
Why am I here?
Stop fuckin' my wife.
First off, she ain't your wife no more.
Not really.
We're workin' shit out!
And second, you can't stop fuckin' somebody, when you ain't fuckin' 'em in the first place!
Now, screwing' another man's wife, well, that's one thing, but lookin 'him in the eye and lyin' about it...
I ain't lying'.
I ain't even touched her.
Yeah, right.
Nice try.
Can't say the same about my brother, though, 'cause he had her every which way.
Told me she was sweet, too.
Shit.
Don't bet against you, huh?
Goddamn it, Marcus, call 'em off!
Who's the smart money on now?
Hey, Marcus, you gave me your word!
He mouthed off to me!
So the fuck what?
Look at him!
Oh, Jesus.
How'd the hell he do that?
That ain't Merlotte.
That's his brother.
Fuck.
Get him outta here.
Come on, Debbie.
I have to say, for a badass werewolf, you drive like a girl.
Sorry.
Today's media landscape is ratings-driven, and unfortunately, it's the Russell Edgingtons of the world who drive ratings.
But facts are facts, even if the fact is that facts are almost never heard.
So let's hear some, shall we?
Fact.
From July of last year...
Fact.
Human-on-vampire crime was also down almost 20%.
You have cornered me.
I surrender.
This is great!
...and I share your beliefs.
Jason.
Uh, where's the security?
Bill had an event at some hotel.
What are you doing here?
Um,
this box is for you.
It's all your stuff.
Hoyt said, he said he wanted you to have 'em, so.
That how he said it?
I might be parrot-phrasing a little.
Jessie, you all right?
Oh, I'm just fine.
If you ever need to talk...
Would you maybe wanna come in?
You know, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Okay.
Yeah.
So, I'm...
I'm, I'm gonna go.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh!
Thank you.
Do you want me to come in with you?
No.
No need to get into any more trouble on my account.
Go on, go home to Alcide.
And now I'd like to introduce to you one of the most generous benefactors the state of Louisiana has ever known,
Bon Temps entrepreneur and philanthropist, Mr. William Compton.
Can you even breathe?
'Cause I can't.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
What a wonderful night, for a wonderful cause.
But make no mistake, there is still much work to be done, for history teaches us that war can sound a louder call to action than can peace.
Right.
Yeah.
That a message of hate can seduce an impressionable mind far more readily than a message of love.
Which means we must remain vigilant...
Bill!
Sookie?
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
Bill!
They're comin' for you, Bill!
Run!

After the struggle of so many years I have come to the conclusion, that..
..if we still continue to beg for independence..
..then the day we wish to see may never come.
Our country, our people,
..our government, our law..
..this is our right!
And in order to get this, we will have to reply to our enemy in the language he understands.
Germany is Britain's enemy.
Britain is our enemy too.
And the enemy's enemy is our friend.
We'II defeat the British government right here..
..by supporting the German army on their home soil.
Are you ready to give me blood?
- Yes.
We are ready.
hall India!
- hall India!
I, Himmat Singh from Amritsar Punjab swear on the almighty.
GopaI Krishna Iyer, Travancore.
I, Hanuman, Punjab.
I, Hameed, Lahore.
Vivek SaniyaI.
I take this vow in the name of God....
I, BaIbir Singh, Punjab.
I swear on the almighty that I will keep..
..fighting against British army in collaboration with Germany..
..for India's freedom, till my last breath.
"We march forward for freedom."
"To destroy the enemies."
"We march forward for freedom."
"To destroy the enemies."
"We have to match step by step and march forward."
"We have to keep marching forward."
"We march forward for freedom."
"To destroy the enemies."

"To destroy the enemies."
"We have to match step by step and march forward."
"We have to keep marching forward."

'20th april, 1945.'
'The final stages of the second world war..'
'..which was going on for almost six years.'
'AImost all of the significant countries of the world..'
'..were involved in fighting each other..'
'..under the banners of the allied Forces and the Axis Forces.'
'The allied Forces made up of powerful countries..'
'..such as Russia, Britain, France and America..'
'..whilst on the other hand..'
'..
Germany, italy and Japan had the reins of the Axis Forces.'
'But amidst all this tumult..'
'..the one name that featured on the entire ..
..world map was the architect of world War II..'
'..and the biggest dictator in history till now..'
'..the chancellor of Germany, adolf hitler.'
'But our story isn't about the adolf hitler who was proud of his dictatorship..'
'..and wanted to exercise control over all of Europe.'
'In fact this is the story about the hitler..'
'..who hid in a bunker with his closest associates..'
'..enduring the Iast beating during the final days of the war.'
'And this was the time..'
'..when this dictator who aspired to rule all over Europe..'
'..with the strength of guns and cannons, was haunted by the image of a great saint..'
'..whose name was Mahatma Gandhi.'
call Dr. GoebbeIs.
What happened?
Why do you look upset?
I think Fuhrer's enemies are attacking notjust from outside..
..but from inside as well.
You mean traitors?
Such people have no sympathies from me.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine?
I have to go and meet Deh Fuhrer.
'21st april 1945..'
'..the Russian Red Army had virtually surrounded..'
'..the city of berlin.'
'To save their lives, the civilians had started moving out..'
'..
looking for safe havens.'
'The hapless German army gradually started surrendering itself to the Russians.'
God bless you, Amrita.
May God be with you!
How are you?
Fine Bapu.
Did you receive any letter from your husband BaIbir Singh?
No, Bapu.
It's been three months since I last heard from him.
I am certain it will come soon.
It is just that, I'm a little scared.
Be brave, dear.
Have faith in the almighty.
Amrita, listen up.
Listen up.
'Indian Legion soldiers..'
'..after Subhash Chandra Bose left Germany..'
'..these soldiers were forced to fight only for Germany.'
'These weary soldiers now have only one wish..'
'..which is to somehow cross the European border..'
'..and reach their motherland India.'
- Go.
Go.
Go.
Run.
Dr. GoebbeIs, you look afraid.
You did not get the letter?
Yes, last night.
I'm reading Shakespeare.
I may be in the foulest of moods..
..but reading Shakespeare always cheers me up.
Danger knows full well that Caesar is more dangerous than he.
We are two lions Iittered in one day.
And I, the elder and more terrible.
And Caesar shall go forth.
My Fuhrer, there is no power in this world that can defeat you.
Our victory is certain.
What was our intention of coming here?
What are we actually doing?
!
We are fighting a battle.
- Against whom?
Against whom?
Against our impending death!
Hey!
My name is Himmat.
Himmat (courage).
only on paper.
You must have the power too.
Go surrender to the British army if you are scared.
Go lick their boots!
Hey!
- Shakir.
If you guys shut up, then perhaps you will not feel the urge to fight each other.
And if you cannot do that, and shoot each other.
Murder one another!
And if you can't even do that, then go to jump off the nearest cliff.
Everything will be easy then.
The Russians are now and I am being informed about this now?
!
Were all officers snoring until now?
They are watching the drama unfold like cowards.
I never believed that my officers..
..would turn out to be so pathetic and weak..
..under the present circumstances.
It would have been better if I had just like stalin did.
At least Germany would not have had to bear the burden..
..of such wretched and puny officers!
My Fuhrer, this is done by those traitors..
we have received information on who they are.
They are leaking all our secrets to the enemy.
Find the traitors and shoot them!
Carry their bodies to the square so that the world knows what the consequences..
..of betraying Germany are.
The things that threaten me..
..never look, but on my deck..
when they shall see the face they are vanished!
KeiteI's report is here, My Fuhrer.
The Russian convoy has raped..
..one thousand five hundred of our helpless women.
They will pay for this.
Prepare every single woman for the protection of our country.
I want an eye for an eye!
An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
I pray to God to grant wisdom to those who agree with this ideology.
We have left the barbarity..
..of the past far behind.
Yet, a few disillusioned people always take..
..the decision to wage war, and the hapless citizenry of a nation..
..has to bear the consequences of it.
No side wins in a war.
Both the sides lose to a certain extent.
And there are other ways to conduct a fight.
My dear fellow Germans, it is Fuhrer's 56th birthday today.
I had just been there, and no arrangements for the party have been made yet.
And what about the band?
Where can we find a band in this war situation?
Dr. GoebbeIs said that he'II arrange for the band.
Oh wow!
That is fantastic.
Whatever you seen on the streets is a part of our strategy.
berlin is absolutely safe.
Don't go by the rumours, and what a few journalists..
..bought over by the enemy are saying.
The government machinery will naturally be affected during a war.
But these small obstacles cannot break our morale.
We have to face the enemy under all circumstance.
Our victory is certain.
Happy birthday.
Yes.
Okay, everyone.
It's alright.
Music.
My Fuhrer, it's been three months since..
..we have been in the bunker.
You can't stay here anymore, it is fraught with danger.
We have aircrafts at our disposal,
And enough fuel to get us to Japan.
I am not leaving berlin.
But your safety is necessary.
You'II be able to handle this war better from outside of berlin.
I am Germany's leader, not some coward.
I can't live covertIy in jungles, settlements and hills.
Dr. GoebbeIs, Speers, you two stay back, the rest of you can attend the party.
So the Russians are using our bridges and buildings to destroy us.
Here, all these bridges..
..blow them up.. and also, blow up these buildings.
But my Fuhrer,
We will have to do this.
I know you built this whole city with great effort.
But our enemies are using the same to destroy us.
Have you gone mad?
!
You are betraying the Fuhrer!
Eva, peace is the only solution.
If we surrender, our and the Fuhrer will be safe too.
Your words stink of betrayal.
Had my sister not been pregnant..
..I would have told Fuhrer the truth about you.
I am very much obliged, Eva.
The Fuhrer is purposely pushing us towards death!
Fuhrer will get a terrible shock, when he discovers that he trusted a coward like you!
But our death is certain here.
Just shut up, and leave me alone.
Dr. GoebbeIs.
Dr. GoebbeIs, please stop this destruction.
Did you think about the civilians even once?
Are you worried about the or your architecture?
If we continue to erode Germany, it will never progress in future.
Germany is not so weak, that a few war damages will hamper its growth.
Our enemies have attacked.
We have lost some wars, and won some wars.
What was our condition during the First world War?
We have seen great destruction.
But we have come back stronger, each time.
Why don't you want to face the truth?
The truth is:
I won't allow my country to be defeated.
I have just one request to make, please save this city from complete destruction.
It has taken thousands of years to develop..
..our civilisation, and it will only take few minutes to destroy all of it.
Some people are doing the same..
..by acting in an emotional, irrational manner.
I agree, the enemies have or they are trying to do just that.
But, this doesn't mean that we should deliberately destroy ourselves.
We should fight with the enemies..
..using 'Ahinsa' (non-vioIence) as the weapon.
'Dear Amrita, by now you may have received the news that the battle is in its last phase.'
'Even today, I distinctly remember the day I joined..
..the British army, and left India to fight against..
..adolf hitler and Germany.'
'I...
I didn't like it one bit.'
bless you, my brave son.
'Because we are enslaved we had no other option but to come and fight the war on their behalf.'
'But when Netaji Subhash summoned us..'
'..and we left the British Army and a new enthusiasm took birth inside each one of us.'
'A feeling to fight was aroused, to fight for India's freedom.'
'But destiny has cheated us.'
'Netaji had to leave, I don't know why.'
'And we were forced to join the German SS force.'
'And our dreams to attain freedom..
..for India were buried by the Germans.'
'But we took an oath that we will not accept defeat.
Never.'
'We have to fill a new enthusiasm in this accessible heart.'
'We have to repay the favour of our motherland.'
'The paths on which the martyrs we have to scatter under their feet in disguise of flowers today.'
'We had decided to return to India at any cost.'
'The paths which we tread upon are perilous.'
'After passing through jungles, and crossing many seas, one day I will meet you where I first laid my eyes upon this I promise you.'
Brother, what happened?
You were about to go somewhere, weren't you?
Let's go.
Do you know the meaning of the word 'wife'?
This is your family now.
Try to adopt the ways and values of this household.
You know, once a woman gets married..
..she goes through a rebirth.
She forgets all the memories of her previous birth.
childhood relationships, friends, relatives, aspirations, they now appear to her in flashes, nothing more than a pleasant dream.
Amrita..
..if you will walk on the principles of Mahatma Gandhi, you won't be able to fulfil any of your responsibilities completely.
Do you want me to shy away from my responsibilities?
'I hope that mother and father are not worrying too much about me please don't be upset when you think about me.'
'I will return.
We will all return.'
'Take care.
Yours, BaIbir.'
Some music, My Fuhrer?
No.
Sorry.
I was just...
I can't stand seeing you so upset.
alright..
..play some good music.
'Henrick HimmIer, minister for internal security..'
'..and external defense.'
'Considered one of the most powerful..
..and closest associates of adolf hitler.'
'During the final days of the war..'
'..this military commander tried to compromise..
..with the Western allied Forces..'
'..hoping to be the chancellor of Germany.'
I have decided..
..there is no other way out.
Very soon before the allied forces,
I am going to offer a proposal for compromise..
..to the allied forces very soon.
But...
There is no question of ifs and buts now, Herman.
What we are left with at the moment is the Fuhrer's stubbornness.
So I have decided, whatever is needed to be done now, I will have to do it,
I mean we have to do it.
By the way, Eva Braun is your sister-in-Iaw.
Get her to understand, if you can.
excellent news, My Fuhrer.
I am sorry.
I am sorry.
Never mind.
tell me.
We have received the intelligence report that the war..
..between the Russian and American armies has begun.
I know.
Extreme marxism and high capitalism can never unite with each other.
The world needs national socialism, and national socialism is my gift.
These are the signs of your victory, My Fuhrer.
I knew it is bound to happen.
You are very close to Eva.
You make her understand.
This place is not safe for us.
AII of us will be killed.
My Fuhrer, berlin is surrounded from all sides.
Let them come.
No one will return alive.
But My Fuhrer, we don't have enough arms and fuels.
You don't always fight with arms and fuels;
sometimes you fight with your mind.
tell Steiner, he will handle everyone.
My Fuhrer, Steiner has a shortage of soldiers.
Then force every citizen to enter the battlefield.
Every child, old man and teenager will fight for Germany.
But My Fuhrer, civilians don't even have anything to eat.
Excuses!
Excuses!
Excuses!
You have excuses for everything.
people of Germany haven't died yet.
This is my order.
Yes, My Fuhrer.
This is the worst war in the history of mankind.
Our people are fighting for a something..
..that is far removed from truth..
But the real dharma is the dharma of truth.
He who is honest to himself is great.
Doctor, there is still time.
Fuhrer can be taken out of there safely.
Your life is very dear to you, isn't it?
What do you mean?
Fuhrer has decided that we will stay here, and fight from here.
Everyone is not a coward like you.
Doctor..
..if Fuhrer is stubborn about it, Iet him be.
Why should we risk our lives?
Doctor, your wife and children have come.
No one is in their senses.
Everyone has gone crazy.
welcome to the bunker.
Now this place will become lively.
- Thank you.
Where are our rooms?
- Over there.
hello?
How are you?
The place is that way, and you are going to love it.
See how beautiful the room is.
How is it?
And how is that?
Dr. GoebbeI's wife and children are here?
!
Have you brought your toys?
Yes, I have brought my car.
Very good.
And you?
I have brought my books, because I Iove reading.
excellent!
You know what;
the Fuhrer loves books as well.
He reads one book everyday.
You all enjoy yourself..
..I will arrange for your snacks quickly.
Okay?
Dear, your earrings are really nice.
- Yes, yes.
Where did you buy them from, dear?
I bought them in a fair in Amritsar.
Are you keeping good health now?
- Yes, I am fine.
Come here.
What is your name?
- Veer Singh.
What is your father's name?
- BaIbir Singh.
What will you become when you grow up?
- soldier.
He is so sweet, isn't he?
'Veer Singh.
What is your father's name?
BaIbir Singh.'
'What will you become when you grow up?
soldier.'
Your son has taken after you.
He reminds me of our first HoIi (festival of colors) together.

"It brought different colors along with it."

'I hope you will be happy to know that..
..though I am following Gandhiji's principles,
I am still fulfilling all the responsibilities of the family.'
'And I now feel that the British government..
..has realised the strength of the Indian freedom struggle.'
'Without shedding a drop of blood we have proved that wars aren'tjust fought with guns and cannons alone.'
'We don't want to physically harm the enemies, instead, we want to hurt their conscience.'
'They will have to bow down in front of 'Satyagraha'.'
'They will leave India helpless and powerless.'
Stop them.
Come on, pick it up.
Come on.
Just take it.
Go.
little higher.
close.
My turn.
wonderful.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now Russians can't escape us.
Cigarette?
- Ya.
Did they only learn how to handle spoons and forks..
..in the military academy?
!
I have never been to any military academy.
I rose up from the rank of a small soldier..
..from the rank of a small messenger to this post!
I am trying to turn timid mice into lions.
Where are my talented officers?
Is everyone hiding out of fear?
My Fuhrer, Goering has sent a letter.
'My Fuhrer, things are getting out of control.'
'I think inside your bunker, you are either clueless about..
..what's going on in the outside world or, some people are creating misconceptions in your mind.'
'I have always been your loyal officer,
I request you grant me the authority..
..to compromise with the allied forces.'
'Germany's betterment lies in..
..handing over the command to me.'
'PIease understand that telephone and..
..other modes of communication have been severed.'
'So, if I don't receive any answer from you..
..by 10 o'cIock tonight, I will assume that
I have been given authorization.'
'Yours sincerely, Goering.'
That's so funny.
hello!
Aunty, she says that butterflies are green in colour.
And what did you say?
I said grasshoppers are green in colour, and butterflies are blue in colour.
But I have seen green butterflies in the garden!
well, butterflies are both green as well as blue in colour.
So both of you are right.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Bye.
Dr. GoebbeIs' children are so sweet.
You never talked to Fuhrer about it.
What could I have said?
That I want children as well.
How could I have told him that?
I am not his wife, I'm his mistress.
But you two have been together for 12 years.
So for him you are more than a wife.
When he first saw me, I was young, right out of school.
We instantly fell for each other.
After that, he never expressed his feelings.
About children, family, he never said anything.
Nothing.
And then...we never talked about these things.
But you could've asked!
- He never gave me a chance.
I am dismissing him from his post right now, this instant.
Germany is losing because of traitors like him.
We don't need outside enemies, when our own men are betraying us.
Go.
There must be other traitors like him, doctor.
Find them all.
hello, hello, please control Dr. GoebbeIs...
There is a message for the Fuhrer.
hello, hello!
shameless swines!
albert.
I had received a message that you are coming.
I came to say goodbye.
Magda, I can take you to a safer place.
We have boats.
- Boats?
May be you don't know, but my husband and I have decided to stay here.
I was thinking about the children, Magda.
The children will stay here, albert.
And what about their future?
They don't have a future without the Fuhrer.
That means they don't have a right to live?
You can leave if you want to.
I don't need your advice.
Okay.
albert.
- Eva.
I knew you would come.
Fuhrer thought you have left.
Fuhrer doubted my loyalty.
Fuhrer thought that you are against him.
But I was sure that you would come.
Thank you, Eva.
Thank you very much.
would you Iike something to eat?
Biscuits?
Anything else I can offer you?
Something to drink?
Champagne?
- Yes.
The very best of course.
- Thank you.
I know this room is slightly small, but it's exactly like I wanted.
- Thanks.
And have you noticed
I have brought along all the furniture that you designed.
Oh, really!
It's beautiful, thank you.
- Thank you.
Eva, I am leaving.
Oh yes.
Can I say something?
I am very happy here.
At least I am with him.
- Sure.
Fuhrer will feel good if you saw him before you left.
To the Fuhrer.
- To the Fuhrer!
And your beauty.
Okay, goodbye.
My Fuhrer!
albert.
Happy to see you.
During our last meeting I felt maybe it's our last time...
But I appreciate that you came here to me.
My Fuhrer, I came here to bid you goodbye.
I didn't carry out your orders.
I couldn't destroy berlin.
After all, how could I destroy my own creation?
please try to understand me.
You are betraying me at this fragile moment.
You will be punished for it.
Yes.
I know that.
Here is my resignation.
You felt bad.
Look, you are tired of working.
You need some rest.
Sit down.
You can dismiss me, I don't want special treatment.
I thought you are a smart..
..loyal and an optimistic person.
My Fuhrer.
You want to leave?
Yes.
I...
I will have to go.
You too, Speer?
- Yes.
Look after yourself, My Fuhrer.
Goodbye.
My Fuhrer, this is the new model of berlin City.
It's been designed just like the way you envisioned it to be.
really, it's very beautiful.
Just like I wanted.
Do you know, Speer, why you are my best architect?
My Fuhrer...
You always turn my imagination into reality.'
Thank you, My Fuhrer.
This is the central hall.
Its pillars are 50 feet tall.
- This one?
Yes.
And this is the dome.
It starts at 100 feet and will extend up to 240 feet.
Unique and stylish.
- really.
Our city will be very beautiful.
More spectacular than Paris.
Just like I wanted!
But My Fuhrer, this construction will be expensive.
Don't worry about that.
Just start the work.
Great, My Fuhrer.
'It seems like you are not receiving my letters.'
'I feel completely lost without you.'
'I am lonely.'
'Strange thoughts pollute my mind.'
'It would be so nice if you could come back to India..
..before something terrible happens.'
'Everything is fine back home.'
'We had a good harvest this year.'
'And yes, I am trying to get Mr. Rehmat..
..to fix the back wall of the house before the monsoon.'
'It completely collapsed last year during the rains.'
'Your son doesn't eat anything..
..without clarified butter and milk.'
'Mother and father are absolutely fine.'
'They have grown slightly weak.'
'Dear, can't you come back soon?
'
'I can't force you, after all, you are my husband.'
'I don't know what to write next.'
'I pray to the lord for your safety.'
'Yours, Amrita.'
'Yours, Sarita.'
If this would have been some Zeenat, Tarannum or KhaIida..
..then you wouldn't have abandoned her like this.
Brother Himmat, it's best that you..
..keep your nonsense to yourself.
Nonsense!
It might be nonsense for you, but it is the truth.
Look, brother Himmat, I won't tolerate it again.
What can you do?
What can you do?
Are you threatening me?
Enough!
Enough.
What is going on?
What is going on?
With great hopes, with great expectations,
I had joined the Azad Hind Fauj.
I thought I will liberate India.
And when I will return to my country, my people will be proud of me.
They will be proud of us.
An able leader like Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose will meet our people.
This, that and what not.
But all my hopes were shattered.
And what did we get?
What?
This dangerous jungle, this trodden path.
Hunger, sickness, anguish!
I was born with such iII-Iuck.
Am I not filled with rage?
I am filled with rage as well.
But this doesn't mean that..
..you point your gun at your own brother!
Stop!
Hey!
Stop!
- help.
Stop!
- help.
help!
- Take her away.
- help.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Himmat.
In the front.
Here, Shakir.
Is anyone in there?
- There is no one here, brother.
That way.
pal, they were supposed to be very rich.
But why were they so stingy in regards to food?
This is not India.
I really feel like eating some fish and rice.
It's been ages.
But we can't help it.
We are so far away.
Not even the aroma of our food reaches here.
Brother, only if I couId my hands..
..on some corn fIatbread and mustard curry!
I swear, you can make me do anything you want.
Brother BaIbir, you heard that?
You can make him do whatever you want to.
And as far as your wish of corn fIatbread..
..and mustard curry is concerned, I will fulfill that, Hanuman.
help.
help.
help.
Hanuman.
Shakir.
Brother BaIbir, Vivek?
Brother BaIbir, it's...well...
What happened?
Himmat is nowhere to be seen.
Go to sleep, folks.
He must be sitting here somewhere among the rocks, with a pot in his hand.
This is not the time to joke.
Look over there.
That way.
Himmat!
Himmat!
Himmat!
Himmat!
Himmat!
What happened?
- French soldiers killed him.
And with me...
Himmat.
'Dear Amrita,'
'Today I feel like I am completely shattered.'
'Now I am just fighting with myself.'
'This is really tough.'
'It is notjust me.
The rest of my friends too are going through the same circumstances.'
'I am the eldest of them all.'
'That is why it tougher for me to deal with these circumstances.'
'I just hope to reach India.'
'My belief is completely shaken.'
'On one hand I see your face, our child.'
'And on the other hand I see my five friends.'
'I shouIdn't be calling them friends, but brothers.'
'I just don't understand what I should write further.'
'Just pray to God.'
'Yours, BaIbir.'
Brother BaIbir.
Brother BaIbir.
How did this happen?
Brother BaIbir.
"Those who are gone don't know.."
"When they will return after achieving victory.."
"..they won't find anything."
"When they will return after achieving victory.."
"..they won't find anything."
"There will be empty lanes."
My Fuhrer, the Russians are at a distance of 500 meters from us.
We don't have the ammunition or the manpower to fight them.
We will fight back.
talk to HimmIer.
- Yes, My Fuhrer.
Check on Steiner.
What situation is he in?
Inform Wencke.
We will fight back.
"There will be empty lanes."
"There will be broken homes."
"There will be terrified children."
"There will be grieving mothers."
Sorry to disturb you, My Fuhrer.
But this is an urgent news.
HimmIer, my most trusted man.
He is making a deal in collaboration with the enemy.
He wants to become the Fuhrer!
Go.
Bury him alive, wherever he is.
Go!
HimmIer has gone missing, My Fuhrer.
Hermann.
Hermann FegeIein must know.
Go.
He too hasn't been in the bunker for the past few days.
He too is not there.
What do you mean?
He is also missing.
Go.
Go, shoot him down.
Go find him.
Go.
He is a traitor.
And I also know that your sister is pregnant.
please spare Hermann.
What will happen to my sister?
I have no mercy for traitors.
please, My Fuhrer.
This is my order.
How dare you?
!
careful.
careful.
Hanuman, you guys move on.
I'II be right back.
- Where to, brother?
I too want to take a leak.
No.
No.
Move on with them.
But brother, I too need to take a leak urgently.
Hanuman, who is older between us?
You, brother.
You.
Then..
- Okay, brother.
Hanuman?
Hanuman?
Hanuman?
Hanuman?
Hanuman?
Speak up.
GopaI,..
please leave me alone for some time.
No.
Babu...
Why isn't Steiner attacking?
Why isn't he attacking?
I want the information.
My Fuhrer, the Russian army is very large in number.
Large in number?
!
Those who fear defeat are afraid of an army which is large in number.
The person who has a fervour for victory within him, he alone is equal to millions.
Go and tell this to Steiner.
Steiner has refused to attack.
Because he is only left with a few starving civilians.
He has refused?
!
My orders have not been carried out.
Now my orders...
I am called Fuhrer, but no one shows me respect, obeys me!
My orders were defied!
I was deceived!
You all have cheated me.
AII of you!
My army, my officers, everyone has cheated me.
You all are worthless, useless, good-for-nothing fellows!
You didn't take any action and now those
Russians have reached berlin.
Our last man is fighting till his last breath.
A lie!
A big lie!
Your man will fight till his last breath?
!
You all are worthless, useless, and cowardly!
My Fuhrer, you can't call my soldiers cowards.
Of course!
Of course I will!
You are all impotent.
Good-for-nothing!
The worst army of the world!
- My Fuhrer!
Don't call me Fuhrer!
Don't call me that.
You may all go wherever you Iike.
Anyone may do whatever they like.
If you all are thinking that I will run away from berlin, then it is your misunderstanding.
I will die.
I will commit suicide,..
..but I will never leave berlin!
Two...two at a time will go that side.
Shakir!
Hey!
You all run from here!
Run!
Go!
Go!
Cowards die many times before their death.
The valor never cares of death.
But once, of all the wonders, that I get hurt..
It seems to me..
..most strange that men should fear.. seeing their death..
..a necessary end, will come when it will come.
Okay, kids, it's time to go to bed.
Take them to their room.
I heard about Steiner.
I want to remind my husband about our decision.
My Fuhrer, Magda and I have decided to stay with you along with..
..our children till the Iast moment.
Thank you, doctor.
Papa.
Oh yeah!
I wanted to go out, but soldier uncle didn't allow me to do so.
There is big danger outside, son.
There is big danger.
I am not scared.
You too go out.
My brave son, if it was in my hands,
I would have played with you here the entire day.
Why can't you be with us?
I have a Iot of work.
Come on, go to sleep now.
I am not feeling sleepy.
I will make you go to sleep.
Come on, sleep now.
Come on, go to sleep.
At least you love the kids.
I Iove you too very much, Magda.
You must've loved once..
..but now you don't get much time away from actresses..
..and others' wives.
If you hadn't tried to cage me I would've tried to escape.
Love can't tied down, Magda.
Say you can't be tied down.
You are getting me wrong again.
And for this very reason your first marriage broke off.
Thanks for reminding me that, Joseph.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's not your mistake.
Anyway, I am happy that we are all together at the Iast moment.
Goodnight, Joseph.
Goodnight.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Eva..
Everyone has deceived me.
I am there with you, My Fuhrer.
Do you know..
..why I didn't marry you?
No.
Because my first love was my country.
Germany.
I didn't want to give you her place.
I don't have any complaints from you, My Fuhrer.
I can understand.
Eva, will you marry me?
'Dear friend, That I address you as a friend is no formality.'
'I own no foes.'
'We have no doubt about your bravery, or devotion to your fatherland.'
'Nor do we believe that you are the monster, described by your opponents.'
'But your own writings and pronouncements
leave no room for doubt that many of your acts are monstrous, and unbecoming of human dignity.'
'Your humiliation of CzechosIovakia, the rape of poland, and the swallowing of Denmark are acts degrading humanity.'
'Our resistance to it does not mean harm to the British people.'
'We seek to convert them, not to defeat them on the battlefield.'
'The rulers may have our land and bodies,..
..but not our souls.'
'If not the British, some other power will certainly improve upon your method, and beat you with your own weapon.'
'You are leaving no legacy to your people of which they will feel proud.'
'Your sincere friend, M.K. Gandhi.'
'I..
..had joined this army as a soldier during the First world War.'
'It's been more than 30 years since then.'
'AII my actions, all the decisions which were taken..
..were done keeping the well being of my countrymen in mind.'
'The people of Germany have given me the strength..
..to live, serve and fight for them.'
Do you accept Miss.
Eva Brown as your wife?
Of course!
'I never wanted this war to take place.'
'This war has been forced upon us.'
'I know..
..that after my death, historians will paint me as..
..a predator in the pages of history.'
Now I pronounce you husband and wife.
'It is my thinking..
..that European countries are being traded like stocks, and the Jews are responsible for it.'
'I had already said that if this war takes place, millions of men, women and children of Europe will be killed, and the criminals will go unpunished.'
'Germany will be divided into two parts, so that it can never raise its head again.'
You hold my glass.
Oh,
'I want to thank all those people..
- God, I am so happy.
Hey!
- ..who have supported me...'
Cheers, everyone.
Everybody!
'After my death, I appoint Dr. GoebbeIs as the chancellor of Third Reich.'
'Instead of bowing my head, I would Iike to be beheaded, for the sake of my country.'
Of course, how can I forget?
There's a secret passage to get out of here.
please leave as soon as possible.
Dinner was good.
We don't have much time.
We have been surrounded from all sides.
I don't want to surrender myself to the enemies, and make a mockery of myself.
I can run.
But I won't run.
If I run I will stay alive physically, but what about my soul?
Your decision is my decision, My Fuhrer.
Just one request.
When your soldiers..
..carry my body out,
I don't want to look ugly.
I just got married just a few hours ago.
And blood stains on my face...
I am sorry, but...
Gunsche.
- My Fuhrer.
After I die...
burn our dead bodies.
I won't be able to do that.
I don't want my enemies to lay their hands even on our dead bodies.
But, My Fuhrer...
- That's my order.
Yes.
My Fuhrer.
This fur coat is for you.
Fuhrer personally gave it to me.
It will suit you well.
I can't leave you people in such a condition.
Dr. GoebbeIs and his wife and children are also there.
I am not an outsider that I would..
- Shut up!
Go, enjoy your life.
And be happy.
Just go.
You are Germany's bravest mother.
- My Fuhrer.
You have made this the most beautiful moment of my Iife.
"..then what are we crying for?"
"Lost the kingdom.
Lost the throne."
"We lost 'yesterday'.
We lost even 'today'."
"A dream has shattered."
"A sense of power has crashed."

"This is the rule of the nature."

Not now.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
Wait, wait.
I-I have to go.
- What?
- I just--I gotta go.
Uhh!
Where are you going, huh?
- I'm sorry.
- Uhh!
I'll be right back, okay?
Don't move.
Why are you dressed?
- You ordered pizza?
- Yeah.
Why are you dressed?
When did you have time to order pizza?
I preordered it.
I thought we'd be hungry afterwards.
Brody, let's just keep it simple, okay?
Let's not make it any more complicated than that.
It's pizza.
It's no metaphor for anything deeper.
What?
Nothing.
I--
I know the word "similitude" also, okay?
Don't underestimate me, Kowalski.
Okay, come on, quit stalling.
- One minute.
- You've had 15.
What the hell is that?
That is a triple word score.
I don't think so, Kowalski.
Unless that's Polish for crazy,
I'm guessing that's not a word.
Fine.
Let's consult the ref.
Hey, my great-grandfather's in this book.
I know, I know.
Richie keeps bragging like he supposedly went toe-to-toe with Al Capone.
Your family is blue-blooded royalty.
Here he is.
Ronald Kowalski.
35 years on the job.
My grandpa Willie was the same tough old bastard.
He died two years ago.
I miss him.
I gotta watch myself around you Kowalskis.
Guess you do.
What?
Nothing.
How long have you and Carlos been married?
Seven years.
Why?
Wow.
Four kids in seven years.
Two of 'em are only a minute apart.
Still.
You got a thing about kids?
No.
No way.
I love kids.
I just don't have any room for them in my life right now.
I barely have room for a guy.
Well, liking a guy doesn't mean it's gonna lead to kids.
It's not like the flu.
I know.
It's just, wow.
Almost or soon-to-be four kids.
It's--
- What can I say?
My Carlos is very passionate and I'm fertile.
Flores, Kowalski.
My office, now.
Got an anonymous call this morning.
Female body found in an alley at Madison near Kilbourne.
Caller said the woman was killed by a cop.
- Any proof?
- Just her word.
You think she's telling the truth?
It's our job to assume they are and investigate-- anonymous or otherwise.
- What are you not telling us?
- Who really did it.
That's your job.
Start there.
That's it?
No other explanation?
I need to repeat myself?
Oh, I thought you said the victim was found in an alley.
- She was.
- Then what's here?
The last place she was seen alive.
The Furry Corral?
Seriously?
I stand out like a sore thumb.
Oh, no.
You look great.
You barely notice.
Did Papadol seem out of sorts this morning?
He gets mean when he lies.
What's he lying about?
The real reason we're here.
- Is that--?
- Lieutenant Bob Barcelli.
He used to be one of the best on the force.
Got turned out somehow heading up narcotics.
Now he's into all kind of bad.
Isn't he, like, top on IA's complaint list?
Coerced confessions?
Excessive force, harassment.
Barcelli's big on abusing his power as a cop.
It's been Papadol's mission to kick him off the force.
But nothing's ever stuck, right?
Maybe Papadol thinks we've got something that finally will.
- Where are you going?
- To talk to Barcelli.
It looks like he comes here a lot.
Maybe he saw something, heard something.
Police.
Take a walk.
IA?
How's Lieutenant Papadol?
He sends his regards.
Mind if we ask you a few questions about a dancer that worked here?
Michelle Kane?
Goes by the name "Candy" Kane?
Beautiful girl.
Died way too young.
We're hoping you can help us figure out why that happened.
Don't know I could be much help to you, but anything for IA.
Girls, IA has got some questions about Candy.
Oblige 'em.
Nikki, give Goldilocks a taste.
Oh, no, that's really not necessary.
Okay, gentlemen, welcome Sherry to the stage.
You know, you really don't have to do this.
Uh-huh.
So you're looking to find who snuffed out Candy?
Yeah.
Any ideas?
Um...
Okay, can you--?
Wow, you're really flexible.
Thanks.
Yoga four times a week.
So, can you tell me anything about Candy?
Candy was always looking to come into some money.
The reason she first came to Chicago was to be part of Second City.
Bitch was hilarious.
Guess she got sidelined, huh?
A lot of girls do.
So, uh, how long was she working here?
Uh, six months.
Was Candy working last night?
Got off early.
Said she had some date and didn't seem to excited about it.
Was Barcelli here last night?
Till closing.
Where'd you go afterwards?
Since my divorce, my one-bedroom apartment.
Were you alone?
I don't kiss and tell.
Characterize your relationship with Candy Kane.
There was no relationship.
She was a piece of ass I liked to see wiggle.
That's it?
She also made all my wet dreams come true.
Got it.
Good.
Wanted to be crystal clear.
Didn't want you thinking there was something more.
Just figured a cop of your rank and stature may have seen something that could help us.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.
So you were with Barcelli all night?
All night.
Till about 6:00 this morning.
Let's go.
We've overstayed our welcome.
Oh.
If you remember anything.
Absolutely, Mrs. Camalari.
Thursday morning.
What's wrong?
Oh, I just took an order I can't possibly fill.
Well, call her back and tell her you can't do it.
She'll never order from me again.
And I've got so many orders coming in now.
I-I-I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up.
I think it's time you open your bake shop.
You've been talking about it for years.
We can't afford that.
We'll make it work.
We always do.
Hey, Mom.
Oh, hey, what are you doing here?
Hey, Mrs. K.
I stopped by to get dad since his car is in the shop.
Your mom is finally gonna open her bake shop.
- Oh, that's great.
- No, no, no, no.
I'm just thinking about it.
Stop thinking and do it.
That's what I told her.
What do you think?
I think you'll know when you're ready, Mrs. K.
John, you're gonna make some nice girl a very good husband someday.
All right, pops.
You ready?
I was born ready.
Just gotta find my keys.
Give Abby a call.
Let her talk you into it.
Bye, honey.
Candy's autopsy report just came in.
The Furry Corral give you any indication why our victim might have a, uh, key inside her stomach?
No.
But why didn't you tell us one of the strippers is undercover IA?
I have a couple of cops working deep undercover, investigating Barcelli.
Nikki happens to be one of them.
What tipped you?
She was eager to come over to us, the other girls were pissed they weren't making money, and she had no problem giving us info.
I'll tell her to work on that.
We're on the same team.
Why keep us in the dark?
My concern is keeping Nikki alive and this investigation secure.
She's gotten closer to Barcelli than most.
That's an understatement.
Nikki took a big chance calling you.
That is why this is all very sensitive.
Nikki would not have jeopardized her cover if she didn't feel strongly that a cop killed Candy.
She is the best we've got.
Nikki was with Barcelli all night long.
No way he killed her.
Doesn't mean he didn't have her killed.
Do your due diligence.
Okay, Candy had sex before she was murdered, but there is no trauma suggesting rape.
What was the cause of death?
Uh, M.E.'s report says suffocation through strangulation.
Is that glass in her hair?
Beveled stained glass and some old-growth wood.
It suggests she was murdered in a much nicer neighborhood than where she was dumped.
Crime lab's doing forensics.
Superficial scratches on her back.
Okay, we find where this key goes to, maybe we find a broken window.
"BB."
Can't be that easy.
That tattoo behind her right ear, it looks like an over-embellished cross.
Candy was one of Bishop's girls.
Who's Bishop?
A pimp who worked a stretch on Rich Street.
So, she was a working girl before she graduated to stripping?
It could be where she originally met Barcelli.
There's a saying on the street.
You're more likely to sleep with a cop than actually be arrested by one.
You can totally do this, Mom.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, and I think I know exactly the person to help you as well.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Hey, baby.
- Damn, you look good.
- Okay, beat it.
Excuse me?
Come here.
Come--come here.
Hey.
Damn it.
- Abby, wait.
- It's all right.
I ain't gonna hurt her.
I said, beat it.
Don't move or I'll break it.
Hope not.
It's his turn to make dinner tonight.
- What?
- Carlos, my new partner Abby.
Abby, my husband.
Oh.
Oh, no!
I'm so sorry!
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah.
- Can I have my arm back now?
- Oh, sure.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were--
Some strung-out brotha?
Spent ten years on vice perfecting this look.
Let that be a lesson to you.
There is no future on the streets.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.
Carlos works this neighborhood.
Figured he know something more about Bishop.
What'd you find out?
Candy was one of Bishop's top moneymakers.
He was pretty pissed when she stepped out on him.
Pissed enough to kill her?
Enough to threaten that if he ever laid eyes on her again, he was gonna slash her pretty little face.
I see you around here again, I'm gonna haul your ass in.
Hey, calm down, bitch.
I'm leaving.
Hey, Bishop.
Flores, Kowalski.
Need to ask you about one of your girls.
She goes by the name of Candy Kane.
I ain't seen that girl since she walked on me, like, six months ago.
Why?
She was found dead this morning just a mile from here.
- What do you know about it?
- Not a damn thing.
I was throwing a private party last night, breaking in some new talent.
She's working up the block right now.
You can ask her yourself.
You know any other reason why Candy would be down here?
- You ask her cop boyfriend?
- Barcelli?
Barcelli?
Who said anything about Barcelli?
Well, that's the cop she was screwing, right?
Hell if I know.
Juan Martinez.
Seems were not the only ones working on this case.
Flores, Kowalski, IA.
Hanning, Martinez, homicide.
What's IA want with our pimp?
- And this is where I get off.
- No, no, no.
- Oh, man.
- Stand over there.
You working the Candy Kane case?
Yeah.
Got a witness that can put Bishop with Candy yesterday.
Bishop claims he hasn't seen Candy since she moved on off to the Furry Corral.
Well, that's not the first time a pimp's lied now, is it?
You guys still haven't answered the question.
Why is IA sniffing around this case?
Uh-uh.
You know how this works.
You share with us, not the other way around.
If we have any further questions, we'll give you a call.
Wow, that's gotta piss 'em off.
It always does.
- Mackie?
- Hey, Mrs. Kowalski.
So I figured we'd jump right in.
Abby said you're swamped, so time is of the essence to get the ball rolling on this lifelong dream of yours.
♪ Baby, and every word that I say is true ♪
♪ you got me runnin' and hiding' ♪
♪ all over town ♪
♪ you got me sneakin' and a-peepin' ♪
♪ and runnin' you down ♪
♪ this can't go on ♪
- Brody!
Hi.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
I came to ask you out on a date.
- A date?
- Yeah, you know.
Fancy linens and silverware.
Or karaoke and sawdusted floors.
- Whatever you prefer.
- Uh...
Okay, what brought this on?
Nothing.
I thought it'd be fun.
Hey, if you don't want your brother to see us, we'll take the EL down to Barrington.
Oh, no, I don't do the EL.
The whole underground thing--
I mean, it's, uh, claustrophobic.
- Yeah, big time.
- So I'll rent a car.
Did you have a good time last night?
Not that part.
The afterwards part.
When you tried to cheat.
I did not cheat.
Just answer the question.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to take you out on a date.
It's been six months.
You owe me a date.
Tomorrow night, 8 p.m.
And, uh, wear your hair down.
Homicide has a witness who claims she saw Bishop in a heated discussion with Candy Kane yesterday, approximately 4:25 p.m. near Rich and State.
It was right before her shift at the Furry Corral.
We tried contacting the witness, but so far, nothing.
Homicide hasn't exactly been forthcoming with their information.
How did Bishop react when you brought up Barcelli?
He pretended like he had no idea who we were talking about.
- You believe him?
- A cop with Barcelli's rep?
Every criminal in this city knows who he is or at least crap their pants upon hearing his name.
Uh, the report came back that the glass and the wood found in the victim's hair was from the early 1900s.
Abby's calling someone who can help narrow it down for us.
It seems there are only a couple places qualified to replace windows in historic buildings.
That's our window.
Looks like your contact at the Historic Initiative was right.
Yeah, the guy at the installation place said someone called just this morning about coming out.
I'm calling in a warrant.
We need to get inside.
Oh, excuse me, sir?
Detectives Flores and Kowalski.
- You live here?
- Why?
Sir, please answer my partner.
- Is this your home?
- Why?
Slowly.
Relax.
Sergeant Brian Dudek.
Are you here investigating Candy Kane's murder?
What?
No.
Let me see your keys.
You need to open this door, Sergeant.
All right.
Heads up, fellas.
IA's in the house.
We just need to ask a few questions.
If everyone will place their firearms on the table before we get started.
Now.
Dad?
Dad, what are you doing here?
- It's not your business.
- Uh, it is my business.
I'm here investigating the murder of a woman who possibly died here last night.
Oh, really?
When did you transfer to homicide?
I didn't.
It's complicated.
I'll explain later.
I've heard about this place.
Is this the cop house everyone talks about, with the wild, late night parties, the strippers, the mistresses?
Do you have a mistress?
- No.
We play poker.
- And?
And it's like a fraternity.
We call ourselves the Blind Bowlers.
- This place used to--
- The Blind Bowlers?
Seriously?
You want to hear this?
Sorry.
Back in the '20s, three cops busted the mobster Dutch Schwartz and took over his speakeasy-- this place.
In those days, lower-class speakeasies were called the Blind Pigs.
The cops decided to call themselves the Blind Bowlers.
If their wives asked, they were bowling, but they'd come here.
You're either invited in or the key is passed down generational.
It's a tradition that's stuck.
Does mom know about this place?
Of course she knows.
We don't have any secrets.
How many members?
20.
We've always kept it small.
Have better control of the place.
Is Bob Barcelli one of the members?
No.
Why?
You think he had something to do with the death of this girl?
I don't know.
You watch your back with him, Abby.
He is not a man to be messed with.
Were you here last night?
Are you asking me as my daughter or an IA Detective?
Both.
It's a simple question, Dad.
Then I have to ask you to come down to IA to answer some more questions.
Then I guess you'd better inform your mother that I'm going to be late for dinner.
Hey, what the--?
Get dressed.
You gotta be kidding me.
What happened in this room, Candy?
Ah, I thought we were sharing information.
We are.
You share what you have with us.
What did you find out?
The key found in Candy's stomach is to this house.
We found evidence it could be the original crime scene.
Yeah, well, this is a house full of cops now, isn't it?
Then one of these cops is a possible suspect in Candy's murder.
Mind if we take a look?
That okay with you?
- Abby.
- What are you doing here?
We got a call to escort some cops down to IA.
Dad?
Am I riding with you, Rich?
Are you arresting dad?
No.
We just have to ask him a few more questions.
Are you out of your mind?
Can you just take him down to IA, please?
- Really, Abby?
Your dad?
- I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
I know how close you are to your family.
Look, he'll get over it.
Kowalskis can't stand not talking to one another.
Who else is gonna listen to them?
What was that?
It was nothing.
It was just- there was a piece of hair in her face.
You let him touch you?
You told me you thought he was disgusting.
- You said that?
- No, I-- okay, I kinda did, but--
- Thanks.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Hey, hey, come on.
Richie, calm down.
You want me to calm down when you're sleeping with my sister behind my back?
- Keep your voice down!
- Can we talk about this?
Yeah, after I kick your ass.
Don't be ridiculous.
You're not kicking anyone's ass.
- I'm not fighting you.
- Richie, damn it!
Stop it!
Damn it!
Richie, get off him!
You don't know what he's been saying about you!
Not one word was about her!
- Bullshit!
- That's enough!
Richard, in the car.
You too, Brody.
Does your mother know about this?
Okay, open your eyes.
Oh!
Mackie, that's wonderful!
Now, we can play around with the colors, switch things around.
Oh, no, no, no.
That's beautiful.
Oh, my gosh!
Hey.
Oh!
Oh, wow, that looks great!
I know, right?
And--and--and I have, um,
I have a business plan and everything was Mackie's idea.
Oh!
- Are you all right?
- What?
You ran in here like your hair was on fire.
Uh, well, first of all, you need to know everyone's okay.
Okay, now you're scaring me.
No, no, no, it's not scary.
I just had to take dad down to IA to ask him some questions, so he might be a little late.
You had to arrest your father?
No, no.
It's a long story.
There was a murder.
You think your father killed someone?
No, mom, no.
A woman died at the house where dad plays poker.
- The Blind Bowlers?
- So you do know about that.
Well, of course I do.
Why wouldn't I?
No reason.
Abby, you have to know, your father would not be involved in anything shameful.
Yes, I do.
So there's no way Lieutenant Bob Barcelli would be in possession of a key?
No.
To your knowledge, has Barcelli ever been inside the house?
Why are you asking me about Lieutenant Barcelli?
Is it because of his connection to my father?
Just because he was a rookie under my father 100 years ago doesn't mean that I am or ever have been friends with him, so I suggest you move on to another question.
Were you at the house last night, Sergeant Kowalski?
- No.
- Do you know who was?
- No.
We don't have a sign-in sheet.
Can you give us the names of everyone who is a member of the house?
Is that why I'm here?
Because I'm the father of one of your detectives,
I should provide you with all the information you need so you don't have to work for it?
Send Detective Kowalski in, please.
We just have a few more--
Unless you're gonna suspend me or compel me to answer your questions,
I would like to speak with my daughter.
I don't pretend to understand why you took this job, but what I will not do is be used in any way, shape, or form because you're my daughter.
That's not what they were doing.
You may not think so, but yes, that's exactly what they were doing.
So, what do you want to know?
Have you ever seen this woman before at the house?
She works as a stripper at the Furry Corral.
- No.
Did she have a record?
- Yes.
Once for solicitation.
We have two rules.
No hookers and no one with a record allowed in.
Well, someone obviously broke that rule.
This woman was found strangled to death early this morning and someone in that house was involved.
I don't believe it.
I'm telling you, there's a murderer among you.
You may not want to believe it, but we have strong evidence that says otherwise.
I'm gonna need the name of every cop with a key to that house.
I'm also gonna need yours.
So, we have a list of all the cops who have keys to the house.
Mind telling us why you didn't mention you were part of the Blind Bowlers?
Never came up.
In case you haven't noticed,
I've been investigating a homicide.
- So have we.
- No, no, no.
You guys are on a witch hunt for a cop.
A cop who may have killed Candy.
Listen, while you guys were out harassing Chicago's finest,
I was out there, solving a case.
Meaning?
Meaning we've already got a suspect in custody.
A suspect?
Who?
- Charles Murray, aka Bishop.
- Candy's ex-pimp?
Just signed a confession 20 minutes ago, so as you can see, I was, uh, kind of busy to come down to your little cop tea party.
So Bishop killed Candy in a houseful of cops?
Yeah, said it was an ef you to the cops for taking away what was his.
And if you don't believe me, you can check the tapes.
Oh, yeah, you can talk to him yourself if you want.
He's down in holding right now.
I almost forgot.
We're gonna need your key.
- What key?
- Your key to the house.
What's my key got to do with anything?
I just told you, we got a confession out of Bishop.
We've collected all 19.
There's one missing.
Yours.
Now, are we done?
Hey, can we talk?
No.
Then can you listen?
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to talk about it.
I won't even allow myself to even think about the thousands of times you've bragged about some chick.
It conjures up images of my sister.
I just want to bash your head in.
Not once was I talking about Abby.
The blond with big boobs who blew you to paradise?
That wasn't your sister.
So you were with all these other women while you were screwing my sister?
No, it's not like that.
I really like Abby.
Please.
You like her so much you're hooking up with other women behind her back?
It was your sister that didn't want any ties, okay?
I was just trying to respect it.
Respect?
That's ridiculous.
How about showing your partner some respect, huh?
- How long were you two--?
- Oh, seriously?
- How long?
- Six months.
I think you're making way too big of a deal out of this.
You should have told me.
It wasn't my secret to tell.
Yes it was, damn it!
You were my partner!
Were?
I put in a request for a new partner.
- Thanks for helping my mom out.
- Oh, my pleasure.
You're so lucky to have a mom like her.
I know.
She's pretty amazing.
Hmm!
That's an understatement.
Do you have any idea how great it is to be able to tell your mom anything and not have her judge you for it?
I didn't tell her about Brody.
- Why didn't you tell her?
- I don't know.
I do.
You don't want her to know that you're not this hopeless romantic you pretend to be because you're actually a horny-ass nymph.
- Are you still drunk?
- What?
The two empty wine bottles pretty much gave you away.
Seriously, what were you thinking, getting my mom drunk in the middle of the day?
Okay, first of all, it takes a little more than a few glasses of white wine to get me drunk.
And secondly, it was your mom who was doing all the pouring.
Mackie.
I promise it will never happen again.
Thank you.
Richie, it's me again.
Can you please call me back?
We need to talk.
- Is your brother still pissed?
- Yes.
So you're not allowed to date someone your brother knows?
Yeah, of course.
It's more complicated.
Okay, I was embarrassed.
Why?
He's cute.
It was just sex.
So you're a ho?
No.
Abby, lighten up.
It's okay to just want sex.
I know.
I just don't want a relationship right now.
I don't have the time for it.
I don't know how you do it.
I have a damn good man that has my back.
- That's not what I meant.
- Look, you make choices.
I could stay home, but that wouldn't benefit my husband or my kids.
I'm just not made that way.
Criminalist report came back from the cop house.
Fibers from Candy's clothing were found inside that room.
So do we still think Bishop had something to do with her murder?
And what happened after that?
She broke away from me and she ran towards the window.
She pulled away and fell into the window.
I tried pulling her back in, but--
Bishop, did you kill Michelle Kane?
Yeah.
Ye--yes.
Yeah, I did.
Do we believe him?
Why would Bishop take Candy to a cop house?
How did he even get in?
And what does he keep looking at?
You mean, who?
Hanning's partner, Martinez?
Bishop looked scared to death.
You saw Martinez.
Would those boyish looks scare you?
Who else would be in the room?
Someone who has a vested interest in making sure Bishop keeps his mouth shut.
Barcelli?
Barcelli has an ironclad alibi.
What would he have to gain by coercing a confession out of Bishop?
That's what you need to find out.
Yeah.
None of this makes sense.
Hold on.
No need to talk to Bishop.
- Why?
- He's dead.
They just found him hanging in his cell.
So, Martinez was not in the room when Bishop confessed.
He was at his desk finishing up paperwork from his last case.
And listen to this.
Hanning and Martinez caught Candy's case three days into their last one.
Usually takes detectives two weeks to catch a new case.
Hanning obviously leapfrogged over a few detectives to make sure he was first again in the rotation.
Just got off with Carlos.
Bishop was telling the truth.
The night of Candy's murder, he was holed up all night with a new girl he deemed Tootsie Pop.
Hanning's file?
Back in 2008, he was cited for drunken misconduct at a bar.
In 2010, cops came out twice to his house on a domestic abuse charge.
Sounds like our cop has anger issues.
Find out if Hanning's covering his tracks or someone else's.
This makes no sense.
All 20 keys are here, including Hanning's.
How long has Hanning been a member of the Blind Bowlers?
Five years.
Does this keep look like it has five years' mileage on it?
Need more than a brand-new key to arrest his ass.
I have an idea.
Help me.
Wait a minute.
I've seen him in here before.
When's the last time he was in?
Maybe, what, three, four days ago?
He pays for a lot of privates.
I danced for him a couple times, but he was sweet on Candy's cherry pop.
Did Candy ever turn him down, seem nervous around him?
No.
No, she liked the attention.
But when she was busy, especially with Barcelli, he'd get irritated and leave.
Barcelli?
Was Hanning a part of Barcelli's crew of cops that came through here?
Yeah, but most times he'd just wait till Barcelli left and then shuffle to the stage and plunk down cash for Candy to work the pole.
Was Candy with Barcelli before she left the other night?
Uh, yeah, but it was weird.
They were in the corner, talking, and Barcelli's not big on conversation.
Hey, see you later.
What the hell is going on?
We have a warrant to search your vehicle.
- What for?
- Just pop the trunk.
You want my trunk open, you call my Lieutenant.
In fact, I'll call him myself.
Please do.
We'll wait.
There.
Thanks for your time, Detective.
Wait.
I think we'll take that Lieutenant's number now.
Hey.
- We need to talk.
- No, we don't.
You can't ignore me forever.
Yeah, well, I can try.
Richie, who I see is none--
"See"?
Really?
That's what you're gonna call it?
Okay, you need to stop acting like some sort of Saint, because I know your past.
You were a dog and I never once judged you for it.
I didn't sleep with your partner.
You slept with my best friend in high school.
- Debbie told you that?
- Yeah.
Well, you know what?
It's different.
Oh, right.
Because you're a guy?
No, because I was in high school.
You're 30 years old.
It doesn't change the fact that I didn't judge you.
I didn't feel what Brody and I were was something you needed to know about.
I didn't want to make it complicated.
Abby, Brody's my partner.
He's got my back.
You're my sister.
I care about you.
I mean, those facts alone make it complicated.
Look, I'm not sorry I slept with Brody, but I am sorry I kept it from you.
I don't know what else to say.
Are we gonna get past this?
Yeah, probably.
But just don't ever lie to me again, okay?
Well, I didn't really lie to you.
Abby.
What's going on?
- Hanning's dead.
- What?
What happened?
Apparently he got shot trying to escape police custody.
He was cuffed.
How did he get away?
The Lieutenant thinks it was a setup.
By who, Barcelli?
It seems the two cops involved in the shooting have possible ties with Barcelli.
- Then let's get on it.
- No need.
Already sent Jones and Fash.
You two have done enough.
Just give me your report by the morning.
Great job, by the way.
So that's it?
Yeah, we did our jobs.
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
Whoa.
Brotha cleans up well, don't he?
- This is a surprise.
- Yeah.
Well, I finished my report early and came over here to entice you to come home with me.
No enticement necessary.
I was just leaving.
We got the bad guy.
One of the bad guys.
Let it go, Abby.
You did good.
I'll see you in the morning.
- Quit--put this right there.
- I can't.
- You can.
- No.
Goldilocks, I heard you solved Candy's murder.
Good for you.
So, when did you become such a son of a bitch?
See, my grandfather was a hard-ass, but he was a damn good cop, and there's no way he would have stood for the crap you pull so what made you turn?
Move along, baby.
Seems Detective Kowalski and I have some business here.
I've been cleared of Candy's murder, so what is it you've still got stuck up your butt?
We know Hanning was one of your guys.
He was my friend.
Did you have Hanning killed because he was screwing Candy behind your back or because he was stupid enough to have her killed in a houseful of cops?
Both.
That's what you want me to say, right?
But what evidence could you possibly have?
My gut, and my gut says you sent Candy after Hanning's key.
Entrance to the cop house is generational or by invitation only.
I did a bit of digging, Bob, and you've been turned down twice in the last year.
That's got to hurt.
So what would I get by having that key?
Plant a camera.
Catch a good cop doing bad.
That's how you get these cops under your thumb, isn't it?
Get something on them, use it against them.
You're good, but eventually you're gonna make a mistake, and when you do, I will be there to nail your ass to the wall.
Consider me warned, Detective Kowalski.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Everything okay?
I came to apologize.
I never meant for this to ruin yours and Richie's partnership.
No, no, it's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.
It was my idea to keep it a secret, so--
He just needs some time to wrap his head around it.
And I'm just glad it's out in the open now.
We don't have to keep it a secret.
I mean, it's a good thing, right?
I think we should take a break.
So this was never about Richie.
I mean, come on, Abby.
Be honest with me.
I was honest with you.
I said at the start I didn't want a relationship.
I know, you did.
Neither did I.
But things changed.
I want to take you on a date and give this thing a shot.
I mean, you already agreed.
Technically, I didn't.
Can I take a rain check?
Okay.
I'm gonna hold you to it, though, Kowalski.
Oh, Mackie's good.
She's really good.
And she's gonna quit her day job.
Oh, I've been trying to get her to do that for years.
She spends one afternoon with you, she throws caution to the wind.
She's a good egg.
She thinks the same about you.
Mm-mm.
So, Brody, huh?
Who told you?
Your father.
- I'm sorry I didn't.
- Oh, honey, please.
Mothers and daughters don't tell each other every detail.
Especially about sex.
I know.
Still--
I was just happy to hear that you have a sex life.
- Mother!
- What?
Well, I mean, I'm just-- I'm just saying.
I--
You're terrible.

Let's not make it any more complicated than that.
It's pizza.
It's no metaphor for anything deeper.
What?
Nothing.

I know the word "similitude" also, okay?
Don't underestimate me, Kowalski.
Okay, come on, quit stalling.
- One minute.
- You've had 15.
What the hell is that?
That is a triple word score.
I don't think so, Kowalski.
Unless that's Polish for crazy,
I'm guessing that's not a word.
Fine.
Let's consult the ref.
Hey, my great-grandfather's in this book.
I know, I know.
Richie keeps bragging like he supposedly went toe-to-toe with Al Capone.
Your family is blue-blooded royalty.
Here he is.
Ronald Kowalski.
35 years on the job.
My grandpa Willie was the same tough old bastard.
He died two years ago.
I miss him.
I gotta watch myself around you Kowalskis.
Guess you do.
What?
Nothing.
How long have you and Carlos been married?
Seven years.
Why?
Wow.
Four kids in seven years.
Two of 'em are only a minute apart.
Still.
You got a thing about kids?
No.
No way.
I love kids.
I just don't have any room for them in my life right now.
I barely have room for a guy.
Well, liking a guy doesn't mean it's gonna lead to kids.
It's not like the flu.
I know.
It's just, wow.
Almost or soon-to-be four kids.
It's--
- What can I say?
My Carlos is very passionate and I'm fertile.
Flores, Kowalski.
My office, now.
Got an anonymous call this morning.
Female body found in an alley at Madison near Kilbourne.
Caller said the woman was killed by a cop.
- Any proof?
- Just her word.
You think she's telling the truth?
It's our job to assume they are and investigate-- anonymous or otherwise.
- What are you not telling us?
- Who really did it.
[Paper rips] That's your job.
Start there.
That's it?
No other explanation?
I need to repeat myself?
Oh, I thought you said the victim was found in an alley.
- She was.
- Then what's here?
The last place she was seen alive.
The Furry Corral?
Seriously?
I stand out like a sore thumb.
Oh, no.
You look great.
You barely notice.
Did Papadol seem out of sorts this morning?
He gets mean when he lies.
What's he lying about?
The real reason we're here.
- Is that--?
- Lieutenant Bob Barcelli.
He used to be one of the best on the force.
Got turned out somehow heading up narcotics.
Now he's into all kind of bad.
Isn't he, like, top on IA's complaint list?
Coerced confessions?
Excessive force, harassment.
Barcelli's big on abusing his power as a cop.
It's been Papadol's mission to kick him off the force.
But nothing's ever stuck, right?
Maybe Papadol thinks we've got something that finally will.
- Where are you going?
- To talk to Barcelli.
It looks like he comes here a lot.
Maybe he saw something, heard something.
Police.
Take a walk.
IA?
How's Lieutenant Papadol?
He sends his regards.
Mind if we ask you a few questions about a dancer that worked here?
Michelle Kane?
Goes by the name "Candy" Kane?
Beautiful girl.
Died way too young.
We're hoping you can help us figure out why that happened.
Don't know I could be much help to you, but anything for IA.
Girls, IA has got some questions about Candy.
Oblige 'em.
Nikki, give Goldilocks a taste.
Oh, no, that's really not necessary.
Okay, gentlemen, welcome Sherry to the stage.
You know, you really don't have to do this.
Uh-huh.
[Laughs]
So you're looking to find who snuffed out Candy?
Yeah.
Any ideas?
Um...
[Giggles]
Okay, can you--?
Wow, you're really flexible.
Thanks.
Yoga four times a week.
So, can you tell me anything about Candy?
Candy was always looking to come into some money.
The reason she first came to Chicago was to be part of Second City.
Bitch was hilarious.
Guess she got sidelined, huh?
A lot of girls do.
So, uh, how long was she working here?
Uh, six months.
Was Candy working last night?
Got off early.
Said she had some date and didn't seem to excited about it.
Was Barcelli here last night?
Till closing.
Where'd you go afterwards?
Since my divorce, my one-bedroom apartment.
Were you alone?
I don't kiss and tell.
Characterize your relationship with Candy Kane.
There was no relationship.
She was a piece of ass I liked to see wiggle.
That's it?
She also made all my wet dreams come true.
Got it.
Good.
Wanted to be crystal clear.
Didn't want you thinking there was something more.
Just figured a cop of your rank and stature may have seen something that could help us.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.
So you were with Barcelli all night?
All night.
Till about 6:00 this morning.
Let's go.
We've overstayed our welcome.
Oh.
If you remember anything.
Absolutely, Mrs. Camalari.
Thursday morning.
[Sighs]
What's wrong?
Oh, I just took an order I can't possibly fill.
Well, call her back and tell her you can't do it.
She'll never order from me again.
And I've got so many orders coming in now.
I-I-I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up.
I think it's time you open your bake shop.
You've been talking about it for years.
We can't afford that.
We'll make it work.
We always do.
Hey, Mom.
Oh, hey, what are you doing here?
Hey, Mrs. K.
I stopped by to get dad since his car is in the shop.
Your mom is finally gonna open her bake shop.
- Oh, that's great.
- No, no, no, no.
I'm just thinking about it.
Stop thinking and do it.
That's what I told her.
[Laughs] What do you think?
I think you'll know when you're ready, Mrs. K.
John, you're gonna make some nice girl a very good husband someday.
[Laughs]
All right, pops.
You ready?
I was born ready.
Just gotta find my keys.
Give Abby a call.
Let her talk you into it.
[Kiss]
Bye, honey.
Candy's autopsy report just came in.
The Furry Corral give you any indication why our victim might have a, uh, key inside her stomach?
No.
But why didn't you tell us one of the strippers is undercover IA?
I have a couple of cops working deep undercover, investigating Barcelli.
Nikki happens to be one of them.
What tipped you?
She was eager to come over to us, the other girls were pissed they weren't making money, and she had no problem giving us info.
I'll tell her to work on that.
We're on the same team.
Why keep us in the dark?
My concern is keeping Nikki alive and this investigation secure.
She's gotten closer to Barcelli than most.
That's an understatement.
Nikki took a big chance calling you.
That is why this is all very sensitive.
Nikki would not have jeopardized her cover if she didn't feel strongly that a cop killed Candy.
She is the best we've got.
Nikki was with Barcelli all night long.
No way he killed her.
Doesn't mean he didn't have her killed.
Do your due diligence.
[Door closes]
Okay, Candy had sex before she was murdered, but there is no trauma suggesting rape.
What was the cause of death?
Uh, M.E.'s report says suffocation through strangulation.
Is that glass in her hair?
Beveled stained glass and some old-growth wood.
It suggests she was murdered in a much nicer neighborhood than where she was dumped.
Crime lab's doing forensics.
Superficial scratches on her back.
Okay, we find where this key goes to, maybe we find a broken window.
"BB."
Can't be that easy.
That tattoo behind her right ear, it looks like an over-embellished cross.
Candy was one of Bishop's girls.
Who's Bishop?
A pimp who worked a stretch on Rich Street.
So, she was a working girl before she graduated to stripping?
It could be where she originally met Barcelli.
There's a saying on the street.
You're more likely to sleep with a cop than actually be arrested by one.
You can totally do this, Mom.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, and I think I know exactly the person to help you as well.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Hey, baby.
- Damn, you look good.
- Okay, beat it.
Excuse me?
Come here.
Come--come here.
Hey.
Damn it.
- Abby, wait.
- It's all right.
I ain't gonna hurt her.
- I said, beat it.
- [Groans]
Don't move or I'll break it.
Hope not.
It's his turn to make dinner tonight.
- What?
- Carlos, my new partner Abby.
Abby, my husband.
Oh.
Oh, no!
I'm so sorry!
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah.
- Can I have my arm back now?
- Oh, sure.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were--
Some strung-out brotha?
Spent ten years on vice perfecting this look.
Let that be a lesson to you.
There is no future on the streets.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.
[Kiss]
Carlos works this neighborhood.
Figured he know something more about Bishop.
What'd you find out?
Candy was one of Bishop's top moneymakers.
He was pretty pissed when she stepped out on him.
Pissed enough to kill her?
Enough to threaten that if he ever laid eyes on her again, he was gonna slash her pretty little face.
I see you around here again, I'm gonna haul your ass in.
Hey, calm down, bitch.
I'm leaving.
Hey, Bishop.
Flores, Kowalski.
Need to ask you about one of your girls.
She goes by the name of Candy Kane.
I ain't seen that girl since she walked on me, like, six months ago.
Why?
She was found dead this morning just a mile from here.
- What do you know about it?
- Not a damn thing.
I was throwing a private party last night, breaking in some new talent.
She's working up the block right now.
You can ask her yourself.
You know any other reason why Candy would be down here?
- You ask her cop boyfriend?
- Barcelli?
Barcelli?
Who said anything about Barcelli?
Well, that's the cop she was screwing, right?
Hell if I know.
[Car door slams]
Juan Martinez.
Seems were not the only ones working on this case.
Flores, Kowalski, IA.
Hanning, Martinez, homicide.
What's IA want with our pimp?
- And this is where I get off.
- No, no, no.
- Oh, man.
- Stand over there.
You working the Candy Kane case?
Yeah.
Got a witness that can put Bishop with Candy yesterday.
Bishop claims he hasn't seen Candy since she moved on off to the Furry Corral.
Well, that's not the first time a pimp's lied now, is it?
You guys still haven't answered the question.
Why is IA sniffing around this case?
Uh-uh.
You know how this works.
You share with us, not the other way around.
If we have any further questions, we'll give you a call.
Wow, that's gotta piss 'em off.
It always does.
- Mackie?
- Hey, Mrs. Kowalski.
So I figured we'd jump right in.
Abby said you're swamped, so time is of the essence to get the ball rolling on this lifelong dream of yours.
♪ Baby, and every word that I say is true ♪
♪ you got me runnin' and hiding' ♪
♪ all over town ♪
♪ you got me sneakin' and a-peepin' ♪
♪ and runnin' you down ♪
♪ this can't go on ♪
- Brody!
Hi.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
I came to ask you out on a date.
- A date?
- Yeah, you know.
Fancy linens and silverware.
Or karaoke and sawdusted floors.
- Whatever you prefer.
- Uh...
Okay, what brought this on?
Nothing.
I thought it'd be fun.
Hey, if you don't want your brother to see us, we'll take the EL down to Barrington.
Oh, no, I don't do the EL.
The whole underground thing--
I mean, it's, uh, claustrophobic.
- Yeah, big time.
- So I'll rent a car.
Did you have a good time last night?
Not that part.
The afterwards part.
When you tried to cheat.
I did not cheat.
Just answer the question.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to take you out on a date.
It's been six months.
You owe me a date.
Tomorrow night, 8 p.m.
And, uh, wear your hair down.
Homicide has a witness who claims she saw Bishop in a heated discussion with Candy Kane yesterday, approximately 4:25 p.m. near Rich and State.
It was right before her shift at the Furry Corral.
We tried contacting the witness, but so far, nothing.
Homicide hasn't exactly been forthcoming with their information.
How did Bishop react when you brought up Barcelli?
He pretended like he had no idea who we were talking about.
- You believe him?
- A cop with Barcelli's rep?
Every criminal in this city knows who he is or at least crap their pants upon hearing his name.
Uh, the report came back that the glass and the wood found in the victim's hair was from the early 1900s.
Abby's calling someone who can help narrow it down for us.
It seems there are only a couple places qualified to replace windows in historic buildings.
That's our window.
Looks like your contact at the Historic Initiative was right.
Yeah, the guy at the installation place said someone called just this morning about coming out.
I'm calling in a warrant.
We need to get inside.
[Dials phone number]
[Dog barks]
Oh, excuse me, sir?
Detectives Flores and Kowalski.
- You live here?
- Why?
Sir, please answer my partner.
- Is this your home?
- Why?
Slowly.
Relax.
Sergeant Brian Dudek.
Are you here investigating Candy Kane's murder?
What?
No.
Let me see your keys.
You need to open this door, Sergeant.
[Sighs] All right.
[Overlapping chatter]
Heads up, fellas.
IA's in the house.
We just need to ask a few questions.
If everyone will place their firearms on the table before we get started.
Now.
Dad?
Dad, what are you doing here?
- It's not your business.
- Uh, it is my business.
I'm here investigating the murder of a woman who possibly died here last night.
Oh, really?
When did you transfer to homicide?
I didn't.
It's complicated.
I'll explain later.
I've heard about this place.
Is this the cop house everyone talks about, with the wild, late night parties, the strippers, the mistresses?
Do you have a mistress?
- No.
We play poker.
- And?
And it's like a fraternity.
We call ourselves the Blind Bowlers.
- This place used to--
- The Blind Bowlers?
Seriously?
You want to hear this?
Sorry.
Back in the '20s, three cops busted the mobster Dutch Schwartz and took over his speakeasy-- this place.
In those days, lower-class speakeasies were called the Blind Pigs.
The cops decided to call themselves the Blind Bowlers.
If their wives asked, they were bowling, but they'd come here.
You're either invited in or the key is passed down generational.
It's a tradition that's stuck.
Does mom know about this place?
Of course she knows.
We don't have any secrets.
How many members?
20.
We've always kept it small.
Have better control of the place.
Is Bob Barcelli one of the members?
No.
Why?
You think he had something to do with the death of this girl?
I don't know.
You watch your back with him, Abby.
He is not a man to be messed with.
Were you here last night?
Are you asking me as my daughter or an IA Detective?
Both.
It's a simple question, Dad.
Then I have to ask you to come down to IA to answer some more questions.
Then I guess you'd better inform your mother that I'm going to be late for dinner.
Hey, what the--?
Get dressed.
You gotta be kidding me.
[Latch clicks]
What happened in this room, Candy?
[Dialing phone number]
[Overlapping chatter]
Ah, I thought we were sharing information.
We are.
You share what you have with us.
What did you find out?
The key found in Candy's stomach is to this house.
We found evidence it could be the original crime scene.
Yeah, well, this is a house full of cops now, isn't it?
Then one of these cops is a possible suspect in Candy's murder.
Mind if we take a look?
That okay with you?
- Abby.
- What are you doing here?
We got a call to escort some cops down to IA.
Dad?
Am I riding with you, Rich?
Are you arresting dad?
No.
We just have to ask him a few more questions.
Are you out of your mind?
Can you just take him down to IA, please?
[Sighs]
- Really, Abby?
Your dad?
- I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
I know how close you are to your family.
Look, he'll get over it.
Kowalskis can't stand not talking to one another.
Who else is gonna listen to them?
What was that?
It was nothing.
It was just- there was a piece of hair in her face.
You let him touch you?
You told me you thought he was disgusting.
- You said that?
- No, I-- okay, I kinda did, but--
- Thanks.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Hey, hey, come on.
Richie, calm down.
You want me to calm down when you're sleeping with my sister behind my back?
- Keep your voice down!
- Can we talk about this?
Yeah, after I kick your ass.
Don't be ridiculous.
You're not kicking anyone's ass.
- I'm not fighting you.
- Richie, damn it!
Stop it!
Damn it!
Richie, get off him!
You don't know what he's been saying about you!
Not one word was about her!
- Bullshit!
- That's enough!
Richard, in the car.
You too, Brody.
Does your mother know about this?
Okay, open your eyes.
[Gasps] Oh!
[Laughs]
Mackie, that's wonderful!
Now, we can play around with the colors, switch things around.
Oh, no, no, no.
That's beautiful.
Oh, my gosh!
[Both laugh]
Hey.
Oh!
Oh, wow, that looks great!
I know, right?
And--and--and I have, um,
I have a business plan and everything was Mackie's idea.
Oh!
[Laughter]
- Are you all right?
- What?
You ran in here like your hair was on fire.
Uh, well, first of all, you need to know everyone's okay.
Okay, now you're scaring me.
No, no, no, it's not scary.
I just had to take dad down to IA to ask him some questions, so he might be a little late.
You had to arrest your father?
No, no.
It's a long story.
There was a murder.
You think your father killed someone?
No, mom, no.
A woman died at the house where dad plays poker.
- The Blind Bowlers?
- So you do know about that.
Well, of course I do.
Why wouldn't I?
No reason.
Abby, you have to know, your father would not be involved in anything shameful.
Yes, I do.
[Laughs]
So there's no way Lieutenant Bob Barcelli would be in possession of a key?
No.
To your knowledge, has Barcelli ever been inside the house?
Why are you asking me about Lieutenant Barcelli?
Is it because of his connection to my father?
Just because he was a rookie under my father 100 years ago doesn't mean that I am or ever have been friends with him, so I suggest you move on to another question.
Were you at the house last night, Sergeant Kowalski?
- No.
- Do you know who was?
- No.
We don't have a sign-in sheet.
Can you give us the names of everyone who is a member of the house?
Is that why I'm here?
Because I'm the father of one of your detectives,
I should provide you with all the information you need so you don't have to work for it?
Send Detective Kowalski in, please.
We just have a few more--
Unless you're gonna suspend me or compel me to answer your questions,
I would like to speak with my daughter.
[Sighs]
[Sighs]
I don't pretend to understand why you took this job, but what I will not do is be used in any way, shape, or form because you're my daughter.
That's not what they were doing.
You may not think so, but yes, that's exactly what they were doing.
[Sighs]
So, what do you want to know?
Have you ever seen this woman before at the house?
She works as a stripper at the Furry Corral.
- No.
Did she have a record?
- Yes.
Once for solicitation.
We have two rules.
No hookers and no one with a record allowed in.
Well, someone obviously broke that rule.
This woman was found strangled to death early this morning and someone in that house was involved.
I don't believe it.
I'm telling you, there's a murderer among you.
You may not want to believe it, but we have strong evidence that says otherwise.
I'm gonna need the name of every cop with a key to that house.
I'm also gonna need yours.
So, we have a list of all the cops who have keys to the house.
Mind telling us why you didn't mention you were part of the Blind Bowlers?
Never came up.
In case you haven't noticed,
I've been investigating a homicide.
- So have we.
- No, no, no.
You guys are on a witch hunt for a cop.
A cop who may have killed Candy.
Listen, while you guys were out harassing Chicago's finest,
I was out there, solving a case.
Meaning?
Meaning we've already got a suspect in custody.
A suspect?
Who?
- Charles Murray, aka Bishop.
- Candy's ex-pimp?
Just signed a confession 20 minutes ago, so as you can see, I was, uh, kind of busy to come down to your little cop tea party.
So Bishop killed Candy in a houseful of cops?
Yeah, said it was an ef you to the cops for taking away what was his.
And if you don't believe me, you can check the tapes.
Oh, yeah, you can talk to him yourself if you want.
He's down in holding right now.
I almost forgot.
We're gonna need your key.
- What key?
- Your key to the house.
What's my key got to do with anything?
I just told you, we got a confession out of Bishop.
We've collected all 19.
There's one missing.
Yours.
[Clears throat]
Now, are we done?
Hey, can we talk?
[Sighs] No.
Then can you listen?
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to talk about it.
I won't even allow myself to even think about the thousands of times you've bragged about some chick.
It conjures up images of my sister.
I just want to bash your head in.
Not once was I talking about Abby.
The blond with big boobs who blew you to paradise?
That wasn't your sister.
So you were with all these other women while you were screwing my sister?
No, it's not like that.
I really like Abby.
Please.
You like her so much you're hooking up with other women behind her back?
It was your sister that didn't want any ties, okay?
I was just trying to respect it.
Respect?
That's ridiculous.
How about showing your partner some respect, huh?
- How long were you two--?
- Oh, seriously?
- How long?
- Six months.
I think you're making way too big of a deal out of this.
You should have told me.
It wasn't my secret to tell.
Yes it was, damn it!
You were my partner!
Were?
[Locker door slams]
[Sighs]
I put in a request for a new partner.
- Thanks for helping my mom out.
- Oh, my pleasure.
You're so lucky to have a mom like her.
I know.
She's pretty amazing.
Hmm!
That's an understatement.
Do you have any idea how great it is to be able to tell your mom anything and not have her judge you for it?
I didn't tell her about Brody.
- Why didn't you tell her?
- I don't know.
I do.
You don't want her to know that you're not this hopeless romantic you pretend to be because you're actually a horny-ass nymph.
- Are you still drunk?
- What?
The two empty wine bottles pretty much gave you away.
Seriously, what were you thinking, getting my mom drunk in the middle of the day?
Okay, first of all, it takes a little more than a few glasses of white wine to get me drunk.
And secondly, it was your mom who was doing all the pouring.
Mackie.
I promise it will never happen again.
Thank you.
[Laughs]
Richie, it's me again.
Can you please call me back?
We need to talk.
- Is your brother still pissed?
- Yes.
So you're not allowed to date someone your brother knows?
Yeah, of course.
It's more complicated.
Okay, I was embarrassed.
Why?
He's cute.
It was just sex.
So you're a ho?
No.
Abby, lighten up.
It's okay to just want sex.
I know.
I just don't want a relationship right now.
I don't have the time for it.
I don't know how you do it.
I have a damn good man that has my back.
- That's not what I meant.
- Look, you make choices.
I could stay home, but that wouldn't benefit my husband or my kids.
I'm just not made that way.
[Phone ringing]
Criminalist report came back from the cop house.
Fibers from Candy's clothing were found inside that room.
So do we still think Bishop had something to do with her murder?
And what happened after that?
She broke away from me and she ran towards the window.
She pulled away and fell into the window.
I tried pulling her back in, but--
Bishop, did you kill Michelle Kane?
Yeah.
Ye--yes.
Yeah, I did.
Do we believe him?
Why would Bishop take Candy to a cop house?
How did he even get in?
And what does he keep looking at?
You mean, who?
[Sighs] Hanning's partner, Martinez?
Bishop looked scared to death.
You saw Martinez.
Would those boyish looks scare you?
Who else would be in the room?
Someone who has a vested interest in making sure Bishop keeps his mouth shut.
Barcelli?
Barcelli has an ironclad alibi.
What would he have to gain by coercing a confession out of Bishop?
That's what you need to find out.
[Phone rings]
Yeah.
None of this makes sense.
Hold on.
No need to talk to Bishop.
- Why?
- He's dead.
They just found him hanging in his cell.
So, Martinez was not in the room when Bishop confessed.
He was at his desk finishing up paperwork from his last case.
And listen to this.
Hanning and Martinez caught Candy's case three days into their last one.
Usually takes detectives two weeks to catch a new case.
Hanning obviously leapfrogged over a few detectives to make sure he was first again in the rotation.
Just got off with Carlos.
Bishop was telling the truth.
The night of Candy's murder, he was holed up all night with a new girl he deemed Tootsie Pop.
Hanning's file?
Back in 2008, he was cited for drunken misconduct at a bar.
In 2010, cops came out twice to his house on a domestic abuse charge.
Sounds like our cop has anger issues.
Find out if Hanning's covering his tracks or someone else's.
This makes no sense.
All 20 keys are here, including Hanning's.
[Key clinks on desktop]
How long has Hanning been a member of the Blind Bowlers?
Five years.
Does this keep look like it has five years' mileage on it?
Need more than a brand-new key to arrest his ass.
I have an idea.
Help me.
Wait a minute.
I've seen him in here before.
When's the last time he was in?
Maybe, what, three, four days ago?
He pays for a lot of privates.
I danced for him a couple times, but he was sweet on Candy's cherry pop.
Did Candy ever turn him down, seem nervous around him?
No.
No, she liked the attention.
But when she was busy, especially with Barcelli, he'd get irritated and leave.
Barcelli?
Was Hanning a part of Barcelli's crew of cops that came through here?
Yeah, but most times he'd just wait till Barcelli left and then shuffle to the stage and plunk down cash for Candy to work the pole.
Was Candy with Barcelli before she left the other night?
Uh, yeah, but it was weird.
They were in the corner, talking, and Barcelli's not big on conversation.
Hey, see you later.
What the hell is going on?
We have a warrant to search your vehicle.
- What for?
- Just pop the trunk.
You want my trunk open, you call my Lieutenant.
In fact, I'll call him myself.
Please do.
We'll wait.
There.
Thanks for your time, Detective.
Wait.
I think we'll take that Lieutenant's number now.
Hey.
- We need to talk.
- No, we don't.
You can't ignore me forever.
Yeah, well, I can try.
Richie, who I see is none--
"See"?
Really?
That's what you're gonna call it?
Okay, you need to stop acting like some sort of Saint, because I know your past.
You were a dog and I never once judged you for it.
I didn't sleep with your partner.
You slept with my best friend in high school.
- Debbie told you that?
- Yeah.
Well, you know what?
It's different.
Oh, right.
Because you're a guy?
No, because I was in high school.
You're 30 years old.
It doesn't change the fact that I didn't judge you.
I didn't feel what Brody and I were was something you needed to know about.
I didn't want to make it complicated.
Abby, Brody's my partner.
He's got my back.
You're my sister.
I care about you.
I mean, those facts alone make it complicated.
Look, I'm not sorry I slept with Brody, but I am sorry I kept it from you.
I don't know what else to say.
Are we gonna get past this?
[Sighs]
Yeah, probably.
But just don't ever lie to me again, okay?
Well, I didn't really lie to you.
Abby.
What's going on?
- Hanning's dead.
- What?
What happened?
Apparently he got shot trying to escape police custody.
He was cuffed.
How did he get away?
The Lieutenant thinks it was a setup.
By who, Barcelli?
It seems the two cops involved in the shooting have possible ties with Barcelli.
- Then let's get on it.
- No need.
Already sent Jones and Fash.
You two have done enough.
Just give me your report by the morning.
Great job, by the way.
[Exhales] So that's it?
Yeah, we did our jobs.
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
Whoa.
Brotha cleans up well, don't he?
- This is a surprise.
- Yeah.
Well, I finished my report early and came over here to entice you to come home with me.
No enticement necessary.
I was just leaving.
We got the bad guy.
One of the bad guys.
Let it go, Abby.
You did good.
I'll see you in the morning.
- Quit--put this right there.
- I can't.
- You can.
- No.
Goldilocks, I heard you solved Candy's murder.
Good for you.
So, when did you become such a son of a bitch?
See, my grandfather was a hard-ass, but he was a damn good cop, and there's no way he would have stood for the crap you pull so what made you turn?
Move along, baby.
Seems Detective Kowalski and I have some business here.
I've been cleared of Candy's murder, so what is it you've still got stuck up your butt?
We know Hanning was one of your guys.
He was my friend.
Did you have Hanning killed because he was screwing Candy behind your back or because he was stupid enough to have her killed in a houseful of cops?
Both.
That's what you want me to say, right?
But what evidence could you possibly have?
My gut, and my gut says you sent Candy after Hanning's key.
Entrance to the cop house is generational or by invitation only.
I did a bit of digging, Bob, and you've been turned down twice in the last year.
That's got to hurt.
So what would I get by having that key?
Plant a camera.
Catch a good cop doing bad.
That's how you get these cops under your thumb, isn't it?
Get something on them, use it against them.
You're good, but eventually you're gonna make a mistake, and when you do, I will be there to nail your ass to the wall.
Consider me warned, Detective Kowalski.
[Knock on door]
Hey.
- Hey.
- Everything okay?
I came to apologize.
I never meant for this to ruin yours and Richie's partnership.
No, no, it's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.
It was my idea to keep it a secret, so--
He just needs some time to wrap his head around it.
And I'm just glad it's out in the open now.
We don't have to keep it a secret.
I mean, it's a good thing, right?
I think we should take a break.
So this was never about Richie.
I mean, come on, Abby.
Be honest with me.
I was honest with you.
I said at the start I didn't want a relationship.
I know, you did.
Neither did I.
But things changed.
I want to take you on a date and give this thing a shot.
I mean, you already agreed.
Technically, I didn't.
Can I take a rain check?
Okay.
I'm gonna hold you to it, though, Kowalski.
Oh, Mackie's good.
She's really good.
And she's gonna quit her day job.
Oh, I've been trying to get her to do that for years.
She spends one afternoon with you, she throws caution to the wind.
She's a good egg.
She thinks the same about you.
Mm-mm.
[Sighs]
So, Brody, huh?
Who told you?
Your father.
- I'm sorry I didn't.
- Oh, honey, please.
Mothers and daughters don't tell each other every detail.
Especially about sex.
I know.
Still--
I was just happy to hear that you have a sex life.
- Mother!
- What?
Well, I mean, I'm just-- I'm just saying.
I--
You're terrible.
[Sighs]
[Laughs]
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Not now.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
Wait, wait.
I-I have to go.
- What?
- I just--I gotta go.
Uhh!
Where are you going, huh?
- I'm sorry.
- Uhh!
I'll be right back, okay?
Don't move.
Why are you dressed?
- You ordered pizza?
- Yeah.
Why are you dressed?
When did you have time to order pizza?
I preordered it.
I thought we'd be hungry afterwards.
Brody, let's just keep it simple, okay?
Let's not make it any more complicated than that.
It's pizza.
It's no metaphor for anything deeper.
What?
Nothing.
I--
I know the word "similitude" also, okay?
Don't underestimate me, Kowalski.
Okay, come on, quit stalling.
- One minute.
- You've had 15.
What the hell is that?
That is a triple word score.
I don't think so, Kowalski.
Unless that's Polish for crazy,
I'm guessing that's not a word.
Fine.
Let's consult the ref.
Hey, my great-grandfather's in this book.
I know, I know.
Richie keeps bragging like he supposedly went toe-to-toe with Al Capone.
Your family is blue-blooded royalty.
Here he is.
Ronald Kowalski.
35 years on the job.
My grandpa Willie was the same tough old bastard.
He died two years ago.
I miss him.
I gotta watch myself around you Kowalskis.
Guess you do.
What?
Nothing.
How long have you and Carlos been married?
Seven years.
Why?
Wow.
Four kids in seven years.
Two of 'em are only a minute apart.
Still.
You got a thing about kids?
No.
No way.
I love kids.
I just don't have any room for them in my life right now.
I barely have room for a guy.
Well, liking a guy doesn't mean it's gonna lead to kids.
It's not like the flu.
I know.
It's just, wow.
Almost or soon-to-be four kids.
It's--
- What can I say?
My Carlos is very passionate and I'm fertile.
Flores, Kowalski.
My office, now.
Got an anonymous call this morning.
Female body found in an alley at Madison near Kilbourne.
Caller said the woman was killed by a cop.
- Any proof?
- Just her word.
You think she's telling the truth?
It's our job to assume they are and investigate-- anonymous or otherwise.
- What are you not telling us?
- Who really did it.
That's your job.
Start there.
That's it?
No other explanation?
I need to repeat myself?
Oh, I thought you said the victim was found in an alley.
- She was.
- Then what's here?
The last place she was seen alive.
The Furry Corral?
Seriously?
I stand out like a sore thumb.
Oh, no.
You look great.
You barely notice.
Did Papadol seem out of sorts this morning?
He gets mean when he lies.
What's he lying about?
The real reason we're here.
- Is that--?
- Lieutenant Bob Barcelli.
He used to be one of the best on the force.
Got turned out somehow heading up narcotics.
Now he's into all kind of bad.
Isn't he, like, top on IA's complaint list?
Coerced confessions?
Excessive force, harassment.
Barcelli's big on abusing his power as a cop.
It's been Papadol's mission to kick him off the force.
But nothing's ever stuck, right?
Maybe Papadol thinks we've got something that finally will.
- Where are you going?
- To talk to Barcelli.
It looks like he comes here a lot.
Maybe he saw something, heard something.
Police.
Take a walk.
IA?
How's Lieutenant Papadol?
He sends his regards.
Mind if we ask you a few questions about a dancer that worked here?
Michelle Kane?
Goes by the name "Candy" Kane?
Beautiful girl.
Died way too young.
We're hoping you can help us figure out why that happened.
Don't know I could be much help to you, but anything for IA.
Girls, IA has got some questions about Candy.
Oblige 'em.
Nikki, give Goldilocks a taste.
Oh, no, that's really not necessary.
Okay, gentlemen, welcome Sherry to the stage.
You know, you really don't have to do this.
Uh-huh.
So you're looking to find who snuffed out Candy?
Yeah.
Any ideas?
Um...
Okay, can you--?
Wow, you're really flexible.
Thanks.
Yoga four times a week.
So, can you tell me anything about Candy?
Candy was always looking to come into some money.
The reason she first came to Chicago was to be part of Second City.
Bitch was hilarious.
Guess she got sidelined, huh?
A lot of girls do.
So, uh, how long was she working here?
Uh, six months.
Was Candy working last night?
Got off early.
Said she had some date and didn't seem to excited about it.
Was Barcelli here last night?
Till closing.
Where'd you go afterwards?
Since my divorce, my one-bedroom apartment.
Were you alone?
I don't kiss and tell.
Characterize your relationship with Candy Kane.
There was no relationship.
She was a piece of ass I liked to see wiggle.
That's it?
She also made all my wet dreams come true.
Got it.
Good.
Wanted to be crystal clear.
Didn't want you thinking there was something more.
Just figured a cop of your rank and stature may have seen something that could help us.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.
So you were with Barcelli all night?
All night.
Till about 6:00 this morning.
Let's go.
We've overstayed our welcome.
Oh.
If you remember anything.
Absolutely, Mrs. Camalari.
Thursday morning.
What's wrong?
Oh, I just took an order I can't possibly fill.
Well, call her back and tell her you can't do it.
She'll never order from me again.
And I've got so many orders coming in now.
I-I-I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up.
I think it's time you open your bake shop.
You've been talking about it for years.
We can't afford that.
We'll make it work.
We always do.
Hey, Mom.
Oh, hey, what are you doing here?
Hey, Mrs. K.
I stopped by to get dad since his car is in the shop.
Your mom is finally gonna open her bake shop.
- Oh, that's great.
- No, no, no, no.
I'm just thinking about it.
Stop thinking and do it.
That's what I told her.
What do you think?
I think you'll know when you're ready, Mrs. K.
John, you're gonna make some nice girl a very good husband someday.
All right, pops.
You ready?
I was born ready.
Just gotta find my keys.
Give Abby a call.
Let her talk you into it.
Bye, honey.
Candy's autopsy report just came in.
The Furry Corral give you any indication why our victim might have a, uh, key inside her stomach?
No.
But why didn't you tell us one of the strippers is undercover IA?
I have a couple of cops working deep undercover, investigating Barcelli.
Nikki happens to be one of them.
What tipped you?
She was eager to come over to us, the other girls were pissed they weren't making money, and she had no problem giving us info.
I'll tell her to work on that.
We're on the same team.
Why keep us in the dark?
My concern is keeping Nikki alive and this investigation secure.
She's gotten closer to Barcelli than most.
That's an understatement.
Nikki took a big chance calling you.
That is why this is all very sensitive.
Nikki would not have jeopardized her cover if she didn't feel strongly that a cop killed Candy.
She is the best we've got.
Nikki was with Barcelli all night long.
No way he killed her.
Doesn't mean he didn't have her killed.
Do your due diligence.
Okay, Candy had sex before she was murdered, but there is no trauma suggesting rape.
What was the cause of death?
Uh, M.E.'s report says suffocation through strangulation.
Is that glass in her hair?
Beveled stained glass and some old-growth wood.
It suggests she was murdered in a much nicer neighborhood than where she was dumped.
Crime lab's doing forensics.
Superficial scratches on her back.
Okay, we find where this key goes to, maybe we find a broken window.
"BB."
Can't be that easy.
That tattoo behind her right ear, it looks like an over-embellished cross.
Candy was one of Bishop's girls.
Who's Bishop?
A pimp who worked a stretch on Rich Street.
So, she was a working girl before she graduated to stripping?
It could be where she originally met Barcelli.
There's a saying on the street.
You're more likely to sleep with a cop than actually be arrested by one.
You can totally do this, Mom.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, and I think I know exactly the person to help you as well.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Hey, baby.
- Damn, you look good.
- Okay, beat it.
Excuse me?
Come here.
Come--come here.
Hey.
Damn it.
- Abby, wait.
- It's all right.
I ain't gonna hurt her.
I said, beat it.
Don't move or I'll break it.
Hope not.
It's his turn to make dinner tonight.
- What?
- Carlos, my new partner Abby.
Abby, my husband.
Oh.
Oh, no!
I'm so sorry!
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah.
- Can I have my arm back now?
- Oh, sure.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were--
Some strung-out brotha?
Spent ten years on vice perfecting this look.
Let that be a lesson to you.
There is no future on the streets.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.
Carlos works this neighborhood.
Figured he know something more about Bishop.
What'd you find out?
Candy was one of Bishop's top moneymakers.
He was pretty pissed when she stepped out on him.
Pissed enough to kill her?
Enough to threaten that if he ever laid eyes on her again, he was gonna slash her pretty little face.
I see you around here again, I'm gonna haul your ass in.
Hey, calm down, bitch.
I'm leaving.
Hey, Bishop.
Flores, Kowalski.
Need to ask you about one of your girls.
She goes by the name of Candy Kane.
I ain't seen that girl since she walked on me, like, six months ago.
Why?
She was found dead this morning just a mile from here.
- What do you know about it?
- Not a damn thing.
I was throwing a private party last night, breaking in some new talent.
She's working up the block right now.
You can ask her yourself.
You know any other reason why Candy would be down here?
- You ask her cop boyfriend?
- Barcelli?
Barcelli?
Who said anything about Barcelli?
Well, that's the cop she was screwing, right?
Hell if I know.
Juan Martinez.
Seems were not the only ones working on this case.
Flores, Kowalski, IA.
Hanning, Martinez, homicide.
What's IA want with our pimp?
- And this is where I get off.
- No, no, no.
- Oh, man.
- Stand over there.
You working the Candy Kane case?
Yeah.
Got a witness that can put Bishop with Candy yesterday.
Bishop claims he hasn't seen Candy since she moved on off to the Furry Corral.
Well, that's not the first time a pimp's lied now, is it?
You guys still haven't answered the question.
Why is IA sniffing around this case?
Uh-uh.
You know how this works.
You share with us, not the other way around.
If we have any further questions, we'll give you a call.
Wow, that's gotta piss 'em off.
It always does.
- Mackie?
- Hey, Mrs. Kowalski.
So I figured we'd jump right in.
Abby said you're swamped, so time is of the essence to get the ball rolling on this lifelong dream of yours.
♪ Baby, and every word that I say is true ♪
♪ you got me runnin' and hiding' ♪
♪ all over town ♪
♪ you got me sneakin' and a-peepin' ♪
♪ and runnin' you down ♪
♪ this can't go on ♪
- Brody!
Hi.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
I came to ask you out on a date.
- A date?
- Yeah, you know.
Fancy linens and silverware.
Or karaoke and sawdusted floors.
- Whatever you prefer.
- Uh...
Okay, what brought this on?
Nothing.
I thought it'd be fun.
Hey, if you don't want your brother to see us, we'll take the EL down to Barrington.
Oh, no, I don't do the EL.
The whole underground thing--
I mean, it's, uh, claustrophobic.
- Yeah, big time.
- So I'll rent a car.
Did you have a good time last night?
Not that part.
The afterwards part.
When you tried to cheat.
I did not cheat.
Just answer the question.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to take you out on a date.
It's been six months.
You owe me a date.
Tomorrow night, 8 p.m.
And, uh, wear your hair down.
Homicide has a witness who claims she saw Bishop in a heated discussion with Candy Kane yesterday, approximately 4:25 p.m. near Rich and State.
It was right before her shift at the Furry Corral.
We tried contacting the witness, but so far, nothing.
Homicide hasn't exactly been forthcoming with their information.
How did Bishop react when you brought up Barcelli?
He pretended like he had no idea who we were talking about.
- You believe him?
- A cop with Barcelli's rep?
Every criminal in this city knows who he is or at least crap their pants upon hearing his name.
Uh, the report came back that the glass and the wood found in the victim's hair was from the early 1900s.
Abby's calling someone who can help narrow it down for us.
It seems there are only a couple places qualified to replace windows in historic buildings.
That's our window.
Looks like your contact at the Historic Initiative was right.
Yeah, the guy at the installation place said someone called just this morning about coming out.
I'm calling in a warrant.
We need to get inside.
Oh, excuse me, sir?
Detectives Flores and Kowalski.
- You live here?
- Why?
Sir, please answer my partner.
- Is this your home?
- Why?
Slowly.
Relax.
Sergeant Brian Dudek.
Are you here investigating Candy Kane's murder?
What?
No.
Let me see your keys.
You need to open this door, Sergeant.
All right.
Heads up, fellas.
IA's in the house.
We just need to ask a few questions.
If everyone will place their firearms on the table before we get started.
Now.
Dad?
Dad, what are you doing here?
- It's not your business.
- Uh, it is my business.
I'm here investigating the murder of a woman who possibly died here last night.
Oh, really?
When did you transfer to homicide?
I didn't.
It's complicated.
I'll explain later.
I've heard about this place.
Is this the cop house everyone talks about, with the wild, late night parties, the strippers, the mistresses?
Do you have a mistress?
- No.
We play poker.
- And?
And it's like a fraternity.
We call ourselves the Blind Bowlers.
- This place used to--
- The Blind Bowlers?
Seriously?
You want to hear this?
Sorry.
Back in the '20s, three cops busted the mobster Dutch Schwartz and took over his speakeasy-- this place.
In those days, lower-class speakeasies were called the Blind Pigs.
The cops decided to call themselves the Blind Bowlers.
If their wives asked, they were bowling, but they'd come here.
You're either invited in or the key is passed down generational.
It's a tradition that's stuck.
Does mom know about this place?
Of course she knows.
We don't have any secrets.
How many members?
20.
We've always kept it small.
Have better control of the place.
Is Bob Barcelli one of the members?
No.
Why?
You think he had something to do with the death of this girl?
I don't know.
You watch your back with him, Abby.
He is not a man to be messed with.
Were you here last night?
Are you asking me as my daughter or an IA Detective?
Both.
It's a simple question, Dad.
Then I have to ask you to come down to IA to answer some more questions.
Then I guess you'd better inform your mother that I'm going to be late for dinner.
Hey, what the--?
Get dressed.
You gotta be kidding me.
What happened in this room, Candy?
Ah, I thought we were sharing information.
We are.
You share what you have with us.
What did you find out?
The key found in Candy's stomach is to this house.
We found evidence it could be the original crime scene.
Yeah, well, this is a house full of cops now, isn't it?
Then one of these cops is a possible suspect in Candy's murder.
Mind if we take a look?
That okay with you?
- Abby.
- What are you doing here?
We got a call to escort some cops down to IA.
Dad?
Am I riding with you, Rich?
Are you arresting dad?
No.
We just have to ask him a few more questions.
Are you out of your mind?
Can you just take him down to IA, please?
- Really, Abby?
Your dad?
- I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
I know how close you are to your family.
Look, he'll get over it.
Kowalskis can't stand not talking to one another.
Who else is gonna listen to them?
What was that?
It was nothing.
It was just- there was a piece of hair in her face.
You let him touch you?
You told me you thought he was disgusting.
- You said that?
- No, I-- okay, I kinda did, but--
- Thanks.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Hey, hey, come on.
Richie, calm down.
You want me to calm down when you're sleeping with my sister behind my back?
- Keep your voice down!
- Can we talk about this?
Yeah, after I kick your ass.
Don't be ridiculous.
You're not kicking anyone's ass.
- I'm not fighting you.
- Richie, damn it!
Stop it!
Damn it!
Richie, get off him!
You don't know what he's been saying about you!
Not one word was about her!
- Bullshit!
- That's enough!
Richard, in the car.
You too, Brody.
Does your mother know about this?
Okay, open your eyes.
Oh!
Mackie, that's wonderful!
Now, we can play around with the colors, switch things around.
Oh, no, no, no.
That's beautiful.
Oh, my gosh!
Hey.
Oh!
Oh, wow, that looks great!
I know, right?
And--and--and I have, um,
I have a business plan and everything was Mackie's idea.
Oh!
- Are you all right?
- What?
You ran in here like your hair was on fire.
Uh, well, first of all, you need to know everyone's okay.
Okay, now you're scaring me.
No, no, no, it's not scary.
I just had to take dad down to IA to ask him some questions, so he might be a little late.
You had to arrest your father?
No, no.
It's a long story.
There was a murder.
You think your father killed someone?
No, mom, no.
A woman died at the house where dad plays poker.
- The Blind Bowlers?
- So you do know about that.
Well, of course I do.
Why wouldn't I?
No reason.
Abby, you have to know, your father would not be involved in anything shameful.
Yes, I do.
So there's no way Lieutenant Bob Barcelli would be in possession of a key?
No.
To your knowledge, has Barcelli ever been inside the house?
Why are you asking me about Lieutenant Barcelli?
Is it because of his connection to my father?
Just because he was a rookie under my father 100 years ago doesn't mean that I am or ever have been friends with him, so I suggest you move on to another question.
Were you at the house last night, Sergeant Kowalski?
- No.
- Do you know who was?
- No.
We don't have a sign-in sheet.
Can you give us the names of everyone who is a member of the house?
Is that why I'm here?
Because I'm the father of one of your detectives,
I should provide you with all the information you need so you don't have to work for it?
Send Detective Kowalski in, please.
We just have a few more--
Unless you're gonna suspend me or compel me to answer your questions,
I would like to speak with my daughter.
I don't pretend to understand why you took this job, but what I will not do is be used in any way, shape, or form because you're my daughter.
That's not what they were doing.
You may not think so, but yes, that's exactly what they were doing.
So, what do you want to know?
Have you ever seen this woman before at the house?
She works as a stripper at the Furry Corral.
- No.
Did she have a record?
- Yes.
Once for solicitation.
We have two rules.
No hookers and no one with a record allowed in.
Well, someone obviously broke that rule.
This woman was found strangled to death early this morning and someone in that house was involved.
I don't believe it.
I'm telling you, there's a murderer among you.
You may not want to believe it, but we have strong evidence that says otherwise.
I'm gonna need the name of every cop with a key to that house.
I'm also gonna need yours.
So, we have a list of all the cops who have keys to the house.
Mind telling us why you didn't mention you were part of the Blind Bowlers?
Never came up.
In case you haven't noticed,
I've been investigating a homicide.
- So have we.
- No, no, no.
You guys are on a witch hunt for a cop.
A cop who may have killed Candy.
Listen, while you guys were out harassing Chicago's finest,
I was out there, solving a case.
Meaning?
Meaning we've already got a suspect in custody.
A suspect?
Who?
- Charles Murray, aka Bishop.
- Candy's ex-pimp?
Just signed a confession 20 minutes ago, so as you can see, I was, uh, kind of busy to come down to your little cop tea party.
So Bishop killed Candy in a houseful of cops?
Yeah, said it was an ef you to the cops for taking away what was his.
And if you don't believe me, you can check the tapes.
Oh, yeah, you can talk to him yourself if you want.
He's down in holding right now.
I almost forgot.
We're gonna need your key.
- What key?
- Your key to the house.
What's my key got to do with anything?
I just told you, we got a confession out of Bishop.
We've collected all 19.
There's one missing.
Yours.
Now, are we done?
Hey, can we talk?
No.
Then can you listen?
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to talk about it.
I won't even allow myself to even think about the thousands of times you've bragged about some chick.
It conjures up images of my sister.
I just want to bash your head in.
Not once was I talking about Abby.
The blond with big boobs who blew you to paradise?
That wasn't your sister.
So you were with all these other women while you were screwing my sister?
No, it's not like that.
I really like Abby.
Please.
You like her so much you're hooking up with other women behind her back?
It was your sister that didn't want any ties, okay?
I was just trying to respect it.
Respect?
That's ridiculous.
How about showing your partner some respect, huh?
- How long were you two--?
- Oh, seriously?
- How long?
- Six months.
I think you're making way too big of a deal out of this.
You should have told me.
It wasn't my secret to tell.
Yes it was, damn it!
You were my partner!
Were?
I put in a request for a new partner.
- Thanks for helping my mom out.
- Oh, my pleasure.
You're so lucky to have a mom like her.
I know.
She's pretty amazing.
Hmm!
That's an understatement.
Do you have any idea how great it is to be able to tell your mom anything and not have her judge you for it?
I didn't tell her about Brody.
- Why didn't you tell her?
- I don't know.
I do.
You don't want her to know that you're not this hopeless romantic you pretend to be because you're actually a horny-ass nymph.
- Are you still drunk?
- What?
The two empty wine bottles pretty much gave you away.
Seriously, what were you thinking, getting my mom drunk in the middle of the day?
Okay, first of all, it takes a little more than a few glasses of white wine to get me drunk.
And secondly, it was your mom who was doing all the pouring.
Mackie.
I promise it will never happen again.
Thank you.
Richie, it's me again.
Can you please call me back?
We need to talk.
- Is your brother still pissed?
- Yes.
So you're not allowed to date someone your brother knows?
Yeah, of course.
It's more complicated.
Okay, I was embarrassed.
Why?
He's cute.
It was just sex.
So you're a ho?
No.
Abby, lighten up.
It's okay to just want sex.
I know.
I just don't want a relationship right now.
I don't have the time for it.
I don't know how you do it.
I have a damn good man that has my back.
- That's not what I meant.
- Look, you make choices.
I could stay home, but that wouldn't benefit my husband or my kids.
I'm just not made that way.
Criminalist report came back from the cop house.
Fibers from Candy's clothing were found inside that room.
So do we still think Bishop had something to do with her murder?
And what happened after that?
She broke away from me and she ran towards the window.
She pulled away and fell into the window.
I tried pulling her back in, but--
Bishop, did you kill Michelle Kane?
Yeah.
Ye--yes.
Yeah, I did.
Do we believe him?
Why would Bishop take Candy to a cop house?
How did he even get in?
And what does he keep looking at?
You mean, who?
Hanning's partner, Martinez?
Bishop looked scared to death.
You saw Martinez.
Would those boyish looks scare you?
Who else would be in the room?
Someone who has a vested interest in making sure Bishop keeps his mouth shut.
Barcelli?
Barcelli has an ironclad alibi.
What would he have to gain by coercing a confession out of Bishop?
That's what you need to find out.
Yeah.
None of this makes sense.
Hold on.
No need to talk to Bishop.
- Why?
- He's dead.
They just found him hanging in his cell.
So, Martinez was not in the room when Bishop confessed.
He was at his desk finishing up paperwork from his last case.
And listen to this.
Hanning and Martinez caught Candy's case three days into their last one.
Usually takes detectives two weeks to catch a new case.
Hanning obviously leapfrogged over a few detectives to make sure he was first again in the rotation.
Just got off with Carlos.
Bishop was telling the truth.
The night of Candy's murder, he was holed up all night with a new girl he deemed Tootsie Pop.
Hanning's file?
Back in 2008, he was cited for drunken misconduct at a bar.
In 2010, cops came out twice to his house on a domestic abuse charge.
Sounds like our cop has anger issues.
Find out if Hanning's covering his tracks or someone else's.
This makes no sense.
All 20 keys are here, including Hanning's.
How long has Hanning been a member of the Blind Bowlers?
Five years.
Does this keep look like it has five years' mileage on it?
Need more than a brand-new key to arrest his ass.
I have an idea.
Help me.
Wait a minute.
I've seen him in here before.
When's the last time he was in?
Maybe, what, three, four days ago?
He pays for a lot of privates.
I danced for him a couple times, but he was sweet on Candy's cherry pop.
Did Candy ever turn him down, seem nervous around him?
No.
No, she liked the attention.
But when she was busy, especially with Barcelli, he'd get irritated and leave.
Barcelli?
Was Hanning a part of Barcelli's crew of cops that came through here?
Yeah, but most times he'd just wait till Barcelli left and then shuffle to the stage and plunk down cash for Candy to work the pole.
Was Candy with Barcelli before she left the other night?
Uh, yeah, but it was weird.
They were in the corner, talking, and Barcelli's not big on conversation.
Hey, see you later.
What the hell is going on?
We have a warrant to search your vehicle.
- What for?
- Just pop the trunk.
You want my trunk open, you call my Lieutenant.
In fact, I'll call him myself.
Please do.
We'll wait.
There.
Thanks for your time, Detective.
Wait.
I think we'll take that Lieutenant's number now.
Hey.
- We need to talk.
- No, we don't.
You can't ignore me forever.
Yeah, well, I can try.
Richie, who I see is none--
"See"?
Really?
That's what you're gonna call it?
Okay, you need to stop acting like some sort of Saint, because I know your past.
You were a dog and I never once judged you for it.
I didn't sleep with your partner.
You slept with my best friend in high school.
- Debbie told you that?
- Yeah.
Well, you know what?
It's different.
Oh, right.
Because you're a guy?
No, because I was in high school.
You're 30 years old.
It doesn't change the fact that I didn't judge you.
I didn't feel what Brody and I were was something you needed to know about.
I didn't want to make it complicated.
Abby, Brody's my partner.
He's got my back.
You're my sister.
I care about you.
I mean, those facts alone make it complicated.
Look, I'm not sorry I slept with Brody, but I am sorry I kept it from you.
I don't know what else to say.
Are we gonna get past this?
Yeah, probably.
But just don't ever lie to me again, okay?
Well, I didn't really lie to you.
Abby.
What's going on?
- Hanning's dead.
- What?
What happened?
Apparently he got shot trying to escape police custody.
He was cuffed.
How did he get away?
The Lieutenant thinks it was a setup.
By who, Barcelli?
It seems the two cops involved in the shooting have possible ties with Barcelli.
- Then let's get on it.
- No need.
Already sent Jones and Fash.
You two have done enough.
Just give me your report by the morning.
Great job, by the way.
So that's it?
Yeah, we did our jobs.
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
Whoa.
Brotha cleans up well, don't he?
- This is a surprise.
- Yeah.
Well, I finished my report early and came over here to entice you to come home with me.
No enticement necessary.
I was just leaving.
We got the bad guy.
One of the bad guys.
Let it go, Abby.
You did good.
I'll see you in the morning.
- Quit--put this right there.
- I can't.
- You can.
- No.
Goldilocks, I heard you solved Candy's murder.
Good for you.
So, when did you become such a son of a bitch?
See, my grandfather was a hard-ass, but he was a damn good cop, and there's no way he would have stood for the crap you pull so what made you turn?
Move along, baby.
Seems Detective Kowalski and I have some business here.
I've been cleared of Candy's murder, so what is it you've still got stuck up your butt?
We know Hanning was one of your guys.
He was my friend.
Did you have Hanning killed because he was screwing Candy behind your back or because he was stupid enough to have her killed in a houseful of cops?
Both.
That's what you want me to say, right?
But what evidence could you possibly have?
My gut, and my gut says you sent Candy after Hanning's key.
Entrance to the cop house is generational or by invitation only.
I did a bit of digging, Bob, and you've been turned down twice in the last year.
That's got to hurt.
So what would I get by having that key?
Plant a camera.
Catch a good cop doing bad.
That's how you get these cops under your thumb, isn't it?
Get something on them, use it against them.
You're good, but eventually you're gonna make a mistake, and when you do, I will be there to nail your ass to the wall.
Consider me warned, Detective Kowalski.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Everything okay?
I came to apologize.
I never meant for this to ruin yours and Richie's partnership.
No, no, it's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.
It was my idea to keep it a secret, so--
He just needs some time to wrap his head around it.
And I'm just glad it's out in the open now.
We don't have to keep it a secret.
I mean, it's a good thing, right?
I think we should take a break.
So this was never about Richie.
I mean, come on, Abby.
Be honest with me.
I was honest with you.
I said at the start I didn't want a relationship.
I know, you did.
Neither did I.
But things changed.
I want to take you on a date and give this thing a shot.
I mean, you already agreed.
Technically, I didn't.
Can I take a rain check?
Okay.
I'm gonna hold you to it, though, Kowalski.
Oh, Mackie's good.
She's really good.
And she's gonna quit her day job.
Oh, I've been trying to get her to do that for years.
She spends one afternoon with you, she throws caution to the wind.
She's a good egg.
She thinks the same about you.
Mm-mm.
So, Brody, huh?
Who told you?
Your father.
- I'm sorry I didn't.
- Oh, honey, please.
Mothers and daughters don't tell each other every detail.
Especially about sex.
I know.
Still--
I was just happy to hear that you have a sex life.
- Mother!
- What?
Well, I mean, I'm just-- I'm just saying.
I--
You're terrible.

Not now.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
Wait, wait.
I-I have to go.
- What?
- I just--I gotta go.
Uhh!
Where are you going, huh?
- I'm sorry.
- Uhh!
I'll be right back, okay?
Don't move.
Why are you dressed?
- You ordered pizza?
- Yeah.
Why are you dressed?
When did you have time to order pizza?
I preordered it.
I thought we'd be hungry afterwards.
Brody, let's just keep it simple, okay?
Let's not make it any more complicated than that.
It's pizza.
It's no metaphor for anything deeper.
What?
Nothing.
I--
I know the word "similitude" also, okay?
Don't underestimate me, Kowalski.
Okay, come on, quit stalling.
- One minute.
- You've had 15.
What the hell is that?
That is a triple word score.
I don't think so, Kowalski.
Unless that's Polish for crazy,
I'm guessing that's not a word.
Fine.
Let's consult the ref.
Hey, my great-grandfather's in this book.
I know, I know.
Richie keeps bragging like he supposedly went toe-to-toe with Al Capone.
Your family is blue-blooded royalty.
Here he is.
Ronald Kowalski.
35 years on the job.
My grandpa Willie was the same tough old bastard.
He died two years ago.
I miss him.
I gotta watch myself around you Kowalskis.
Guess you do.
What?
Nothing.
How long have you and Carlos been married?
Seven years.
Why?
Wow.
Four kids in seven years.
Two of 'em are only a minute apart.
Still.
You got a thing about kids?
No.
No way.
I love kids.
I just don't have any room for them in my life right now.
I barely have room for a guy.
Well, liking a guy doesn't mean it's gonna lead to kids.
It's not like the flu.
I know.
It's just, wow.
Almost or soon-to-be four kids.
It's--
- What can I say?
My Carlos is very passionate and I'm fertile.
Flores, Kowalski.
My office, now.
Got an anonymous call this morning.
Female body found in an alley at Madison near Kilbourne.
Caller said the woman was killed by a cop.
- Any proof?
- Just her word.
You think she's telling the truth?
It's our job to assume they are and investigate-- anonymous or otherwise.
- What are you not telling us?
- Who really did it.
That's your job.
Start there.
That's it?
No other explanation?
I need to repeat myself?
Oh, I thought you said the victim was found in an alley.
- She was.
- Then what's here?
The last place she was seen alive.
The Furry Corral?
Seriously?
I stand out like a sore thumb.
Oh, no.
You look great.
You barely notice.
Did Papadol seem out of sorts this morning?
He gets mean when he lies.
What's he lying about?
The real reason we're here.
- Is that--?
- Lieutenant Bob Barcelli.
He used to be one of the best on the force.
Got turned out somehow heading up narcotics.
Now he's into all kind of bad.
Isn't he, like, top on IA's complaint list?
Coerced confessions?
Excessive force, harassment.
Barcelli's big on abusing his power as a cop.
It's been Papadol's mission to kick him off the force.
But nothing's ever stuck, right?
Maybe Papadol thinks we've got something that finally will.
- Where are you going?
- To talk to Barcelli.
It looks like he comes here a lot.
Maybe he saw something, heard something.
Police.
Take a walk.
IA?
How's Lieutenant Papadol?
He sends his regards.
Mind if we ask you a few questions about a dancer that worked here?
Michelle Kane?
Goes by the name "Candy" Kane?
Beautiful girl.
Died way too young.
We're hoping you can help us figure out why that happened.
Don't know I could be much help to you, but anything for IA.
Girls, IA has got some questions about Candy.
Oblige 'em.
Nikki, give Goldilocks a taste.
Oh, no, that's really not necessary.
Okay, gentlemen, welcome Sherry to the stage.
You know, you really don't have to do this.
Uh-huh.
So you're looking to find who snuffed out Candy?
Yeah.
Any ideas?
Um...
Okay, can you--?
Wow, you're really flexible.
Thanks.
Yoga four times a week.
So, can you tell me anything about Candy?
Candy was always looking to come into some money.
The reason she first came to Chicago was to be part of Second City.
Bitch was hilarious.
Guess she got sidelined, huh?
A lot of girls do.
So, uh, how long was she working here?
Uh, six months.
Was Candy working last night?
Got off early.
Said she had some date and didn't seem to excited about it.
Was Barcelli here last night?
Till closing.
Where'd you go afterwards?
Since my divorce, my one-bedroom apartment.
Were you alone?
I don't kiss and tell.
Characterize your relationship with Candy Kane.
There was no relationship.
She was a piece of ass I liked to see wiggle.
That's it?
She also made all my wet dreams come true.
Got it.
Good.
Wanted to be crystal clear.
Didn't want you thinking there was something more.
Just figured a cop of your rank and stature may have seen something that could help us.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.
So you were with Barcelli all night?
All night.
Till about 6:00 this morning.
Let's go.
We've overstayed our welcome.
Oh.
If you remember anything.
Absolutely, Mrs. Camalari.
Thursday morning.
What's wrong?
Oh, I just took an order I can't possibly fill.
Well, call her back and tell her you can't do it.
She'll never order from me again.
And I've got so many orders coming in now.
I-I-I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up.
I think it's time you open your bake shop.
You've been talking about it for years.
We can't afford that.
We'll make it work.
We always do.
Hey, Mom.
Oh, hey, what are you doing here?
Hey, Mrs. K.
I stopped by to get dad since his car is in the shop.
Your mom is finally gonna open her bake shop.
- Oh, that's great.
- No, no, no, no.
I'm just thinking about it.
Stop thinking and do it.
That's what I told her.
What do you think?
I think you'll know when you're ready, Mrs. K.
John, you're gonna make some nice girl a very good husband someday.
All right, pops.
You ready?
I was born ready.
Just gotta find my keys.
Give Abby a call.
Let her talk you into it.
Bye, honey.
Candy's autopsy report just came in.
The Furry Corral give you any indication why our victim might have a, uh, key inside her stomach?
No.
But why didn't you tell us one of the strippers is undercover IA?
I have a couple of cops working deep undercover, investigating Barcelli.
Nikki happens to be one of them.
What tipped you?
She was eager to come over to us, the other girls were pissed they weren't making money, and she had no problem giving us info.
I'll tell her to work on that.
We're on the same team.
Why keep us in the dark?
My concern is keeping Nikki alive and this investigation secure.
She's gotten closer to Barcelli than most.
That's an understatement.
Nikki took a big chance calling you.
That is why this is all very sensitive.
Nikki would not have jeopardized her cover if she didn't feel strongly that a cop killed Candy.
She is the best we've got.
Nikki was with Barcelli all night long.
No way he killed her.
Doesn't mean he didn't have her killed.
Do your due diligence.
Okay, Candy had sex before she was murdered, but there is no trauma suggesting rape.
What was the cause of death?
Uh, M.E.'s report says suffocation through strangulation.
Is that glass in her hair?
Beveled stained glass and some old-growth wood.
It suggests she was murdered in a much nicer neighborhood than where she was dumped.
Crime lab's doing forensics.
Superficial scratches on her back.
Okay, we find where this key goes to, maybe we find a broken window.
"BB."
Can't be that easy.
That tattoo behind her right ear, it looks like an over-embellished cross.
Candy was one of Bishop's girls.
Who's Bishop?
A pimp who worked a stretch on Rich Street.
So, she was a working girl before she graduated to stripping?
It could be where she originally met Barcelli.
There's a saying on the street.
You're more likely to sleep with a cop than actually be arrested by one.
You can totally do this, Mom.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, and I think I know exactly the person to help you as well.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Hey, baby.
- Damn, you look good.
- Okay, beat it.
Excuse me?
Come here.
Come--come here.
Hey.
Damn it.
- Abby, wait.
- It's all right.
I ain't gonna hurt her.
I said, beat it.
Don't move or I'll break it.
Hope not.
It's his turn to make dinner tonight.
- What?
- Carlos, my new partner Abby.
Abby, my husband.
Oh.
Oh, no!
I'm so sorry!
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah.
- Can I have my arm back now?
- Oh, sure.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were--
Some strung-out brotha?
Spent ten years on vice perfecting this look.
Let that be a lesson to you.
There is no future on the streets.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.
Carlos works this neighborhood.
Figured he know something more about Bishop.
What'd you find out?
Candy was one of Bishop's top moneymakers.
He was pretty pissed when she stepped out on him.
Pissed enough to kill her?
Enough to threaten that if he ever laid eyes on her again, he was gonna slash her pretty little face.
I see you around here again, I'm gonna haul your ass in.
Hey, calm down, bitch.
I'm leaving.
Hey, Bishop.
Flores, Kowalski.
Need to ask you about one of your girls.
She goes by the name of Candy Kane.
I ain't seen that girl since she walked on me, like, six months ago.
Why?
She was found dead this morning just a mile from here.
- What do you know about it?
- Not a damn thing.
I was throwing a private party last night, breaking in some new talent.
She's working up the block right now.
You can ask her yourself.
You know any other reason why Candy would be down here?
- You ask her cop boyfriend?
- Barcelli?
Barcelli?
Who said anything about Barcelli?
Well, that's the cop she was screwing, right?
Hell if I know.
Juan Martinez.
Seems were not the only ones working on this case.
Flores, Kowalski, IA.
Hanning, Martinez, homicide.
What's IA want with our pimp?
- And this is where I get off.
- No, no, no.
- Oh, man.
- Stand over there.
You working the Candy Kane case?
Yeah.
Got a witness that can put Bishop with Candy yesterday.
Bishop claims he hasn't seen Candy since she moved on off to the Furry Corral.
Well, that's not the first time a pimp's lied now, is it?
You guys still haven't answered the question.
Why is IA sniffing around this case?
Uh-uh.
You know how this works.
You share with us, not the other way around.
If we have any further questions, we'll give you a call.
Wow, that's gotta piss 'em off.
It always does.
- Mackie?
- Hey, Mrs. Kowalski.
So I figured we'd jump right in.
Abby said you're swamped, so time is of the essence to get the ball rolling on this lifelong dream of yours.
♪ Baby, and every word that I say is true ♪
♪ you got me runnin' and hiding' ♪
♪ all over town ♪
♪ you got me sneakin' and a-peepin' ♪
♪ and runnin' you down ♪
♪ this can't go on ♪
- Brody!
Hi.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
I came to ask you out on a date.
- A date?
- Yeah, you know.
Fancy linens and silverware.
Or karaoke and sawdusted floors.
- Whatever you prefer.
- Uh...
Okay, what brought this on?
Nothing.
I thought it'd be fun.
Hey, if you don't want your brother to see us, we'll take the EL down to Barrington.
Oh, no, I don't do the EL.
The whole underground thing--
I mean, it's, uh, claustrophobic.
- Yeah, big time.
- So I'll rent a car.
Did you have a good time last night?
Not that part.
The afterwards part.
When you tried to cheat.
I did not cheat.
Just answer the question.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to take you out on a date.
It's been six months.
You owe me a date.
Tomorrow night, 8 p.m.
And, uh, wear your hair down.
Homicide has a witness who claims she saw Bishop in a heated discussion with Candy Kane yesterday, approximately 4:25 p.m. near Rich and State.
It was right before her shift at the Furry Corral.
We tried contacting the witness, but so far, nothing.
Homicide hasn't exactly been forthcoming with their information.
How did Bishop react when you brought up Barcelli?
He pretended like he had no idea who we were talking about.
- You believe him?
- A cop with Barcelli's rep?
Every criminal in this city knows who he is or at least crap their pants upon hearing his name.
Uh, the report came back that the glass and the wood found in the victim's hair was from the early 1900s.
Abby's calling someone who can help narrow it down for us.
It seems there are only a couple places qualified to replace windows in historic buildings.
That's our window.
Looks like your contact at the Historic Initiative was right.
Yeah, the guy at the installation place said someone called just this morning about coming out.
I'm calling in a warrant.
We need to get inside.
Oh, excuse me, sir?
Detectives Flores and Kowalski.
- You live here?
- Why?
Sir, please answer my partner.
- Is this your home?
- Why?
Slowly.
Relax.
Sergeant Brian Dudek.
Are you here investigating Candy Kane's murder?
What?
No.
Let me see your keys.
You need to open this door, Sergeant.
All right.
Heads up, fellas.
IA's in the house.
We just need to ask a few questions.
If everyone will place their firearms on the table before we get started.
Now.
Dad?
Dad, what are you doing here?
- It's not your business.
- Uh, it is my business.
I'm here investigating the murder of a woman who possibly died here last night.
Oh, really?
When did you transfer to homicide?
I didn't.
It's complicated.
I'll explain later.
I've heard about this place.
Is this the cop house everyone talks about, with the wild, late night parties, the strippers, the mistresses?
Do you have a mistress?
- No.
We play poker.
- And?
And it's like a fraternity.
We call ourselves the Blind Bowlers.
- This place used to--
- The Blind Bowlers?
Seriously?
You want to hear this?
Sorry.
Back in the '20s, three cops busted the mobster Dutch Schwartz and took over his speakeasy-- this place.
In those days, lower-class speakeasies were called the Blind Pigs.
The cops decided to call themselves the Blind Bowlers.
If their wives asked, they were bowling, but they'd come here.
You're either invited in or the key is passed down generational.
It's a tradition that's stuck.
Does mom know about this place?
Of course she knows.
We don't have any secrets.
How many members?
20.
We've always kept it small.
Have better control of the place.
Is Bob Barcelli one of the members?
No.
Why?
You think he had something to do with the death of this girl?
I don't know.
You watch your back with him, Abby.
He is not a man to be messed with.
Were you here last night?
Are you asking me as my daughter or an IA Detective?
Both.
It's a simple question, Dad.
Then I have to ask you to come down to IA to answer some more questions.
Then I guess you'd better inform your mother that I'm going to be late for dinner.
Hey, what the--?
Get dressed.
You gotta be kidding me.
What happened in this room, Candy?
Ah, I thought we were sharing information.
We are.
You share what you have with us.
What did you find out?
The key found in Candy's stomach is to this house.
We found evidence it could be the original crime scene.
Yeah, well, this is a house full of cops now, isn't it?
Then one of these cops is a possible suspect in Candy's murder.
Mind if we take a look?
That okay with you?
- Abby.
- What are you doing here?
We got a call to escort some cops down to IA.
Dad?
Am I riding with you, Rich?
Are you arresting dad?
No.
We just have to ask him a few more questions.
Are you out of your mind?
Can you just take him down to IA, please?
- Really, Abby?
Your dad?
- I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
I know how close you are to your family.
Look, he'll get over it.
Kowalskis can't stand not talking to one another.
Who else is gonna listen to them?
What was that?
It was nothing.
It was just- there was a piece of hair in her face.
You let him touch you?
You told me you thought he was disgusting.
- You said that?
- No, I-- okay, I kinda did, but--
- Thanks.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Hey, hey, come on.
Richie, calm down.
You want me to calm down when you're sleeping with my sister behind my back?
- Keep your voice down!
- Can we talk about this?
Yeah, after I kick your ass.
Don't be ridiculous.
You're not kicking anyone's ass.
- I'm not fighting you.
- Richie, damn it!
Stop it!
Damn it!
Richie, get off him!
You don't know what he's been saying about you!
Not one word was about her!
- Bullshit!
- That's enough!
Richard, in the car.
You too, Brody.
Does your mother know about this?
Okay, open your eyes.
Oh!
Mackie, that's wonderful!
Now, we can play around with the colors, switch things around.
Oh, no, no, no.
That's beautiful.
Oh, my gosh!
Hey.
Oh!
Oh, wow, that looks great!
I know, right?
And--and--and I have, um,
I have a business plan and everything was Mackie's idea.
Oh!
- Are you all right?
- What?
You ran in here like your hair was on fire.
Uh, well, first of all, you need to know everyone's okay.
Okay, now you're scaring me.
No, no, no, it's not scary.
I just had to take dad down to IA to ask him some questions, so he might be a little late.
You had to arrest your father?
No, no.
It's a long story.
There was a murder.
You think your father killed someone?
No, mom, no.
A woman died at the house where dad plays poker.
- The Blind Bowlers?
- So you do know about that.
Well, of course I do.
Why wouldn't I?
No reason.
Abby, you have to know, your father would not be involved in anything shameful.
Yes, I do.
So there's no way Lieutenant Bob Barcelli would be in possession of a key?
No.
To your knowledge, has Barcelli ever been inside the house?
Why are you asking me about Lieutenant Barcelli?
Is it because of his connection to my father?
Just because he was a rookie under my father 100 years ago doesn't mean that I am or ever have been friends with him, so I suggest you move on to another question.
Were you at the house last night, Sergeant Kowalski?
- No.
- Do you know who was?
- No.
We don't have a sign-in sheet.
Can you give us the names of everyone who is a member of the house?
Is that why I'm here?
Because I'm the father of one of your detectives,
I should provide you with all the information you need so you don't have to work for it?
Send Detective Kowalski in, please.
We just have a few more--
Unless you're gonna suspend me or compel me to answer your questions,
I would like to speak with my daughter.
I don't pretend to understand why you took this job, but what I will not do is be used in any way, shape, or form because you're my daughter.
That's not what they were doing.
You may not think so, but yes, that's exactly what they were doing.
So, what do you want to know?
Have you ever seen this woman before at the house?
She works as a stripper at the Furry Corral.
- No.
Did she have a record?
- Yes.
Once for solicitation.
We have two rules.
No hookers and no one with a record allowed in.
Well, someone obviously broke that rule.
This woman was found strangled to death early this morning and someone in that house was involved.
I don't believe it.
I'm telling you, there's a murderer among you.
You may not want to believe it, but we have strong evidence that says otherwise.
I'm gonna need the name of every cop with a key to that house.
I'm also gonna need yours.
So, we have a list of all the cops who have keys to the house.
Mind telling us why you didn't mention you were part of the Blind Bowlers?
Never came up.
In case you haven't noticed,
I've been investigating a homicide.
- So have we.
- No, no, no.
You guys are on a witch hunt for a cop.
A cop who may have killed Candy.
Listen, while you guys were out harassing Chicago's finest,
I was out there, solving a case.
Meaning?
Meaning we've already got a suspect in custody.
A suspect?
Who?
- Charles Murray, aka Bishop.
- Candy's ex-pimp?
Just signed a confession 20 minutes ago, so as you can see, I was, uh, kind of busy to come down to your little cop tea party.
So Bishop killed Candy in a houseful of cops?
Yeah, said it was an ef you to the cops for taking away what was his.
And if you don't believe me, you can check the tapes.
Oh, yeah, you can talk to him yourself if you want.
He's down in holding right now.
I almost forgot.
We're gonna need your key.
- What key?
- Your key to the house.
What's my key got to do with anything?
I just told you, we got a confession out of Bishop.
We've collected all 19.
There's one missing.
Yours.
Now, are we done?
Hey, can we talk?
No.
Then can you listen?
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to talk about it.
I won't even allow myself to even think about the thousands of times you've bragged about some chick.
It conjures up images of my sister.
I just want to bash your head in.
Not once was I talking about Abby.
The blond with big boobs who blew you to paradise?
That wasn't your sister.
So you were with all these other women while you were screwing my sister?
No, it's not like that.
I really like Abby.
Please.
You like her so much you're hooking up with other women behind her back?
It was your sister that didn't want any ties, okay?
I was just trying to respect it.
Respect?
That's ridiculous.
How about showing your partner some respect, huh?
- How long were you two--?
- Oh, seriously?
- How long?
- Six months.
I think you're making way too big of a deal out of this.
You should have told me.
It wasn't my secret to tell.
Yes it was, damn it!
You were my partner!
Were?
I put in a request for a new partner.
- Thanks for helping my mom out.
- Oh, my pleasure.
You're so lucky to have a mom like her.
I know.
She's pretty amazing.
Hmm!
That's an understatement.
Do you have any idea how great it is to be able to tell your mom anything and not have her judge you for it?
I didn't tell her about Brody.
- Why didn't you tell her?
- I don't know.
I do.
You don't want her to know that you're not this hopeless romantic you pretend to be because you're actually a horny-ass nymph.
- Are you still drunk?
- What?
The two empty wine bottles pretty much gave you away.
Seriously, what were you thinking, getting my mom drunk in the middle of the day?
Okay, first of all, it takes a little more than a few glasses of white wine to get me drunk.
And secondly, it was your mom who was doing all the pouring.
Mackie.
I promise it will never happen again.
Thank you.
Richie, it's me again.
Can you please call me back?
We need to talk.
- Is your brother still pissed?
- Yes.
So you're not allowed to date someone your brother knows?
Yeah, of course.
It's more complicated.
Okay, I was embarrassed.
Why?
He's cute.
It was just sex.
So you're a ho?
No.
Abby, lighten up.
It's okay to just want sex.
I know.
I just don't want a relationship right now.
I don't have the time for it.
I don't know how you do it.
I have a damn good man that has my back.
- That's not what I meant.
- Look, you make choices.
I could stay home, but that wouldn't benefit my husband or my kids.
I'm just not made that way.
Criminalist report came back from the cop house.
Fibers from Candy's clothing were found inside that room.
So do we still think Bishop had something to do with her murder?
And what happened after that?
She broke away from me and she ran towards the window.
She pulled away and fell into the window.
I tried pulling her back in, but--
Bishop, did you kill Michelle Kane?
Yeah.
Ye--yes.
Yeah, I did.
Do we believe him?
Why would Bishop take Candy to a cop house?
How did he even get in?
And what does he keep looking at?
You mean, who?
Hanning's partner, Martinez?
Bishop looked scared to death.
You saw Martinez.
Would those boyish looks scare you?
Who else would be in the room?
Someone who has a vested interest in making sure Bishop keeps his mouth shut.
Barcelli?
Barcelli has an ironclad alibi.
What would he have to gain by coercing a confession out of Bishop?
That's what you need to find out.
Yeah.
None of this makes sense.
Hold on.
No need to talk to Bishop.
- Why?
- He's dead.
They just found him hanging in his cell.
So, Martinez was not in the room when Bishop confessed.
He was at his desk finishing up paperwork from his last case.
And listen to this.
Hanning and Martinez caught Candy's case three days into their last one.
Usually takes detectives two weeks to catch a new case.
Hanning obviously leapfrogged over a few detectives to make sure he was first again in the rotation.
Just got off with Carlos.
Bishop was telling the truth.
The night of Candy's murder, he was holed up all night with a new girl he deemed Tootsie Pop.
Hanning's file?
Back in 2008, he was cited for drunken misconduct at a bar.
In 2010, cops came out twice to his house on a domestic abuse charge.
Sounds like our cop has anger issues.
Find out if Hanning's covering his tracks or someone else's.
This makes no sense.
All 20 keys are here, including Hanning's.
How long has Hanning been a member of the Blind Bowlers?
Five years.
Does this keep look like it has five years' mileage on it?
Need more than a brand-new key to arrest his ass.
I have an idea.
Help me.
Wait a minute.
I've seen him in here before.
When's the last time he was in?
Maybe, what, three, four days ago?
He pays for a lot of privates.
I danced for him a couple times, but he was sweet on Candy's cherry pop.
Did Candy ever turn him down, seem nervous around him?
No.
No, she liked the attention.
But when she was busy, especially with Barcelli, he'd get irritated and leave.
Barcelli?
Was Hanning a part of Barcelli's crew of cops that came through here?
Yeah, but most times he'd just wait till Barcelli left and then shuffle to the stage and plunk down cash for Candy to work the pole.
Was Candy with Barcelli before she left the other night?
Uh, yeah, but it was weird.
They were in the corner, talking, and Barcelli's not big on conversation.
Hey, see you later.
What the hell is going on?
We have a warrant to search your vehicle.
- What for?
- Just pop the trunk.
You want my trunk open, you call my Lieutenant.
In fact, I'll call him myself.
Please do.
We'll wait.
There.
Thanks for your time, Detective.
Wait.
I think we'll take that Lieutenant's number now.
Hey.
- We need to talk.
- No, we don't.
You can't ignore me forever.
Yeah, well, I can try.
Richie, who I see is none--
"See"?
Really?
That's what you're gonna call it?
Okay, you need to stop acting like some sort of Saint, because I know your past.
You were a dog and I never once judged you for it.
I didn't sleep with your partner.
You slept with my best friend in high school.
- Debbie told you that?
- Yeah.
Well, you know what?
It's different.
Oh, right.
Because you're a guy?
No, because I was in high school.
You're 30 years old.
It doesn't change the fact that I didn't judge you.
I didn't feel what Brody and I were was something you needed to know about.
I didn't want to make it complicated.
Abby, Brody's my partner.
He's got my back.
You're my sister.
I care about you.
I mean, those facts alone make it complicated.
Look, I'm not sorry I slept with Brody, but I am sorry I kept it from you.
I don't know what else to say.
Are we gonna get past this?
Yeah, probably.
But just don't ever lie to me again, okay?
Well, I didn't really lie to you.
Abby.
What's going on?
- Hanning's dead.
- What?
What happened?
Apparently he got shot trying to escape police custody.
He was cuffed.
How did he get away?
The Lieutenant thinks it was a setup.
By who, Barcelli?
It seems the two cops involved in the shooting have possible ties with Barcelli.
- Then let's get on it.
- No need.
Already sent Jones and Fash.
You two have done enough.
Just give me your report by the morning.
Great job, by the way.
So that's it?
Yeah, we did our jobs.
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
Whoa.
Brotha cleans up well, don't he?
- This is a surprise.
- Yeah.
Well, I finished my report early and came over here to entice you to come home with me.
No enticement necessary.
I was just leaving.
We got the bad guy.
One of the bad guys.
Let it go, Abby.
You did good.
I'll see you in the morning.
- Quit--put this right there.
- I can't.
- You can.
- No.
Goldilocks, I heard you solved Candy's murder.
Good for you.
So, when did you become such a son of a bitch?
See, my grandfather was a hard-ass, but he was a damn good cop, and there's no way he would have stood for the crap you pull so what made you turn?
Move along, baby.
Seems Detective Kowalski and I have some business here.
I've been cleared of Candy's murder, so what is it you've still got stuck up your butt?
We know Hanning was one of your guys.
He was my friend.
Did you have Hanning killed because he was screwing Candy behind your back or because he was stupid enough to have her killed in a houseful of cops?
Both.
That's what you want me to say, right?
But what evidence could you possibly have?
My gut, and my gut says you sent Candy after Hanning's key.
Entrance to the cop house is generational or by invitation only.
I did a bit of digging, Bob, and you've been turned down twice in the last year.
That's got to hurt.
So what would I get by having that key?
Plant a camera.
Catch a good cop doing bad.
That's how you get these cops under your thumb, isn't it?
Get something on them, use it against them.
You're good, but eventually you're gonna make a mistake, and when you do, I will be there to nail your ass to the wall.
Consider me warned, Detective Kowalski.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Everything okay?
I came to apologize.
I never meant for this to ruin yours and Richie's partnership.
No, no, it's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.
It was my idea to keep it a secret, so--
He just needs some time to wrap his head around it.
And I'm just glad it's out in the open now.
We don't have to keep it a secret.
I mean, it's a good thing, right?
I think we should take a break.
So this was never about Richie.
I mean, come on, Abby.
Be honest with me.
I was honest with you.
I said at the start I didn't want a relationship.
I know, you did.
Neither did I.
But things changed.
I want to take you on a date and give this thing a shot.
I mean, you already agreed.
Technically, I didn't.
Can I take a rain check?
Okay.
I'm gonna hold you to it, though, Kowalski.
Oh, Mackie's good.
She's really good.
And she's gonna quit her day job.
Oh, I've been trying to get her to do that for years.
She spends one afternoon with you, she throws caution to the wind.
She's a good egg.
She thinks the same about you.
Mm-mm.
So, Brody, huh?
Who told you?
Your father.
- I'm sorry I didn't.
- Oh, honey, please.
Mothers and daughters don't tell each other every detail.
Especially about sex.
I know.
Still--
I was just happy to hear that you have a sex life.
- Mother!
- What?
Well, I mean, I'm just-- I'm just saying.
I--
You're terrible.

Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
Wait, wait.

Uhh!

Where are you going, huh?

Don't move.
[Sighs]
Why are you dressed?
- You ordered pizza?
- Yeah.
Why are you dressed?
When did you have time to order pizza?
I preordered it.
I thought we'd be hungry afterwards.
Brody, let's just keep it simple, okay?
Let's not make it any more complicated than that.
It's pizza.
It's no metaphor for anything deeper.
What?
Nothing.
I--
I know the word "similitude" also, okay?
Don't underestimate me, Kowalski.
Okay, come on, quit stalling.
- One minute.
- You've had 15.
What the hell is that?
That is a triple word score.
I don't think so, Kowalski.
Unless that's Polish for crazy,
I'm guessing that's not a word.
Fine.
Let's consult the ref.
Hey, my great-grandfather's in this book.
I know, I know.
Richie keeps bragging like he supposedly went toe-to-toe with Al Capone.
Your family is blue-blooded royalty.
Here he is.
Ronald Kowalski.
35 years on the job.
My grandpa Willie was the same tough old bastard.
He died two years ago.
I miss him.
I gotta watch myself around you Kowalskis.
Guess you do.
What?
Nothing.
How long have you and Carlos been married?
Seven years.
Why?
Wow.
Four kids in seven years.
Two of 'em are only a minute apart.
Still.
You got a thing about kids?
No.
No way.
I love kids.
I just don't have any room for them in my life right now.
I barely have room for a guy.
Well, liking a guy doesn't mean it's gonna lead to kids.
It's not like the flu.
I know.
It's just, wow.
Almost or soon-to-be four kids.
It's--
- What can I say?
My Carlos is very passionate and I'm fertile.
Flores, Kowalski.
My office, now.
Got an anonymous call this morning.
Female body found in an alley at Madison near Kilbourne.
Caller said the woman was killed by a cop.
- Any proof?
- Just her word.
You think she's telling the truth?
It's our job to assume they are and investigate-- anonymous or otherwise.
- What are you not telling us?
- Who really did it.
[Paper rips] That's your job.
Start there.
That's it?
No other explanation?
I need to repeat myself?
Oh, I thought you said the victim was found in an alley.
- She was.
- Then what's here?
The last place she was seen alive.
The Furry Corral?
Seriously?
I stand out like a sore thumb.
Oh, no.
You look great.
You barely notice.
Did Papadol seem out of sorts this morning?
He gets mean when he lies.
What's he lying about?
The real reason we're here.
- Is that--?
- Lieutenant Bob Barcelli.
He used to be one of the best on the force.
Got turned out somehow heading up narcotics.
Now he's into all kind of bad.
Isn't he, like, top on IA's complaint list?
Coerced confessions?
Excessive force, harassment.
Barcelli's big on abusing his power as a cop.
It's been Papadol's mission to kick him off the force.
But nothing's ever stuck, right?
Maybe Papadol thinks we've got something that finally will.
- Where are you going?
- To talk to Barcelli.
It looks like he comes here a lot.
Maybe he saw something, heard something.
Police.
Take a walk.
IA?
How's Lieutenant Papadol?
He sends his regards.
Mind if we ask you a few questions about a dancer that worked here?
Michelle Kane?
Goes by the name "Candy" Kane?
Beautiful girl.
Died way too young.
We're hoping you can help us figure out why that happened.
Don't know I could be much help to you, but anything for IA.
Girls, IA has got some questions about Candy.
Oblige 'em.
Nikki, give Goldilocks a taste.
Oh, no, that's really not necessary.
Okay, gentlemen, welcome Sherry to the stage.
You know, you really don't have to do this.
Uh-huh.
[Laughs]
So you're looking to find who snuffed out Candy?
Yeah.
Any ideas?
Um...
[Giggles]
Okay, can you--?
Wow, you're really flexible.
Thanks.
Yoga four times a week.
So, can you tell me anything about Candy?
Candy was always looking to come into some money.
The reason she first came to Chicago was to be part of Second City.
Bitch was hilarious.
Guess she got sidelined, huh?
A lot of girls do.
So, uh, how long was she working here?
Uh, six months.
Was Candy working last night?
Got off early.
Said she had some date and didn't seem to excited about it.
Was Barcelli here last night?
Till closing.
Where'd you go afterwards?
Since my divorce, my one-bedroom apartment.
Were you alone?
I don't kiss and tell.
Characterize your relationship with Candy Kane.
There was no relationship.
She was a piece of ass I liked to see wiggle.
That's it?
She also made all my wet dreams come true.
Got it.
Good.
Wanted to be crystal clear.
Didn't want you thinking there was something more.
Just figured a cop of your rank and stature may have seen something that could help us.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.
So you were with Barcelli all night?
All night.
Till about 6:00 this morning.
Let's go.
We've overstayed our welcome.
Oh.
If you remember anything.
Absolutely, Mrs. Camalari.
Thursday morning.
[Sighs]
What's wrong?
Oh, I just took an order I can't possibly fill.
Well, call her back and tell her you can't do it.
She'll never order from me again.
And I've got so many orders coming in now.
I-I-I'm afraid I won't be able to keep up.
I think it's time you open your bake shop.
You've been talking about it for years.
We can't afford that.
We'll make it work.
We always do.
Hey, Mom.
Oh, hey, what are you doing here?
Hey, Mrs. K.
I stopped by to get dad since his car is in the shop.
Your mom is finally gonna open her bake shop.
- Oh, that's great.
- No, no, no, no.
I'm just thinking about it.
Stop thinking and do it.
That's what I told her.
[Laughs] What do you think?
I think you'll know when you're ready, Mrs. K.
John, you're gonna make some nice girl a very good husband someday.
[Laughs]
All right, pops.
You ready?
I was born ready.
Just gotta find my keys.
Give Abby a call.
Let her talk you into it.
[Kiss]
Bye, honey.
Candy's autopsy report just came in.
The Furry Corral give you any indication why our victim might have a, uh, key inside her stomach?
No.
But why didn't you tell us one of the strippers is undercover IA?
I have a couple of cops working deep undercover, investigating Barcelli.
Nikki happens to be one of them.
What tipped you?
She was eager to come over to us, the other girls were pissed they weren't making money, and she had no problem giving us info.
I'll tell her to work on that.
We're on the same team.
Why keep us in the dark?
My concern is keeping Nikki alive and this investigation secure.
She's gotten closer to Barcelli than most.
That's an understatement.
Nikki took a big chance calling you.
That is why this is all very sensitive.
Nikki would not have jeopardized her cover if she didn't feel strongly that a cop killed Candy.
She is the best we've got.
Nikki was with Barcelli all night long.
No way he killed her.
Doesn't mean he didn't have her killed.
Do your due diligence.
[Door closes]
Okay, Candy had sex before she was murdered, but there is no trauma suggesting rape.
What was the cause of death?
Uh, M.E.'s report says suffocation through strangulation.
Is that glass in her hair?
Beveled stained glass and some old-growth wood.
It suggests she was murdered in a much nicer neighborhood than where she was dumped.
Crime lab's doing forensics.
Superficial scratches on her back.
Okay, we find where this key goes to, maybe we find a broken window.
"BB."
Can't be that easy.
That tattoo behind her right ear, it looks like an over-embellished cross.
Candy was one of Bishop's girls.
Who's Bishop?
A pimp who worked a stretch on Rich Street.
So, she was a working girl before she graduated to stripping?
It could be where she originally met Barcelli.
There's a saying on the street.
You're more likely to sleep with a cop than actually be arrested by one.
You can totally do this, Mom.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, and I think I know exactly the person to help you as well.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Hey, baby.
- Damn, you look good.
- Okay, beat it.
Excuse me?
Come here.
Come--come here.
Hey.
Damn it.
- Abby, wait.
- It's all right.
I ain't gonna hurt her.
- I said, beat it.
- [Groans]
Don't move or I'll break it.
Hope not.
It's his turn to make dinner tonight.
- What?
- Carlos, my new partner Abby.
Abby, my husband.
Oh.
Oh, no!
I'm so sorry!
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yeah.
- Can I have my arm back now?
- Oh, sure.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were--
Some strung-out brotha?
Spent ten years on vice perfecting this look.
Let that be a lesson to you.
There is no future on the streets.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.
[Kiss]
Carlos works this neighborhood.
Figured he know something more about Bishop.
What'd you find out?
Candy was one of Bishop's top moneymakers.
He was pretty pissed when she stepped out on him.
Pissed enough to kill her?
Enough to threaten that if he ever laid eyes on her again, he was gonna slash her pretty little face.
I see you around here again, I'm gonna haul your ass in.
Hey, calm down, bitch.
I'm leaving.
Hey, Bishop.
Flores, Kowalski.
Need to ask you about one of your girls.
She goes by the name of Candy Kane.
I ain't seen that girl since she walked on me, like, six months ago.
Why?
She was found dead this morning just a mile from here.
- What do you know about it?
- Not a damn thing.
I was throwing a private party last night, breaking in some new talent.
She's working up the block right now.
You can ask her yourself.
You know any other reason why Candy would be down here?
- You ask her cop boyfriend?
- Barcelli?
Barcelli?
Who said anything about Barcelli?
Well, that's the cop she was screwing, right?
Hell if I know.
[Car door slams]
Juan Martinez.
Seems were not the only ones working on this case.
Flores, Kowalski, IA.
Hanning, Martinez, homicide.
What's IA want with our pimp?
- And this is where I get off.
- No, no, no.
- Oh, man.
- Stand over there.
You working the Candy Kane case?
Yeah.
Got a witness that can put Bishop with Candy yesterday.
Bishop claims he hasn't seen Candy since she moved on off to the Furry Corral.
Well, that's not the first time a pimp's lied now, is it?
You guys still haven't answered the question.
Why is IA sniffing around this case?
Uh-uh.
You know how this works.
You share with us, not the other way around.
If we have any further questions, we'll give you a call.
Wow, that's gotta piss 'em off.
It always does.
- Mackie?
- Hey, Mrs. Kowalski.
So I figured we'd jump right in.
Abby said you're swamped, so time is of the essence to get the ball rolling on this lifelong dream of yours.

- Brody!
Hi.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
I came to ask you out on a date.
- A date?
- Yeah, you know.
Fancy linens and silverware.
Or karaoke and sawdusted floors.
- Whatever you prefer.
- Uh...
Okay, what brought this on?
Nothing.
I thought it'd be fun.
Hey, if you don't want your brother to see us, we'll take the EL down to Barrington.
Oh, no, I don't do the EL.
The whole underground thing--
I mean, it's, uh, claustrophobic.
- Yeah, big time.
- So I'll rent a car.
Did you have a good time last night?
Not that part.
The afterwards part.
When you tried to cheat.
I did not cheat.
Just answer the question.
Why are you doing this?
Because I want to take you out on a date.
It's been six months.
You owe me a date.
Tomorrow night, 8 p.m.
And, uh, wear your hair down.
Homicide has a witness who claims she saw Bishop in a heated discussion with Candy Kane yesterday, approximately 4:25 p.m. near Rich and State.
It was right before her shift at the Furry Corral.
We tried contacting the witness, but so far, nothing.
Homicide hasn't exactly been forthcoming with their information.
How did Bishop react when you brought up Barcelli?
He pretended like he had no idea who we were talking about.
- You believe him?
- A cop with Barcelli's rep?
Every criminal in this city knows who he is or at least crap their pants upon hearing his name.
Uh, the report came back that the glass and the wood found in the victim's hair was from the early 1900s.
Abby's calling someone who can help narrow it down for us.
It seems there are only a couple places qualified to replace windows in historic buildings.
That's our window.
Looks like your contact at the Historic Initiative was right.
Yeah, the guy at the installation place said someone called just this morning about coming out.
I'm calling in a warrant.
We need to get inside.
[Dials phone number]
[Dog barks]
Oh, excuse me, sir?
Detectives Flores and Kowalski.
- You live here?
- Why?
Sir, please answer my partner.
- Is this your home?
- Why?
Slowly.
Relax.
Sergeant Brian Dudek.
Are you here investigating Candy Kane's murder?
What?
No.
Let me see your keys.
You need to open this door, Sergeant.
[Sighs] All right.
[Overlapping chatter]
Heads up, fellas.
IA's in the house.
We just need to ask a few questions.
If everyone will place their firearms on the table before we get started.
Now.
Dad?
Dad, what are you doing here?
- It's not your business.
- Uh, it is my business.
I'm here investigating the murder of a woman who possibly died here last night.
Oh, really?
When did you transfer to homicide?
I didn't.
It's complicated.
I'll explain later.
I've heard about this place.
Is this the cop house everyone talks about, with the wild, late night parties, the strippers, the mistresses?
Do you have a mistress?
- No.
We play poker.
- And?
And it's like a fraternity.
We call ourselves the Blind Bowlers.
- This place used to--
- The Blind Bowlers?
Seriously?
You want to hear this?
Sorry.
Back in the '20s, three cops busted the mobster Dutch Schwartz and took over his speakeasy-- this place.
In those days, lower-class speakeasies were called the Blind Pigs.
The cops decided to call themselves the Blind Bowlers.
If their wives asked, they were bowling, but they'd come here.
You're either invited in or the key is passed down generational.
It's a tradition that's stuck.
Does mom know about this place?
Of course she knows.
We don't have any secrets.
How many members?
20.
We've always kept it small.
Have better control of the place.
Is Bob Barcelli one of the members?
No.
Why?
You think he had something to do with the death of this girl?
I don't know.
You watch your back with him, Abby.
He is not a man to be messed with.
Were you here last night?
Are you asking me as my daughter or an IA Detective?
Both.
It's a simple question, Dad.
Then I have to ask you to come down to IA to answer some more questions.
Then I guess you'd better inform your mother that I'm going to be late for dinner.
Hey, what the--?
Get dressed.
You gotta be kidding me.
[Latch clicks]
What happened in this room, Candy?
[Dialing phone number]
[Overlapping chatter]
Ah, I thought we were sharing information.
We are.
You share what you have with us.
What did you find out?
The key found in Candy's stomach is to this house.
We found evidence it could be the original crime scene.
Yeah, well, this is a house full of cops now, isn't it?
Then one of these cops is a possible suspect in Candy's murder.
Mind if we take a look?
That okay with you?
- Abby.
- What are you doing here?
We got a call to escort some cops down to IA.
Dad?
Am I riding with you, Rich?
Are you arresting dad?
No.
We just have to ask him a few more questions.
Are you out of your mind?
Can you just take him down to IA, please?
[Sighs]
- Really, Abby?
Your dad?
- I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
I know how close you are to your family.
Look, he'll get over it.
Kowalskis can't stand not talking to one another.
Who else is gonna listen to them?
What was that?
It was nothing.
It was just- there was a piece of hair in her face.
You let him touch you?
You told me you thought he was disgusting.
- You said that?
- No, I-- okay, I kinda did, but--
- Thanks.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Hey, hey, come on.
Richie, calm down.
You want me to calm down when you're sleeping with my sister behind my back?
- Keep your voice down!
- Can we talk about this?
Yeah, after I kick your ass.
Don't be ridiculous.
You're not kicking anyone's ass.
- I'm not fighting you.
- Richie, damn it!
Stop it!
Damn it!
Richie, get off him!
You don't know what he's been saying about you!
Not one word was about her!
- Bullshit!
- That's enough!
Richard, in the car.
You too, Brody.
Does your mother know about this?
Okay, open your eyes.
[Gasps] Oh!
[Laughs]
Mackie, that's wonderful!
Now, we can play around with the colors, switch things around.
Oh, no, no, no.
That's beautiful.
Oh, my gosh!
[Both laugh]
Hey.
Oh!
Oh, wow, that looks great!
I know, right?
And--and--and I have, um,
I have a business plan and everything was Mackie's idea.
Oh!
[Laughter]
- Are you all right?
- What?
You ran in here like your hair was on fire.
Uh, well, first of all, you need to know everyone's okay.
Okay, now you're scaring me.
No, no, no, it's not scary.
I just had to take dad down to IA to ask him some questions, so he might be a little late.
You had to arrest your father?
No, no.
It's a long story.
There was a murder.
You think your father killed someone?
No, mom, no.
A woman died at the house where dad plays poker.
- The Blind Bowlers?
- So you do know about that.
Well, of course I do.
Why wouldn't I?
No reason.
Abby, you have to know, your father would not be involved in anything shameful.
Yes, I do.
[Laughs]
So there's no way Lieutenant Bob Barcelli would be in possession of a key?
No.
To your knowledge, has Barcelli ever been inside the house?
Why are you asking me about Lieutenant Barcelli?
Is it because of his connection to my father?
Just because he was a rookie under my father 100 years ago doesn't mean that I am or ever have been friends with him, so I suggest you move on to another question.
Were you at the house last night, Sergeant Kowalski?
- No.
- Do you know who was?
- No.
We don't have a sign-in sheet.
Can you give us the names of everyone who is a member of the house?
Is that why I'm here?
Because I'm the father of one of your detectives,
I should provide you with all the information you need so you don't have to work for it?
Send Detective Kowalski in, please.
We just have a few more--
Unless you're gonna suspend me or compel me to answer your questions,
I would like to speak with my daughter.
[Sighs]
[Sighs]
I don't pretend to understand why you took this job, but what I will not do is be used in any way, shape, or form because you're my daughter.
That's not what they were doing.
You may not think so, but yes, that's exactly what they were doing.
[Sighs]
So, what do you want to know?
Have you ever seen this woman before at the house?
She works as a stripper at the Furry Corral.
- No.
Did she have a record?
- Yes.
Once for solicitation.
We have two rules.
No hookers and no one with a record allowed in.
Well, someone obviously broke that rule.
This woman was found strangled to death early this morning and someone in that house was involved.
I don't believe it.
I'm telling you, there's a murderer among you.
You may not want to believe it, but we have strong evidence that says otherwise.
I'm gonna need the name of every cop with a key to that house.
I'm also gonna need yours.
So, we have a list of all the cops who have keys to the house.
Mind telling us why you didn't mention you were part of the Blind Bowlers?
Never came up.
In case you haven't noticed,
I've been investigating a homicide.
- So have we.
- No, no, no.
You guys are on a witch hunt for a cop.
A cop who may have killed Candy.
Listen, while you guys were out harassing Chicago's finest,
I was out there, solving a case.
Meaning?
Meaning we've already got a suspect in custody.
A suspect?
Who?
- Charles Murray, aka Bishop.
- Candy's ex-pimp?
Just signed a confession 20 minutes ago, so as you can see, I was, uh, kind of busy to come down to your little cop tea party.
So Bishop killed Candy in a houseful of cops?
Yeah, said it was an ef you to the cops for taking away what was his.
And if you don't believe me, you can check the tapes.
Oh, yeah, you can talk to him yourself if you want.
He's down in holding right now.
I almost forgot.
We're gonna need your key.
- What key?
- Your key to the house.
What's my key got to do with anything?
I just told you, we got a confession out of Bishop.
We've collected all 19.
There's one missing.
Yours.
[Clears throat]
Now, are we done?
Hey, can we talk?
[Sighs] No.
Then can you listen?
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to talk about it.
I won't even allow myself to even think about the thousands of times you've bragged about some chick.
It conjures up images of my sister.
I just want to bash your head in.
Not once was I talking about Abby.
The blond with big boobs who blew you to paradise?
That wasn't your sister.
So you were with all these other women while you were screwing my sister?
No, it's not like that.
I really like Abby.
Please.
You like her so much you're hooking up with other women behind her back?
It was your sister that didn't want any ties, okay?
I was just trying to respect it.
Respect?
That's ridiculous.
How about showing your partner some respect, huh?
- How long were you two--?
- Oh, seriously?
- How long?
- Six months.
I think you're making way too big of a deal out of this.
You should have told me.
It wasn't my secret to tell.
Yes it was, damn it!
You were my partner!
Were?
[Locker door slams]
[Sighs]
I put in a request for a new partner.
- Thanks for helping my mom out.
- Oh, my pleasure.
You're so lucky to have a mom like her.
I know.
She's pretty amazing.
Hmm!
That's an understatement.
Do you have any idea how great it is to be able to tell your mom anything and not have her judge you for it?
I didn't tell her about Brody.
- Why didn't you tell her?
- I don't know.
I do.
You don't want her to know that you're not this hopeless romantic you pretend to be because you're actually a horny-ass nymph.
- Are you still drunk?
- What?
The two empty wine bottles pretty much gave you away.
Seriously, what were you thinking, getting my mom drunk in the middle of the day?
Okay, first of all, it takes a little more than a few glasses of white wine to get me drunk.
And secondly, it was your mom who was doing all the pouring.
Mackie.
I promise it will never happen again.
Thank you.
[Laughs]
Richie, it's me again.
Can you please call me back?
We need to talk.
- Is your brother still pissed?
- Yes.
So you're not allowed to date someone your brother knows?
Yeah, of course.
It's more complicated.
Okay, I was embarrassed.
Why?
He's cute.
It was just sex.
So you're a ho?
No.
Abby, lighten up.
It's okay to just want sex.
I know.
I just don't want a relationship right now.
I don't have the time for it.
I don't know how you do it.
I have a damn good man that has my back.
- That's not what I meant.
- Look, you make choices.
I could stay home, but that wouldn't benefit my husband or my kids.
I'm just not made that way.
[Phone ringing]
Criminalist report came back from the cop house.
Fibers from Candy's clothing were found inside that room.
So do we still think Bishop had something to do with her murder?
And what happened after that?
She broke away from me and she ran towards the window.
She pulled away and fell into the window.
I tried pulling her back in, but--
Bishop, did you kill Michelle Kane?
Yeah.
Ye--yes.
Yeah, I did.
Do we believe him?
Why would Bishop take Candy to a cop house?
How did he even get in?
And what does he keep looking at?
You mean, who?
[Sighs] Hanning's partner, Martinez?
Bishop looked scared to death.
You saw Martinez.
Would those boyish looks scare you?
Who else would be in the room?
Someone who has a vested interest in making sure Bishop keeps his mouth shut.
Barcelli?
Barcelli has an ironclad alibi.
What would he have to gain by coercing a confession out of Bishop?
That's what you need to find out.
[Phone rings]
Yeah.
None of this makes sense.
Hold on.
No need to talk to Bishop.
- Why?
- He's dead.
They just found him hanging in his cell.
So, Martinez was not in the room when Bishop confessed.
He was at his desk finishing up paperwork from his last case.
And listen to this.
Hanning and Martinez caught Candy's case three days into their last one.
Usually takes detectives two weeks to catch a new case.
Hanning obviously leapfrogged over a few detectives to make sure he was first again in the rotation.
Just got off with Carlos.
Bishop was telling the truth.
The night of Candy's murder, he was holed up all night with a new girl he deemed Tootsie Pop.
Hanning's file?
Back in 2008, he was cited for drunken misconduct at a bar.
In 2010, cops came out twice to his house on a domestic abuse charge.
Sounds like our cop has anger issues.
Find out if Hanning's covering his tracks or someone else's.
This makes no sense.
All 20 keys are here, including Hanning's.
[Key clinks on desktop]
How long has Hanning been a member of the Blind Bowlers?
Five years.
Does this keep look like it has five years' mileage on it?
Need more than a brand-new key to arrest his ass.
I have an idea.
Help me.
Wait a minute.
I've seen him in here before.
When's the last time he was in?
Maybe, what, three, four days ago?
He pays for a lot of privates.
I danced for him a couple times, but he was sweet on Candy's cherry pop.
Did Candy ever turn him down, seem nervous around him?
No.
No, she liked the attention.
But when she was busy, especially with Barcelli, he'd get irritated and leave.
Barcelli?
Was Hanning a part of Barcelli's crew of cops that came through here?
Yeah, but most times he'd just wait till Barcelli left and then shuffle to the stage and plunk down cash for Candy to work the pole.
Was Candy with Barcelli before she left the other night?
Uh, yeah, but it was weird.
They were in the corner, talking, and Barcelli's not big on conversation.
Hey, see you later.
What the hell is going on?
We have a warrant to search your vehicle.
- What for?
- Just pop the trunk.
You want my trunk open, you call my Lieutenant.
In fact, I'll call him myself.
Please do.
We'll wait.
There.
Thanks for your time, Detective.
Wait.
I think we'll take that Lieutenant's number now.
Hey.
- We need to talk.
- No, we don't.
You can't ignore me forever.
Yeah, well, I can try.
Richie, who I see is none--
"See"?
Really?
That's what you're gonna call it?
Okay, you need to stop acting like some sort of Saint, because I know your past.
You were a dog and I never once judged you for it.
I didn't sleep with your partner.
You slept with my best friend in high school.
- Debbie told you that?
- Yeah.
Well, you know what?
It's different.
Oh, right.
Because you're a guy?
No, because I was in high school.
You're 30 years old.
It doesn't change the fact that I didn't judge you.
I didn't feel what Brody and I were was something you needed to know about.
I didn't want to make it complicated.
Abby, Brody's my partner.
He's got my back.
You're my sister.
I care about you.
I mean, those facts alone make it complicated.
Look, I'm not sorry I slept with Brody, but I am sorry I kept it from you.
I don't know what else to say.
Are we gonna get past this?
[Sighs]
Yeah, probably.
But just don't ever lie to me again, okay?
Well, I didn't really lie to you.
Abby.
What's going on?
- Hanning's dead.
- What?
What happened?
Apparently he got shot trying to escape police custody.
He was cuffed.
How did he get away?
The Lieutenant thinks it was a setup.
By who, Barcelli?
It seems the two cops involved in the shooting have possible ties with Barcelli.
- Then let's get on it.
- No need.
Already sent Jones and Fash.
You two have done enough.
Just give me your report by the morning.
Great job, by the way.
[Exhales] So that's it?
Yeah, we did our jobs.
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.
Whoa.
Brotha cleans up well, don't he?
- This is a surprise.
- Yeah.
Well, I finished my report early and came over here to entice you to come home with me.
No enticement necessary.
I was just leaving.
We got the bad guy.
One of the bad guys.
Let it go, Abby.
You did good.
I'll see you in the morning.
- Quit--put this right there.
- I can't.
- You can.
- No.
Goldilocks, I heard you solved Candy's murder.
Good for you.
So, when did you become such a son of a bitch?
See, my grandfather was a hard-ass, but he was a damn good cop, and there's no way he would have stood for the crap you pull so what made you turn?
Move along, baby.
Seems Detective Kowalski and I have some business here.
I've been cleared of Candy's murder, so what is it you've still got stuck up your butt?
We know Hanning was one of your guys.
He was my friend.
Did you have Hanning killed because he was screwing Candy behind your back or because he was stupid enough to have her killed in a houseful of cops?
Both.
That's what you want me to say, right?
But what evidence could you possibly have?
My gut, and my gut says you sent Candy after Hanning's key.
Entrance to the cop house is generational or by invitation only.
I did a bit of digging, Bob, and you've been turned down twice in the last year.
That's got to hurt.
So what would I get by having that key?
Plant a camera.
Catch a good cop doing bad.
That's how you get these cops under your thumb, isn't it?
Get something on them, use it against them.
You're good, but eventually you're gonna make a mistake, and when you do, I will be there to nail your ass to the wall.
Consider me warned, Detective Kowalski.
[Knock on door]
Hey.
- Hey.
- Everything okay?
I came to apologize.
I never meant for this to ruin yours and Richie's partnership.
No, no, it's not your fault.
- Yes, it is.
It was my idea to keep it a secret, so--
He just needs some time to wrap his head around it.
And I'm just glad it's out in the open now.
We don't have to keep it a secret.
I mean, it's a good thing, right?
I think we should take a break.
So this was never about Richie.
I mean, come on, Abby.
Be honest with me.
I was honest with you.
I said at the start I didn't want a relationship.
I know, you did.
Neither did I.
But things changed.
I want to take you on a date and give this thing a shot.
I mean, you already agreed.
Technically, I didn't.
Can I take a rain check?
Okay.
I'm gonna hold you to it, though, Kowalski.
Oh, Mackie's good.
She's really good.
And she's gonna quit her day job.
Oh, I've been trying to get her to do that for years.
She spends one afternoon with you, she throws caution to the wind.
She's a good egg.
She thinks the same about you.
Mm-mm.
[Sighs]
So, Brody, huh?
Who told you?
Your father.
- I'm sorry I didn't.
- Oh, honey, please.
Mothers and daughters don't tell each other every detail.
Especially about sex.
I know.
Still--
I was just happy to hear that you have a sex life.
- Mother!
- What?
Well, I mean, I'm just-- I'm just saying.
I--
You're terrible.
[Sighs]
[Laughs]

Previously on The Secret Circle...
My sweet Cassie, you finding this means I'm gone, and for that I am so sorry.
I didn't want you to have this life, but destiny's not easy to run from.
Hi.
I'm Diana.
- You seen her yet?
- She got in yesterday.
- We're different.
- You're different.
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded 100% witch.
Here we have real power now.
A complete circle is 6.
You complete the circle.
She's got the gift.
You can get Cassie to do what we need?
The circle will take care of that without even knowing it.
There was a guy in Nick's yard last night.
It must have been his older brother Jake.
He left town a couple of years ago.
He was a troubled young man.
- What do you want?
- Your blood.
Aah!
Get off of her.
We did a spell together to send her away.
So, you know you're a witch.
Your dad told me about you and Cassie being destined to be together.
I've been standing on the sidelines watching it since she got here.
I can't do that anymore.
I've come here to rid Chance Harbor of witches, and I will not fail.
What do you think?
Those are ancient artifacts, not a Halloween costume.
Whatever.
I'm a sexy witch Doctor.
Take it off.
We shouldn't be drawing attention to ourselves.
Relax, it's Halloween.
We're just blending in with all the supernatural wannabes.
And is there a more perfect place for party decorations?
Uh, no, we're not having a party.
Just a get-together.
That was the deal.
My grandmother's only gone for the night.
I know.
And I'm impressed that you agreed without me having to resort to blackmail.
No, I just...
I think it'll be a good break for us.
Halloween's the night to pretend you're someone else, right?
Sluttier versions of someone else, but I get your point.
And maybe it'll be good for Adam and Diana.
Is that what this is about?
You feel bad about breaking them up, and now, you're throwing a party to lure them back together?
No, I did not break them up.
I think that the best way to cover up the fact that you tried to steal her boyfriend is to get one of your own.
How about Luke?
I...pfft!
No.
I blew my chance when I became the world's worst dance date.
Ecch.
Luke.
Hi.
So, Cassie's having a party tonight, and she would love for you to come.
No, it is just a...a get-together.
And I totally understand if you don't want to, or if you have other, better plans.
Sure.
Ok.
So, I'll see you tonight?
See you then.
And now, you have a hot guy to flirt with at the party.
Done.
So what about you?
I have a target in mind.
- Jake?
- Maybe.
Let me change out of these artifacts.
Will you buy this for me?
As a reward for being so helpful?
Um, hmm.
Hi.
Happy Halloween.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Blake?
Any relation to Amelia Blake?
She was my mother.
Well.

Wilson's.
It's been there as long as I can remember.
The guy who owns the place seemed to know me.
Or at least knew mom.
Calvin Wilson.
Is he one of us?
A witch?
Yes.
Why, did he say something to you?
No.
I touched his hand by mistake, and then, the mirror behind him shattered.
It was really strange.
Residual power and active power crossing.
It could've just been a random surge.
How many witches are there in Chance Harbor?
Hard to know exactly.
People tend to be private about it.
But a lot less than there used to be.
After the fire, everyone stopped practicing.
Many families left town.
Right.
Like us.
I'd better get going to Henry's lake house.
It's a long drive.
You sure you're going to be ok here?
Absolutely.
Henry's an elder, isn't he?
Well, I just thought that you didn't want to tell anyone that we'd bound the circle, especially elders.
I'm not going to tell him about the circle.
But I haven't heard from him in weeks, and I'm worried.
You have friends coming to stay with you here, right?
Yeah.
All the girls will be here.
We're going to do a low-key Halloween thing, like hand out candy to trick-or-treaters and watch some movies.
Good.
Bye, grandma.
Morning.
Thought you'd still be sleeping it off.
I'm fine.
The keys to the boathouse weren't on the hook.
You forget to put them back, I guess.
Sorry about that.
And I appreciate the concern, but I'm fine.
Do you remember that Diana broke up with me 'cause you told her how Cassie and I were written in the stars?
I know it's hard to understand.
No, I understand perfectly.
Since you've already ruined your life, you've decided to destroy mine.
That's not fair.
Diana loved me.
And the more I tried to be worthy of it, the better I got, and the further I got from being you.
I don't want you to be me either.
Trust me.
But messing with fate will get you there faster than you know.
Please stop using fate as an excuse for what you did to mom.
Did you ever even love her?
'Cause the way you talk about Amelia, it doesn't seem like it.
You got a lot of great stuff.
Thanks for coming over to help set up.
No problem.
I love Halloween.
And I could use the distraction.
Have you and Adam talked at all since the wake?
No.
I wish I could help somehow...
I don't even want to talk about it.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Oh, of course.
Sorry.
Ok.
I know there's a big bag of plastic cups somewhere in here.
What is that?
Uh, zombie?
Got it from the drama club.
This is just the beginning.
There's a trunkload of stuff.
Faye invited them so they'd let us take as much as we wanted.
Oh, my God.
What's wrong?
This is part of the blade that girl used to attack me.
It must have broken off.
It looks old.
That's the Crescent moon symbol she burned in the ground.
Hey.
Happy Halloween.
First one as a witch, very important.
Yes.
Thanks.
Uh, I found something.
What is it?
It's a piece of the weapon that girl used to attack me.
Found it in the kitchen.
Where are you taking it?
Just the antiquities shop by the boardwalk.
Thought I'd try to figure out what it is and what these two symbols mean.
You sure that's a good idea?
It might tip off who you really are.
And that witch is gone, so there's not much to do about it, anyway.
I told you the night she died that there's too much I don't know about witchcraft.
It's time I learned.
I don't want us to be sitting targets anymore.
I get that.
I'll be careful about what I tell him.
Don't worry.
Let me know how it goes.
I'll see you later?
Sorry, I'm closed for lunch.
Thought I locked up.
You did.
Calvin Wilson, right?
That's right.
I made a couple of calls and found out that the Wilsons have been around this area forever.
A long time.
Maybe you knew my parents?
Richard and Sara Armstrong?
No.
I didn't really know them, either.
I was pretty young when they died.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
But that's not why I came here.
Do you have any witch cruets?
Excuse me?
I have a few, but I'm always looking for more.
I use them for salad dressing, but apparently, they're meant for killing witches.
Is that right?
All you need is mandrake root and some blood.
Ahh!
And a personal item that's absorbed some of the witch's energy.
Please.
It's my wedding ring.
Then as long as the cruet's been spelled, all you have to do next is throw in a match, and ding dong, the witch is dead.
But you knew that, didn't you?
You're not a very powerful witch, are you, Calvin?
If Cassie Blake comes in here and asks any questions, all you're going to say is, "I don't know."
Got it?
Yes.
I swear it.
Great.
Probably best you don't carry these in your shop.
Dangerous things.
Mr. Wilson?
Oh.
You were here this morning.
I have something to show you.
I'm a little busy here.
Ok.
Well, can you just tell me what it is?
I don't know.
I wish I could be more helpful.
Hmm.
Ok.
Well, if you...if you think of anything, then, um...
I will write down my name and my number, and you can call me.
All right.
Oh, my God.
I...that was so dumb.
I'm sorry.
Can I help you clean it up?
Do you have, like, a broom or something?
Of course, I will pay for it.
Never mind.
I'll do it.
Jake.
You miss him, too?
Not exactly.
I'm here for them.
Look, you don't have to be all tough.
We both loved him.
I hadn't seen Nick in two years.
When I was living here, all we did was fight.
So take this trip down memory lane by yourself.
Wow.
Great Big Brother.
He was playing with things that he shouldn't have.
He wound up dead.
I could've told him.
But you weren't here to do that.
You just left.
So maybe this is on you.
You know, I actually thought we might be able to be friends, that we had something in common.
I'm nothing like the rest of you.
Trust me.
Ok.
See how close you can get to this one, the third symbol.
It could be an old crest.
People used to etch them into objects of all kinds.
It's like a family seal.
All right.
I recreated the images on the sketch pad app and ran a search.
Might take a few minutes to scan for matches.
I...
I called Diana, she should be here, too.
If she knows I'm here, she won't come.
I don't blame her.
Ever since I was little, my dad would talk about how he was supposed to be with Amelia, and how I'm fated to be with Amelia's daughter.
I should have known he'd say it to Diana, too.
But this breakup isn't his fault...it's mine.
The only reason Diana believed what he said is because it's the way I've been acting.
I'm sorry for anything I did to make that worse.
I don't know what's between you and me, exactly.
But I know that without Diana, I'm not much of anything.
Then you should fight for her.
Show her that.
Forbidden love.
So adorable.
Am I interrupting?
Uh, no, no.
Did you find anything in my book about the symbols on the blade?
No.
But I did find a cool attraction spell for future reference.
I got a match.
That's it.
Does it belong to any family name?
Not a family.
A society.
The Geticas, also known as "The Hunters."
This goes back all the way to the Middle Ages.
Hunters?
Its motto is from ancient text...
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
So the girl who attacked me wasn't a crazy witch.
She was a witch hunter.
Adam Conant...
Diana Meade...
Faye Chamberlain...
Melissa Glaser... and Cassie Blake.
As angry as you were at Simone for hurrying along the process, at least she did the marking.
Now you don't have to.
Simone ignored the plan.
She could have ruined everything.
If you kill a bound witch the wrong way, their powers can pass to other witches, make them stronger.
We can't afford mistakes.
Which is why some of us are worried about a plan that hinges on you.
Witchcraft took my parents and my brother.
I know which side I'm on.
Now, do you want me to do this or not?
Because if I don't spell these, they're just fancy bottles, and you're back to burning witches at the stake.
Go ahead.
Spell the vessels.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
It's done.
Add their blood, the objects, set it on fire, they die.
And their magic dies with them.
Good.
We can't risk outing you in the process.
So, we'll have some brothers at the party, doing the gathering for you.
Ian came with us from Salem.
And one of our hunters is from here in town.
He's very familiar with the targets.
That girl lied to you.
She wasn't a witch.
What are you talking about?
We found out what those symbols mean.
- And?
- She was a witch hunter.
Wait.
If she was a witch hunter, why would she bother lying to me?
I don't know.
Are you sure she didn't say anything else to you?
No, just exactly what I told you.
- Hmm.
- How do you know she wasn't just some crazy witch?
What else have you really got to go on?
Just those 3 symbols?
Um, I'll see you at the party tonight?
I might drop by.
Yeah.
You know, it's times like this I pity the normals.
They will never be this cool.
What else can we do?
Bats.
Take flight and dive.
Take flight and dive.
Ohh!
Aah!
Wow, nice work.
Um, hey, look, when Jake shows up, do you think you can keep him occupied?
Why do you think I'm wearing this?
Oh.
Right.
Wait, why do you want him occupied?
When I showed him the fleam, he knew that there were 3 symbols when mine was missing one.
He obviously knows more than he's telling us.
* give it, unh * * give it *
* give it * * feel the drums, the beat is loud * * you know how I do it, I rock the crowd * * back up, all you people like "wow" * * send a twitpic, try and copy my style *
* I have a feelin' I'll be up for a while * * people that don't know will give it up for a while *
* I'm loud, I'm loud, sticking'... *
You look...
Wow.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Have fun tonight.
Diana, wait.
Is this who we are now?
We don't even talk?
What's left that you want me to say?
Tell me how to fix this.
Adam, don't.
I love you.
So if I let you forget that...
Then let me try again.
I know we can work it out.
We shouldn't have to work so hard.
Not everything is perfect, Diana.
Sometimes...sometimes, things get a little out of control.
But that doesn't mean it's wrong.
Like Cassie?
Whiskey, neat, right?
Good memory.
I'm impressed.
Don't be.
What brings you across town?
Can't an old friend just stop by for a visit?
Not after 16 years, no.
Maybe I wasn't in your circle, but I never gave you a reason not to trust me.
You shouldn't have come here.
Well, it wasn't on the top of my list, either, but Amelia Blake's daughter came to my store this morning.
Really.
Why's that?
Thought you might know.
She was asking questions about some old hunting acquaintances of ours.
It's funny.
I couldn't see much of her mother in her, at first, not until she told me who she was.
You know how it is with kids.
It's hard to predict which parent they'll favor.
She's Amelia's daughter, Cal.
Are you sure?
'Cause you were always a bit blind when it came to Amelia.
We were all blind except Amelia, in the end.
She doesn't even know who her father really was, does she?
What he was attempting to do that night?
And there's no reason she should.
Why not?
Especially if she's as much like Amelia as you say.
Just leave it alone.
She needs to know about John Blackwell.
She has a right to protect herself.
* I turn it on, I set the tone *
* I don't know, I'm ready to go *
* I saw you waking up against the wall * * and I knew you were ready to go * * tonight, I'm a different guy * * forget about the things you know * * if you want to do it, we can do it right *
* I can see you coming whole * * 'cause you're ready to go * * is that a yes or a no?
* * 'cause you're ready to go * * is that a yes or a no?
* * 'cause I'm ready to go... *
There you are.
Hey...
Gangsta.
You made it.
Oh, and we match.
Kind of.
You're a...
B.B. Gun?
Mmm.
Killer bee, actually.
Um, but I was just about to go run and grab some more ice.
So I'll B.B. back in a sec.
* Ready to go *
Great costume.
Halloween's for kids.
I'm just here for the beer.
Come on.
Let me give you a tour.
Faye, no, not now.
Not now?
The old Jake didn't even know those words.
* Show me, this is it *
Faye?
* Go *
* I'm ready to go * * if you say so *
And this is her bedroom.
How sweet.
* If you say so, 'cause I'm ready to go *
* I'm ready to go if you say so *
* I'm ready to go if you say so *
Really, Faye?
In my bedroom?
What the hell is going on with you?
Come on, Faye.
Don't try and deny something's going on.
Is this going to be drama?
No.
No drama.
But something's different with you.
You were always an ass, and you always had a cruel streak.
But you were never distant.
Not when we were like this.
Maybe you just always thought there was more there, and there wasn't.
No.
I've felt it since you got back.
Looking for something?
Uh, just Nick's MP3 player, for Melissa.
You know, their songs?
I thought it might help her.
Did you think stabbing it to death would get her the closure she needs?
No.
But what else would you use it for?
Opening really thick letters?
Killing people?
Why do you have it?
It's not mine.
You're telling me this is Nick's?
I'm going to show you something.
But you can't tell anyone.
I know.
Nick was always into weird stuff, but I never expected this.
These symbols mean witch hunter.
Same as the girl had on her blade.
Why didn't you show me these?
To protect him.
I know how this looks.
He was no traitor.
No, of course not.
There's no way Nick was a witch hunter.
But she was, so... so, what's the connection?
I don't know yet.
Maybe Nick was looking into that witch hunter stuff and got on their radar.
You think Nick's the reason she came here?
Let me see the knife.
Well, isn't this creepy.
Is this what it takes to get you excited, a little girl with a knife?
Cassie, I can't find Melissa, we should get back.
I thought you were going to distract him.
I tried.
I didn't realize you were waiting for him in his room.
No, I was looking for something.
But then, I found something else.
Oh!
Hello?
Cassie, my name is Calvin Wilson.
We met at my shop earlier today.
Of course.
I left something for you.
You're in danger.
In danger?
What do you mean?
Mr. Wilson?
Mr. Wilson.
No costume on Halloween?
Hello?
Mr. Wilson?
Sorry.
No problem.
I think I got something on your face.
May I?
Was my warning not specific enough?
I wasn't going to tell her anything about you.
Remember this?
I had a feeling you'd try to be a hero.
Please.
This is just something personal.
It doesn't concern you.
Try me.
All right.
She has dark magic inside her.
So why are you so desperate to tell her?
So she can fight it.
Maybe stop it from overcoming her.
You think people can change who they are?
Of course.
I don't.
Out.
Now.
Oh, hey, Adam.
Have you found Melissa and Diana?
Because the guy I met at the antiquities shop called, freaked out, and I think he was trying to warn me about w...
Luke?
You bleed just like us.
But you're not.
That's enough.
Finish the cruet.
- What's going on?
- Witch hunters.
This is a ring of iron sulphide to stop your powers.
Science prevailing over your ungodly magic.
We haven't done anything wrong.
But you will.
Luke, please.
Stop this.
Tell him that we're not a threat.
You bound your circle, Cassie.
No one to blame but yourselves.
So you've been spying on us all this time, just to narc to other witch hunters?
Like my father did.
And his father.
You aren't the only ones born into a legacy.
At least I can be proud of mine.
Enough.
Finish it.
"Watch the witch, but never trust him,
"for his every thought is a sin, his every word a lie."
You have to stop this.
You shouldn't be here.
Cassie has dark magic.
All magic is dark.
Not like this.
Cassie isn't like other witches, Isaac.
She's stronger.
We can't kill her this way.
You have to trust me.
You've become a great asset to me.
But you are too close to this.
I won't stop it.
Luke, don't.
Look, Luke, I'm your friend.
That's why I wanted to be the one to do this.
I'm freeing you from a life of sin.
That's not true.
I'm sorry, Diana.
You have a good heart, but it's not enough to protect you from your true nature.
This will be fast.
I promise.
No!
Oh my God.
Trust me now?
Are you ok?
A guy...a guy in a pig mask jumped me and brought me here.
I fought him off.
Where did he go?
There was an explosion from inside, and he ran off.
Another guy came running out, too.
What happened in there?
It's me.
It's ok.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
I was worried.
It's ok.
I'm ok.
When he had your blood...
I know.
It's all so real now.
My whole life, everyone said,
"there's that kid who lost his mom.
How sad."
But you can't lose something you never had.
Every day, my dad pulls away a little more.
You are my home, Diana.
Maybe I'm just supposed to just let you go now, but I can't.
Because I can't lose everything I have all at once.
I want to get past this.
I know not everything can be perfect.
But I have to believe that it can be, just so fighting for it makes sense.
And you're not a believer?
Not right now.
You look a little rattled.
Oh.
I just...how can there be people out there that hate us so much, you know?
It's like, we haven't done anything.
We didn't choose this.
We were...we were born this way.
People don't understand.
What they don't understand scares them.
You seem so calm about it all.
I've been at this longer than you.
Have you ever done magic on your own?
I...
I think I did something on my own tonight.
Really?
I think I stopped one of those witch hunters from killing Diana.
That's a pretty good trick.
So, why didn't they round you up with the rest of us?
Don't trust me, huh?
Not really.
That's ok.
I don't mind having to earn it.
Mmm.
Good luck with that.
Henry?
Henry, it's Jane.
You here?

Previously on The Secret Circle...
My sweet Cassie, you finding this means I'm gone, and for that I am so sorry.
I didn't want you to have this life, but destiny's not easy to run from.
Hi.
I'm Diana.
- You seen her yet?
- She got in yesterday.
- We're different.
- You're different.
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded 100% witch.
Here we have real power now.
A complete circle is 6.
You complete the circle.
She's got the gift.
You can get Cassie to do what we need?
The circle will take care of that without even knowing it.
There was a guy in Nick's yard last night.
It must have been his older brother Jake.
He left town a couple of years ago.
He was a troubled young man.
- What do you want?
- Your blood.
Aah!
Get off of her.
We did a spell together to send her away.
So, you know you're a witch.
Your dad told me about you and Cassie being destined to be together.
I've been standing on the sidelines watching it since she got here.
I can't do that anymore.
I've come here to rid Chance Harbor of witches, and I will not fail.
What do you think?
Those are ancient artifacts, not a Halloween costume.
Whatever.
I'm a sexy witch Doctor.
Take it off.
We shouldn't be drawing attention to ourselves.
Relax, it's Halloween.
We're just blending in with all the supernatural wannabes.
And is there a more perfect place for party decorations?
Uh, no, we're not having a party.
Just a get-together.
That was the deal.
My grandmother's only gone for the night.
I know.
And I'm impressed that you agreed without me having to resort to blackmail.
No, I just-
- I think it'll be a good break for us.
Halloween's the night to pretend you're someone else, right?
Sluttier versions of someone else, but I get your point.
And maybe it'll be good for Adam and Diana.
Is that what this is about?
You feel bad about breaking them up, and now, you're throwing a party to lure them back together?
No, I did not break them up.
I think that the best way to cover up the fact that you tried to steal her boyfriend is to get one of your own.
How about Luke?
I--pfft!
No.
I blew my chance when I became the world's worst dance date.
Ecch.
Luke.
Hi.
So, Cassie's having a party tonight, and she would love for you to come.
No, it is just a--a get-together.
And I totally understand if you don't want to, or if you have other, better plans.
Sure.
Ok.
So, I'll see you tonight?
See you then.
And now, you have a hot guy to flirt with at the party.
Done.
So what about you?
I have a target in mind.
- Jake?
- Maybe.
Let me change out of these artifacts.
Will you buy this for me?
As a reward for being so helpful?
Um, hmm.
Hi.
Happy Halloween.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Blake?
Any relation to Amelia Blake?
She was my mother.
Well.

Wilson's.
It's been there as long as I can remember.
The guy who owns the place seemed to know me.
Or at least knew mom.
Calvin Wilson.
Is he one of us?
A witch?
Yes.
Why, did he say something to you?
No.
I touched his hand by mistake, and then, the mirror behind him shattered.
It was really strange.
Residual power and active power crossing.
It could've just been a random surge.
How many witches are there in Chance Harbor?
Hard to know exactly.
People tend to be private about it.
But a lot less than there used to be.
After the fire, everyone stopped practicing.
Many families left town.
Right.
Like us.
I'd better get going to Henry's lake house.
It's a long drive.
You sure you're going to be ok here?
Absolutely.
Henry's an elder, isn't he?
Well, I just thought that you didn't want to tell anyone that we'd bound the circle, especially elders.
I'm not going to tell him about the circle.
But I haven't heard from him in weeks, and I'm worried.
You have friends coming to stay with you here, right?
Yeah.
All the girls will be here.
We're going to do a low-key Halloween thing, like hand out candy to trick-or-treaters and watch some movies.
Good.
Bye, grandma.
Morning.
Thought you'd still be sleeping it off.
I'm fine.
The keys to the boathouse weren't on the hook.
You forget to put them back, I guess.
Sorry about that.
And I appreciate the concern, but I'm fine.
Do you remember that Diana broke up with me 'cause you told her how Cassie and I were written in the stars?
I know it's hard to understand.
No, I understand perfectly.
Since you've already ruined your life, you've decided to destroy mine.
That's not fair.
Diana loved me.
And the more I tried to be worthy of it, the better I got, and the further I got from being you.
I don't want you to be me either.
Trust me.
But messing with fate will get you there faster than you know.
Please stop using fate as an excuse for what you did to mom.
Did you ever even love her?
'Cause the way you talk about Amelia, it doesn't seem like it.
You got a lot of great stuff.
Thanks for coming over to help set up.
No problem.
I love Halloween.
And I could use the distraction.
Have you and Adam talked at all since the wake?
No.
I wish I could help somehow--
I don't even want to talk about it.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Oh, of course.
Sorry.
Ok.
I know there's a big bag of plastic cups somewhere in here.
What is that?
Uh, zombie?
Got it from the drama club.
This is just the beginning.
There's a trunkload of stuff.
Faye invited them so they'd let us take as much as we wanted.
Oh, my God.
What's wrong?
This is part of the blade that girl used to attack me.
It must have broken off.
It looks old.
That's the Crescent moon symbol she burned in the ground.
Hey.
Happy Halloween.
First one as a witch, very important.
Yes.
Thanks.
Uh, I found something.
What is it?
It's a piece of the weapon that girl used to attack me.
Found it in the kitchen.
Where are you taking it?
Just the antiquities shop by the boardwalk.
Thought I'd try to figure out what it is and what these two symbols mean.
You sure that's a good idea?
It might tip off who you really are.

No.
But I did find a cool attraction spell for future reference.
I got a match.
That's it.
Does it belong to any family name?
Not a family.
A society.
The Geticas, also known as "The Hunters."
This goes back all the way to the Middle Ages.
Hunters?
Its motto is from ancient text--
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
So the girl who attacked me wasn't a crazy witch.
She was a witch hunter.
Adam Conant...
Diana Meade...
Faye Chamberlain...
Melissa Glaser... and Cassie Blake.
As angry as you were at Simone for hurrying along the process, at least she did the marking.
Now you don't have to.
Simone ignored the plan.
She could have ruined everything.
If you kill a bound witch the wrong way, their powers can pass to other witches, make them stronger.
We can't afford mistakes.
Which is why some of us are worried about a plan that hinges on you.
Witchcraft took my parents and my brother.
I know which side I'm on.
Now, do you want me to do this or not?
Because if I don't spell these, they're just fancy bottles, and you're back to burning witches at the stake.
Go ahead.
Spell the vessels.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
It's done.
Add their blood, the objects, set it on fire, they die.
And their magic dies with them.
Good.
We can't risk outing you in the process.
So, we'll have some brothers at the party, doing the gathering for you.
Ian came with us from Salem.
And one of our hunters is from here in town.
He's very familiar with the targets.
That girl lied to you.
She wasn't a witch.
What are you talking about?
We found out what those symbols mean.
- And?
- She was a witch hunter.
Wait.
If she was a witch hunter, why would she bother lying to me?
I don't know.
Are you sure she didn't say anything else to you?
No, just exactly what I told you.
- Hmm.
- How do you know she wasn't just some crazy witch?
What else have you really got to go on?
Just those 3 symbols?
Um, I'll see you at the party tonight?
I might drop by.
Yeah.
You know, it's times like this I pity the normals.
They will never be this cool.
What else can we do?
Bats.
Take flight and dive.
Take flight and dive.
Ohh!
Aah!
Wow, nice work.
Um, hey, look, when Jake shows up, do you think you can keep him occupied?
Why do you think I'm wearing this?
Oh.
Right.
Wait, why do you want him occupied?
When I showed him the fleam, he knew that there were 3 symbols when mine was missing one.
He obviously knows more than he's telling us.

Diana, wait.
Is this who we are now?
We don't even talk?
What's left that you want me to say?
Tell me how to fix this.
Adam, don't.
I love you.
So if I let you forget that...
Then let me try again.
I know we can work it out.
We shouldn't have to work so hard.
Not everything is perfect, Diana.
Sometimes--sometimes, things get a little out of control.
But that doesn't mean it's wrong.
Like Cassie?
Whiskey, neat, right?
Good memory.
I'm impressed.
Don't be.
What brings you across town?
Can't an old friend just stop by for a visit?
Not after 16 years, no.
Maybe I wasn't in your circle, but I never gave you a reason not to trust me.
You shouldn't have come here.
Well, it wasn't on the top of my list, either, but Amelia Blake's daughter came to my store this morning.
Really.
Why's that?
Thought you might know.
She was asking questions about some old hunting acquaintances of ours.
It's funny.
I couldn't see much of her mother in her, at first, not until she told me who she was.
You know how it is with kids.
It's hard to predict which parent they'll favor.
She's Amelia's daughter, Cal.
Are you sure?
'Cause you were always a bit blind when it came to Amelia.
We were all blind except Amelia, in the end.
She doesn't even know who her father really was, does she?
What he was attempting to do that night?
And there's no reason she should.
Why not?
Especially if she's as much like Amelia as you say.
Just leave it alone.
She needs to know about John Blackwell.
She has a right to protect herself.

Really, Faye?
In my bedroom?
What the hell is going on with you?
Come on, Faye.
Don't try and deny something's going on.
Is this going to be drama?
No.
No drama.
But something's different with you.
You were always an ass, and you always had a cruel streak.
But you were never distant.
Not when we were like this.
Maybe you just always thought there was more there, and there wasn't.
No.
I've felt it since you got back.
Looking for something?
Uh, just Nick's MP3 player, for Melissa.
You know, their songs?
I thought it might help her.
Did you think stabbing it to death would get her the closure she needs?
No.
But what else would you use it for?
Opening really thick letters?
Killing people?
Why do you have it?
It's not mine.
You're telling me this is Nick's?
I'm going to show you something.
But you can't tell anyone.
I know.
Nick was always into weird stuff, but I never expected this.
These symbols mean witch hunter.
Same as the girl had on her blade.
Why didn't you show me these?
To protect him.
I know how this looks.
He was no traitor.
No, of course not.
There's no way Nick was a witch hunter.
But she was, so-- so, what's the connection?
I don't know yet.
Maybe Nick was looking into that witch hunter stuff and got on their radar.
You think Nick's the reason she came here?
Let me see the knife.
Well, isn't this creepy.
Is this what it takes to get you excited, a little girl with a knife?
Cassie, I can't find Melissa, we should get back.
I thought you were going to distract him.
I tried.
I didn't realize you were waiting for him in his room.
No, I was looking for something.
But then, I found something else.
Oh!
Hello?
Cassie, my name is Calvin Wilson.
We met at my shop earlier today.
Of course.
I left something for you.
You're in danger.
In danger?
What do you mean?
Mr. Wilson?
Mr. Wilson.
No costume on Halloween?
Hello?
Mr. Wilson?
Sorry.
No problem.
I think I got something on your face.
May I?
Was my warning not specific enough?
I wasn't going to tell her anything about you.
Remember this?
I had a feeling you'd try to be a hero.
Please.
This is just something personal.
It doesn't concern you.
Try me.
All right.
She has dark magic inside her.
So why are you so desperate to tell her?
So she can fight it.
Maybe stop it from overcoming her.
You think people can change who they are?
Of course.
I don't.
Out.
Now.
Oh, hey, Adam.
Have you found Melissa and Diana?
Because the guy I met at the antiquities shop called, freaked out, and I think he was trying to warn me about w--
Luke?
You bleed just like us.
But you're not.
That's enough.
Finish the cruet.
- What's going on?
- Witch hunters.
This is a ring of iron sulphide to stop your powers.
Science prevailing over your ungodly magic.
We haven't done anything wrong.
But you will.
Luke, please.
Stop this.
Tell him that we're not a threat.
You bound your circle, Cassie.
No one to blame but yourselves.
So you've been spying on us all this time, just to narc to other witch hunters?
Like my father did.
And his father.
You aren't the only ones born into a legacy.
At least I can be proud of mine.
Enough.
Finish it.
"Watch the witch, but never trust him,
"for his every thought is a sin, his every word a lie."
You have to stop this.
You shouldn't be here.
Cassie has dark magic.
All magic is dark.
Not like this.
Cassie isn't like other witches, Isaac.
She's stronger.
We can't kill her this way.
You have to trust me.
You've become a great asset to me.
But you are too close to this.
I won't stop it.
Luke, don't.
Look, Luke, I'm your friend.
That's why I wanted to be the one to do this.
I'm freeing you from a life of sin.
That's not true.
I'm sorry, Diana.
You have a good heart, but it's not enough to protect you from your true nature.
This will be fast.
I promise.
No!
Oh my God.
Trust me now?
Are you ok?
A guy--a guy in a pig mask jumped me and brought me here.
I fought him off.
Where did he go?
There was an explosion from inside, and he ran off.
Another guy came running out, too.
What happened in there?
It's me.
It's ok.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
I was worried.
It's ok.
I'm ok.
When he had your blood...
I know.
It's all so real now.
My whole life, everyone said,
"there's that kid who lost his mom.
How sad."
But you can't lose something you never had.
Every day, my dad pulls away a little more.
You are my home, Diana.
Maybe I'm just supposed to just let you go now, but I can't.
Because I can't lose everything I have all at once.
I want to get past this.
I know not everything can be perfect.
But I have to believe that it can be, just so fighting for it makes sense.
And you're not a believer?
Not right now.
You look a little rattled.
Oh.
I just--how can there be people out there that hate us so much, you know?
It's like, we haven't done anything.
We didn't choose this.
We were--we were born this way.
People don't understand.
What they don't understand scares them.
You seem so calm about it all.
I've been at this longer than you.
Have you ever done magic on your own?
I...
I think I did something on my own tonight.
Really?
I think I stopped one of those witch hunters from killing Diana.
That's a pretty good trick.
So, why didn't they round you up with the rest of us?
Don't trust me, huh?
Not really.
That's ok.
I don't mind having to earn it.
Mmm.
Good luck with that.
Henry?
Henry, it's Jane.
You here?

Previously on The Secret Circle...
My sweet Cassie, you finding this means I'm gone, and for that I am so sorry.
I didn't want you to have this life, but destiny's not easy to run from.
Hi.
I'm Diana.
- You seen her yet?
- She got in yesterday.
- We're different.
- You're different.
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded 100% witch.
Here we have real power now.
A complete circle is 6.
You complete the circle.
She's got the gift.
You can get Cassie to do what we need?
The circle will take care of that without even knowing it.
There was a guy in Nick's yard last night.
It must have been his older brother Jake.
He left town a couple of years ago.
He was a troubled young man.
- What do you want?
- Your blood.
Aah!
Get off of her.
We did a spell together to send her away.
So, you know you're a witch.
Your dad told me about you and Cassie being destined to be together.
I've been standing on the sidelines watching it since she got here.
I can't do that anymore.
I've come here to rid Chance Harbor of witches, and I will not fail.
What do you think?
Those are ancient artifacts, not a Halloween costume.
Whatever.
I'm a sexy witch Doctor.
Take it off.
We shouldn't be drawing attention to ourselves.
Relax, it's Halloween.
We're just blending in with all the supernatural wannabes.
And is there a more perfect place for party decorations?
Uh, no, we're not having a party.
Just a get-together.
That was the deal.
My grandmother's only gone for the night.
I know.
And I'm impressed that you agreed without me having to resort to blackmail.
No, I just-
- I think it'll be a good break for us.
Halloween's the night to pretend you're someone else, right?
Sluttier versions of someone else, but I get your point.
And maybe it'll be good for Adam and Diana.
Is that what this is about?
You feel bad about breaking them up, and now, you're throwing a party to lure them back together?
No, I did not break them up.
I think that the best way to cover up the fact that you tried to steal her boyfriend is to get one of your own.
How about Luke?
I--pfft!
No.
I blew my chance when I became the world's worst dance date.
Ecch.
Luke.
Hi.
So, Cassie's having a party tonight, and she would love for you to come.
No, it is just a--a get-together.
And I totally understand if you don't want to, or if you have other, better plans.
Sure.
Ok.
So, I'll see you tonight?
See you then.
And now, you have a hot guy to flirt with at the party.
Done.
So what about you?
I have a target in mind.
- Jake?
- Maybe.
Let me change out of these artifacts.
Will you buy this for me?
As a reward for being so helpful?
Um, hmm.
Hi.
Happy Halloween.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Blake?
Any relation to Amelia Blake?
She was my mother.
Well.

Wilson's.
It's been there as long as I can remember.
The guy who owns the place seemed to know me.
Or at least knew mom.
Calvin Wilson.
Is he one of us?
A witch?
Yes.
Why, did he say something to you?
No.
I touched his hand by mistake, and then, the mirror behind him shattered.
It was really strange.
Residual power and active power crossing.
It could've just been a random surge.
How many witches are there in Chance Harbor?
Hard to know exactly.
People tend to be private about it.
But a lot less than there used to be.
After the fire, everyone stopped practicing.
Many families left town.
Right.
Like us.
I'd better get going to Henry's lake house.
It's a long drive.
You sure you're going to be ok here?
Absolutely.
Henry's an elder, isn't he?
Well, I just thought that you didn't want to tell anyone that we'd bound the circle, especially elders.
I'm not going to tell him about the circle.
But I haven't heard from him in weeks, and I'm worried.
You have friends coming to stay with you here, right?
Yeah.
All the girls will be here.
We're going to do a low-key Halloween thing, like hand out candy to trick-or-treaters and watch some movies.
Good.
Bye, grandma.
Morning.
Thought you'd still be sleeping it off.
I'm fine.
The keys to the boathouse weren't on the hook.
You forget to put them back, I guess.
Sorry about that.
And I appreciate the concern, but I'm fine.
Do you remember that Diana broke up with me 'cause you told her how Cassie and I were written in the stars?
I know it's hard to understand.
No, I understand perfectly.
Since you've already ruined your life, you've decided to destroy mine.
That's not fair.
Diana loved me.
And the more I tried to be worthy of it, the better I got, and the further I got from being you.
I don't want you to be me either.
Trust me.
But messing with fate will get you there faster than you know.
Please stop using fate as an excuse for what you did to mom.
Did you ever even love her?
'Cause the way you talk about Amelia, it doesn't seem like it.
You got a lot of great stuff.
Thanks for coming over to help set up.
No problem.
I love Halloween.
And I could use the distraction.
Have you and Adam talked at all since the wake?
No.
I wish I could help somehow--
I don't even want to talk about it.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Oh, of course.
Sorry.
Ok.
I know there's a big bag of plastic cups somewhere in here.
What is that?
Uh, zombie?
Got it from the drama club.
This is just the beginning.
There's a trunkload of stuff.
Faye invited them so they'd let us take as much as we wanted.
Oh, my God.
What's wrong?
This is part of the blade that girl used to attack me.
It must have broken off.
It looks old.
That's the Crescent moon symbol she burned in the ground.
Hey.
Happy Halloween.
First one as a witch, very important.
Yes.
Thanks.
Uh, I found something.
What is it?
It's a piece of the weapon that girl used to attack me.
Found it in the kitchen.
Where are you taking it?
Just the antiquities shop by the boardwalk.
Thought I'd try to figure out what it is and what these two symbols mean.
You sure that's a good idea?
It might tip off who you really are.
And that witch is gone, so there's not much to do about it, anyway.
I told you the night she died that there's too much I don't know about witchcraft.
It's time I learned.
I don't want us to be sitting targets anymore.
I get that.
I'll be careful about what I tell him.
Don't worry.
Let me know how it goes.
I'll see you later?
Sorry, I'm closed for lunch.
Thought I locked up.
You did.
Calvin Wilson, right?
That's right.
I made a couple of calls and found out that the Wilsons have been around this area forever.
A long time.
Maybe you knew my parents?
Richard and Sara Armstrong?
No.
I didn't really know them, either.
I was pretty young when they died.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
But that's not why I came here.
Do you have any witch cruets?
Excuse me?
I have a few, but I'm always looking for more.
I use them for salad dressing, but apparently, they're meant for killing witches.
Is that right?
All you need is mandrake root and some blood.
Ahh!
And a personal item that's absorbed some of the witch's energy.
Please.
It's my wedding ring.
Then as long as the cruet's been spelled, all you have to do next is throw in a match, and ding dong, the witch is dead.
But you knew that, didn't you?
You're not a very powerful witch, are you, Calvin?
If Cassie Blake comes in here and asks any questions, all you're going to say is, "I don't know."
Got it?
Yes.
I swear it.
Great.
Probably best you don't carry these in your shop.
Dangerous things.
Mr. Wilson?
Oh.
You were here this morning.
I have something to show you.
I'm a little busy here.
Ok.
Well, can you just tell me what it is?
I don't know.
I wish I could be more helpful.
Hmm.
Ok.
Well, if you--if you think of anything, then, um...
I will write down my name and my number, and you can call me.
All right.
Oh, my God.
I--that was so dumb.
I'm sorry.
Can I help you clean it up?
Do you have, like, a broom or something?
Of course, I will pay for it.
Never mind.
I'll do it.
Jake.
You miss him, too?
Not exactly.
I'm here for them.
Look, you don't have to be all tough.
We both loved him.
I hadn't seen Nick in two years.
When I was living here, all we did was fight.
So take this trip down memory lane by yourself.
Wow.
Great Big Brother.
He was playing with things that he shouldn't have.
He wound up dead.
I could've told him.
But you weren't here to do that.
You just left.
So maybe this is on you.
You know, I actually thought we might be able to be friends, that we had something in common.
I'm nothing like the rest of you.
Trust me.
Ok.
See how close you can get to this one, the third symbol.
It could be an old crest.
People used to etch them into objects of all kinds.
It's like a family seal.
All right.
I recreated the images on the sketch pad app and ran a search.
Might take a few minutes to scan for matches.
I--I called Diana, she should be here, too.
If she knows I'm here, she won't come.
I don't blame her.
Ever since I was little, my dad would talk about how he was supposed to be with Amelia, and how I'm fated to be with Amelia's daughter.
I should have known he'd say it to Diana, too.
But this breakup isn't his fault--it's mine.
The only reason Diana believed what he said is because it's the way I've been acting.
I'm sorry for anything I did to make that worse.
I don't know what's between you and me, exactly.
But I know that without Diana, I'm not much of anything.
Then you should fight for her.
Show her that.
Forbidden love.
So adorable.
Am I interrupting?
Uh, no, no.
Did you find anything in my book about the symbols on the blade?
No.
But I did find a cool attraction spell for future reference.
I got a match.
That's it.
Does it belong to any family name?
Not a family.
A society.
The Geticas, also known as "The Hunters."
This goes back all the way to the Middle Ages.
Hunters?
Its motto is from ancient text--
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
So the girl who attacked me wasn't a crazy witch.
She was a witch hunter.
Adam Conant...
Diana Meade...
Faye Chamberlain...
Melissa Glaser... and Cassie Blake.
As angry as you were at Simone for hurrying along the process, at least she did the marking.
Now you don't have to.
Simone ignored the plan.
She could have ruined everything.
If you kill a bound witch the wrong way, their powers can pass to other witches, make them stronger.
We can't afford mistakes.
Which is why some of us are worried about a plan that hinges on you.
Witchcraft took my parents and my brother.
I know which side I'm on.
Now, do you want me to do this or not?
Because if I don't spell these, they're just fancy bottles, and you're back to burning witches at the stake.
Go ahead.
Spell the vessels.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
It's done.
Add their blood, the objects, set it on fire, they die.
And their magic dies with them.
Good.
We can't risk outing you in the process.
So, we'll have some brothers at the party, doing the gathering for you.
Ian came with us from Salem.
And one of our hunters is from here in town.
He's very familiar with the targets.
That girl lied to you.
She wasn't a witch.
What are you talking about?
We found out what those symbols mean.
- And?
- She was a witch hunter.
Wait.
If she was a witch hunter, why would she bother lying to me?
I don't know.
Are you sure she didn't say anything else to you?
No, just exactly what I told you.
- Hmm.
- How do you know she wasn't just some crazy witch?
What else have you really got to go on?
Just those 3 symbols?
Um, I'll see you at the party tonight?
I might drop by.
Yeah.
You know, it's times like this I pity the normals.
They will never be this cool.
What else can we do?
Bats.
Take flight and dive.
Take flight and dive.
Ohh!
Aah!
Wow, nice work.
Um, hey, look, when Jake shows up, do you think you can keep him occupied?
Why do you think I'm wearing this?
Oh.
Right.
Wait, why do you want him occupied?
When I showed him the fleam, he knew that there were 3 symbols when mine was missing one.
He obviously knows more than he's telling us.

Thank you.
Have fun tonight.
Diana, wait.
Is this who we are now?
We don't even talk?
What's left that you want me to say?
Tell me how to fix this.
Adam, don't.
I love you.
So if I let you forget that...
Then let me try again.
I know we can work it out.
We shouldn't have to work so hard.
Not everything is perfect, Diana.
Sometimes--sometimes, things get a little out of control.
But that doesn't mean it's wrong.
Like Cassie?
Whiskey, neat, right?
Good memory.
I'm impressed.
Don't be.
What brings you across town?
Can't an old friend just stop by for a visit?
Not after 16 years, no.
Maybe I wasn't in your circle, but I never gave you a reason not to trust me.
You shouldn't have come here.
Well, it wasn't on the top of my list, either, but Amelia Blake's daughter came to my store this morning.
Really.
Why's that?
Thought you might know.
She was asking questions about some old hunting acquaintances of ours.
It's funny.
I couldn't see much of her mother in her, at first, not until she told me who she was.
You know how it is with kids.
It's hard to predict which parent they'll favor.
She's Amelia's daughter, Cal.
Are you sure?
'Cause you were always a bit blind when it came to Amelia.
We were all blind except Amelia, in the end.
She doesn't even know who her father really was, does she?
What he was attempting to do that night?
And there's no reason she should.
Why not?
Especially if she's as much like Amelia as you say.
Just leave it alone.
She needs to know about John Blackwell.
She has a right to protect herself.
# I turn it on, I set the tone #
# I don't know, I'm ready to go #
# I saw you waking up against the wall # # and I knew you were ready to go # # tonight, I'm a different guy # # forget about the things you know # # if you want to do it, we can do it right #
# I can see you coming whole # # 'cause you're ready to go # # is that a yes or a no?

# # 'cause I'm ready to go-- #
There you are.
Hey...
Gangsta.
You made it.
Oh, and we match.
Kind of.
You're a...
B.B. Gun?
Mmm.
Killer bee, actually.
Um, but I was just about to go run and grab some more ice.
So I'll B.B. back in a sec.
# Ready to go #
Great costume.
Halloween's for kids.
I'm just here for the beer.
Come on.
Let me give you a tour.
Faye, no, not now.
Not now?
The old Jake didn't even know those words.
# Show me, this is it #
Faye?
# Go #
# I'm ready to go # # if you say so #
And this is her bedroom.
How sweet.
# If you say so, 'cause I'm ready to go #
# I'm ready to go if you say so #
# I'm ready to go if you say so #
Really, Faye?
In my bedroom?
What the hell is going on with you?
Come on, Faye.
Don't try and deny something's going on.
Is this going to be drama?
No.
No drama.
But something's different with you.
You were always an ass, and you always had a cruel streak.
But you were never distant.
Not when we were like this.
Maybe you just always thought there was more there, and there wasn't.
No.
I've felt it since you got back.
Looking for something?
Uh, just Nick's MP3 player, for Melissa.
You know, their songs?
I thought it might help her.
Did you think stabbing it to death would get her the closure she needs?
No.
But what else would you use it for?
Opening really thick letters?
Killing people?
Why do you have it?
It's not mine.
You're telling me this is Nick's?
I'm going to show you something.
But you can't tell anyone.
I know.
Nick was always into weird stuff, but I never expected this.
These symbols mean witch hunter.
Same as the girl had on her blade.
Why didn't you show me these?
To protect him.
I know how this looks.
He was no traitor.
No, of course not.
There's no way Nick was a witch hunter.
But she was, so-- so, what's the connection?
I don't know yet.
Maybe Nick was looking into that witch hunter stuff and got on their radar.
You think Nick's the reason she came here?
Let me see the knife.
Well, isn't this creepy.
Is this what it takes to get you excited, a little girl with a knife?
Cassie, I can't find Melissa, we should get back.
I thought you were going to distract him.
I tried.
I didn't realize you were waiting for him in his room.
No, I was looking for something.
But then, I found something else.
Oh!
Hello?
Cassie, my name is Calvin Wilson.
We met at my shop earlier today.
Of course.
I left something for you.
You're in danger.
In danger?
What do you mean?
Mr. Wilson?
Mr. Wilson.
No costume on Halloween?
Hello?
Mr. Wilson?
Sorry.
No problem.
I think I got something on your face.
May I?
Was my warning not specific enough?
I wasn't going to tell her anything about you.
Remember this?
I had a feeling you'd try to be a hero.
Please.
This is just something personal.
It doesn't concern you.
Try me.
All right.
She has dark magic inside her.
So why are you so desperate to tell her?
So she can fight it.
Maybe stop it from overcoming her.
You think people can change who they are?
Of course.
I don't.
Out.
Now.
Oh, hey, Adam.
Have you found Melissa and Diana?
Because the guy I met at the antiquities shop called, freaked out, and I think he was trying to warn me about w--
Luke?
You bleed just like us.
But you're not.
That's enough.
Finish the cruet.
- What's going on?
- Witch hunters.
This is a ring of iron sulphide to stop your powers.
Science prevailing over your ungodly magic.
We haven't done anything wrong.
But you will.
Luke, please.
Stop this.
Tell him that we're not a threat.
You bound your circle, Cassie.
No one to blame but yourselves.
So you've been spying on us all this time, just to narc to other witch hunters?
Like my father did.
And his father.
You aren't the only ones born into a legacy.
At least I can be proud of mine.
Enough.
Finish it.
"Watch the witch, but never trust him,
"for his every thought is a sin, his every word a lie."
You have to stop this.
You shouldn't be here.
Cassie has dark magic.
All magic is dark.
Not like this.
Cassie isn't like other witches, Isaac.
She's stronger.
We can't kill her this way.
You have to trust me.
You've become a great asset to me.
But you are too close to this.
I won't stop it.
Luke, don't.
Look, Luke, I'm your friend.
That's why I wanted to be the one to do this.
I'm freeing you from a life of sin.
That's not true.
I'm sorry, Diana.
You have a good heart, but it's not enough to protect you from your true nature.
This will be fast.
I promise.
No!
Oh my God.
Trust me now?
Are you ok?
A guy--a guy in a pig mask jumped me and brought me here.
I fought him off.
Where did he go?
There was an explosion from inside, and he ran off.
Another guy came running out, too.
What happened in there?
It's me.
It's ok.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
I was worried.
It's ok.
I'm ok.
When he had your blood...
I know.
It's all so real now.
My whole life, everyone said,
"there's that kid who lost his mom.
How sad."
But you can't lose something you never had.
Every day, my dad pulls away a little more.
You are my home, Diana.
Maybe I'm just supposed to just let you go now, but I can't.
Because I can't lose everything I have all at once.
I want to get past this.
I know not everything can be perfect.
But I have to believe that it can be, just so fighting for it makes sense.
And you're not a believer?
Not right now.
You look a little rattled.
Oh.
I just--how can there be people out there that hate us so much, you know?
It's like, we haven't done anything.
We didn't choose this.
We were--we were born this way.
People don't understand.
What they don't understand scares them.
You seem so calm about it all.
I've been at this longer than you.
Have you ever done magic on your own?
I...
I think I did something on my own tonight.
Really?
I think I stopped one of those witch hunters from killing Diana.
That's a pretty good trick.
So, why didn't they round you up with the rest of us?
Don't trust me, huh?
Not really.
That's ok.
I don't mind having to earn it.
Mmm.
Good luck with that.
Henry?
Henry, it's Jane.
You here?

Previously on The Secret Circle...
My sweet Cassie, you finding this means I'm gone, and for that I am so sorry.
I didn't want you to have this life, but destiny's not easy to run from.
Hi.
I'm Diana.
- You seen her yet?
- She got in yesterday.
- We're different.
- You're different.
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded 100% witch.
Here we have real power now.
A complete circle is 6.
You complete the circle.
She's got the gift.
You can get Cassie to do what we need?
The circle will take care of that without even knowing it.
There was a guy in Nick's yard last night.
It must have been his older brother Jake.
He left town a couple of years ago.
He was a troubled young man.
- What do you want?
- Your blood.
Aah!
Get off of her.
We did a spell together to send her away.
So, you know you're a witch.
Your dad told me about you and Cassie being destined to be together.
I've been standing on the sidelines watching it since she got here.
I can't do that anymore.
I've come here to rid Chance Harbor of witches, and I will not fail.
[Music playing]
Faye:
What do you think?
Those are ancient artifacts, not a Halloween costume.
Whatever.
I'm a sexy witch Doctor.
Take it off.
We shouldn't be drawing attention to ourselves.
Relax, it's Halloween.
We're just blending in with all the supernatural wannabes.
And is there a more perfect place for party decorations?
Uh, no, we're not having a party.
Just a get-together.
That was the deal.
My grandmother's only gone for the night.
I know.
And I'm impressed that you agreed without me having to resort to blackmail.
No, I just-
- I think it'll be a good break for us.
Halloween's the night to pretend you're someone else, right?
Sluttier versions of someone else, but I get your point.
And maybe it'll be good for Adam and Diana.
Is that what this is about?
You feel bad about breaking them up, and now, you're throwing a party to lure them back together?
No, I did not break them up.
I think that the best way to cover up the fact that you tried to steal her boyfriend is to get one of your own.
How about Luke?
I--pfft!
No.
I blew my chance when I became the world's worst dance date.
Ecch.
Luke.
Hi.
So, Cassie's having a party tonight, and she would love for you to come.
No, it is just a--a get-together.
And I totally understand if you don't want to, or if you have other, better plans.
Sure.
Ok.
So, I'll see you tonight?
See you then.
And now, you have a hot guy to flirt with at the party.
Done.
So what about you?
I have a target in mind.
- Jake?
- Maybe.
Let me change out of these artifacts.
Will you buy this for me?
As a reward for being so helpful?
Um, hmm.
Hi.
Happy Halloween.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Blake?
Any relation to Amelia Blake?
She was my mother.
Well.

Jane:
Wilson's.
It's been there as long as I can remember.
The guy who owns the place seemed to know me.
Or at least knew mom.
Calvin Wilson.
Is he one of us?
A witch?
Yes.
Why, did he say something to you?
No.
I touched his hand by mistake, and then, the mirror behind him shattered.
It was really strange.
Residual power and active power crossing.
It could've just been a random surge.
How many witches are there in Chance Harbor?
Hard to know exactly.
People tend to be private about it.
But a lot less than there used to be.
After the fire, everyone stopped practicing.
Many families left town.
Right.
Like us.
I'd better get going to Henry's lake house.
It's a long drive.
You sure you're going to be ok here?
Absolutely.
Henry's an elder, isn't he?
Well, I just thought that you didn't want to tell anyone that we'd bound the circle, especially elders.
I'm not going to tell him about the circle.
But I haven't heard from him in weeks, and I'm worried.
You have friends coming to stay with you here, right?
Yeah.
All the girls will be here.
We're going to do a low-key Halloween thing, like hand out candy to trick-or-treaters and watch some movies.
Good.
Bye, grandma.
Morning.
Thought you'd still be sleeping it off.
I'm fine.
The keys to the boathouse weren't on the hook.
You forget to put them back, I guess.
Sorry about that.
And I appreciate the concern, but I'm fine.
Do you remember that Diana broke up with me 'cause you told her how Cassie and I were written in the stars?
I know it's hard to understand.
No, I understand perfectly.
Since you've already ruined your life, you've decided to destroy mine.
That's not fair.
Diana loved me.
And the more I tried to be worthy of it, the better I got, and the further I got from being you.
I don't want you to be me either.
Trust me.
But messing with fate will get you there faster than you know.
Please stop using fate as an excuse for what you did to mom.
Did you ever even love her?
'Cause the way you talk about Amelia, it doesn't seem like it.
You got a lot of great stuff.
Thanks for coming over to help set up.
No problem.
I love Halloween.
And I could use the distraction.
Have you and Adam talked at all since the wake?
No.
I wish I could help somehow--
I don't even want to talk about it.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Oh, of course.
Sorry.
Ok.
I know there's a big bag of plastic cups somewhere in here.
What is that?
Uh, zombie?
Got it from the drama club.
This is just the beginning.
Melissa:
There's a trunkload of stuff.
Faye invited them so they'd let us take as much as we wanted.
Oh, my God.
Diana:
What's wrong?
This is part of the blade that girl used to attack me.
It must have broken off.
Melissa:
It looks old.
That's the Crescent moon symbol she burned in the ground.
Hey.
[Grunts]
Happy Halloween.
First one as a witch, very important.
Yes.
Thanks.
Uh, I found something.
What is it?
It's a piece of the weapon that girl used to attack me.
Found it in the kitchen.
Where are you taking it?
Just the antiquities shop by the boardwalk.
Thought I'd try to figure out what it is and what these two symbols mean.
You sure that's a good idea?
It might tip off who you really are.
And that witch is gone, so there's not much to do about it, anyway.
I told you the night she died that there's too much I don't know about witchcraft.
It's time I learned.
I don't want us to be sitting targets anymore.
I get that.
I'll be careful about what I tell him.
Don't worry.
Let me know how it goes.
I'll see you later?
[Engine grinds]
[Clicking]
[Clicks]
[Engine grinds]
[Clicks]
[Rings]
Sorry, I'm closed for lunch.
Thought I locked up.
You did.
Calvin Wilson, right?
That's right.
I made a couple of calls and found out that the Wilsons have been around this area forever.
A long time.
Maybe you knew my parents?
Richard and Sara Armstrong?
No.
I didn't really know them, either.
I was pretty young when they died.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
But that's not why I came here.
Do you have any witch cruets?
Excuse me?
I have a few, but I'm always looking for more.
I use them for salad dressing, but apparently, they're meant for killing witches.
Is that right?
[Grunts]
All you need is mandrake root and some blood.
Ahh!
[Grunts and gasps]
And a personal item that's absorbed some of the witch's energy.
Please.
It's my wedding ring.
Then as long as the cruet's been spelled, all you have to do next is throw in a match, and ding dong, the witch is dead.
But you knew that, didn't you?
You're not a very powerful witch, are you, Calvin?
[Match strikes]
If Cassie Blake comes in here and asks any questions, all you're going to say is, "I don't know."
Got it?
Yes.
I swear it.
Great.
Probably best you don't carry these in your shop.
Dangerous things.
[Bell rings]
Mr. Wilson?
Oh.
You were here this morning.
I have something to show you.
I'm a little busy here.
Ok.
Well, can you just tell me what it is?
I don't know.
I wish I could be more helpful.
Hmm.
Ok.
Well, if you--if you think of anything, then, um...
I will write down my name and my number, and you can call me.
All right.
Oh, my God.
I--that was so dumb.
I'm sorry.
Can I help you clean it up?
Do you have, like, a broom or something?
Of course, I will pay for it.
Never mind.
I'll do it.
[Phone beeps and shutter clicks]
Jake.
You miss him, too?
Not exactly.
I'm here for them.
Look, you don't have to be all tough.
We both loved him.
I hadn't seen Nick in two years.
When I was living here, all we did was fight.
So take this trip down memory lane by yourself.
Wow.
Great Big Brother.
He was playing with things that he shouldn't have.
He wound up dead.
I could've told him.
But you weren't here to do that.
You just left.
So maybe this is on you.
You know, I actually thought we might be able to be friends, that we had something in common.
I'm nothing like the rest of you.
Trust me.
[Crow caws]
Ok.
See how close you can get to this one, the third symbol.
It could be an old crest.
People used to etch them into objects of all kinds.
It's like a family seal.
[Beeps]
All right.
I recreated the images on the sketch pad app and ran a search.
Might take a few minutes to scan for matches.
[Beeping]
I--I called Diana, she should be here, too.
If she knows I'm here, she won't come.
I don't blame her.
Ever since I was little, my dad would talk about how he was supposed to be with Amelia, and how I'm fated to be with Amelia's daughter.
I should have known he'd say it to Diana, too.
But this breakup isn't his fault--it's mine.
The only reason Diana believed what he said is because it's the way I've been acting.
I'm sorry for anything I did to make that worse.
I don't know what's between you and me, exactly.
But I know that without Diana, I'm not much of anything.
Then you should fight for her.
Show her that.
Faye:
Forbidden love.
So adorable.
Am I interrupting?
Uh, no, no.
Did you find anything in my book about the symbols on the blade?
No.
But I did find a cool attraction spell for future reference.
[Beeps] I got a match.
Cassie:
That's it.
Does it belong to any family name?
Not a family.
A society.
The Geticas, also known as "The Hunters."
This goes back all the way to the Middle Ages.
Hunters?
[Beeps]
Its motto is from ancient text--
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
So the girl who attacked me wasn't a crazy witch.
She was a witch hunter.
Adam Conant...
Diana Meade...
Faye Chamberlain...
Melissa Glaser... and Cassie Blake.
As angry as you were at Simone for hurrying along the process, at least she did the marking.
Now you don't have to.
Simone ignored the plan.
She could have ruined everything.
If you kill a bound witch the wrong way, their powers can pass to other witches, make them stronger.
We can't afford mistakes.
Which is why some of us are worried about a plan that hinges on you.
Witchcraft took my parents and my brother.
I know which side I'm on.
Now, do you want me to do this or not?
Because if I don't spell these, they're just fancy bottles, and you're back to burning witches at the stake.
Go ahead.
Spell the vessels.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
It's done.
Add their blood, the objects, set it on fire, they die.
And their magic dies with them.
Good.
We can't risk outing you in the process.
So, we'll have some brothers at the party, doing the gathering for you.
Ian came with us from Salem.
And one of our hunters is from here in town.
He's very familiar with the targets.
That girl lied to you.
She wasn't a witch.
What are you talking about?
We found out what those symbols mean.
- And?
- She was a witch hunter.
Wait.
If she was a witch hunter, why would she bother lying to me?
I don't know.
Are you sure she didn't say anything else to you?
No, just exactly what I told you.
- Hmm.
- How do you know she wasn't just some crazy witch?
What else have you really got to go on?
Just those 3 symbols?
Um, I'll see you at the party tonight?
I might drop by.
Yeah.
[Electronica playing]
You know, it's times like this I pity the normals.
They will never be this cool.
What else can we do?
Bats.
Take flight and dive.
Both:
Take flight and dive.
Ohh!
[Laughs]
[Laughs]
[Both laughing]
Aah!
[Laughter]
Wow, nice work.
Um, hey, look, when Jake shows up, do you think you can keep him occupied?
Why do you think I'm wearing this?
Oh.
Right.
Wait, why do you want him occupied?
When I showed him the fleam, he knew that there were 3 symbols when mine was missing one.
He obviously knows more than he's telling us.

We don't even talk?
What's left that you want me to say?
Tell me how to fix this.
Adam, don't.
I love you.
So if I let you forget that...
Then let me try again.
I know we can work it out.
We shouldn't have to work so hard.
Not everything is perfect, Diana.
Sometimes--sometimes, things get a little out of control.
But that doesn't mean it's wrong.
Like Cassie?
Whiskey, neat, right?
Good memory.
I'm impressed.
Don't be.
What brings you across town?
Can't an old friend just stop by for a visit?
Not after 16 years, no.
Maybe I wasn't in your circle, but I never gave you a reason not to trust me.
You shouldn't have come here.
Well, it wasn't on the top of my list, either, but Amelia Blake's daughter came to my store this morning.
Really.
Why's that?
Thought you might know.
She was asking questions about some old hunting acquaintances of ours.
It's funny.
I couldn't see much of her mother in her, at first, not until she told me who she was.
You know how it is with kids.
It's hard to predict which parent they'll favor.
She's Amelia's daughter, Cal.
Are you sure?
'Cause you were always a bit blind when it came to Amelia.
We were all blind except Amelia, in the end.
She doesn't even know who her father really was, does she?
What he was attempting to do that night?
And there's no reason she should.
Why not?
Especially if she's as much like Amelia as you say.
Just leave it alone.
She needs to know about John Blackwell.
She has a right to protect herself.

What the hell is going on with you?
Come on, Faye.
[Exhales]
Don't try and deny something's going on.
Is this going to be drama?
No.
No drama.
But something's different with you.
You were always an ass, and you always had a cruel streak.
But you were never distant.
Not when we were like this.
Maybe you just always thought there was more there, and there wasn't.
No.
I've felt it since you got back.
[Door opens]
Looking for something?
Uh, just Nick's MP3 player, for Melissa.
You know, their songs?
I thought it might help her.
Did you think stabbing it to death would get her the closure she needs?
No.
But what else would you use it for?
Opening really thick letters?
Killing people?
Why do you have it?
It's not mine.
You're telling me this is Nick's?
I'm going to show you something.
But you can't tell anyone.
[Drawer opens]
I know.
Nick was always into weird stuff, but I never expected this.
These symbols mean witch hunter.
Same as the girl had on her blade.
Why didn't you show me these?
To protect him.
I know how this looks.
He was no traitor.
No, of course not.
There's no way Nick was a witch hunter.
But she was, so-- so, what's the connection?
I don't know yet.
Maybe Nick was looking into that witch hunter stuff and got on their radar.
You think Nick's the reason she came here?
Let me see the knife.
Well, isn't this creepy.
Is this what it takes to get you excited, a little girl with a knife?
Cassie, I can't find Melissa, we should get back.
I thought you were going to distract him.
I tried.
I didn't realize you were waiting for him in his room.
No, I was looking for something.
But then, I found something else.
[Cell phone rings]
Oh!
[Ring]
Hello?
Cassie, my name is Calvin Wilson.
We met at my shop earlier today.
Of course.
I left something for you.
You're in danger.
In danger?
What do you mean?
Mr. Wilson?
Mr. Wilson.
No costume on Halloween?
Hello?
Mr. Wilson?
[Indistinct electronica playing]
Sorry. [Chuckles] No problem.
I think I got something on your face.
May I?
[Grunting]
Was my warning not specific enough?
I wasn't going to tell her anything about you.
Remember this?
I had a feeling you'd try to be a hero.
Please.
This is just something personal.
It doesn't concern you.
Try me.
[Stammers]
All right.
She has dark magic inside her.
So why are you so desperate to tell her?
So she can fight it.
Maybe stop it from overcoming her.
You think people can change who they are?
Of course.
I don't.
[Choking and grunting]
Out.
Now.
[Indistinct talking]
[Indistinct electronica playing]
[Door opens] Oh, hey, Adam.
Have you found Melissa and Diana?
Because the guy I met at the antiquities shop called, freaked out, and I think he was trying to warn me about w-- [Grunting]
[Gasps and screams]
[Panting]
Luke?
[Gasps]
You bleed just like us.
But you're not.
That's enough.
Finish the cruet.
[Gasps]
- What's going on?
- Witch hunters.
This is a ring of iron sulphide to stop your powers.
Science prevailing over your ungodly magic.
We haven't done anything wrong.
But you will.
Luke, please.
Stop this.
Tell him that we're not a threat.
You bound your circle, Cassie.
No one to blame but yourselves.
So you've been spying on us all this time, just to narc to other witch hunters?
Like my father did.
And his father.
You aren't the only ones born into a legacy.
At least I can be proud of mine.
Enough.
Finish it.
"Watch the witch, but never trust him,
"for his every thought is a sin, his every word a lie."
You have to stop this.
You shouldn't be here.
Cassie has dark magic.
All magic is dark.
Not like this.
Cassie isn't like other witches, Isaac.
She's stronger.
We can't kill her this way.
You have to trust me.
You've become a great asset to me.
But you are too close to this.
I won't stop it.
Luke, don't.
Look, Luke, I'm your friend.
That's why I wanted to be the one to do this.
I'm freeing you from a life of sin.
That's not true.
I'm sorry, Diana.
[Gasps] You have a good heart, but it's not enough to protect you from your true nature.
This will be fast.
I promise.
No!
[Luke grunts]
[Panting]
[Cassie panting]
[Gasps and grunts]
[Screams]
[Screaming]
[Panting and grunting]
Oh my God.
Trust me now?
[Panting]
[Grunts]
[Grunting]
[All panting and grunting]
[Jake screams]
Cassie:
Are you ok?
A guy--a guy in a pig mask jumped me and brought me here.
I fought him off.
Where did he go?
There was an explosion from inside, and he ran off.
Another guy came running out, too.
What happened in there?
It's me.
It's ok.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
I was worried.
It's ok.
I'm ok.
When he had your blood...
I know.
It's all so real now.
My whole life, everyone said,
"there's that kid who lost his mom.
How sad."
But you can't lose something you never had.
Every day, my dad pulls away a little more.
You are my home, Diana.
Maybe I'm just supposed to just let you go now, but I can't.
Because I can't lose everything I have all at once.
I want to get past this.
I know not everything can be perfect.
But I have to believe that it can be, just so fighting for it makes sense.
And you're not a believer?
Not right now.
[Door opens and shuts]
[Crickets]
You look a little rattled.
Oh.
I just--how can there be people out there that hate us so much, you know?
It's like, we haven't done anything.
We didn't choose this.
We were--we were born this way.
People don't understand.
What they don't understand scares them.
You seem so calm about it all.
I've been at this longer than you.
Have you ever done magic on your own?
I...
I think I did something on my own tonight.
Really?
I think I stopped one of those witch hunters from killing Diana.
That's a pretty good trick.
So, why didn't they round you up with the rest of us?
Don't trust me, huh?
[Chuckles] Not really.
That's ok.
I don't mind having to earn it.
Mmm.
Good luck with that.
[Lock clicks]
[Grunts]
Henry?
Henry, it's Jane.
You here?

Previously on The Secret Circle...
My sweet Cassie, you finding this means I'm gone, and for that I am so sorry.
I didn't want you to have this life, but destiny's not easy to run from.
Hi.
I'm Diana.
- You seen her yet?
- She got in yesterday.
- We're different.
- You're different.
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded 100% witch.
Here we have real power now.
A complete circle is 6.
You complete the circle.
She's got the gift.
You can get Cassie to do what we need?
The circle will take care of that without even knowing it.
There was a guy in Nick's yard last night.
It must have been his older brother Jake.
He left town a couple of years ago.
He was a troubled young man.
- What do you want?
- Your blood.
Aah!
Get off of her.
We did a spell together to send her away.
So, you know you're a witch.
Your dad told me about you and Cassie being destined to be together.
I've been standing on the sidelines watching it since she got here.
I can't do that anymore.
I've come here to rid Chance Harbor of witches, and I will not fail.
What do you think?
Those are ancient artifacts, not a Halloween costume.
Whatever.
I'm a sexy witch Doctor.
Take it off.
We shouldn't be drawing attention to ourselves.
Relax, it's Halloween.
We're just blending in with all the supernatural wannabes.
And is there a more perfect place for party decorations?
Uh, no, we're not having a party.
Just a get-together.
That was the deal.
My grandmother's only gone for the night.
I know.
And I'm impressed that you agreed without me having to resort to blackmail.
No, I just-
- I think it'll be a good break for us.
Halloween's the night to pretend you're someone else, right?
Sluttier versions of someone else, but I get your point.
And maybe it'll be good for Adam and Diana.
Is that what this is about?
You feel bad about breaking them up, and now, you're throwing a party to lure them back together?
No, I did not break them up.
I think that the best way to cover up the fact that you tried to steal her boyfriend is to get one of your own.
How about Luke?
I--pfft!
No.
I blew my chance when I became the world's worst dance date.
Ecch.
Luke.
Hi.
So, Cassie's having a party tonight, and she would love for you to come.
No, it is just a--a get-together.
And I totally understand if you don't want to, or if you have other, better plans.
Sure.
Ok.
So, I'll see you tonight?
See you then.
And now, you have a hot guy to flirt with at the party.
Done.
So what about you?
I have a target in mind.
- Jake?
- Maybe.
Let me change out of these artifacts.
Will you buy this for me?
As a reward for being so helpful?
Um, hmm.
Hi.
Happy Halloween.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Blake?
Any relation to Amelia Blake?
She was my mother.
Well.

Wilson's.
It's been there as long as I can remember.
The guy who owns the place seemed to know me.
Or at least knew mom.
Calvin Wilson.
Is he one of us?
A witch?
Yes.
Why, did he say something to you?
No.
I touched his hand by mistake, and then, the mirror behind him shattered.
It was really strange.
Residual power and active power crossing.
It could've just been a random surge.
How many witches are there in Chance Harbor?
Hard to know exactly.
People tend to be private about it.
But a lot less than there used to be.
After the fire, everyone stopped practicing.
Many families left town.
Right.
Like us.
I'd better get going to Henry's lake house.
It's a long drive.
You sure you're going to be ok here?
Absolutely.
Henry's an elder, isn't he?
Well, I just thought that you didn't want to tell anyone that we'd bound the circle, especially elders.
I'm not going to tell him about the circle.
But I haven't heard from him in weeks, and I'm worried.
You have friends coming to stay with you here, right?
Yeah.
All the girls will be here.
We're going to do a low-key Halloween thing, like hand out candy to trick-or-treaters and watch some movies.
Good.
Bye, grandma.
Morning.
Thought you'd still be sleeping it off.
I'm fine.
The keys to the boathouse weren't on the hook.
You forget to put them back, I guess.
Sorry about that.
And I appreciate the concern, but I'm fine.
Do you remember that Diana broke up with me 'cause you told her how Cassie and I were written in the stars?
I know it's hard to understand.
No, I understand perfectly.
Since you've already ruined your life, you've decided to destroy mine.
That's not fair.
Diana loved me.
And the more I tried to be worthy of it, the better I got, and the further I got from being you.
I don't want you to be me either.
Trust me.
But messing with fate will get you there faster than you know.
Please stop using fate as an excuse for what you did to mom.
Did you ever even love her?
'Cause the way you talk about Amelia, it doesn't seem like it.
You got a lot of great stuff.
Thanks for coming over to help set up.
No problem.
I love Halloween.
And I could use the distraction.
Have you and Adam talked at all since the wake?
No.
I wish I could help somehow--
I don't even want to talk about it.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Oh, of course.
Sorry.
Ok.
I know there's a big bag of plastic cups somewhere in here.
What is that?
Uh, zombie?
Got it from the drama club.
This is just the beginning.
There's a trunkload of stuff.
Faye invited them so they'd let us take as much as we wanted.
Oh, my God.
What's wrong?
This is part of the blade that girl used to attack me.
It must have broken off.
It looks old.
That's the Crescent moon symbol she burned in the ground.
Hey.
Happy Halloween.
First one as a witch, very important.
Yes.
Thanks.
Uh, I found something.
What is it?
It's a piece of the weapon that girl used to attack me.
Found it in the kitchen.
Where are you taking it?
Just the antiquities shop by the boardwalk.
Thought I'd try to figure out what it is and what these two symbols mean.
You sure that's a good idea?
It might tip off who you really are.
And that witch is gone, so there's not much to do about it, anyway.
I told you the night she died that there's too much I don't know about witchcraft.
It's time I learned.
I don't want us to be sitting targets anymore.
I get that.
I'll be careful about what I tell him.
Don't worry.
Let me know how it goes.
I'll see you later?
Sorry, I'm closed for lunch.
Thought I locked up.
You did.
Calvin Wilson, right?
That's right.
I made a couple of calls and found out that the Wilsons have been around this area forever.
A long time.
Maybe you knew my parents?
Richard and Sara Armstrong?
No.
I didn't really know them, either.
I was pretty young when they died.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
But that's not why I came here.
Do you have any witch cruets?
Excuse me?
I have a few, but I'm always looking for more.
I use them for salad dressing, but apparently, they're meant for killing witches.
Is that right?
All you need is mandrake root and some blood.
Ahh!
And a personal item that's absorbed some of the witch's energy.
Please.
It's my wedding ring.
Then as long as the cruet's been spelled, all you have to do next is throw in a match, and ding dong, the witch is dead.
But you knew that, didn't you?
You're not a very powerful witch, are you, Calvin?
If Cassie Blake comes in here and asks any questions, all you're going to say is, "I don't know."
Got it?
Yes.
I swear it.
Great.
Probably best you don't carry these in your shop.
Dangerous things.
Mr. Wilson?
Oh.
You were here this morning.
I have something to show you.
I'm a little busy here.
Ok.
Well, can you just tell me what it is?
I don't know.
I wish I could be more helpful.
Hmm.
Ok.
Well, if you--if you think of anything, then, um...
I will write down my name and my number, and you can call me.
All right.
Oh, my God.
I--that was so dumb.
I'm sorry.
Can I help you clean it up?
Do you have, like, a broom or something?
Of course, I will pay for it.
Never mind.
I'll do it.
Jake.
You miss him, too?
Not exactly.
I'm here for them.
Look, you don't have to be all tough.
We both loved him.
I hadn't seen Nick in two years.
When I was living here, all we did was fight.
So take this trip down memory lane by yourself.
Wow.
Great Big Brother.
He was playing with things that he shouldn't have.
He wound up dead.
I could've told him.
But you weren't here to do that.
You just left.
So maybe this is on you.
You know, I actually thought we might be able to be friends, that we had something in common.
I'm nothing like the rest of you.
Trust me.
Ok.
See how close you can get to this one, the third symbol.
It could be an old crest.
People used to etch them into objects of all kinds.
It's like a family seal.
All right.
I recreated the images on the sketch pad app and ran a search.
Might take a few minutes to scan for matches.
I--I called Diana, she should be here, too.
If she knows I'm here, she won't come.
I don't blame her.
Ever since I was little, my dad would talk about how he was supposed to be with Amelia, and how I'm fated to be with Amelia's daughter.
I should have known he'd say it to Diana, too.
But this breakup isn't his fault--it's mine.
The only reason Diana believed what he said is because it's the way I've been acting.
I'm sorry for anything I did to make that worse.
I don't know what's between you and me, exactly.
But I know that without Diana, I'm not much of anything.
Then you should fight for her.
Show her that.
Forbidden love.
So adorable.
Am I interrupting?
Uh, no, no.
Did you find anything in my book about the symbols on the blade?
No.
But I did find a cool attraction spell for future reference.
I got a match.
That's it.
Does it belong to any family name?
Not a family.
A society.
The Geticas, also known as "The Hunters."
This goes back all the way to the Middle Ages.
Hunters?
Its motto is from ancient text--
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
So the girl who attacked me wasn't a crazy witch.
She was a witch hunter.
Adam Conant...
Diana Meade...
Faye Chamberlain...
Melissa Glaser... and Cassie Blake.
As angry as you were at Simone for hurrying along the process, at least she did the marking.
Now you don't have to.
Simone ignored the plan.
She could have ruined everything.
If you kill a bound witch the wrong way, their powers can pass to other witches, make them stronger.
We can't afford mistakes.
Which is why some of us are worried about a plan that hinges on you.
Witchcraft took my parents and my brother.
I know which side I'm on.
Now, do you want me to do this or not?
Because if I don't spell these, they're just fancy bottles, and you're back to burning witches at the stake.
Go ahead.
Spell the vessels.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
It's done.
Add their blood, the objects, set it on fire, they die.
And their magic dies with them.
Good.
We can't risk outing you in the process.
So, we'll have some brothers at the party, doing the gathering for you.
Ian came with us from Salem.
And one of our hunters is from here in town.
He's very familiar with the targets.
That girl lied to you.
She wasn't a witch.
What are you talking about?
We found out what those symbols mean.
- And?
- She was a witch hunter.
Wait.
If she was a witch hunter, why would she bother lying to me?
I don't know.
Are you sure she didn't say anything else to you?
No, just exactly what I told you.
- Hmm.
- How do you know she wasn't just some crazy witch?
What else have you really got to go on?
Just those 3 symbols?
Um, I'll see you at the party tonight?
I might drop by.
Yeah.
You know, it's times like this I pity the normals.
They will never be this cool.
What else can we do?
Bats.
Take flight and dive.
Take flight and dive.
Ohh!
Aah!
Wow, nice work.
Um, hey, look, when Jake shows up, do you think you can keep him occupied?
Why do you think I'm wearing this?
Oh.
Right.
Wait, why do you want him occupied?
When I showed him the fleam, he knew that there were 3 symbols when mine was missing one.
He obviously knows more than he's telling us.

We don't even talk?
What's left that you want me to say?
Tell me how to fix this.
Adam, don't.
I love you.
So if I let you forget that...
Then let me try again.
I know we can work it out.
We shouldn't have to work so hard.
Not everything is perfect, Diana.
Sometimes--sometimes, things get a little out of control.
But that doesn't mean it's wrong.
Like Cassie?
Whiskey, neat, right?
Good memory.
I'm impressed.
Don't be.
What brings you across town?
Can't an old friend just stop by for a visit?
Not after 16 years, no.
Maybe I wasn't in your circle, but I never gave you a reason not to trust me.
You shouldn't have come here.
Well, it wasn't on the top of my list, either, but Amelia Blake's daughter came to my store this morning.
Really.
Why's that?
Thought you might know.
She was asking questions about some old hunting acquaintances of ours.
It's funny.
I couldn't see much of her mother in her, at first, not until she told me who she was.
You know how it is with kids.
It's hard to predict which parent they'll favor.
She's Amelia's daughter, Cal.
Are you sure?
'Cause you were always a bit blind when it came to Amelia.
We were all blind except Amelia, in the end.
She doesn't even know who her father really was, does she?
What he was attempting to do that night?
And there's no reason she should.
Why not?
Especially if she's as much like Amelia as you say.
Just leave it alone.
She needs to know about John Blackwell.
She has a right to protect herself.

What the hell is going on with you?
Come on, Faye.
Don't try and deny something's going on.
Is this going to be drama?
No.
No drama.
But something's different with you.
You were always an ass, and you always had a cruel streak.
But you were never distant.
Not when we were like this.
Maybe you just always thought there was more there, and there wasn't.
No.
I've felt it since you got back.
Looking for something?
Uh, just Nick's MP3 player, for Melissa.
You know, their songs?
I thought it might help her.
Did you think stabbing it to death would get her the closure she needs?
No.
But what else would you use it for?
Opening really thick letters?
Killing people?
Why do you have it?
It's not mine.
You're telling me this is Nick's?
I'm going to show you something.
But you can't tell anyone.
I know.
Nick was always into weird stuff, but I never expected this.
These symbols mean witch hunter.
Same as the girl had on her blade.
Why didn't you show me these?
To protect him.
I know how this looks.
He was no traitor.
No, of course not.
There's no way Nick was a witch hunter.
But she was, so-- so, what's the connection?
I don't know yet.
Maybe Nick was looking into that witch hunter stuff and got on their radar.
You think Nick's the reason she came here?
Let me see the knife.
Well, isn't this creepy.
Is this what it takes to get you excited, a little girl with a knife?
Cassie, I can't find Melissa, we should get back.
I thought you were going to distract him.
I tried.
I didn't realize you were waiting for him in his room.
No, I was looking for something.
But then, I found something else.
Oh!
Hello?
Cassie, my name is Calvin Wilson.
We met at my shop earlier today.
Of course.
I left something for you.
You're in danger.
In danger?
What do you mean?
Mr. Wilson?
Mr. Wilson.
No costume on Halloween?
Hello?
Mr. Wilson?
Sorry.
No problem.
I think I got something on your face.
May I?
Was my warning not specific enough?
I wasn't going to tell her anything about you.
Remember this?
I had a feeling you'd try to be a hero.
Please.
This is just something personal.
It doesn't concern you.
Try me.
All right.
She has dark magic inside her.
So why are you so desperate to tell her?
So she can fight it.
Maybe stop it from overcoming her.
You think people can change who they are?
Of course.
I don't.
Out.
Now.
Oh, hey, Adam.
Have you found Melissa and Diana?
Because the guy I met at the antiquities shop called, freaked out, and I think he was trying to warn me about w--
Luke?
You bleed just like us.
But you're not.
That's enough.
Finish the cruet.
- What's going on?
- Witch hunters.
This is a ring of iron sulphide to stop your powers.
Science prevailing over your ungodly magic.
We haven't done anything wrong.
But you will.
Luke, please.
Stop this.
Tell him that we're not a threat.
You bound your circle, Cassie.
No one to blame but yourselves.
So you've been spying on us all this time, just to narc to other witch hunters?
Like my father did.
And his father.
You aren't the only ones born into a legacy.
At least I can be proud of mine.
Enough.
Finish it.
"Watch the witch, but never trust him,
"for his every thought is a sin, his every word a lie."
You have to stop this.
You shouldn't be here.
Cassie has dark magic.
All magic is dark.
Not like this.
Cassie isn't like other witches, Isaac.
She's stronger.
We can't kill her this way.
You have to trust me.
You've become a great asset to me.
But you are too close to this.
I won't stop it.
Luke, don't.
Look, Luke, I'm your friend.
That's why I wanted to be the one to do this.
I'm freeing you from a life of sin.
That's not true.
I'm sorry, Diana.
You have a good heart, but it's not enough to protect you from your true nature.
This will be fast.
I promise.
No!
Oh my God.
Trust me now?
Are you ok?
A guy--a guy in a pig mask jumped me and brought me here.
I fought him off.
Where did he go?
There was an explosion from inside, and he ran off.
Another guy came running out, too.
What happened in there?
It's me.
It's ok.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
I was worried.
It's ok.
I'm ok.
When he had your blood...
I know.
It's all so real now.
My whole life, everyone said,
"there's that kid who lost his mom.
How sad."
But you can't lose something you never had.
Every day, my dad pulls away a little more.
You are my home, Diana.
Maybe I'm just supposed to just let you go now, but I can't.
Because I can't lose everything I have all at once.
I want to get past this.
I know not everything can be perfect.
But I have to believe that it can be, just so fighting for it makes sense.
And you're not a believer?
Not right now.
You look a little rattled.
Oh.
I just--how can there be people out there that hate us so much, you know?
It's like, we haven't done anything.
We didn't choose this.
We were--we were born this way.
People don't understand.
What they don't understand scares them.
You seem so calm about it all.
I've been at this longer than you.
Have you ever done magic on your own?
I...
I think I did something on my own tonight.
Really?
I think I stopped one of those witch hunters from killing Diana.
That's a pretty good trick.
So, why didn't they round you up with the rest of us?
Don't trust me, huh?
Not really.
That's ok.
I don't mind having to earn it.
Mmm.
Good luck with that.
Henry?
Henry, it's Jane.

Previously on The Secret Circle...
My sweet Cassie, you finding this means I'm gone, and for that I am so sorry.
I didn't want you to have this life, but destiny's not easy to run from.
Hi.
I'm Diana.
- You seen her yet?
- She got in yesterday.
- We're different.
- You're different.
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded 100% witch.
Here we have real power now.
A complete circle is 6.
You complete the circle.
She's got the gift.
You can get Cassie to do what we need?
The circle will take care of that without even knowing it.
There was a guy in Nick's yard last night.
It must have been his older brother Jake.
He left town a couple of years ago.
He was a troubled young man.
- What do you want?
- Your blood.
Aah!
Get off of her.
We did a spell together to send her away.
So, you know you're a witch.
Your dad told me about you and Cassie being destined to be together.
I've been standing on the sidelines watching it since she got here.
I can't do that anymore.
I've come here to rid Chance Harbor of witches, and I will not fail.
[Music playing]
Faye:
What do you think?
Those are ancient artifacts, not a Halloween costume.
Whatever.
I'm a sexy witch Doctor.
Take it off.
We shouldn't be drawing attention to ourselves.
Relax, it's Halloween.
We're just blending in with all the supernatural wannabes.
And is there a more perfect place for party decorations?
Uh, no, we're not having a party.
Just a get-together.
That was the deal.
My grandmother's only gone for the night.
I know.
And I'm impressed that you agreed without me having to resort to blackmail.
No, I just-
- I think it'll be a good break for us.
Halloween's the night to pretend you're someone else, right?
Sluttier versions of someone else, but I get your point.
And maybe it'll be good for Adam and Diana.
Is that what this is about?
You feel bad about breaking them up, and now, you're throwing a party to lure them back together?
No, I did not break them up.
I think that the best way to cover up the fact that you tried to steal her boyfriend is to get one of your own.
How about Luke?
I--pfft!
No.
I blew my chance when I became the world's worst dance date.
Ecch.
Luke.
Hi.
So, Cassie's having a party tonight, and she would love for you to come.
No, it is just a--a get-together.
And I totally understand if you don't want to, or if you have other, better plans.
Sure.
Ok.
So, I'll see you tonight?
See you then.
And now, you have a hot guy to flirt with at the party.
Done.
So what about you?
I have a target in mind.
- Jake?
- Maybe.
Let me change out of these artifacts.
Will you buy this for me?
As a reward for being so helpful?
Um, hmm.
Hi.
Happy Halloween.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Blake?
Any relation to Amelia Blake?
She was my mother.
Well.

Jane:
Wilson's.
It's been there as long as I can remember.
The guy who owns the place seemed to know me.
Or at least knew mom.
Calvin Wilson.
Is he one of us?
A witch?
Yes.
Why, did he say something to you?
No.
I touched his hand by mistake, and then, the mirror behind him shattered.
It was really strange.
Residual power and active power crossing.
It could've just been a random surge.
How many witches are there in Chance Harbor?
Hard to know exactly.
People tend to be private about it.
But a lot less than there used to be.
After the fire, everyone stopped practicing.
Many families left town.
Right.
Like us.
I'd better get going to Henry's lake house.
It's a long drive.
You sure you're going to be ok here?
Absolutely.
Henry's an elder, isn't he?
Well, I just thought that you didn't want to tell anyone that we'd bound the circle, especially elders.
I'm not going to tell him about the circle.
But I haven't heard from him in weeks, and I'm worried.
You have friends coming to stay with you here, right?
Yeah.
All the girls will be here.
We're going to do a low-key Halloween thing, like hand out candy to trick-or-treaters and watch some movies.
Good.
Bye, grandma.
Morning.
Thought you'd still be sleeping it off.
I'm fine.
The keys to the boathouse weren't on the hook.
You forget to put them back, I guess.
Sorry about that.
And I appreciate the concern, but I'm fine.
Do you remember that Diana broke up with me 'cause you told her how Cassie and I were written in the stars?
I know it's hard to understand.
No, I understand perfectly.
Since you've already ruined your life, you've decided to destroy mine.
That's not fair.
Diana loved me.
And the more I tried to be worthy of it, the better I got, and the further I got from being you.
I don't want you to be me either.
Trust me.
But messing with fate will get you there faster than you know.
Please stop using fate as an excuse for what you did to mom.
Did you ever even love her?
'Cause the way you talk about Amelia, it doesn't seem like it.
You got a lot of great stuff.
Thanks for coming over to help set up.
No problem.
I love Halloween.
And I could use the distraction.
Have you and Adam talked at all since the wake?
No.
I wish I could help somehow--
I don't even want to talk about it.
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Oh, of course.
Sorry.
Ok.
I know there's a big bag of plastic cups somewhere in here.
What is that?
Uh, zombie?
Got it from the drama club.
This is just the beginning.
Melissa:
There's a trunkload of stuff.
Faye invited them so they'd let us take as much as we wanted.
Oh, my God.
Diana:
What's wrong?
This is part of the blade that girl used to attack me.
It must have broken off.
Melissa:
It looks old.
That's the Crescent moon symbol she burned in the ground.
Hey.
[Grunts]
Happy Halloween.
First one as a witch, very important.
Yes.
Thanks.
Uh, I found something.
What is it?
It's a piece of the weapon that girl used to attack me.
Found it in the kitchen.
Where are you taking it?
Just the antiquities shop by the boardwalk.
Thought I'd try to figure out what it is and what these two symbols mean.
You sure that's a good idea?
It might tip off who you really are.
And that witch is gone, so there's not much to do about it, anyway.
I told you the night she died that there's too much I don't know about witchcraft.
It's time I learned.
I don't want us to be sitting targets anymore.
I get that.
I'll be careful about what I tell him.
Don't worry.
Let me know how it goes.
I'll see you later?

[Rings]
Sorry, I'm closed for lunch.
Thought I locked up.
You did.
Calvin Wilson, right?
That's right.
I made a couple of calls and found out that the Wilsons have been around this area forever.
A long time.
Maybe you knew my parents?
Richard and Sara Armstrong?
No.
I didn't really know them, either.
I was pretty young when they died.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
But that's not why I came here.
Do you have any witch cruets?
Excuse me?
I have a few, but I'm always looking for more.
I use them for salad dressing, but apparently, they're meant for killing witches.
Is that right?
[Grunts]
All you need is mandrake root and some blood.
Ahh!
[Grunts and gasps]
And a personal item that's absorbed some of the witch's energy.
Please.
It's my wedding ring.
Then as long as the cruet's been spelled, all you have to do next is throw in a match, and ding dong, the witch is dead.
But you knew that, didn't you?
You're not a very powerful witch, are you, Calvin?
[Match strikes]
If Cassie Blake comes in here and asks any questions, all you're going to say is, "I don't know."
Got it?
Yes.
I swear it.
Great.
Probably best you don't carry these in your shop.
Dangerous things.
[Bell rings]
Mr. Wilson?
Oh.
You were here this morning.
I have something to show you.
I'm a little busy here.
Ok.
Well, can you just tell me what it is?
I don't know.
I wish I could be more helpful.
Hmm.
Ok.
Well, if you--if you think of anything, then, um...
I will write down my name and my number, and you can call me.
All right.
Oh, my God.
I--that was so dumb.
I'm sorry.
Can I help you clean it up?
Do you have, like, a broom or something?
Of course, I will pay for it.
Never mind.
I'll do it.
[Phone beeps and shutter clicks]
Jake.
You miss him, too?
Not exactly.
I'm here for them.
Look, you don't have to be all tough.
We both loved him.
I hadn't seen Nick in two years.
When I was living here, all we did was fight.
So take this trip down memory lane by yourself.
Wow.
Great Big Brother.
He was playing with things that he shouldn't have.
He wound up dead.
I could've told him.
But you weren't here to do that.
You just left.
So maybe this is on you.
You know, I actually thought we might be able to be friends, that we had something in common.
I'm nothing like the rest of you.
Trust me.
[Crow caws]
Ok.
See how close you can get to this one, the third symbol.
It could be an old crest.
People used to etch them into objects of all kinds.
It's like a family seal.
[Beeps]
All right.
I recreated the images on the sketch pad app and ran a search.
Might take a few minutes to scan for matches.
[Beeping]
I--I called Diana, she should be here, too.
If she knows I'm here, she won't come.
I don't blame her.
Ever since I was little, my dad would talk about how he was supposed to be with Amelia, and how I'm fated to be with Amelia's daughter.
I should have known he'd say it to Diana, too.
But this breakup isn't his fault--it's mine.
The only reason Diana believed what he said is because it's the way I've been acting.
I'm sorry for anything I did to make that worse.
I don't know what's between you and me, exactly.
But I know that without Diana, I'm not much of anything.
Then you should fight for her.
Show her that.
Faye:
Forbidden love.
So adorable.
Am I interrupting?
Uh, no, no.
Did you find anything in my book about the symbols on the blade?
No.
But I did find a cool attraction spell for future reference.
[Beeps] I got a match.
Cassie:
That's it.
Does it belong to any family name?
Not a family.
A society.
The Geticas, also known as "The Hunters."
This goes back all the way to the Middle Ages.
Hunters?
[Beeps]
Its motto is from ancient text--
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
So the girl who attacked me wasn't a crazy witch.
She was a witch hunter.
Adam Conant...
Diana Meade...
Faye Chamberlain...
Melissa Glaser... and Cassie Blake.
As angry as you were at Simone for hurrying along the process, at least she did the marking.
Now you don't have to.
Simone ignored the plan.
She could have ruined everything.
If you kill a bound witch the wrong way, their powers can pass to other witches, make them stronger.
We can't afford mistakes.
Which is why some of us are worried about a plan that hinges on you.
Witchcraft took my parents and my brother.
I know which side I'm on.
Now, do you want me to do this or not?
Because if I don't spell these, they're just fancy bottles, and you're back to burning witches at the stake.
Go ahead.
Spell the vessels.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
Let light rise out of darkness.
It's done.
Add their blood, the objects, set it on fire, they die.
And their magic dies with them.
Good.
We can't risk outing you in the process.
So, we'll have some brothers at the party, doing the gathering for you.
Ian came with us from Salem.
And one of our hunters is from here in town.
He's very familiar with the targets.
That girl lied to you.
She wasn't a witch.
What are you talking about?
We found out what those symbols mean.
- And?
- She was a witch hunter.
Wait.
If she was a witch hunter, why would she bother lying to me?
I don't know.
Are you sure she didn't say anything else to you?
No, just exactly what I told you.
- Hmm.
- How do you know she wasn't just some crazy witch?
What else have you really got to go on?
Just those 3 symbols?
Um, I'll see you at the party tonight?
I might drop by.
Yeah.
[Electronica playing]
You know, it's times like this I pity the normals.
They will never be this cool.
What else can we do?
Bats.
Take flight and dive.
Both:
Take flight and dive.
Ohh!
[Laughs]
[Laughs]
[Both laughing]
Aah!
[Laughter]
Wow, nice work.
Um, hey, look, when Jake shows up, do you think you can keep him occupied?
Why do you think I'm wearing this?
Oh.
Right.
Wait, why do you want him occupied?
When I showed him the fleam, he knew that there were 3 symbols when mine was missing one.
He obviously knows more than he's telling us.

What's left that you want me to say?
Tell me how to fix this.
Adam, don't.
I love you.
So if I let you forget that...
Then let me try again.
I know we can work it out.
We shouldn't have to work so hard.
Not everything is perfect, Diana.
Sometimes--sometimes, things get a little out of control.
But that doesn't mean it's wrong.
Like Cassie?
Whiskey, neat, right?
Good memory.
I'm impressed.
Don't be.
What brings you across town?
Can't an old friend just stop by for a visit?
Not after 16 years, no.
Maybe I wasn't in your circle, but I never gave you a reason not to trust me.
You shouldn't have come here.
Well, it wasn't on the top of my list, either, but Amelia Blake's daughter came to my store this morning.
Really.
Why's that?
Thought you might know.
She was asking questions about some old hunting acquaintances of ours.
It's funny.
I couldn't see much of her mother in her, at first, not until she told me who she was.
You know how it is with kids.
It's hard to predict which parent they'll favor.
She's Amelia's daughter, Cal.
Are you sure?
'Cause you were always a bit blind when it came to Amelia.
We were all blind except Amelia, in the end.
She doesn't even know who her father really was, does she?
What he was attempting to do that night?
And there's no reason she should.
Why not?
Especially if she's as much like Amelia as you say.
Just leave it alone.
She needs to know about John Blackwell.
She has a right to protect herself.

Come on, Faye.
[Exhales]
Don't try and deny something's going on.
Is this going to be drama?
No.
No drama.
But something's different with you.
You were always an ass, and you always had a cruel streak.
But you were never distant.
Not when we were like this.
Maybe you just always thought there was more there, and there wasn't.
No.
I've felt it since you got back.
[Door opens]
Looking for something?
Uh, just Nick's MP3 player, for Melissa.
You know, their songs?
I thought it might help her.
Did you think stabbing it to death would get her the closure she needs?
No.
But what else would you use it for?
Opening really thick letters?
Killing people?
Why do you have it?
It's not mine.
You're telling me this is Nick's?
I'm going to show you something.
But you can't tell anyone.
[Drawer opens]
I know.
Nick was always into weird stuff, but I never expected this.
These symbols mean witch hunter.
Same as the girl had on her blade.
Why didn't you show me these?
To protect him.
I know how this looks.
He was no traitor.
No, of course not.
There's no way Nick was a witch hunter.
But she was, so-- so, what's the connection?
I don't know yet.
Maybe Nick was looking into that witch hunter stuff and got on their radar.
You think Nick's the reason she came here?
Let me see the knife.
Well, isn't this creepy.
Is this what it takes to get you excited, a little girl with a knife?
Cassie, I can't find Melissa, we should get back.
I thought you were going to distract him.
I tried.
I didn't realize you were waiting for him in his room.
No, I was looking for something.
But then, I found something else.
[Cell phone rings]
Oh!
[Ring]
Hello?
Cassie, my name is Calvin Wilson.
We met at my shop earlier today.
Of course.
I left something for you.
You're in danger.
In danger?
What do you mean?
Mr. Wilson?
Mr. Wilson.
No costume on Halloween?
Hello?
Mr. Wilson?
[Indistinct electronica playing]
Sorry. [Chuckles] No problem.
I think I got something on your face.
May I?
[Grunting]
Was my warning not specific enough?
I wasn't going to tell her anything about you.
Remember this?
I had a feeling you'd try to be a hero.
Please.
This is just something personal.
It doesn't concern you.
Try me.
[Stammers]
All right.
She has dark magic inside her.
So why are you so desperate to tell her?
So she can fight it.
Maybe stop it from overcoming her.
You think people can change who they are?
Of course.
I don't.
[Choking and grunting]
Out.
Now.
[Indistinct talking]

Luke?
[Gasps]
You bleed just like us.
But you're not.
That's enough.
Finish the cruet.
[Gasps]
- What's going on?
- Witch hunters.
This is a ring of iron sulphide to stop your powers.
Science prevailing over your ungodly magic.
We haven't done anything wrong.
But you will.
Luke, please.
Stop this.
Tell him that we're not a threat.
You bound your circle, Cassie.
No one to blame but yourselves.
So you've been spying on us all this time, just to narc to other witch hunters?
Like my father did.
And his father.
You aren't the only ones born into a legacy.
At least I can be proud of mine.
Enough.
Finish it.
"Watch the witch, but never trust him,
"for his every thought is a sin, his every word a lie."
You have to stop this.
You shouldn't be here.
Cassie has dark magic.
All magic is dark.
Not like this.
Cassie isn't like other witches, Isaac.
She's stronger.
We can't kill her this way.
You have to trust me.
You've become a great asset to me.
But you are too close to this.
I won't stop it.
Luke, don't.
Look, Luke, I'm your friend.
That's why I wanted to be the one to do this.
I'm freeing you from a life of sin.
That's not true.
I'm sorry, Diana.
[Gasps] You have a good heart, but it's not enough to protect you from your true nature.
This will be fast.
I promise.
No!

Cassie:
Are you ok?
A guy--a guy in a pig mask jumped me and brought me here.
I fought him off.
Where did he go?
There was an explosion from inside, and he ran off.
Another guy came running out, too.
What happened in there?
It's me.
It's ok.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
I was worried.
It's ok.
I'm ok.
When he had your blood...
I know.
It's all so real now.
My whole life, everyone said,
"there's that kid who lost his mom.
How sad."
But you can't lose something you never had.
Every day, my dad pulls away a little more.
You are my home, Diana.
Maybe I'm just supposed to just let you go now, but I can't.
Because I can't lose everything I have all at once.
I want to get past this.
I know not everything can be perfect.
But I have to believe that it can be, just so fighting for it makes sense.
And you're not a believer?
Not right now.
[Door opens and shuts]
[Crickets]
You look a little rattled.
Oh.
I just--how can there be people out there that hate us so much, you know?
It's like, we haven't done anything.
We didn't choose this.
We were--we were born this way.
People don't understand.
What they don't understand scares them.
You seem so calm about it all.
I've been at this longer than you.
Have you ever done magic on your own?
I...
I think I did something on my own tonight.
Really?
I think I stopped one of those witch hunters from killing Diana.
That's a pretty good trick.
So, why didn't they round you up with the rest of us?
Don't trust me, huh?
[Chuckles] Not really.
That's ok.
I don't mind having to earn it.
Mmm.
Good luck with that.

Samuel Mfana.
Mike, Foxtrot, Alpha, November, Alpha.
He's one of the original kidnappers.
Naomi got hit.
Do you hear me?
She got hit.
Whoever took her might use a hospital.
All right, check the hospitals.
I gotta go.
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!
On your knees!
OK, I'm going down.
Slowly.
(RINGS)
Hello, Angela.
What happened?
What is it?
Let's go, sweetheart.
That's it.
He's dead, you let him die.
His family don't want a dead man.
Just business.
Naomi, come to me!
Come to my voice!
I lost my hostage.
How could this happen twice?
Mr Shaffer...
How did these other kidnappers even know about Naomi?
That's what we're trying to establish.
How the hell did he get it so wrong?
Sometimes hostage victims are passed up the kidnap chain.
They...
You have no idea who's got her.
The new kidnappers seem to be professionals, which will make negotiating with them much more straightforward.
Naomi's a valuable commodity to them, they'll want to protect that.
They've got Naomi and the money?
Yes.
Will our insurance still cover this?
We'll deal directly with Lloyds about the second payout.
Your negotiator stood by while my wife was shot.
Mr King is doing everything possible to resolve the situation.
I gave you friendly advice, Mr King.
Good advice.
"Keep me informed.
Don't ride roughshod over my authority."
Clearly the message didn't get through.
I'm going to have to try a different approach.
Why were you there, Inspector Lanning?
What?
The middle of nowhere - you got there quickly.
Someone heard gunshots, gave us a call.
12 men, four cars, arrived in three minutes.
That's remarkable.
I must have been tipped off by the kidnappers?
I...must be corrupt?
I don't know.
Are you?
I tracked your rental car from your hotel.
But we lost the signal for about 20 minutes.
Pity.
I could've had the kidnappers and Naomi Shaffer.
Do you know how most kidnap victims get killed?
Tell me.
Police rescue attempts.
(LAUGHS)
That's funny, cos...
I can't imagine anyone doing a worse job than you did.
You were found with a dead body.
With a gun.
I could hold you here...for a very long time.
Who took Naomi?
I don't know.
But you know something.
One of the men had a tattoo on the inside of his wrist.
White man, white wrist.
It's a dagger in a flame.
That's military.
Interesting.
I'm gonna let you go...on one condition.
You keep me informed.
This new lot calls you, you call me.
Will you do that?
No.
Give him his stuff, let him go.
Er...
Just one thing.
This.
Samuel Mfana, I'll check it out.
(PHONE RINGS)
Dom, are you all right?
Don't worry, it's OK, I'm out now.
I'm going to stay in Cape Town and wait for the call.
So can you get Carrie out here?
Sure.
I'll get her on a flight.
When you can, all right.
Bye.
(MAN SCREAMING)
DIETER:
You had to go and get greedy...
Aaargh!
You little greedy fuck!
Aaargh!
Please, please don't hurt me!
I went along with Mikey.
But I called you in the end!
I know that, Sammy.
But you still haven't told me what the moneyman told you!
Aargh!
Tell me now!
You want to see what pain is?
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)
(GUNSHOT)
(WHIMPERS)
Sit.
Sorry about the noise, and the stench.
So where did your interest in plants come from?
Grow your own at college?
I tried that once.
Bought the lamps and everything.
Total disaster.
So what was it?
Window boxes.
Me and Mum had a top floor flat.
That's crafty, Naomi.
Very crafty.
Did you go on one of those courses?
Kidnap and Ransom:
What To Do In The Event Of.
"Remind your kidnapper you're not just a price tag, you're a human being."
I didn't mean anything by it.
Too late.
I'm hooked, totally hooked.
Where was Dad in this top floor flat?
He was dead.
Good answer.
And a true one, to boot.
I'm sure he'd be proud of you.
(GAGS)
(CRIES OUT)
(GUNSHOTS)
Up now!
Come on!
Is that the girl?
Yes, yes!
Is that the girl?
Yes!
You're gonna be sorry, Sammy!
(SCREAMS)
We trusted you!
Angela, did you get anything back on Samuel Mfana?
Yes, he was a security guard for a firm called Citadel.
I think he knew the gang who've taken Naomi.
(SHOUTING)
I just assumed word had got round.
White woman hostage...
I'll do it.
Thank you.
..time and place of handover.
But you now think they knew each other.
Yeah, I do.
(FOOTSTEPS)
I want a bathroom.
I want a bathroom.
I'm looking for Inspector Lanning.
All right.
Thanks.
Inspector?
(SPEAKS LOCAL LANGUAGE)
DOMINIC:
Thank you.
How did you find me?
I bribed your desk sergeant.
This is Carrie Heath, she works with me.
Inspector Lanning.
Hi.
Samuel Mfana, the name you gave me...
Yeah.
He was murdered.
They dumped his body outside his house, yesterday.
Did you know that?
No, I didn't know that.
Would you have told me if I hadn't found you here?
No.
Now I've got three homicides and a missing person.
Nice work, Mr King.
Anyway, this place belongs to Samuel's friend, Mikey Snyders.
Gang boy, small fry.
I wonder...what made him interested in Mrs Shaffer?
Shall I show you where they held her?
What are you doing here?
I want to help.
Samuel Mfana, he worked for Citadel Security?
What's your point?
The guys with the tattoos they were with...
White Plains Regiment.
I followed up on that.
Ex-military, most go into security.
Couldn't they have worked for Citadel Security as well?
See, my point...is that I think Samuel and his friend, they knew these people.
You think or you know?
Well...
I think.
Well, if you'd seen what they did to his body you'd certainly say they had a score to settle.
Kidnap to order, they didn't deliver so they thought they'd keep the money.
And Samuel, he was the one who got punished.
I've got a few phone calls to make.
Don't go anywhere.
Thank you.
(FLIES BUZZING)
Oh, God!
Well, listen to this.
Samuel Mfana worked with an ex-marine called Dieter DeVries, ex-White Plains Regiment, on a security job for Citadel last summer.
What was the job?
ConradVictra Pharmaceuticals.
Interesting, eh?
Do you think that that's maybe how they found out about Mrs Shaffer?
They're in the same world.
Pharmaceuticals.
We're going to go to the DeVries residence now.
It's not my place here, Inspector, but that's not a good idea.
You don't want to destroy the only link we have to Naomi.
Don't worry, if she's not there, we'll make sure he tells us where she is.
But what worries me is if she is there.
You're welcome to join us, Mr King.
Police rescue attempts.
Yeah, yeah, I heard you the first time.
Make the call now.
(RINGING TONE)
(PHONE RINGS)
Jane Wickham.
Can you talk, Jane?
Are you alone?
Who is this?
Someone with an interest in the welfare of Naomi Shaffer.
Who are you?
A businessman.
Do you have Naomi?
What I want to know, Jane, is what Naomi is worth to your company?
What's in her head?
Is it gold?
I can't talk to you.
Just tell me what's she worth to your company.
I thought she was going to build you a factory, make you lots of money.
I can't talk to you about this.
I'll give you the number of our response specialists.
I don't wanna talk to any bloody response specialists, I wanna talk to...
It's a London number.
0207... 946... 0233.
Jane...
Get up!
(SHOUTING)
It's not them.
WOMAN:
What have I done?
I haven't done...
DeVries' wife.
Says she hasn't seen him in months or heard from him.
Same story at Citadel Security.
That's a bit of luck for you.
What do you mean?
If they had been holding her there, she'd be dead by now.
(PHONE RINGS)
It's Angela.
Hello.
The kidnappers made contact with Jane Wickham.
I'm sending you the recording now.
Good.
Send it.
That means she's alive.
Wickham gave them your crash number, expect their call.
(PHONE RINGS)
Hello.
Dominic King.
Yes.
Can I ask you what your name is?
We might be talking quite a lot, so what would you like me to call you?
Don't call me anything.
Are you there?
Yes, I'm here.
You're the "response specialist", so respond.
First I need to know that you have Naomi and that she's in good health.
I have Naomi and she's in good health.
She was shot.
The wound's been seen to.
I need to speak to her.
You need to go back to the insurance company and find out...
No, until I hear from Naomi, I cannot negotiate on her behalf.
Talk.
Hello?
Naomi.
I'm the negotiator.
Dominic King.
Please, get me out of here.
Keep calm.
Naomi, I want you to tell me where you and your husband were married?
What are you talking about?
In what church were you and your husband married?
We weren't married in a church.
Please...
That's enough.
Please tell Sally I love her.
Sssh!
Take her back.
(CRACKLING)
Are you on a radio?
So?
Taking all the precautions.
Using a radio strap.
I sense a military brain.
Here's the deal.
I know she has kidnap insurance.
Anything less than the max and she's dead.
Do you understand?
I don't know the max.
Well, I'll call you again.
(SIGHS)
(RUNNING WATER)
Don't worry, it'll heal.
You're still pretty.
Can I have a cigarette?
I didn't know you smoked.
There you go.
(COUGHS) God.
It's strong.
Don't breathe in so deep, you'll be sick.
Aaargh!
(SHOUTING) She's out!
(CRIES OUT)
NAOMI:
I'm sorry.
Argh!
Fook...fookin' get away with it!
NAOMI: (SOBS) I'm sorry.
Sorry.
(BRIN CRIES OUT IN PAIN)
Best thing about breaking up is making up.
I'm sorry, no.
No!
(CLOTHES TEAR)
(NAOMI SCREAMS)
I'll make you some dinner in a minute.
I don't want dinner, thank you.
Fine, then don't eat.
Bought all this food for nothing.
(PHONE RINGS)
(STOPS RINGING)
Oh!
Hi, it's me.
I've been trying to get hold of you guys.
Hope you're OK.
I'm fine.
Everything's going... slow here, as always.
Anyway...
Call me.
I miss you both.
Lots of love.
Now don't your nails look nice?
Colour looks great.
Sharon...have you ever known families where the mother didn't come home?
Sal, I've got to get to work now.
You all right?
I'll see you tonight.
Everything's going to be fine.
Bye.
OK.
Bye.
OK.
Have you got your inhaler?
Two million dollars, that's what I want.
That sort of money doesn't exist.
Well, then, goodbye.
No.
We can talk about this.
Talk all you want, she's dead.
You...you go down that road, nobody wins.
Two million dollars.
King?
Hello?
Are you there?
(SPLASHING)
What's that noise?
It's me.
I'm having a pee.
You have to drink a lot of water in the heat.
Well, go right ahead.
I should apologise.
What?
Calling you Mr King.
Should be Colonel.
(TOILET FLUSHES)
I said it should be Colonel.
The 9th/12th Dragoons, no less.
(TOILET LID CLATTERS)
Hello?
Hang on a minute.
Sorry, I can't hear you.
(RUNNING WATER)
What?
Are you...?
King?
Are you there?
Sorry?
(CRACKLING)
You finished now?
So you looked me up.
Well done.
Are you alone, King?
In what sense?
In the sense is anyone else listening?
Yes.
Good.
You could've lied.
Never promise, never lie.
What's that, words of wisdom for the negotiating professional?
OK, Colonel, if you're a man of your word, then you tell me what she's worth.
You want me to give you a figure?
I want you to give me a figure.
400,000.
You've already got 100,000.
Half a million dollars.
(HANGS UP)
What do you think?
I think he's going to settle.
Two million to 400,000, in one conversation.
That's impressive.
I just didn't expect it all to happen...so quickly.
Naomi, come to me!
Come to my voice!
I lost my hostage.
He's dead, you let him die.
His family don't want a dead man.
Just business.
AMANDA:
Where did you go after the handover?
We couldn't reach you.
I've never lost a hostage, took a bit of processing.
(PHONE RINGS)
Yeah, we have a deal.
(DOOR UNLOCKED)
Naomi...
I've agreed a price.
I'm sending you home.
You remember what that means?
You'd better.
Are you getting me?
Say something.
Ba bom bom.
Yeah.
Good.
(MESSAGE ALERT)
Bank account information's come through.
Got it.
Yeah.
(PHONE RINGS)
I'm here.
I know.
Two of you.
You're showing your age, Colonel.
I am my age.
Do you have Naomi?
I do.
Money first.
It doesn't work like that.
No money until I see Mrs Shaffer.
You're a very obstinate man.
Man with a wheelchair.
Quarter to 12.
Quarter to 12, in a wheelchair.
See her yet?
Do you see her?
I see her.
You make a move and she dies.
Is she all right?
She's fine.
She's sleeping.
Just send the money.
I'm telling you, Colonel, go anywhere near her, you die.
OK, that's enough.
Just send the money now or you both get a bullet.
You want me to take that shot, boss?
Last chance.
Naomi, it's Dominic.
Sorry.
You're OK now.
You're going home.
Send the money or you're both dead.
Do it, Carrie.
Done.
(PHONE RINGS)
Yeah?
Funds are cleared.
Gone through?
Yes, sir, transaction complete.
Pleasure doing business with you, Colonel.
I'm sorry.
All right?
Sorry...
All right.
Your mum's coming home, Sal.
She's coming home.
(SOUNDTRACK OVER SPEECH)
Goodbye.
Thank you, Mr King.
Hi.
All right?
Take care.
How is she?
Physically OK.
They fixed her up in Cape Town, ran all the standard tests, virals, HIV.
Was she raped?
She's not saying much.
But she's going to need to talk to somebody.
She didn't want to go to the hospital here?
No, she wanted to go straight home.
So do I.
(PHONE RINGS)
OK...
Dominic King.
Mr King, it's Lanning.
How can I help you, Inspector Lanning?
Can you help me?
(MOURNFUL SINGING)
Cos I suspect even if you could, you wouldn't.
You're home safe, Naomi Shaffer with you.
Yeah, we got lucky.
Naomi was released.
Luck had nothing to do with it, just money.
Do you know where I am?
I'm watching Benjamin Sisulu get buried.
The murdered taxi driver, remember him?
His wife and kids dressed smart.
Sad, you know.
Cos the son of a bitch who caused his death is probably a million dollars richer.
Are you proud of yourself, Mr King?
Is that what you're calling about, Inspector?
Yeah, I guess it is.
Hello?
Tess?
Tess?
Hi.
You OK?
Sorry, I didn't think you were coming home.
Sorry.
Do you mind, I'm...
It kept me safe.
Does it feel good to be home, Mummy?
It feels wonderful, my love.
It's what kept me going, thinking of you.
I cried every single night.
I'm so sorry.
I've taken tomorrow off.
And I can take the rest of the week off too.
No, It's all right.
I don't need you to, I'm fine.
No, darling, I'd like to.
Maybe we should let Mum get some rest.
(PHONE RINGS)
It's all right, darling, I'll get it.
Dom, I'm taking the mirror system off the Shaffer phones, right?
No, leave it on, please.
Another 48 hours.
No, it comes off.
She's been back a few days.
Well, go on then.
Out with it.
Just wouldn't hurt to keep an eye on her a little longer.
It's illegal.
Why would you want to?
Because I don't think we've got the full story.
From Naomi?
What about?
About any of it, really.
About why they released her, for instance.
We won this one.
Enjoy it, move on.
Thank you for bringing me home.
I'm so grateful.
Well, if I hadn't, I was going to pack it in, what I do.
Sorry, I have absolutely no idea why I told you that.
Why would you stop?
My last situation, a...hostage died.
And?
Isn't that like a doctor saying, "I lost a patient so I'm going to hang up my..."
What is it doctors hang up?
Stethoscopes?
Stethoscope.
I still really have no idea why they released you.
The insurance payment?
They were professionals.
No negotiator in the world can make 400,000 look good to someone who wants two million.
Well, I'm free.
Does it matter why?
I hope not.
Thank you.
I'm just pleased to be home.
How is everything with your husband?
Forgive me, it's just sometimes...
it can be difficult.
to explain exactly what you went through.
No, Philip's been great.
He really has.
Top myself up.
I'm fine.
(CAR ALARM DISABLED)
You sat on their heads?
(LAUGHTER)
You go to sleep, OK?
Night-night.
Now snuggle down.
Night-night, my love.
Night, Mum.
I'm glad that you're home.
(DIALS NUMBER)
(PHONE RINGS)
Hi.
Hi, darling.
Are you OK?
(SOBS)
I mean, I know you're not OK, but...
When are you coming home?
An hour or two.
What is it, Naomi?
What is it?
Please tell me.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Talk to me, honey, please.
Naomi.
Oh, it's all right.
Erm...
I'm going to bed now.
OK.
I won't be long.
(PHONE RINGS)
Philip?
No, it's not Philip.
I'm disappointed.
Why have you been talking to Dominic King?
He asked to see me.
How do I know that?
I didn't say anything.
I thought we had a deal.
I promise you.
I don't think I can rely on you, Naomi.
(LINE GOES DEAD)
Hello?
Hello?
(MUFFLED SCREAM) Hello, pretty.
Don't move.
No police.
(PHONE RINGS)
We made a deal and a deal has to be honoured.
I know she's alive.
You do this and we're finished.
This isn't a war.
Well, that's what you tell yourself.
I'm just asking you to use your relationship with the kidnappers.
It's an unacceptable risk, you're not playing a game.
Promise me you'll get her back.
(GUNSHOTS)
Do we have a deal or not?
In short.
I had been to a job interview that I thought I had failed.
"Do you speak English ?
- Yes.
- Where are you from ?
- Yes."
But they hired me.
For logistics.
They told me that I would do everything and nothing.
"You will do everything and nothing".
I realized that I was doing everything, and they were doing nothing.
Thinking again about it, I understood why he hired me.
"What are you asking for salary-wise ?"
"Well...
Er...
Money..." "Shit !"
I was making coffee, I was recharging the xerox.
One day, Fabien told me:
"It's the numbers, fuck, it doesn't work anymore!
Look!"
I pretended to type complicated things, without using the mouse so that it would look more American, and at some point, I just types on the Num Lock key.
I said: "it's fixed".
He told me: "You're a genius !" I thought: "You're a moron!".
"You're welcome."
After one month, I understood why an office was called like that.
Jean-Louis was the paper-clip.
Everyone was bending him in all directions, he will never be able to have his original shape again.
"You heard what I said Jean-Louis ?" "Yes."
Francis is the scotch tape.
He doesn't let you go.
"You're sure ?" "Yes."
"Mmh, good."
This lady, she's the glue.
She smells good, but she's intoxicating.
"I didn't tell you about my week-end ?"
"Since the weather was nice, we went to the countryside with my husband Christian, close to a lake.
We did some paddle boat!"
I don't give a shit.
"That's incredible!"
Jean-Michel is the stapler.
You never find it. (phone rings)
And Fabien is the post-it.
You see him from far away, he's sticky and she shows himself everywhere.
"She's got one of these asses, I wouldn't say no to it!"
I wondered if I was also a desk supply.
I understood that I was the trash bin.
At their feet, to help them get rid of what they didn't want.
I threw everything away, I said: "I'm leaving".
The scotch-tape told me: "You're sure ?" I said: "Yes." He said: "You won't have anything!" I said: "It's not a problem".
It was a problem.
"Are you sure ?" No.
- "Yes".
When I left, I told them to go fuck themselves.
"Good bye."
In short, I had a job.
"Did you hear what I said Jean-Louis ?
- Yes.
- You sure ?
- Yes.
- Didn't catch that, are you sure ?
- Yes!
- Arrghhh..."
"Are you sure ?
- Blgrgrg..."
Maybelle has a request.
Her beau... he wishes to call at the house.
Maybe a few days.
You have a family waiting that loves you.
How does it feel to have everything?
- Mr. Attorney General.
- What can I do for you, Nuck?
If you were ever planning on making good on a certain debt...
- But yours was a state election.
- So?
So I have no standing to intervene on a federal level.
You used to call him "the letch"... my father.
It must have been when I was still angry with him.
I was a mere child when Nucky brought me to your father, you're certainly right about that.
That card game you operate is located in territory that Mr. masseria considers to be his.
A tax of 10% on the game going forward...
- hold on...
- Charlie.
There's another speak off baltic.
Right time of night, you'll be good for a hundred cases.
Cash up front, officer.
- What are your talents, Mr. sleater?
- Making people stop.
I just received a call from Bill McCoy.
The Coast Guard is seizing his ships.
We'll not be needing your services.
You want this order or not?
Look, I've no quarrel with you, sir.
We're just not buying any liquor.
- What did he promise you?
- More than you ever did.
I will ruin you...
all of you.
- Jimmy!
- Have a nice dinner, gentlemen.
How was dinner with your father?
Which one?
Come on, you gotta help me move these barrels.
- Here we go.
- You can barely move in here.
You got your friends at the Coast Guard to thank for that.
Three ships' worth of booze... the Nina, the Pinta and the Canadian club.
Bill McCoy's probably still crying his eyes out.
On Nucky Thompson's shoulder.
What happened with you and Nucky anyway?
I guess that's between me and Nucky, isn't it?
We need more space, Mickey.
Ain't an empty garage in 10 Miles.
Then try 11.
Pay cash.
End of next summer we'll be the biggest distributors in the Northeast.
From the tiny acorn grows the mighty elk.
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous.
Yo, be careful with that.
Don't like not knowing what's going on.
That's what makes it exciting.
What the hell is that?
"The Pipes of Pan."
Goddamn cat in a rain barrel.
Open your eyes, if thou darest.
Ain't you the humdinger?
Silence, mortal.
I am Diana, daughter of Jupiter.
And no man may look upon my nakedness as I bathe.
This is one of your little performances.
You should have come, dear, at least once.
I never liked the idea of you parading around in front of other men.
You could have married me.
I had a city to run.
I understand.
I always have.
But I did have a boy to raise.
We're all here now, aren't we?
He has so much to learn from you.
I can't tell you what it means to us, after all this time.
And you're going to take care of him, aren't you?
Come here with that mouth.
Do you know what happened to the Shepherd who spied on the virginal Diana?
She turned him into a stag.
He tried to run away, but his own hounds tore him to pieces.
Get your ass over here.
Prepare for the righteous punishment of the gods.
Louis?
Louis!
Louis!
Louis!
What does the bee do?
Bring home honey.
What does the father do?
Bring home money.
What does the mother do?
Lay out the money.
What do children do?
Eat up the honey!
Lovely, dear.
- Very nice.
- Good morning.
- Munchkins.
- Good morning, Uncle Nucky.
- Could you not sleep?
- I have a busy day.
Will you be breakfasting, Mr. Thompson?
I will not.
Nor will I be dinnering.
It's Ed Bader's birthday.
Did I not mention that?
I take it there will be a party?
Oh, something small, make him feel important.
A meal in his honor maybe.
Well, be sure not to overindulge.
Mr. Sleater.
Good day, everyone.
Top o' the mornin'.
Isn't that what your people say?
And we also fix shoes if you leave them outside your door.
- Surely it isn't that funny.
- Yes ma'am.
Mr. Sleater will be driving me now.
It's all I can do to stick to the correct side of the road.
- I'll be right out.
- Sir, ma'am.
Katy.
Please ask Lilian to get the children dressed and to drill Teddy in his catechism.
Come, dears.
A bit cheeky, isn't he?
- What's that mean again?
- Impertinent.
He's serving a purpose.
And may I ask what that is?
You may, and I may not answer.
The weekly expenses.
There's a little extra for the staff.
- What for?
- To let them know they're appreciated.
This is no time to be frivolous with money.
It's $2 extra a piece.
It makes no difference to us, but to them it's a windfall.
You do realize they steal from us.
It's what servants do.
It's what everyone does.
And we pretend not to know and life goes on.
No one gave me a bonus when I was in service.
All the more reason to be generous now.
I'm nearly out of shaving soap.
Any more of them eggs?
You've had nearly half a dozen already, Albert.
Tell them chickens to work overtime.
- Daddy!
- There's my sweet pea.
- When did you get home?
- Last night, past your bedtime.
Crept in like the sandman.
Will you check my homework?
You're asking daddy?
Your mama'll do that for you.
Your brother know I'm too strict.
- If you say so.
- Stop toying with your father.
He know who bring home the bacon.
How my princess doin'?
Did you ask him, mother?
Ask me what?
Mama invited Samuel over for dinner tomorrow night.
Did she now?
We did discuss this.
If a young lady is being courted, it needs to be in a respectable manner.
He's planning to study medicine.
Hmph.
An educated buck.
Well, I suppose it'd be all right.
Dinner with all the fixings.
I been craving hoppin' John since the moon was blue.
Richard.
Good morning.
I'm here for Jimmy.
I thought he was with you.
His mother called late last night.
He left and I assumed...
Was everything all right?
He doesn't tell me anything.
This business with Nucky...
I saw him on the boardwalk.
He wouldn't even look at me.
Mmm, very bold.
My feeble attempt at expressionism.
There was an artist I saw in Paris.
He does cityscapes... very stark, no people.
De Chirico.
I don't know.
He also did figures who look like mannequins.
Have you ever posed for an artist?
No.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
I used to draw when I was a child.
It was very relaxing.
It can be.
It can also be maddening.
It took me years to be able to draw hands.
It's apoplexy...
a stroke.
His entire right side is paralyzed.
He can eat, but so far he's been unable to speak.
Was he agitated?
Overexcited in any way?
As I said, I found him like this.
- Shouldn't he be in a hospital?
- No.
No one can care for him like his family.
Commodore.
What do you want to say?
C... cock.
Cock!
Yeah, I...
I, uh...
- cockfuck!
- That's enough for now.
He needs to rest.
Jesus Christ, he's a fucking vegetable!
Keep your voice down, please.
- What are we gonna do now?
- He's going to be fine, dear.
- Not what Dr. Surran says.
- Without him running this thing,
- his political connections...
- Stop it right now!
The both of you!
Now you listen to me.
I didn't spend my life getting groped by a bunch of drunks to wind up in a goddamn poorhouse.
- I've got eight kids, Gillian.
- Jimmy and I are well aware of that.
"Jimmy and you.
" That's exactly... the two of you and... him?
!
None of that's normal.
It never was.
It's normal to me and to my son and his father.
And it suited you, didn't it?
Up till this morning.
Up till this morning the man with the clout wasn't drooling into his pajamas.
You have a cruel streak, Eli.
That's never an attractive quality.
- He can't even talk.
- Louis is unwell.
He's going to recover.
You need to calm down.
It's all going to work out.
- How the fuck would you know?
- Because Jimmy will handle it.
We're in for 70 grand to his cronies.
They'll get paid back when we unload the booze.
- What are you waiting for?
- The town's flush, Eli.
Then sell it out of town...
New York, Philadelphia.
You wanna give me names and addresses or should I just go door to door?
Why ask me?
You both got it all worked out, right?
Maybe this wasn't the best idea, letting Eli see him like that.
I'm sorry if I seemed heated, baby.
It's a difficult time for both of us.
I want ice cream!
Alcohol and cake.
Call it for 9:00 so nobody's expecting a full dinner.
Hors d'oeuvres only.
Dancing girls?
Wouldn't be much of a party otherwise, would it?
- Fine, then you handle that.
- How old is mayor bader?
The fuck do I know?
What's the difference?
- The candles for the cake.
- Don't make a production out of it.
He is the mayor of Atlantic city.
And not the Prince of Wales.
Tell them to send up some eggs florentine.
- And get me Arnold Rothstein on the phone.
- Ja.
Arnold?
A Nucky Thompson on the telephone?
I'll take it in here, darling.
How's our stomach?
It's still a little tentative.
So much apple bread.
It has a binding effect.
Is that the best thing right now?
Sound elimination is the basis of good health.
"Mr. Thompson."
Mr. Thompson, to what do I owe the pleasure?
A change in my circumstances, as I'm sure you've already heard.
And are we discussing a problem or a proposition?
That depends which side of the phone you're on.
I need a port to land some cargo.
I was under the impression Atlantic City was aptly named.
The Coast Guard's locked me down.
I can't land a mackerel.
Well, I have an import operation in Montauk.
Long Island.
Too far.
What about Philadelphia?
We'd have to cut in Waxey Gordon.
I'm listening.
There's my 20% and I'll convince Waxey that 20% for him is a fair price also.
That's a pretty penny, Arnold.
Of course my cut includes men to oversee the operation.
You remember Mr. Luciano.
- I do.
- Then it's settled.
Direct your ships to Philly and let me know the details.
You've got a new port of call.
I can already feel the brotherly love.
I'd like to thank Mr. White for joining us here today.
We know how busy he is and how hard he works for our community.
Ain't no matter, Wilfred.
Yes sir.
Now this is an informal gathering so we will not adhere to strict parliamentary rule, but if you could just raise your hands...
I give the floor to Mr. White.
Now I know y'all got your beefs and various complaints.
I hear an earful over the past weeks I've been in jail.
But I'm back now and everybody know my door always open.
- Mr. White.
- Yeah?
I don't mean to trouble you.
You ain't never no trouble, Mrs. Mayhew.
There's this couple next door to me.
They are habituated to late-night rent parties.
- Mmm mmm mmm.
- There's no end to rag music being played, and unseemly behavior on public view.
Well, you ain't gonna be bothered by none of that from now on.
Oh bless you, Mr. White.
Travis Elkins, sir.
I remember you fine, Travis.
Well, Mr. White, I been six months in the kitchen there at the Ritz?
Near 40 of us on second shift.
12 hours on our feet.
- Uh-huh.
- Wash our aprons, that come out your pay.
Break a cup, that come out your pay.
Give us the one meal...
if you call it that... it come out your pay too.
What they serve us, Mr. White, ain't fit for a dog tied to a stake post, and we working men.
- I'll look into that, Travis.
- Thank you, sir.
It's true.
Everybody, enjoy the refreshments.
- Mr. White.
- And remember, come July fourth,
- all y'all...
- What about my husband?
- How's that?
- Those white men cut his throat while he loading your trucks with your illegal liquor... sister, moderation in the lord's house.
Huh-uh.
What being' done about that?
You'll be looked after, I promise.
You promise.
You promise.
- My son is dead.
- I buried the father of my three children.
They bring my man home rolled up in a washbucket.
- Ladies, ladies.
- It's true.
- I said it'll be taken care of.
- When?
- How?
- Order, ladies, please.
Ain't nobody put you in charge.
You walk around, take a bite off everyone else's plate, don't give nothing back 'cept a summer clambake and a Christmas Turkey.
Continental tea garden, $422.
Morgan's oyster house, $216.
- Shall I tag them with currency straps?
- I'll do it.
- I don't mind, sir, I have...
- Johnny on the spot, are you?
Have you finished the affidavits for tomorrow's search warrants?
- I was in the process...
- Concern yourself with your own duties, agent Clarkson.
Yes sir.
I'll be in the W.C.
- According to "the New York Herald"...
- Do not start with that.
Half of all prohibition agents accept bribes... m not interested in discussing... or engage in some other form of illegal activity.
- Just because you saw in the paper...
- Come on, Stan.
You don't notice anything strange about him?
Where do I start?
I'm not talking personal habits.
A few weeks back, I'm down on Pacific coming from the podiatrist.
I spot him driving with another fella in a derby.
It was suspicious.
He didn't see me, so I tailed him.
- I did some snooping.
- You tailed our boss?
They went to a barn;
Trucks were coming and going;
The smell of alcohol was in the air;
It was a bootlegging operation.
- I'll tell the world.
- So he's sitting on it, waiting for the right time for us to make our move.
It was over a month ago.
Heads will roll, gentlemen.
- "Van Asshole."
- Sir?
Someone scribbled an obscenity on the water closet wall.
Due to recent events, it has become necessary that we scale back in an effort to conserve financially.
- Are we being sacked, ma'am?
- No.
Though I'm considering suggesting a wage cut
- across the board.
- If I may?
My husband has been unable to find employment...
- I support a crippled brother...
- I'm sure you all have hardships, which we've taken into consideration.
You'll each find an extra $2 in your pay this week.
Th-this week only, mam?
Yes.
As a bonus.
I believe it's customary to say thank you.
- Yes.
- Of course.
Thank you.
What is it, ladies?
Speak your minds.
Actually, ma'am, we were expecting a raise in pay.
- Whatever for?
- Mr. Thompson... a few weeks back he came in one night in... a rather jolly mood.
He told us he was raising our salaries.
Forgive me, ma'am, but he may have been drinking.
Well...
It's a special kind of fool who relies on the promise of a drunkard.
Now if there's nothing else?
- No ma'am.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
To your tasks then.
You talked to him about the cash upfront, right?
Munya!
We made it.
Manny Horvitz, this is the fella I called you about...
Jimmy Darmody.
- Mr. Horvitz.
- You're Darmody?
Oysh, he's just a baby.
I thought you liked em' young, Manny.
If we're talking veal, yes.
But when it comes to business...
- You speak yiddish?
- That's all I know.
Still you make an effort, I'm impressed.
Already I feel this is going well.
This man looks interesting.
My associate Mr. Harrow.
What happened to you?
I put my nose where it didn't belong.
You're funny.
He's a sweetheart and Mickey is a gonif from way back.
Chayem, introduce yourself.
- Herman Kaufman.
- All right, Herman.
First in his class at eastern state...
Penitentiary.
I'm kidding.
Herman only did county time.
Can I get you fellas something to eat?
- No, but thank you.
- Ahhh.
You're gonna smell the cooking and you're gonna get hungry.
So what's your pleasure, Mr. Horvitz?
Munya or Manny.
My pleasure?
I got a daughter.
She's an angel.
And my wife?
Ehh, ankles got thick, but I love her anyway.
And Waxey Gordon is a cocksucking piece of shit.
- Why is that?
- He's a greedy prick, with his hand in my ass pocket where my wallet should be.
- Fuckin' chazer.
- Eight years I work with the man.
Promises made and now where am I?
Talking to a baby in a butcher shop.
I like you, boychik.
Nice warm feeling.
We hear you're flush with hooch.
- You heard right.
- How'd you like to make some dough?
We didn't come to Philly for the brisket.
You got liquor.
We got money.
You see where I'm driving?
I need cash upfront.
Well, first consider I got restaurants, 30, 40 speaks, about 10 blocks or so in jewtown... weikel off somerset.
It's a nice opportunity.
We'd do 100 cases a week, build our business from there.
And stick it right up Waxey's tuchus.
Still has to be in advance.
Five grand, we can make delivery anytime.
That's a lot of green.
You could always say no.
We got a deal.
But just so we're clear, my icebox is filled with pieces of fellas who tried to fuck me over.
I just got creamsicles in mine.
Mr. Harrow will be in touch.
Gentlemen.
Mr. Dempsey, Mr. Dempsey.
Hey, Mr. Dempsey!
Champ, hey, champ!
Mr. Dempsey, please!
- Come on, Jack.
Gotta go.
- All right, all right.
That's it, all right.
Thank you, thank you.
- It's worse than being in the ring.
- Yeah, I know.
There we go.
There we go.
That's my lawyer over there.
- In a while you'll see his briefs.
- He's got his hands full.
Oh, gee!
That's it, girls.
Bring him in.
Ow ow!
Ohh.
Oink oink oink oink.
- Happy Birthday, Ed.
- Make a wish.
This was my wish.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you were in the middle of a city council meeting.
Jesus, is that who I think it is?
Jesus wouldn't last a round.
Jack Dempsey, say hello to our esteemed mayor Edward Bader.
Happy Birthday, sir.
I usually keep my trousers on for visiting dignitaries.
Hell, most of the fellas I meet are in their boxing trunks anyhow.
He could have used you a minute ago when they were beating the tar out of him.
Heh, I wouldn't tangle with these girls.
That's for sure.
And if you would, you'd be doin' it in Jersey city.
Come here to gloat, Mr. Hague?
That and...
for some cake.
How you feeling about Carpentier, champ?
Are you kiddin'?
I'm gonna knock his block off.
In a brand new arena I built for the occasion.
Jersey city in July, what's that like?
- Once you get past the smell...
- Can't say he's lying there.
I tell you, sometimes I gotta hold my breath running past that sewage plant.
So train here.
Fresh sea air, early morning runs on the beach, not to mention our other natural resources.
Sorry, hon, but we ain't homegrown.
Philadelphia imports.
I was wondering why I hadn't seen you around.
We been here since November, sweetie.
These are the girls we had trucked in during the election.
She was responsible for 1,000 republican votes single-handed.
Except it wasn't my hands I was usin'.
Wait a minute.
Did you say you girls are from Philadelphia?
- What of it?
- My friend, you need to have a chat with your lawyer.
- Cake?
- Yeah, a slice.
- Cake?
- Slice of cake?
- What's wrong?
- Wrong?
I just figured a way to get your case dismissed.
Moving whores across state lines?
That's a federal charge.
Bureau of internal revenue.
Special Agent Van Alden speaking.
Nelson, are you all right?
Rose.
Yes.
I'm fine, dear.
What's wrong?
I called your boardinghouse five times last night.
- That seems excessive.
- They said you no longer lived there.
That... what?
That's ridiculous.
Who... who did you speak with?
A Greek gentleman.
I didn't get his name.
Well, that's preposterous.
I'll get to the bottom of this immediately.
I was very frightened, Nelson.
I thought something happened.
No, of course not.
There's nothing for you to worry about.
The, umm, mice in the attic?
They've been very active lately.
I'll set traps next time I'm home.
- When will that be?
- Soon.
We're very busy, dear.
I'm lonely, Nelson.
And I don't like the way you sound.
There are some very important matters
I need to attend to.
Please try to get some rest.
I will.
Take care and God bless.
We're making progress.
It's slow but sure.
Slow don't cut it with four of my boys in an unmarked grave.
Their families will be compensated.
This ain't about money, Nucky.
It's about revenge on them ghost-ridin' motherfuckers.
You need to sit tight with that.
Oh, I been sittin' tight.
My ass sore.
Well, those silk cushions ought to help.
- You keep makin' this about money.
- It's always about money.
It took a lot of cash for my lawyer to get you out, chalky.
That fella you have is inept.
Did I not say thank you?
You can thank me by being a good boy.
I gave you my word.
Now save your strength and enjoy your family.
How am I supposed to do that?
I got four other families waiting' on me for justice.
You're not the only one looking to settle scores.
These are your sworn depositions stating that Enoch Thompson brought you to Atlantic City last November with the express purpose of performing sexual favors for certain gentlemen in order to...
Influence their voting blocs.
Uh, you fucked people to sway their votes.
Sure we did.
A couple factory owners, some union reps.
Then this accurately reflects your understanding of events as they occurred?
Sure, I suppose.
And the charges keep piling up.
Well, it's not like esn't have it coming.
He loves you.
There's love and then there's everything else.
I'm sorry.
Am I allowed to talk?
It doesn't hinder me.
Have you ever been in love?
Not the way you mean.
Someone you care about?
I have a sister.
A twin.
Her name is Emma.
Where does she live?
Plover, Wisconsin.
We grew up on the farm.
There were no other children of our age.
We spent every moment together.
- Inseparable.
- Yeah.
We milked cows, baled hay, fished.
She taught me how to cook.
That's sweet.
Whatever love is, that's what I felt for Emma.
Do you visit her often?
When I came back from the war, she nursed me, and gave me morphine to keep the pain at bay.
Despite my injuries she treated me no different.
I was her brother, the closest person in her life.
But suddenly...
I felt different toward her.
I would stare at her...
And feel nothing.
I lost whatever I thought love was.
When my wounds healed,
I moved to Chicago to get lost there.
I haven't spoken to her since.
It was a constable station in tipperary.
They pulled the bodies of 12 black and tans from the rubble.
One had no head.
For the cause?
A message for the crown.
And after that it was our mission to execute a bombing a week... lorries, sentries, British quarters, post offices, even a rectory.
Uh, the wire.
This is what you used?
Uh-huh, gelignite.
Blasting gelatin used in quarries... for mining.
You see it doesn't sweat.
Like you are now.
What does "sweat" mean?
That it won't leak nitroglycerine like dynamite.
It's more stable and easier to transport.
Detonators.
- They won't bite.
- What is it?
Blasting caps filled with Mercury and chlorate of potash.
Someone's goin' out of business.
Mickey Doyle.
Here you go.
There's another 50 in the car.
They're ingersolls.
I wish you would stop with this.
We schlep around with a box of watches, what do we look like?
Fellas who know what time it is.
Might as well set up a pushcart.
Arnold Rothstein's here.
- We're talking, Benny.
- Oh.
So I should tell him go fuck a duck?
Enough with the crazy shit already, huh?
- The fuck?
- Bring him in before he breaks the house.
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Put the bag away.
A.R., did you come to sit in?
You know you're always welcome.
I'm afraid those sharpers out there'd fleece me.
Owing to his present difficulties,
I've made a deal with Nucky Thompson.
He'll be offloading his liquor shipments in Philadelphia.
Waxey Gordon will ensure safe arrival.
The route to Atlantic city will be my responsibility.
And you'd like us to recruit the muscle?
I would like you to be the muscle.
A.R., we, uh, got some business going on just now.
I can see that.
But Mr. Thompson is paying me a premium.
Anybody could ride shotgun.
Until you encounter Indians.
We're honored by your trust, A.R., and flattered that you would come below 14th street to discuss it personally.
Aren't we, Charlie?
- Sure.
- As it happens
I was down here having dinner with Joe Masseria, who left me with the distinct impression he'd still like both of you dead.
You broke bread with that prick?
We were served a native dish of tripe, which I cannot abide.
But I ate it anyway, to keep the peace.
Some things, Charlie, you just have to swallow.
Adeline, can you bring the biscuits, please?
Coming.
Everyone take your places, please.
I want to welcome Samuel to our table...
Thank you, Mrs. White and Mr. White.
And ask that he lead us in the saying of grace.
I'd be honored, ma'am.
- Lord, we...
- Is that a duck?
Yes, Albert.
Of course it is.
Please, Mr. Crawford.
- Lord, we thank you...
- I thought I asked for hopping' John.
There's duck...
Peas, carrots, fresh-baked biscuits.
I made chocolate pudding for dessert.
- We'd like to thank you for the gifts...
- I asked a question.
Albert, please.
She made that pudding all by herself.
- That's very nice.
- Where the damn hoppin' John?
Albert, you know that's not proper food for a guest.
Now let's allow Samuel to finish.
Lord, we come togeth...
Well, maybe our guest would've liked some.
Well, I have always enjoyed that type of food, sir.
What type of food?
Uh, my grandma would make it.
I say something funny, son?
- Beg your pardon?
- You laughing.
- What the joke?
- Hoppin' John, Albert.
You're being ridiculous.
I been eatin' rice and beans all my life.
Tell me it ain't good enough.
You'll have to forgive my husband's country ways.
I completely understand, ma'am.
This is my house!
And my country ways put the food on this goddamn table.
Albert!
You're drunk.
Sir, I apologize.
- I'll leave...
- You stay right where you are, son.
Right there...
Inside the house.
Pretty clear who the field nigger is.
Almost finished.
Hmm.
This is what I look like?
Yes.
Hmm, is it expensive?
- The drawing?
- I can pay for it.
No.
No, I... it's yours, if you want it.
Ange?
Ange, are you home?
In here.
- What are you doing?
- I was sketching Richard.
I'll put him to bed.
Thank you.
He's tuckered out.
We rode the Ferris wheel after my mother's.
Tomorrow... we're gonna need to go to Philly for that delivery.
Okay.
Good night.
He sat for you?
Is that so surprising?
I don't know.
I'm never sure what's going on inside him.
I gotta hand it to Icky.
This was a great idea.
The whole thing was a setup.
I mean, Fleming helped too of course.
It was a means to an end.
But surely nothing to be proud of.
It's not pride, it's happiness.
I violated the mann act.
It prohibits the interstate transportation of females for immoral purposes.
It's a federal law, which means the entire election case can be rolled into a federal indictment.
- So the Attorney General can help?
- Exactly.
This is how things work, Margaret.
You know that.
I had no relations with any of these women, if that's what you're worried about.
I believe you.
The tide's turning, I'll tell you that much.
I'd love to see the look on the Commodore's...
I need $100.
Clothes for the children.
Very well.
Where are you going?
Off to bed.
I'll be up in a while.
It's owned by a widow, but ran by a fella named Mickey Doyle.
Van Alden arrested him last year for bootlegging.
- This is the place?
- This is it.
It looks deserted.
You don't smell that?
There's a still in there.
I don't see the point of this.
We're prohis, Stan.
We're going to make an arrest.
But if it is what you think it is, van Alden will have our heads.
Then we'll arrest him too.
Go check around back.
Oh.
Oh God.
That's it, one last bite.
Louis dear.
You need nourishment.
Do you remember when we met?
I'll never forget your smile.
Jimmy sometimes, he has it.
I look at him and I see you.
That first night, how you plied me with wine...
Why I'd never felt such a sensation.
We were downstairs.
And I'd fallen asleep on the divan.
You carried me to the bedroom, went to say good night to your guests.
And I lay there in bed...
Dreaming of the waves.
I'd been on the beach that day.
Suddenly I felt a crushing feeling,
I couldn't breathe.
I opened my eyes to find you atop me...
Your breath smelling of whiskey and tobacco...
One hand covering my mouth...
And the other groping at me.
Do you remember that?
Still...
Sometimes when I sleep, it wakes me with a start.
Do you remember that night?
I...
I asked you a question.
# Come where my love lies dreaming # # dreaming the happy hours away # # in visions bright redeeming # # the fleeting joys of day # # dreaming # # the happy hours # # dreaming dreaming the happy hours away #
# come where my love lies dreaming # # my old love is sweetly dreaming # # the happy hours away # # come where my love lies dreaming #
Maybelle has a request.
Her beau... he wishes to call at the house.
Maybe a few days.
You have a family waiting that loves you.
How does it feel to have everything?
- Mr. Attorney General.
- What can I do for you, Nuck?
If you were ever planning on making good on a certain debt...
- But yours was a state election.
- So?
So I have no standing to intervene on a federal level.
You used to call him "the letch"... my father.
It must have been when I was still angry with him.
I was a mere child when Nucky brought me to your father, you're certainly right about that.
That card game you operate is located in territory that Mr. masseria considers to be his.
A tax of 10% on the game going forward...
- hold on...
- Charlie.
There's another speak off baltic.
Right time of night, you'll be good for a hundred cases.
Cash up front, officer.
- What are your talents, Mr. sleater?
- Making people stop.
I just received a call from Bill McCoy.
The Coast Guard is seizing his ships.
We'll not be needing your services.
You want this order or not?
Look, I've no quarrel with you, sir.
We're just not buying any liquor.
- What did he promise you?
- More than you ever did.
I will ruin you...
all of you.
- Jimmy!
- Have a nice dinner, gentlemen.
How was dinner with your father?
Which one?
Come on, you gotta help me move these barrels.
- Here we go.
- You can barely move in here.
You got your friends at the Coast Guard to thank for that.
Three ships' worth of booze... the Nina, the Pinta and the Canadian club.
Bill McCoy's probably still crying his eyes out.
On Nucky Thompson's shoulder.
What happened with you and Nucky anyway?
I guess that's between me and Nucky, isn't it?
We need more space, Mickey.
Ain't an empty garage in 10 Miles.
Then try 11.
Pay cash.
End of next summer we'll be the biggest distributors in the Northeast.
From the tiny acorn grows the mighty elk.
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous.
Yo, be careful with that.
Don't like not knowing what's going on.
That's what makes it exciting.
What the hell is that?
"The Pipes of Pan."
Goddamn cat in a rain barrel.
Open your eyes, if thou darest.
Ain't you the humdinger?
Silence, mortal.
I am Diana, daughter of Jupiter.
And no man may look upon my nakedness as I bathe.
This is one of your little performances.
You should have come, dear, at least once.
I never liked the idea of you parading around in front of other men.
You could have married me.
I had a city to run.
I understand.
I always have.
But I did have a boy to raise.
We're all here now, aren't we?
He has so much to learn from you.
I can't tell you what it means to us, after all this time.
And you're going to take care of him, aren't you?
Come here with that mouth.
Do you know what happened to the Shepherd who spied on the virginal Diana?
She turned him into a stag.
He tried to run away, but his own hounds tore him to pieces.
Get your ass over here.
Prepare for the righteous punishment of the gods.
Louis?
Louis!
Louis!
Louis!
What does the bee do?
Bring home honey.
What does the father do?
Bring home money.
What does the mother do?
Lay out the money.
What do children do?
Eat up the honey!
Lovely, dear.
- Very nice.
- Good morning.
- Munchkins.
- Good morning, Uncle Nucky.
- Could you not sleep?
- I have a busy day.
Will you be breakfasting, Mr. Thompson?
I will not.
Nor will I be dinnering.
It's Ed Bader's birthday.
Did I not mention that?
I take it there will be a party?
Oh, something small, make him feel important.
A meal in his honor maybe.
Well, be sure not to overindulge.
Mr. Sleater.
Good day, everyone.
Top o' the mornin'.
Isn't that what your people say?
And we also fix shoes if you leave them outside your door.
- Surely it isn't that funny.
- Yes ma'am.
Mr. Sleater will be driving me now.
It's all I can do to stick to the correct side of the road.
- I'll be right out.
- Sir, ma'am.
Katy.
Please ask Lilian to get the children dressed and to drill Teddy in his catechism.
Come, dears.
A bit cheeky, isn't he?
- What's that mean again?
- Impertinent.
He's serving a purpose.
And may I ask what that is?
You may, and I may not answer.
The weekly expenses.
There's a little extra for the staff.
- What for?
- To let them know they're appreciated.
This is no time to be frivolous with money.
It's $2 extra a piece.
It makes no difference to us, but to them it's a windfall.
You do realize they steal from us.
It's what servants do.
It's what everyone does.
And we pretend not to know and life goes on.
No one gave me a bonus when I was in service.
All the more reason to be generous now.
I'm nearly out of shaving soap.
Any more of them eggs?
You've had nearly half a dozen already, Albert.
Tell them chickens to work overtime.
- Daddy!
- There's my sweet pea.
- When did you get home?
- Last night, past your bedtime.
Crept in like the sandman.
Will you check my homework?
You're asking daddy?
Your mama'll do that for you.
Your brother know I'm too strict.
- If you say so.
- Stop toying with your father.
He know who bring home the bacon.
How my princess doin'?
Did you ask him, mother?
Ask me what?
Mama invited Samuel over for dinner tomorrow night.
Did she now?
We did discuss this.
If a young lady is being courted, it needs to be in a respectable manner.
He's planning to study medicine.
Hmph.
An educated buck.
Well, I suppose it'd be all right.
Dinner with all the fixings.
I been craving hoppin' John since the moon was blue.
Richard.
Good morning.
I'm here for Jimmy.
I thought he was with you.
His mother called late last night.
He left and I assumed...
Was everything all right?
He doesn't tell me anything.
This business with Nucky...
I saw him on the boardwalk.
He wouldn't even look at me.
Mmm, very bold.
My feeble attempt at expressionism.
There was an artist I saw in Paris.
He does cityscapes... very stark, no people.
De Chirico.
I don't know.
He also did figures who look like mannequins.
Have you ever posed for an artist?
No.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
I used to draw when I was a child.
It was very relaxing.
It can be.
It can also be maddening.
It took me years to be able to draw hands.
It's apoplexy...
a stroke.
His entire right side is paralyzed.
He can eat, but so far he's been unable to speak.
Was he agitated?
Overexcited in any way?
As I said, I found him like this.
- Shouldn't he be in a hospital?
- No.
No one can care for him like his family.
Commodore.
What do you want to say?
C... cock.
Cock!
Yeah, I...
I, uh...
- cockfuck!
- That's enough for now.
He needs to rest.
Jesus Christ, he's a fucking vegetable!
Keep your voice down, please.
- What are we gonna do now?
- He's going to be fine, dear.
- Not what Dr. Surran says.
- Without him running this thing,
- his political connections...
- Stop it right now!
The both of you!
Now you listen to me.
I didn't spend my life getting groped by a bunch of drunks to wind up in a goddamn poorhouse.
- I've got eight kids, Gillian.
- Jimmy and I are well aware of that.
"Jimmy and you.
" That's exactly... the two of you and... him?
!
None of that's normal.
It never was.
It's normal to me and to my son and his father.
And it suited you, didn't it?
Up till this morning.
Up till this morning the man with the clout wasn't drooling into his pajamas.
You have a cruel streak, Eli.
That's never an attractive quality.
- He can't even talk.
- Louis is unwell.
He's going to recover.
You need to calm down.
It's all going to work out.
- How the fuck would you know?
- Because Jimmy will handle it.
We're in for 70 grand to his cronies.
They'll get paid back when we unload the booze.
- What are you waiting for?
- The town's flush, Eli.
Then sell it out of town...
New York, Philadelphia.
You wanna give me names and addresses or should I just go door to door?
Why ask me?
You both got it all worked out, right?
Maybe this wasn't the best idea, letting Eli see him like that.
I'm sorry if I seemed heated, baby.
It's a difficult time for both of us.
I want ice cream!
Alcohol and cake.
Call it for 9:00 so nobody's expecting a full dinner.
Hors d'oeuvres only.
Dancing girls?
Wouldn't be much of a party otherwise, would it?
- Fine, then you handle that.
- How old is mayor bader?
The fuck do I know?
What's the difference?
- The candles for the cake.
- Don't make a production out of it.
He is the mayor of Atlantic city.
And not the Prince of Wales.
Tell them to send up some eggs florentine.
- And get me Arnold Rothstein on the phone.
- Ja.
Arnold?
A Nucky Thompson on the telephone?
I'll take it in here, darling.
How's our stomach?
It's still a little tentative.
So much apple bread.
It has a binding effect.
Is that the best thing right now?
Sound elimination is the basis of good health.
"Mr. Thompson."
Mr. Thompson, to what do I owe the pleasure?
A change in my circumstances, as I'm sure you've already heard.
And are we discussing a problem or a proposition?
That depends which side of the phone you're on.
I need a port to land some cargo.
I was under the impression Atlantic City was aptly named.
The Coast Guard's locked me down.
I can't land a mackerel.
Well, I have an import operation in Montauk.
Long Island.
Too far.
What about Philadelphia?
We'd have to cut in Waxey Gordon.
I'm listening.
There's my 20% and I'll convince Waxey that 20% for him is a fair price also.
That's a pretty penny, Arnold.
Of course my cut includes men to oversee the operation.
You remember Mr. Luciano.
- I do.
- Then it's settled.
Direct your ships to Philly and let me know the details.
You've got a new port of call.
I can already feel the brotherly love.
I'd like to thank Mr. White for joining us here today.
We know how busy he is and how hard he works for our community.
Ain't no matter, Wilfred.
Yes sir.
Now this is an informal gathering so we will not adhere to strict parliamentary rule, but if you could just raise your hands...
I give the floor to Mr. White.
Now I know y'all got your beefs and various complaints.
I hear an earful over the past weeks I've been in jail.
But I'm back now and everybody know my door always open.
- Mr. White.
- Yeah?
I don't mean to trouble you.
You ain't never no trouble, Mrs. Mayhew.
There's this couple next door to me.
They are habituated to late-night rent parties.
- Mmm mmm mmm.
- There's no end to rag music being played, and unseemly behavior on public view.
Well, you ain't gonna be bothered by none of that from now on.
Oh bless you, Mr. White.
Travis Elkins, sir.
I remember you fine, Travis.
Well, Mr. White, I been six months in the kitchen there at the Ritz?
Near 40 of us on second shift.
12 hours on our feet.
- Uh-huh.
- Wash our aprons, that come out your pay.
Break a cup, that come out your pay.
Give us the one meal...
if you call it that... it come out your pay too.
What they serve us, Mr. White, ain't fit for a dog tied to a stake post, and we working men.
- I'll look into that, Travis.
- Thank you, sir.
It's true.
Everybody, enjoy the refreshments.
- Mr. White.
- And remember, come July fourth,
- all y'all...
- What about my husband?
- How's that?
- Those white men cut his throat while he loading your trucks with your illegal liquor... sister, moderation in the lord's house.
Huh-uh.
What being' done about that?
You'll be looked after, I promise.
You promise.
You promise.
- My son is dead.
- I buried the father of my three children.
They bring my man home rolled up in a washbucket.
- Ladies, ladies.
- It's true.
- I said it'll be taken care of.
- When?
- How?
- Order, ladies, please.
Ain't nobody put you in charge.
You walk around, take a bite off everyone else's plate, don't give nothing back 'cept a summer clambake and a Christmas Turkey.
Continental tea garden, $422.
Morgan's oyster house, $216.
- Shall I tag them with currency straps?
- I'll do it.
- I don't mind, sir, I have...
- Johnny on the spot, are you?
Have you finished the affidavits for tomorrow's search warrants?
- I was in the process...
- Concern yourself with your own duties, agent Clarkson.
Yes sir.
I'll be in the W.C.
- According to "the New York Herald"...
- Do not start with that.
Half of all prohibition agents accept bribes... m not interested in discussing... or engage in some other form of illegal activity.
- Just because you saw in the paper...
- Come on, Stan.
You don't notice anything strange about him?
Where do I start?
I'm not talking personal habits.
A few weeks back, I'm down on Pacific coming from the podiatrist.
I spot him driving with another fella in a derby.
It was suspicious.
He didn't see me, so I tailed him.
- I did some snooping.
- You tailed our boss?
They went to a barn;
Trucks were coming and going;
The smell of alcohol was in the air;
It was a bootlegging operation.
- I'll tell the world.
- So he's sitting on it, waiting for the right time for us to make our move.
It was over a month ago.
Heads will roll, gentlemen.
- "Van Asshole."
- Sir?
Someone scribbled an obscenity on the water closet wall.
Due to recent events, it has become necessary that we scale back in an effort to conserve financially.
- Are we being sacked, ma'am?
- No.
Though I'm considering suggesting a wage cut
- across the board.
- If I may?
My husband has been unable to find employment...
- I support a crippled brother...
- I'm sure you all have hardships, which we've taken into consideration.
You'll each find an extra $2 in your pay this week.
Th-this week only, mam?
Yes.
As a bonus.
I believe it's customary to say thank you.
- Yes.
- Of course.
Thank you.
What is it, ladies?
Speak your minds.
Actually, ma'am, we were expecting a raise in pay.
- Whatever for?
- Mr. Thompson... a few weeks back he came in one night in... a rather jolly mood.
He told us he was raising our salaries.
Forgive me, ma'am, but he may have been drinking.
Well...
It's a special kind of fool who relies on the promise of a drunkard.
Now if there's nothing else?
- No ma'am.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
To your tasks then.
You talked to him about the cash upfront, right?
Munya!
We made it.
Manny Horvitz, this is the fella I called you about...
Jimmy Darmody.
- Mr. Horvitz.
- You're Darmody?
Oysh, he's just a baby.
I thought you liked em' young, Manny.
If we're talking veal, yes.
But when it comes to business...
- You speak yiddish?
- That's all I know.
Still you make an effort, I'm impressed.
Already I feel this is going well.
This man looks interesting.
My associate Mr. Harrow.
What happened to you?
I put my nose where it didn't belong.
You're funny.
He's a sweetheart and Mickey is a gonif from way back.
Chayem, introduce yourself.
- Herman Kaufman.
- All right, Herman.
First in his class at eastern state...
Penitentiary.
I'm kidding.
Herman only did county time.
Can I get you fellas something to eat?
- No, but thank you.
- Ahhh.
You're gonna smell the cooking and you're gonna get hungry.
So what's your pleasure, Mr. Horvitz?
Munya or Manny.
My pleasure?
I got a daughter.
She's an angel.
And my wife?
Ehh, ankles got thick, but I love her anyway.
And Waxey Gordon is a cocksucking piece of shit.
- Why is that?
- He's a greedy prick, with his hand in my ass pocket where my wallet should be.
- Fuckin' chazer.
- Eight years I work with the man.
Promises made and now where am I?
Talking to a baby in a butcher shop.
I like you, boychik.
Nice warm feeling.
We hear you're flush with hooch.
- You heard right.
- How'd you like to make some dough?
We didn't come to Philly for the brisket.
You got liquor.
We got money.
You see where I'm driving?
I need cash upfront.
Well, first consider I got restaurants, 30, 40 speaks, about 10 blocks or so in jewtown... weikel off somerset.
It's a nice opportunity.
We'd do 100 cases a week, build our business from there.
And stick it right up Waxey's tuchus.
Still has to be in advance.
Five grand, we can make delivery anytime.
That's a lot of green.
You could always say no.
We got a deal.
But just so we're clear, my icebox is filled with pieces of fellas who tried to fuck me over.
I just got creamsicles in mine.
Mr. Harrow will be in touch.
Gentlemen.
Mr. Dempsey, Mr. Dempsey.
Hey, Mr. Dempsey!
Champ, hey, champ!
Mr. Dempsey, please!
- Come on, Jack.
Gotta go.
- All right, all right.
That's it, all right.
Thank you, thank you.
- It's worse than being in the ring.
- Yeah, I know.
There we go.
There we go.
That'smylawyeroverthere.
- In a while you'll see his briefs.
- He's got his hands full.
Oh, gee!
That's it, girls.
Bringhimin .
Ow ow!
Ohh.
Oink oink oink oink.
- Happy Birthday, Ed.
- Make a wish.
This was my wish.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you were in the middle of a city council meeting.
Jesus, is that who I think it is?
Jesus wouldn't last a round.
Jack Dempsey, say hello to our esteemed mayor Edward Bader.
Happy Birthday, sir.
I usually keep my trousers on for visiting dignitaries.
Hell, most of the fellas I meet are in their boxing trunks anyhow.
He could have used you a minute ago when they were beating the tar out of him.
Heh, I wouldn't tangle with these girls.
That's for sure.
And if you would, you'd be doin' it in Jersey city.
Come here to gloat, Mr. Hague?
That and...
for some cake.
How you feeling about Carpentier, champ?
Are you kiddin'?
I'm gonna knock his block off.
In a brand new arena I built for the occasion.
Jersey city in July, what's that like?
- Once you get past the smell...
- Can't say he's lying there.
I tell you, sometimes I gotta hold my breath running past that sewage plant.
So train here.
Fresh sea air, early morning runs on the beach, not to mention our other natural resources.
Sorry, hon, but we ain't homegrown.
Philadelphia imports.
I was wondering why I hadn't seen you around.
We been here since November, sweetie.
These are the girls we had trucked in during the election.
She was responsible for 1,000 republican votes single-handed.
Except it wasn't my hands I was usin'.
Wait a minute.
Did you say you girls are from Philadelphia?
- What of it?
- My friend, you need to have a chat with your lawyer.
- Cake?
- Yeah, a slice.
- Cake?
- Slice of cake?
- What's wrong?
- Wrong?
I just figured a way to get your case dismissed.
Moving whores across state lines?
That's a federal charge.
Bureau of internal revenue.
Special Agent Van Alden speaking.
Nelson, are you all right?
Rose.
Yes.
I'm fine, dear.
What's wrong?
I called your boardinghouse five times last night.
- That seems excessive.
- They said you no longer lived there.
That... what?
That's ridiculous.
Who... who did you speak with?
A Greek gentleman.
I didn't get his name.
Well, that's preposterous.
I'll get to the bottom of this immediately.
I was very frightened, Nelson.
I thought something happened.
No, of course not.
There's nothing for you to worry about.
The, umm, mice in the attic?
They've been very active lately.
I'll set traps next time I'm home.
- When will that be?
- Soon.
We're very busy, dear.
I'm lonely, Nelson.
And I don't like the way you sound.
There are some very important matters
I need to attend to.
Please try to get some rest.
I will.
Take care and God bless.
We're making progress.
It's slow but sure.
Slow don't cut it with four of my boys in an unmarked grave.
Their families will be compensated.
This ain't about money, Nucky.
It's about revenge on them ghost-ridin' motherfuckers.
You need to sit tight with that.
Oh, I been sittin' tight.
My ass sore.
Well, those silk cushions ought to help.
- You keep makin' this about money.
- It's always about money.
It took a lot of cash for my lawyer to get you out, chalky.
That fella you have is inept.
Did I not say thank you?
You can thank me by being a good boy.
I gave you my word.
Now save your strength and enjoy your family.
How am I supposed to do that?
I got four other families waiting' on me for justice.
You're not the only one looking to settle scores.
These are your sworn depositions stating that Enoch Thompson brought you to Atlantic City last November with the express purpose of performing sexual favors for certain gentlemen in order to...
Influence their voting blocs.
Uh, you fucked people to sway their votes.
Sure we did.
A couple factory owners, some union reps.
Then this accurately reflects your understanding of events as they occurred?
Sure, I suppose.
And the charges keep piling up.
Well, it's not like esn't have it coming.
He loves you.
There's love and then there's everything else.
I'm sorry.
Am I allowed to talk?
It doesn't hinder me.
Have you ever been in love?
Not the way you mean.
Someone you care about?
I have a sister.
A twin.
Her name is Emma.
Where does she live?
Plover, Wisconsin.
We grew up on the farm.
There were no other children of our age.
We spent every moment together.
- Inseparable.
- Yeah.
We milked cows, baled hay, fished.
She taught me how to cook.
That's sweet.
Whatever love is, that's what I felt for Emma.
Do you visit her often?
When I came back from the war, she nursed me, and gave me morphine to keep the pain at bay.
Despite my injuries she treated me no different.
I was her brother, the closest person in her life.
But suddenly...
I felt different toward her.
I would stare at her...
And feel nothing.
I lost whatever I thought love was.
When my wounds healed,
I moved to Chicago to get lost there.
I haven't spoken to her since.
It was a constable station in tipperary.
They pulled the bodies of 12 black and tans from the rubble.
One had no head.
For the cause?
A message for the crown.
And after that it was our mission to execute a bombing a week... lorries, sentries, British quarters, post offices, even a rectory.
Uh, the wire.
This is what you used?
Uh-huh, gelignite.
Blasting gelatin used in quarries... for mining.
You see it doesn't sweat.
Like you are now.
What does "sweat" mean?
That it won't leak nitroglycerine like dynamite.
It's more stable and easier to transport.
Detonators.
- They won't bite.
- What is it?
Blasting caps filled with Mercury and chlorate of potash.
Someone's goin' out of business.
Mickey Doyle.
Here you go.
There's another 50 in the car.
They're ingersolls.
I wish you would stop with this.
We schlep around with a box of watches, what do we look like?
Fellas who know what time it is.
Might as well set up a pushcart.
Arnold Rothstein's here.
- We're talking, Benny.
- Oh.
So I should tell him go fuck a duck?
Enough with the crazy shit already, huh?
- The fuck?
- Bring him in before he breaks the house.
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Put the bag away.
A.R., did you come to sit in?
You know you're always welcome.
I'm afraid those sharpers out there'd fleece me.
Owing to his present difficulties,
I've made a deal with Nucky Thompson.
He'll be offloading his liquor shipments in Philadelphia.
Waxey Gordon will ensure safe arrival.
The route to Atlantic city will be my responsibility.
And you'd like us to recruit the muscle?
I would like you to be the muscle.
A.R., we, uh, got some business going on just now.
I can see that.
But Mr. Thompson is paying me a premium.
Anybody could ride shotgun.
Until you encounter Indians.
We're honored by your trust, A.R., and flattered that you would come below 14th street to discuss it personally.
Aren't we, Charlie?
- Sure.
- As it happens
I was down here having dinner with Joe Masseria, who left me with the distinct impression he'd still like both of you dead.
You broke bread with that prick?
We were served a native dish of tripe, which I cannot abide.
But I ate it anyway, to keep the peace.
Some things, Charlie, you just have to swallow.
Adeline, can you bring the biscuits, please?
Coming.
Everyone take your places, please.
I want to welcome Samuel to our table...
Thank you, Mrs. White and Mr. White.
And ask that he lead us in the saying of grace.
I'd be honored, ma'am.
- Lord, we...
- Is that a duck?
Yes, Albert.
Of course it is.
Please, Mr. Crawford.
- Lord, we thank you...
- I thought I asked for hopping' John.
There's duck...
Peas, carrots, fresh-baked biscuits.
I made chocolate pudding for dessert.
- We'd like to thank you for the gifts...
- I asked a question.
Albert, please.
She made that pudding all by herself.
- That's very nice.
- Where the damn hoppin' John?
Albert, you know that's not proper food for a guest.
Now let's allow Samuel to finish.
Lord, we come togeth...
Well, maybe our guest would've liked some.
Well, I have always enjoyed that type of food, sir.
What type of food?
Uh, my grandma would make it.
I say something funny, son?
- Beg your pardon?
- You laughing.
- What the joke?
- Hoppin' John, Albert.
You're being ridiculous.
I been eatin' rice and beans all my life.
Tell me it ain't good enough.
You'll have to forgive my husband's country ways.
I completely understand, ma'am.
This is my house!
And my country ways put the food on this goddamn table.
Albert!
You're drunk.
Sir, I apologize.
- I'll leave...
- You stay right where you are, son.
Right there...
Inside the house.
Pretty clear who the field nigger is.
Almost finished.
Hmm.
This is what I look like?
Yes.
Hmm, is it expensive?
- The drawing?
- I can pay for it.
No.
No, I... it's yours, if you want it.
Ange?
Ange, are you home?
In here.
- What are you doing?
- I was sketching Richard.
I'll put him to bed.
Thank you.
He's tuckered out.
We rode the Ferris wheel after my mother's.
Tomorrow... we're gonna need to go to Philly for that delivery.
Okay.
Good night.
He sat for you?
Is that so surprising?
I don't know.
I'm never sure what's going on inside him.
I gotta hand it to Icky.
Thiswasagreatidea .
The whole thing was a setup.
I mean, Fleming helped too of course.
It was a means to an end.
But surely nothing to be proud of.
It's not pride, it's happiness.
I violated the mann act.
It prohibits the interstate transportation of females for immoral purposes.
It's a federal law, which means the entire election case can be rolled into a federal indictment.
- So the Attorney General can help?
- Exactly.
This is how things work, Margaret.
You know that.
I had no relations with any of these women, if that's what you're worried about.
I believe you.
The tide's turning, I'll tell you that much.
I'd love to see the look on the Commodore's...
I need $100.
Clothes for the children.
Very well.
Where are you going?
Off to bed.
I'll be up in a while.
It's owned by a widow, but ran by a fella named Mickey Doyle.
Van Alden arrested him last year for bootlegging.
- This is the place?
- This is it.
It looks deserted.
You don't smell that?
There's a still in there.
I don't see the point of this.
We're prohis, Stan.
We're going to make an arrest.
But if it is what you think it is, van Alden will have our heads.
Then we'll arrest him too.
Go check around back.
Oh.
Oh God.
That's it, one last bite.
Louis dear.
You need nourishment.
Do you remember when we met?
I'll never forget your smile.
Jimmy sometimes, he has it.
I look at him and I see you.
That first night, how you plied me with wine...
Why I'd never felt such a sensation.
We were downstairs.
And I'd fallen asleep on the divan.
You carried me to the bedroom, went to say good night to your guests.
And I lay there in bed...
Dreaming of the waves.
I'd been on the beach that day.
Suddenly I felt a crushing feeling,
I couldn't breathe.
I opened my eyes to find you atop me...
Your breath smelling of whiskey and tobacco...
One hand covering my mouth...
And the other groping at me.
Do you remember that?
Still...
Sometimes when I sleep, it wakes me with a start.
Do you remember that night?
I...
I asked you a question.

Come on, you gotta help me move these barrels.
- Here we go.
- You can barely move in here.
You got your friends at the Coast Guard to thank for that.
Three ships' worth of booze... the Nina, the Pinta and the Canadian club.
Bill McCoy's probably still crying his eyes out.
On Nucky Thompson's shoulder.
What happened with you and Nucky anyway?
I guess that's between me and Nucky, isn't it?
We need more space, Mickey.
Ain't an empty garage in 10 Miles.
Then try 11.
Pay cash.
End of next summer we'll be the biggest distributors in the Northeast.
From the tiny acorn grows the mighty elk.
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous.
Yo, be careful
Don't like not knowing what's going on.
That's what makes it exciting.
What the hell is that?
"The Pipes of Pan."
Goddamn cat in a rain barrel.
Open your eyes, if thou darest.
Ain't you the humdinger?
Silence, mortal.
I am Diana, daughter of Jupiter.
And no man may look upon my nakedness as I bathe.
This is one of your little performances.
You should have come, dear, at least once.
I never liked the idea of you parading around in front of other men.
You could have married me.
I had a city to run.
I understand.
I always have.
But I did have a boy to raise.
We're all here now, aren't we?
He has so much to learn from you.
I can't tell you what it means to us, after all this time.
And you're going to take care of him, aren't you?
Come here with that mouth.
Do you know what happened to the Shepherd who spied on the virginal Diana?
She turned him into a stag.
He tried to run away, but his own hounds tore him to pieces.
Get your ass over here.
Prepare for the righteous punishment of the gods.
Louis?
Louis!
Louis!
What does the bee do?
Bring home honey.
What does the father do?
Bring home money.
What does the mother do?
Lay out the money.
What do children do?
Eat up the honey!
Lovely, dear.
- Very nice.
- Good morning.
- Munchkins.
- Good morning, Uncle Nucky.
- Could you not sleep?
- I have a busy day.
Will you be breakfasting, Mr. Thompson?
I will not.
Nor will I be dinnering.
It's Ed Bader's birthday.
Did I not mention that?
I take it there will be a party?
Oh, something small, make him feel important.
A meal in his honor maybe.
Well, be sure not to overindulge.
Mr. Sleater.
Good day, everyone.
Top o' the mornin'.
Isn't that what your people say?
And we also fix shoes if you leave them outside your door.
- Surely it isn't that funny.
- Yes ma'am.
Mr. Sleater will be driving me now.
It's all I can do to stick to the correct side of the road.
- I'll be right out.
- Sir, ma'am.
Katy.
Please ask Lilian to get the children dressed and to drill Teddy in his catechism.
Come, dears.
A bit cheeky, isn't he?
- What's that mean again?
- Impertinent.
He's serving a purpose.
And may I ask what that is?
You may, and I may not answer.
The weekly expenses.
There's a little extra for the staff.
- What for?
- To let them know they're appreciated.
This is no time to be frivolous with money.
It's $2 extra a piece.
It makes no difference to us, but to them it's a windfall.
You do realize they steal from us.
It's what servants do.
It's what everyone does.
And we pretend not to know and life goes on.
No one gave me a bonus when I was in service.
All the more reason to be generous now.
I'm nearly out of shaving soap.
Any more of them eggs?
You've had nearly half a dozen already, Albert.
Tell them chickens to work overtime.
- Daddy!
- There's my sweet pea.
- When did you get home?
- Last night, past your bedtime.
Crept in like the sandman.
Will you check my homework?
You're asking daddy?
Your mama'll do that for you.
Your brother know I'm too strict.
- If you say so.
- Stop toying with your father.
He know who bring home the bacon.
How my princess doin'?
Did you ask him, mother?
Ask me what?
Mama invited Samuel over for dinner tomorrow night.
Did she now?
We did discuss this.
If a young lady is being courted, it needs to be in a respectable manner.
He's planning to study medicine.
Hmph.
An educated buck.
Well, I suppose it'd be all right.
Dinner with all the fixings.
I been craving hoppin' John since the moon was blue.
Richard.
Good morning.
I'm here for Jimmy.
I thought he was with you.
His mother called late last night.
He left and I assumed...
Was everything all right?
He doesn't tell me anything.
This business with Nucky...
I saw him on the boardwalk.
He wouldn't even look at me.
Mmm, very bold.
My feeble attempt at expressionism.
There was an artist I saw in Paris.
He does cityscapes... very stark, no people.
De Chirico.
I don't know.
He also did figures who look like mannequins.
Have you ever posed for an artist?
No.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
I used to draw when I was a child.
It was very relaxing.
It can be.
It can also be maddening.
It took me years to be able to draw hands.
It's apoplexy...
a stroke.
His entire right side is paralyzed.
He can eat, but so far he's been unable to speak.
Was he agitated?
Overexcited in any way?
As I said, I found him like this.
- Shouldn't he be in a hospital?
- No.
No one can care for him like his family.
Commodore.
What do you want to say?
C... cock.
Cock!
Yeah, I...
I, uh...
- cockfuck!
- That's enough for now.
He needs to rest.
Jesus Christ, he's a fucking vegetable!
Keep your voice down, please.
- What are we gonna do now?
- He's going to be fine, dear.
- Not what Dr. Surran says.
- Without him running this thing,
- his political connections...
- Stop it right now!
The both of you!
Now you listen to me.
I didn't spend my life getting groped by a bunch of drunks to wind up in a goddamn poorhouse.
- I've got eight kids, Gillian.
- Jimmy and I are well aware of that.
"Jimmy and you.
" That's exactly... the two of you and... him?
!
None of that's normal.
It never was.
It's normal to me and to my son and his father.
And it suited you, didn't it?
Up till this morning.
Up till this morning the man with the clout wasn't drooling into his pajamas.
You have a cruel streak, Eli.
That's never an attractive quality.
- He can't even talk.
- Louis is unwell.
He's going to recover.
You need to calm down.
It's all going to work out.
- How the fuck would you know?
- Because Jimmy will handle it.
We're in for 70 grand to his cronies.
They'll get paid back when we unload the booze.
- What are you waiting for?
- The town's flush, Eli.
Then sell it out of town...
New York, Philadelphia.
You wanna give me names and addresses or should I just go door to door?
Why ask me?
You both got it all worked out, right?
Maybe this wasn't the best idea, letting Eli see him like that.
I'm sorry if I seemed heated, baby.
It's a difficult time for both of us.
I want ice cream!
Alcohol and cake.
Call it for 9:00 so nobody's expecting a full dinner.
Hors d'oeuvres only.
Dancing girls?
Wouldn't be much of a party otherwise, would it?
- Fine, then you handle that.
- How old is mayor bader?
The fuck do I know?
What's the difference?
- The candles for the cake.
- Don't make a production out of it.
He is the mayor of Atlantic city.
And not the Prince of Wales.
Tell them to send up some eggs florentine.
- And get me Arnold Rothstein on the phone.
- Ja.
Arnold?
A Nucky Thompson on the telephone?
I'll take it in here, darling.
How's our stomach?
It's still a little tentative.
So much apple bread.
It has a binding effect.
Is that the best thing right now?
Sound elimination is the basis of good health.
"Mr. Thompson."
Mr. Thompson, to what do I owe the pleasure?
A change in my circumstances, as I'm sure you've already heard.
And are we discussing a problem or a proposition?
That depends which side of the phone you're on.
I need a port to land some cargo.
I was under the impression Atlantic City was aptly named.
The Coast Guard's locked me down.
I can't land a mackerel.
Well, I have an import operation in Montauk.
Long Island.
Too far.
What about Philadelphia?
We'd have to cut in Waxey Gordon.
I'm listening.
There's my 20% and I'll convince Waxey that 20% for him is a fair price also.
That's a pretty penny, Arnold.
Of course my cut includes men to oversee the operation.
You remember Mr. Luciano.
- I do.
- Then it's settled.
Direct your ships to Philly and let me know the details.
You've got a new port of call.
I can already feel the brotherly love.
I'd like to thank Mr. White for joining us here today.
We know how busy he is and how hard he works for our community.
Ain't no matter, Wilfred.
Yes sir.
Now this is an informal gathering so we will not adhere to strict parliamentary rule, but if you could just raise your hands...
I give the floor to Mr. White.
Now I know y'all got your beefs and various complaints.
I hear an earful over the past weeks I've been in jail.
But I'm back now and everybody know my door always open.
- Mr. White.
- Yeah?
I don't mean to trouble you.
You ain't never no trouble, Mrs. Mayhew.
There's this couple next door to me.
They are habituated to late-night rent parties.
- Mmm mmm mmm.
- There's no end to rag music being played, and unseemly behavior on public view.
Well, you ain't gonna be bothered by none of that from now on.
Oh bless you, Mr. White.
Travis Elkins, sir.
I remember you fine, Travis.
Well, Mr. White, I been six months in the kitchen there at the Ritz?
Near 40 of us on second shift.
12 hours on our feet.
- Uh-huh.
- Wash our aprons, that come out your pay.
Break a cup, that come out your pay.
Give us the one meal...
if you call it that... it come out your pay too.
What they serve us, Mr. White, ain't fit for a dog tied to a stake post, and we working men.
- I'll look into that, Travis.
- Thank you, sir.
It's true.
Everybody, enjoy the refreshments.
- Mr. White.
- And remember, come July fourth,
- all y'all...
- What about my husband?
- How's that?
- Those white men cut his throat while he loading your trucks with your illegal liquor... sister, moderation in the lord's house.
Huh-uh.
What being' done about that?
You'll be looked after, I promise.
You promise.
You promise.
- My son is dead.
- I buried the father of my three children.
They bring my man home rolled up in a washbucket.
- Ladies, ladies.
- It's true.
- I said it'll be taken care of.
- When?
- How?
- Order, ladies, please.
Ain't nobody put you in charge.
You walk around, take a bite off everyone else's plate, don't give nothing back 'cept a summer clambake and a Christmas Turkey.
Continental tea garden, $422.
Morgan's oyster house, $216.
- Shall I tag them with currency straps?
- I'll do it.
- I don't mind, sir, I have...
- Johnny on the spot, are you?
Have you finished the affidavits for tomorrow's search warrants?
- I was in the process...
- Concern yourself with your own duties, agent Clarkson.
Yes sir.
I'll be in the W.C.
- According to "the New York Herald"...
- Do not start with that.
Half of all prohibition agents accept bribes... m not interested in discussing... or engage in some other form of illegal activity.
- Just because you saw in the paper...
- Come on, Stan.
You don't notice anything strange about him?
Where do I start?
I'm not talking personal habits.
A few weeks back, I'm down on Pacific coming from the podiatrist.
I spot him driving with another fella in a derby.
It was suspicious.
He didn't see me, so I tailed him.
- I did some snooping.
- You tailed our boss?
They went to a barn;
Trucks were coming and going;
The smell of alcohol was in the air;
It was a bootlegging operation.
- I'll tell the world.
- So he's sitting on it, waiting for the right time for us to make our move.
It was over a month ago.
Heads will roll, gentlemen.
- "Van Asshole."
- Sir?
Someone scribbled an obscenity on the water closet wall.
Due to recent events, it has become necessary that we scale back in an effort to conserve financially.
- Are we being sacked, ma'am?
- No.
Though I'm considering suggesting a wage cut
- across the board.
- If I may?
My husband has been unable to find employment...
- I support a crippled brother...
- I'm sure you all have hardships, which we've taken into consideration.
You'll each find an extra $2 in your pay this week.
Th-this week only, mam?
Yes.
As a bonus.
I believe it's customary to say thank you.
- Yes.
- Of course.
Thank you.
What is it, ladies?
Speak your minds.
Actually, ma'am, we were expecting a raise in pay.
- Whatever for?
- Mr. Thompson... a few weeks back he came in one night in... a rather jolly mood.
He told us he was raising our salaries.
Forgive me, ma'am, but he may have been drinking.
Well...
It's a special kind of fool who relies on the promise of a drunkard.
Now if there's nothing else?
- No ma'am.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
To your tasks then.
You talked to him about the cash upfront, right?
Munya!
We made it.
Manny Horvitz, this is the fella I called you about...
Jimmy Darmody.
- Mr. Horvitz.
- You're Darmody?
Oysh, he's just a baby.
I thought you liked em' young, Manny.
If we're talking veal, yes.
But when it comes to business...
- You speak yiddish?
- That's all I know.
Still you make an effort, I'm impressed.
Already I feel this is going well.
This man looks interesting.
My associate Mr. Harrow.
What happened to you?
I put my nose where it didn't belong.
You're funny.
He's a sweetheart and Mickey is a gonif from way back.
Chayem, introduce yourself.
- Herman Kaufman.
- All right, Herman.
First in his class at eastern state...
Penitentiary.
I'm kidding.
Herman only did county time.
Can I get you fellas something to eat?
- No, but thank you.
- Ahhh.
You're gonna smell the cooking and you're gonna get hungry.
So what's your pleasure, Mr. Horvitz?
Munya or Manny.
My pleasure?
I got a daughter.
She's an angel.
And my wife?
Ehh, ankles got thick, but I love her anyway.
And Waxey Gordon is a cocksucking piece of shit.
- Why is that?
- He's a greedy prick, with his hand in my ass pocket where my wallet should be.
- Fuckin' chazer.
- Eight years I work with the man.
Promises made and now where am I?
Talking to a baby in a butcher shop.
I like you, boychik.
Nice warm feeling.
We hear you're flush with hooch.
- You heard right.
- How'd you like to make some dough?
We didn't come to Philly for the brisket.
You got liquor.
We got money.
You see where I'm driving?
I need cash upfront.
Well, first consider I got restaurants, 30, 40 speaks, about 10 blocks or so in jewtown... weikel off somerset.
It's a nice opportunity.
We'd do 100 cases a week, build our business from there.
And stick it right up Waxey's tuchus.
Still has to be in advance.
Five grand, we can make delivery anytime.
That's a lot of green.
You could always say no.
We got a deal.
But just so we're clear, my icebox is filled with pieces of fellas who tried to fuck me over.
I just got creamsicles in mine.
Mr. Harrow will be in touch.
Gentlemen.
Mr. Dempsey, Mr. Dempsey.
Hey, Mr. Dempsey!
Champ, hey, champ!
Mr. Dempsey, please!
- Come on, Jack.
Gotta go.
- All right, all right.
That's it, all right.
Thank you, thank you.
- It's worse than being in the ring.
- Yeah, I know.
There we go.
There we go.
That'smylawyeroverthere.
- In a while you'll see his briefs.
- He's got his hands full.
Oh, gee!
That's it, girls.
Bringhimin .
Ow ow!
Ohh.
Oink oink oink oink.
- Happy Birthday, Ed.
- Make a wish.
This was my wish.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you were in the middle of a city council meeting.
Jesus, is that who I think it is?
Jesus wouldn't last a round.
Jack Dempsey, say hello to our esteemed mayor Edward Bader.
Happy Birthday, sir.
I usually keep my trousers on for visiting dignitaries.
Hell, most of the fellas I meet are in their boxing trunks anyhow.
He could have used you a minute ago when they were beating the tar out of him.
Heh, I wouldn't tangle with these girls.
That's for sure.
And if you would, you'd be doin' it in Jersey city.
Come here to gloat, Mr. Hague?
That and...
for some cake.
How you feeling about Carpentier, champ?
Are you kiddin'?
I'm gonna knock his block off.
In a brand new arena I built for the occasion.
Jersey city in July, what's that like?
- Once you get past the smell...
- Can't say he's lying there.
I tell you, sometimes I gotta hold my breath running past that sewage plant.
So train here.
Fresh sea air, early morning runs on the beach, not to mention our other natural resources.
Sorry, hon, but we ain't homegrown.
Philadelphia imports.
I was wondering why I hadn't seen you around.
We been here since November, sweetie.
These are the girls we had trucked in during the election.
She was responsible for 1,000 republican votes single-handed.
Except it wasn't my hands I was usin'.
Wait a minute.
Did you say you girls are from Philadelphia?
- What of it?
- My friend, you need to have a chat with your lawyer.
- Cake?
- Yeah, a slice.
- Cake?
- Slice of cake?
- What's wrong?
- Wrong?
I just figured a way to get your case dismissed.
Moving whores across state lines?
That's a federal charge.
Bureau of internal revenue.
Special Agent Van Alden speaking.
Nelson, are you all right?
Rose.
Yes.
I'm fine, dear.
What's wrong?
I called your boardinghouse five times last night.
- That seems excessive.
- They said you no longer lived there.
That... what?
That's ridiculous.
Who... who did you speak with?
A Greek gentleman.
I didn't get his name.
Well, that's preposterous.
I'll get to the bottom of this immediately.
I was very frightened, Nelson.
I thought something happened.
No, of course not.
There's nothing for you to worry about.
The, umm, mice in the attic?
They've been very active lately.
I'll set traps next time I'm home.
- When will that be?
- Soon.
We're very busy, dear.
I'm lonely, Nelson.
And I don't like the way you sound.
There are some very important matters
I need to attend to.
Please try to get some rest.
I will.
Take care and God bless.
We're making progress.
It's slow but sure.
Slow don't cut it with four of my boys in an unmarked grave.
Their families will be compensated.
This ain't about money, Nucky.
It's about revenge on them ghost-ridin' motherfuckers.
You need to sit tight with that.
Oh, I been sittin' tight.
My ass sore.
Well, those silk cushions ought to help.
- You keep makin' this about money.
- It's always about money.
It took a lot of cash for my lawyer to get you out, chalky.
That fella you have is inept.
Did I not say thank you?
You can thank me by being a good boy.
I gave you my word.
Now save your strength and enjoy your family.
How am I supposed to do that?
I got four other families waiting' on me for justice.
You're not the only one looking to settle scores.
These are your sworn depositions stating that Enoch Thompson brought you to Atlantic City last November with the express purpose of performing sexual favors for certain gentlemen in order to...
Influence their voting blocs.
Uh, you fucked people to sway their votes.
Sure we did.
A couple factory owners, some union reps.
Then this accurately reflects your understanding of events as they occurred?
Sure, I suppose.
And the charges keep piling up.
Well, it's not like esn't have it coming.
He loves you.
There's love and then there's everything else.
I'm sorry.
Am I allowed to talk?
It doesn't hinder me.
Have you ever been in love?
Not the way you mean.
Someone you care about?
I have a sister.
A twin.
Her name is Emma.
Where does she live?
Plover, Wisconsin.
We grew up on the farm.
There were no other children of our age.
We spent every moment together.
- Inseparable.
- Yeah.
We milked cows, baled hay, fished.
She taught me how to cook.
That's sweet.
Whatever love is, that's what I felt for Emma.
Do you visit her often?
When I came back from the war, she nursed me, and gave me morphine to keep the pain at bay.
Despite my injuries she treated me no different.
I was her brother, the closest person in her life.
But suddenly...
I felt different toward her.
I would stare at her...
And feel nothing.
I lost whatever I thought love was.
When my wounds healed,
I moved to Chicago to get lost there.
I haven't spoken to her since.
It was a constable station in tipperary.
They pulled the bodies of 12 black and tans from the rubble.
One had no head.
For the cause?
A message for the crown.
And after that it was our mission to execute a bombing a week... lorries, sentries, British quarters, post offices, even a rectory.
Uh, the wire.
This is what you used?
Uh-huh, gelignite.
Blasting gelatin used in quarries... for mining.
You see it doesn't sweat.
Like you are now.
What does "sweat" mean?
That it won't leak nitroglycerine like dynamite.
It's more stable and easier to transport.
Detonators.
- They won't bite.
- What is it?
Blasting caps filled with Mercury and chlorate of potash.
Someone's goin' out of business.
Mickey Doyle.
Here you go.
There's another 50 in the car.
They're ingersolls.
I wish you would stop with this.
We schlep around with a box of watches, what do we look like?
Fellas who know what time it is.
Might as well set up a pushcart.
Arnold Rothstein's here.
- We're talking, Benny.
- Oh.
So I should tell him go fuck a duck?
Enough with the crazy shit already, huh?
- The fuck?
- Bring him in before he breaks the house.
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Put the bag away.
A.R., did you come to sit in?
You know you're always welcome.
I'm afraid those sharpers out there'd fleece me.
Owing to his present difficulties,
I've made a deal with Nucky Thompson.
He'll be offloading his liquor shipments in Philadelphia.
Waxey Gordon will ensure safe arrival.
The route to Atlantic city will be my responsibility.
And you'd like us to recruit the muscle?
I would like you to be the muscle.
A.R., we, uh, got some business going on just now.
I can see that.
But Mr. Thompson is paying me a premium.
Anybody could ride shotgun.
Until you encounter Indians.
We're honored by your trust, A.R., and flattered that you would come below 14th street to discuss it personally.
Aren't we, Charlie?
- Sure.
- As it happens
I was down here having dinner with Joe Masseria, who left me with the distinct impression he'd still like both of you dead.
You broke bread with that prick?
We were served a native dish of tripe, which I cannot abide.
But I ate it anyway, to keep the peace.
Some things, Charlie, you just have to swallow.
Adeline, can you bring the biscuits, please?
Coming.
Everyone take your places, please.
I want to welcome Samuel to our table...
Thank you, Mrs. White and Mr. White.
And ask that he lead us in the saying of grace.
I'd be honored, ma'am.
- Lord, we...
- Is that a duck?
Yes, Albert.
Of course it is.
Please, Mr. Crawford.
- Lord, we thank you...
- I thought I asked for hopping' John.
There's duck...
Peas, carrots, fresh-baked biscuits.
I made chocolate pudding for dessert.
- We'd like to thank you for the gifts...
- I asked a question.
Albert, please.
She made that pudding all by herself.
- That's very nice.
- Where the damn hoppin' John?
Albert, you know that's not proper food for a guest.
Now let's allow Samuel to finish.
Lord, we come togeth...
Well, maybe our guest would've liked some.
Well, I have always enjoyed that type of food, sir.
What type of food?
Uh, my grandma would make it.
I say something funny, son?
- Beg your pardon?
- You laughing.
- What the joke?
- Hoppin' John, Albert.
You're being ridiculous.
I been eatin' rice and beans all my life.
Tell me it ain't good enough.
You'll have to forgive my husband's country ways.
I completely understand, ma'am.
This is my house!
And my country ways put the food on this goddamn table.
Albert!
You're drunk.
Sir, I apologize.
- I'll leave...
- You stay right where you are, son.
Right there...
Inside the house.
Pretty clear who the field nigger is.
Almost finished.
Hmm.
This is what I look like?
Yes.
Hmm, is it expensive?
- The drawing?
- I can pay for it.
No.
No, I... it's yours, if you want it.
Ange?
Ange, are you home?
In here.
- What are you doing?
- I was sketching Richard.
I'll put him to bed.
Thank you.
He's tuckered out.
We rode the Ferris wheel after my mother's.
Tomorrow... we're gonna need to go to Philly for that delivery.
Okay.
Good night.
He sat for you?
Is that so surprising?
I don't know.
I'm never sure what's going on inside him.
I gotta hand it to Icky.
Thiswasagreatidea .
The whole thing was a setup.
I mean, Fleming helped too of course.
It was a means to an end.
But surely nothing to be proud of.
It's not pride, it's happiness.
I violated the mann act.
It prohibits the interstate transportation of females for immoral purposes.
It's a federal law, which means the entire election case can be rolled into a federal indictment.
- So the Attorney General can help?
- Exactly.
This is how things work, Margaret.
You know that.
I had no relations with any of these women, if that's what you're worried about.
I believe you.
The tide's turning, I'll tell you that much.
I'd love to see the look on the Commodore's...
I need $100.
Clothes for the children.
Very well.
Where are you going?
Off to bed.
I'll be up in a while.
It's owned by a widow, but ran by a fella named Mickey Doyle.
Van Alden arrested him last year for bootlegging.
- This is the place?
- This is it.
It looks deserted.
You don't smell that?
There's a still in there.
I don't see the point of this.
We're prohis, Stan.
We're going to make an arrest.
But if it is what you think it is, van Alden will have our heads.
Then we'll arrest him too.
Go check around back.
Oh.
Oh God.
That's it, one last bite.
Louis dear.
You need nourishment.
Do you remember when we met?
I'll never forget your smile.
Jimmy sometimes, he has it.
I look at him and I see you.
That first night, how you plied me with wine...
Why I'd never felt such a sensation.
We were downstairs.
And I'd fallen asleep on the divan.
You carried me to the bedroom, went to say good night to your guests.
And I lay there in bed...
Dreaming of the waves.
I'd been on the beach that day.
Suddenly I felt a crushing feeling,
I couldn't breathe.
I opened my eyes to find you atop me...
Your breath smelling of whiskey and tobacco...
One hand covering my mouth...
And the other groping at me.
Do you remember that?
Still...
Sometimes when I sleep, it wakes me with a start.
Do you remember that night?
I...
I asked you a question.

Come on, you gotta help me move these barrels.
- Here we go.
- You can barely move in here.
You've got your friends at the Coast Guard to thank for that.
Three ships' worth of booze.
The Nina, the Pinta and the Canadian Club.
Bill McCoy's probably still crying his eyes out.
On Nucky Thompson's shoulder.
What happened with you and Nucky anyway?
I guess that's between me and Nucky, isn't it?
We need more space, Mickey.
Ain't an empty garage in 10 miles.
Then try 11.
Pay cash.
End of next summer, we'll be the biggest distributors in the northeast.
From the tiny acorn grows the mighty elk.
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous.
Be careful with that.
Don't like not knowing what's going on.
That's what makes it exciting.
What the hell is that?
The Pipes of Pan.
Goddamn cat in a rain barrel.
Open your eyes, if thou darest.
Ain't you the humdinger?
Silence, mortal.
I am Diana, daughter of Jupiter.
And no man may look upon my nakedness as I bathe.
This is one of your little performances.
You should have come, dear, at least once.
I never liked the idea of you parading around in front of other men.
You could have married me.
I had a city to run.
I understand.
I always have.
But I did have a boy to raise.
We're all here now, aren't we?
He has so much to learn from you.
I can't tell you what it means to us, after all this time.
And you're going to take care of him, aren't you?
Come here with that mouth.
Do you know what happened to the shepherd who spied on the virginal Diana?
She turned him into a stag.
He tried to run away, but his own hounds tore him to pieces.
Get your ass over here.
Prepare for the righteous punishment of the gods.
Louis?
Louis!
Louis!
Louis!
What does the bee do?
Bring home honey.
What does Father do?
Bring home money.
What does Mother do?
Lay out the money.
What do children do?
Eat up the honey!
Lovely, dear.
- Very nice.
- Good morning.
- Munchkins.
- Good morning, Uncle Nucky.
Could you not sleep?
I have a busy day.
Will you be breakfasting, Mr. Thompson?
I will not.
Nor will I be dinnering.
It's Ed Bader's birthday.
Did I not mention that?
I take it there will be a party?
Something small, make him feel important.
A meal in his honor, maybe.
Be sure not to overindulge.
Mr. Sleater.
Good day, everyone.
Top of the mornin'.
Isn't that what your people say?
And we also fix shoes if you leave them outside your door.
- Surely it isn't that funny.
- Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Sleater will be driving me now.
It's all I can do to stick to the correct side of the road.
- I'll be right out.
- Sir, ma'am.
Katy.
Please ask Lilian to get the children dressed and to drill Teddy in his catechism.
Come, dears.
A bit cheeky, isn't he?
- What's that mean again?
- Impertinent.
He's serving a purpose.
- And may I ask what that is?
- You may, and I may not answer.
The weekly expenses.
There's a little extra for the staff.
- What for?
- To let them know they're appreciated.
This is no time to be frivolous with money.
It's two dollars extra apiece.
It makes no difference to us, but to them it's a windfall.
You do realize they steal from us.
It's what servants do.
It's what everyone does.
And we pretend not to know and life goes on.
No one gave me a bonus when I was in service.
All the more reason to be generous now.
I'm nearly out of shaving soap.
Any more of them eggs?
You've had nearly half a dozen already, Albert.
Tell them chickens to work overtime.
- Daddy!
- There's my sweet pea.
- When did you get home?
- Last night, past your bedtime.
Crept in like the sandman.
Will you check my homework?
You're asking Daddy?
Your mama'll do that for you.
Your brother know I'm too strict.
If you say so.
Stop toying with your father.
He know who bring home the bacon.
How my princess doin'?
Did you ask him, Mother?
Ask me what?
Mama invited Samuel over for dinner tomorrow night.
Did she now?
We did discuss this.
If a young lady is being courted, it needs to be in a respectable manner.
He's planning to study medicine.
An educated buck.
I suppose it'd be all right.
Dinner with all the fixings.
I been craving Hoppin' John since the moon was blue.
- Richard.
- Good morning.
I'm here for Jimmy.
I thought he was with you.
His mother called late last night.
He left and I assumed...
Was everything all right?
He doesn't tell me anything.
This business with Nucky...
I saw him on the Boardwalk, he wouldn't even look at me.
Very bold.
My feeble attempt at expressionism.
There was an artist I saw in Paris.
He does cityscapes.
Very stark, no people.
De Chirico.
I don't know.
He also did figures who look like mannequins.
Have you ever posed for an artist?
No.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
I used to draw when I was a child.
It was very relaxing.
It can be.
It can also be maddening.
It took me years to be able to draw hands.
It's apoplexy.
A stroke.
His entire right side is paralyzed.
He can eat, but so far he's been unable to speak.
Was he agitated?
Overexcited in any way?
As I said, I found him like this.
Shouldn't he be in a hospital?
No.
No one can care for him like his family.
Commodore.
What do you want to say?
Cock.
Cock!
Yeah, I...
- Cock, fuck!
- That's enough for now.
He needs to rest.
Jesus Christ, he's a fucking vegetable!
Keep your voice down, please.
- What are we gonna do now?
- He's going to be fine, dear.
- That's not what Dr. Surran says.
- Without him running this thing,
- his political connections, Nucky'll...
- Stop it right now!
The both of you!
Now, you listen to me.
I didn't spend my life getting groped by a bunch of drunks to wind up in a goddamn poorhouse.
I've got eight kids, Gillian.
Jimmy and I are well aware of that.
"Jimmy and you." That's exactly...
The two of you, and him?
None of that's normal.
It never was.
It's normal to me and to my son and his father.
And it suited you, didn't it?
Up till this morning.
Up till this morning, the man with the clout wasn't drooling into his pajamas.
You have a cruel streak, Eli.
That's never an attractive quality.
- He can't even talk.
- Louis is unwell.
He's going to recover.
You need to calm down.
It's all going to work out.
- How the fuck would you know?
- Because Jimmy will handle it.
We're in for 70 grand to his cronies.
They'll get paid back when we unload the booze.
- What are you waiting for?
- The town's flush, Eli.
Then sell it out of town.
New York, Philadelphia.
You wanna give me names and addresses, or should I just go door to door?
Why ask me?
You both got it all worked out, right?
Maybe this wasn't the best idea, letting Eli see him like that.
I'm sorry if I seemed heated, baby.
It's a difficult time for both of us.
I want ice cream!
Alcohol and cake.
Call it for 9:00 so nobody's expecting a full dinner.
Hors d'oeuvres only.
Dancing girls?
Wouldn't be much of a party otherwise, would it?
- Fine, then, you handle that.
- How old is Mayor Bader?
The fuck do I know?
What's the difference?
- The candles for the cake.
- Don't make a production out of it.
He is the mayor of Atlantic City.
And not the Prince of Wales.
Tell them to send up some eggs Florentine.
And get me Arnold Rothstein on the phone.
Arnold?
A Nucky Thompson on the telephone.
I'll take it in here, darling.
How's our stomach?
It's still a little tentative.
So much apple bread.
It has a binding effect.
Is that the best thing right now?
Sound elimination is the basis of good health.
Mr. Thompson.
Mr. Thompson, to what do I owe the pleasure?
A change in my circumstances, as I'm sure you've already heard.
And are we discussing a problem or a proposition?
That depends which side of the phone you're on.
I need a port to land some cargo.
I was under the impression Atlantic City was aptly named.
The Coast Guard's locked me down.
I can't land a mackerel.
I have an import operation in Montauk.
Long Island.
Too far.
What about Philadelphia?
We'd have to cut in Waxey Gordon.
I'm listening.
There's my 20% and I'll convince Waxey that 20% for him is a fair price also.
- That's a pretty penny, Arnold.
- Of course, my cut includes men to oversee the operation.
You remember Mr. Luciano.
- I do.
- Then it's settled.
Direct your ships to Philly and let me know the details.
You've got a new port of call.
I can already feel the brotherly love.
I'd like to thank Mr. White for joining us here today.
We know how busy he is and how hard he works for our community.
Ain't no matter, Wilfred.
Yes, sir.
Now, this is an informal gathering so we will not adhere to strict parliamentary rule, but if you could just raise your hands...
I give the floor to Mr. White.
Now I know y'all got your beefs and various complaints.
I hear an earful over the past weeks I've been in jail.
But I'm back now, and everybody know my door always open.
- Mr. White.
- Yeah?
I don't mean to trouble you.
You ain't never no trouble, Mrs. Mayhew.
There's this couple next door to me.
They are habituated to late-night rent parties.
There's no end to rag music being played, and unseemly behavior on public view.
You ain't gonna be bothered by none of that from now on.
Bless you, Mr. White.
Travis Elkins, sir.
I remember you fine, Travis.
Mr. White, I been six months in the kitchen there at the Ritz?
Near 40 of us on second shift.
12 hours on our feet.
Wash our aprons, that come out your pay.
Break a cup, that come out your pay.
Give us the one meal, if you call it that, it come out your pay, too.
What they serve us, Mr. White, ain't fit for a dog tied to a stake post, and we working men.
- I'll look into that, Travis.
- Thank you, sir.
It's true.
Everybody, enjoy the refreshments.
- Mr. White.
- And remember,
- come July 4th, all y'all...
- What about my husband?
- How's that?
- Those white men cut his throat while he loading your trucks with your illegal liquor...
Sister, moderation in the Lord's house.
What being' done about that?
You'll be looked after, I promise.
You promise.
You promise.
- My son is dead.
- I buried the father of my three children.
They bring my man home rolled up in a wash bucket.
- Ladies, ladies.
- It's true.
I said it'll be taken care of.
When?
How?
Order, ladies, please.
Ain't nobody put you in charge.
You walk around, take a bite off everyone else's plate, don't give nothing back except a summer clambake and a Christmas turkey.
Continental Tea Garden, $422.
Morgan's Oyster House, $216.
- Shall I tag them with currency straps?
- I'll do it.
- I don't mind, sir, I have...
- Johnny-on-the-spot, are you?
Have you finished the affidavits for tomorrow's search warrants?
- I was in the process...
- Concern yourself with your own duties,
Agent Clarkson.
Yes, sir.
I'll be in the W.C.
- According to the New York Herald...
- Do not start with that.
...half of all prohibition agents accept bribes...
- I'm not interested in discussing...
...or engage in some other form of illegal activity.
- Just because you saw in the paper...
- Come on, Stan.
You don't notice anything strange about him?
- Where do I start?
- I'm not talking personal habits.
A few weeks back, I'm down on Pacific, coming from the podiatrist.
I spot him driving with another fella in a derby.
It was suspicious.
He didn't see me, so I tailed him.
I did some snooping.
You tailed our boss?
They went to a barn.
Trucks were coming and going, the smell of alcohol was in the air.
It was a bootlegging operation.
- I'll tell the world.
- So he's sitting on it, waiting for the right time for us to make our move.
It was over a month ago.
Heads will roll, gentlemen.
- "Van Asshole."
- Sir?
Someone scribbled an obscenity on the water closet wall.
Due to recent events, it has become necessary that we scale back in an effort to conserve financially.
- Are we being sacked, ma'am?
- No.
Though I'm considering suggesting a wage cut
- across the board.
- If I may?
My husband has been unable to find employment...
- I support a crippled brother...
- I'm sure you all have hardships, which we've taken into consideration.
You'll each find an extra $2 in your pay this week.
This week only, ma'am?
Yes.
As a bonus.
I believe it's customary to say, "Thank you."
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
What is it, ladies?
Speak your minds.
Actually, ma'am, we were expecting a raise in pay.
- Whatever for?
- Mr. Thompson, a few weeks back, he came in one night in...
A rather jolly mood.
He told us he was raising our salaries.
Forgive me, ma'am, but he may have been drinking.
It's a special kind of fool who relies on the promise of a drunkard.
Now, if there's nothing else?
- No, ma'am.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
To your tasks, then.
You talked to him about the cash up front, right?
Munya!
We made it.
Manny Horvitz, this is the fella I called you about.
Jimmy Darmody.
Mr. Horvitz.
You're Darmody?
He's just a baby.
I thought you liked em' young, Manny.
If we're talking veal, yes.
But when it comes to business...
It's nice to meet you.
- You speak Yiddish?
- That's all I know.
Still, you make an effort.
I'm impressed.
Already I feel this is going well.
This man looks interesting.
My associate, Mr. Harrow.
What happened to you?
I put my nose where it didn't belong.
You're funny.
He's a sweetheart, and Mickey is a gonif from way back.
Introduce yourself.
- Herman Kaufman.
- All right, Herman.
First in his class at Eastern State Penitentiary.
I'm kidding.
Herman only did county time.
Can I get you fellas something to eat?
No, but thank you.
You're gonna smell the cooking and you're gonna get hungry.
Avram, fry this up with some onions.
So what's your pleasure, Mr. Horvitz?
Munya, or Manny.
My pleasure?
I got a daughter.
She's an angel.
And my wife?
Ankles got thick, but I love her anyway.
And Waxey Gordon is a cocksucking piece of shit.
- Why is that?
- He's a greedy prick, with his hand in my ass pocket where my wallet should be.
Fuckin' khazer.
Eight years I work with the man.
Promises made and now where am I?
Talking to a baby in a butcher shop.
I like you, boychik.
Nice warm feeling.
We hear you're flush with hooch.
- You heard right.
- How'd you like to make some dough?
We didn't come to Philly for the brisket.
You got liquor.
We got money.
You see where I'm driving?
I need cash up front.
First consider I got restaurants, 30, 40 speaks, about 10 blocks or so in Jew town...
Weikel off Somerset.
It's a nice opportunity.
We do 100 cases a week, build our business from there.
And stick it right up Waxey's tuchus.
Still has to be in advance.
Five grand, we can make delivery anytime.
That's a lot of green.
You could always say no.
We got a deal.
But just so we're clear, my icebox is filled with pieces of fellas who tried to fuck me over.
I just got creamsicles in mine.
Mr. Harrow will be in touch.
Gentlemen.
Mr. Dempsey, Mr. Dempsey.
Mr. Dempsey!
Champ!
Hey, champ!
Mr. Dempsey, please!
- Come on, Jack.
Gotta go.
- All right, all right.
That's it, all right.
Thank you, thank you.
- It's worse than being in the ring.
- Yeah, I know.
There we go.
There we go.
That's my lawyer over there.
- In a while you'll see his briefs.
- He's got his hands full.
That's it, girls.
Bring him in.
Oink, oink, oink, oink!
- Happy birthday, Ed.
- Make a wish.
This was my wish.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you were in the middle of a city council meeting.
Jesus, is that who I think it is?
Jesus wouldn't last a round.
Jack Dempsey, say hello to our esteemed Mayor Edward Bader.
Happy birthday, sir.
I usually keep my trousers on for visiting dignitaries.
Hell, most of the fellas I meet are in their boxing trunks anyhow.
He could have used you a minute ago when they were beating the tar out of him.
I wouldn't tangle with these girls.
That's for sure.
And if you would, you'd be doin' it in Jersey City.
Come here to gloat, Mr. Hague?
That, and for some cake.
- How you feeling about Carpentier, champ?
- Are you kiddin'?
I'm gonna knock his block off.
In a brand new arena I built for the occasion.
Jersey City in July, what's that like?
Once you get past the smell...
Can't say he's lying there.
I tell you, sometimes I gotta hold my breath running past that sewage plant.
So train here.
Fresh sea air, early morning runs on the beach, not to mention our other natural resources.
- Sorry, hon, but we ain't homegrown.
- Philadelphia imports.
I was wondering why I hadn't seen you around.
We been here since November, sweetie.
These are the girls we had trucked in during the election.
She was responsible for 1,000 Republican votes single-handed.
Except it wasn't my hands I was usin'.
Wait a minute.
Did you say you girls are from Philadelphia?
What of it?
My friend, you need to have a chat with your lawyer.
- Cake?
- Yeah, a slice.
- Cake?
- Slice of cake?
- What's wrong?
- Wrong?
I just figured a way to get your case dismissed.
Moving whores across state lines?
That's a federal charge.
Bureau of Internal Revenue.
Special Agent Van Alden speaking.
Nelson, are you all right?
Rose.
Yes.
I'm fine, dear.
What's wrong?
I called your boardinghouse five times last night.
That seems excessive.
They said you no longer lived there.
What?
That's ridiculous.
Who did you speak with?
A Greek gentleman.
I didn't get his name.
Well, that's preposterous.
I'll get to the bottom of this immediately.
I was very frightened, Nelson.
I thought something happened.
No, of course not.
There's nothing for you to worry about.
The mice in the attic?
They've been very active lately.
I'll set traps next time I'm home.
- When will that be?
- Soon.
We're very busy, dear.
I'm lonely, Nelson.
And I don't like the way you sound.
There are some very important matters I need to attend to.
Please try to get some rest.
I will.
Take care and God bless.
We're making progress.
It's slow but sure.
Slow don't cut it with four of my boys in an unmarked grave.
Their families will be compensated.
This ain't about money, Nucky.
It's about revenge on them ghost-ridin' motherfuckers.
You need to sit tight with that.
I been sittin' tight.
My ass sore.
Those silk cushions ought to help.
- You keep makin' this about money.
- It's always about money.
It took a lot of cash for my lawyer to get you out, Chalky.
That fella you have is inept.
Did I not say thank you?
You can thank me by being a good boy.
I gave you my word.
Now save your strength and enjoy your family.
How am I supposed to do that?
I got four other families waiting' on me for justice.
You're not the only one looking to settle scores.
These are your sworn depositions stating that Enoch Thompson brought you to Atlantic City last November with the express purpose of performing sexual favors for certain gentlemen in order to
influence their voting blocs.
You fucked people to sway their votes.
Sure we did.
A couple factory owners, some union reps.
Then this accurately reflects your understanding of events as they occurred?
Sure, I suppose.
And the charges keep piling up.
It's not like he doesn't have it coming.
He loves you.
There's love, and then there's everything else.
I'm sorry.
Am I allowed to talk?
It doesn't hinder me.
Have you ever been in love?
Not the way you mean.
Someone you care about?
I have a sister.
A twin.
Her name is Emma.
Where does she live?
Plover, Wisconsin.
We grew up on the farm.
There were no other children of our age.
We spent every moment together.
- Inseparable.
- Yeah.
We milked cows, baled hay, fished.
She taught me how to cook.
That's sweet.
Whatever love is, that's what I felt for Emma.
Do you visit her often?
When I came back from the war, she nursed me, and gave me morphine to keep the pain at bay.
Despite my injuries, she treated me no different.
I was her brother, the closest person in her life.
But suddenly,
I felt different toward her.
I would stare at her and feel nothing.
I lost whatever I thought love was.
When my wounds healed, I moved to Chicago to get lost there.
I haven't spoken to her since.
It was a constable station in Tipperary.
They pulled the bodies of 12 Black and Tans from the rubble.
One had no head.
For the cause?
A message for the Crown.
And after that, it was our mission to execute a bombing a week.
Lorries, sentries, British quarters, post offices, even a rectory.
The wire.
This is what you used?
Gelignite.
Blasting gelatin used in quarries for mining.
You see, it doesn't sweat.
Like you are now.
What does "sweat" mean?
That it won't leak nitroglycerine like dynamite.
It's more stable and easier to transport.
Detonators.
They won't bite.
What is it?
Blasting caps filled with mercury and chlorate of potash.
Someone's goin' out of business.
Mickey Doyle.
Here you go.
There's another 50 in the car.
They're Ingersolls.
I wish you would stop with this.
You schlep around with a box of watches, what do we look like?
Fellas who know what time it is.
Might as well set up a pushcart.
Arnold Rothstein's here.
We're talking, Benny.
So I should tell him go fuck a duck?
Enough with the crazy shit already.
- What the fuck?
- Bring him in before he breaks the house.
Mr. Rothstein.
Put the bag away.
A.R., did you come to sit in?
You know you're always welcome.
I'm afraid those sharpers out there would fleece me.
Owing to his present difficulties, I've made a deal with Nucky Thompson.
He'll be offloading his liquor shipments in Philadelphia.
Waxey Gordon will ensure safe arrival.
The route to Atlantic City will be my responsibility.
And you'd like us to recruit the muscle?
I would like you to be the muscle.
A.R., we got some business going on just now.
I can see that.
But Mr. Thompson is paying me a premium.
Anybody could ride shotgun.
Until you encounter Indians.
We're honored by your trust, A.R., and flattered that you would come below 14th Street to discuss it personally.
Aren't we, Charlie?
- Sure.
- As it happens,
I was down here having dinner with Joe Masseria, who left me with the distinct impression he'd still like both of you dead.
You broke bread with that prick?
We were served a native dish of tripe, which I cannot abide.
But I ate it anyway, to keep the peace.
Some things, Charlie, you just have to swallow.
- Adeline, can you bring the biscuits, please?
- Coming.
Everyone take your places, please.
I want to welcome Samuel to our table.
Thank you, Mrs. White and Mr. White.
And ask that he lead us in the saying of grace.
I'd be honored, ma'am.
- Lord, we...
- Is that a duck?
Yes, Albert.
Of course it is.
Please, Mr. Crawford.
- Lord, we thank you...
- I thought I asked for Hoppin' John.
There's duck, peas, carrots, fresh-baked biscuits.
I made chocolate pudding for dessert.
- We'd like to thank you for the gifts...
- I asked a question.
Albert, please.
She made that pudding all by herself.
- That's very nice.
- Where the damn Hoppin' John?
Albert, you know that's not proper food for a guest.
Now, let's allow Samuel to finish.
- Lord, we come...
- Maybe our guest would've liked some.
I have always enjoyed that type of food, sir.
What type of food?
My grandma would make it.
I say something funny, son?
- Beg your pardon?
- You laughing.
- What the joke?
- Hoppin' John, Albert.
You're being ridiculous.
I been eatin' rice and beans all my life.
Tell me it ain't good enough.
You'll have to forgive my husband's country ways.
I completely understand, ma'am.
This is my house!
And my country ways put the food on this goddamn table!
Albert!
You're drunk.
Sir,
I apologize.
- I'll leave...
- You stay right where you are, son.
Right there.
Inside the house.
Pretty clear who the field nigger is.
Almost finished.
This is what I look like?
Yes.
Is it expensive?
The drawing?
I can pay for it.
No.
No.
It's yours, if you want it.
Ange?
Ange, you home?
In here.
What are you doing?
I was sketching Richard.
I'll put him to bed.
Thank you.
He's tuckered out.
We rode the Ferris wheel after my mother's.
Tomorrow we're gonna need to go to Philly for that delivery.
Okay.
Good night.
He sat for you?
Is that so surprising?
I don't know.
I'm never sure what's going on inside him.
I gotta hand it to Icky.
This was a great idea.
The whole thing was a setup.
I mean, Fleming helped, too, of course.
It was a means to an end.
Surely nothing to be proud of.
It's not pride, it's happiness.
I violated the Mann Act.
It prohibits the interstate transportation of females for immoral purposes.
It's a federal law, which means the entire election case can be rolled into a federal indictment.
- So the attorney general can help?
- Exactly.
This is how things work, Margaret.
You know that.
I had no relations with any of these women, if that's what you're worried about.
I believe you.
The tide's turning, I'll tell you that much.
I'd love to see the look on the Commodore's...
I need $100.
Clothes for the children.
Very well.
Where are you going?
Off to bed.
I'll be up in a while.
It's owned by a widow, but ran by a fella named Mickey Doyle.
Van Alden arrested him last year for bootlegging.
This is the place?
This is it.
It looks deserted.
You don't smell that?
There's a still in there.
I don't see the point of this.
We're prohis, Stan.
We're going to make an arrest.
But if it is what you think it is, Van Alden will have our heads.
Then we'll arrest him, too.
Go check around back.
Oh, God.
That's it, one last bite.
Louis, dear.
You need nourishment.
Do you remember when we met?
I'll never forget your smile.
Jimmy sometimes, he has it.
I look at him and I see you.
That first night, how you plied me with wine.
Why, I'd never felt such a sensation.
We were downstairs.
And I'd fallen asleep on the divan.
You carried me to the bedroom, went to say good night to your guests.
And I lay there in bed, dreaming of the waves.
I'd been on the beach that day.
Suddenly, I felt a crushing feeling,
I couldn't breathe.
I opened my eyes to find you atop me.
Your breath smelling of whiskey and tobacco.
One hand covering my mouth,
and the other groping at me.
Do you remember that?
Still, sometimes when I sleep,
it wakes me with a start.
Do you remember that night?
I...
I asked you a question.
Students, today's anatomy lesson is devoted to the lung.
We will expose the inner wall of the lung and study the tissue-
-Where the exchange between the oxygen and the blood takes place.
Frid, a scalpel.
Is there any one who wants to make the first cut?
Moritz Dahlgren?
Professor.
I said "Can you take down the egg for me?" and he goes after the nest And falls.
He falls to the ground.
I wondered if he was dead.
I ran up and saw his elbow was dislocated.
He screamed like an animal.
-Don't you like it?
-I'll get up and continue working.
Frid, haven't you a penny to lend me?
I'm bankrupt.
Dahlgren?
You're warm among the birds, the professor's office won't complain.
-Uppsala?
-I'll go to a couple of lectures.
-You're not going to become a physician?
-No.
But it'd be useful to observe the latest advances in anatomy.
-How long?
-A couple of days.
Although Freund.
It'd be a great benefit to him to come along in view of his role as a tutor here ...
Thanks, that's enough.
Three days' absence, not more.
Take my carriage.
Professor Medelheim was a pharmacist.
One day the king passed by his city;
and he had a cyst on the crown.
A swollen sebaceous gland.
Painful.
Medelheim operated at the facility, which lead to his professorship and ennoblement.
-He was knighted for a sebaceous gland?
-No.
He was knighted for a swollen sebaceous gland.
Sit still.
Why do I need to go to Uppsala, then?
I want to show I also have come up in the world.
Mrs. Wåhlstedt.
Dåådh.
-You'll leave the city.
-In a few days.
Are you fleeing?
I want you to know I feel deeply remorseful.
And you?
I'm not satisfied either.
If a simple kiss is plaguing you ...
A simple kiss?
Everything's so easy for you.
You're free, but I've completed a sacred pledge of allegiance.
That promise is now broken.
Is it?
It keeps me awake at night.
You think, but what do you really do?
The feeling when we kissed, I can't describe it in words, but I realize that feeling puts us both in an impossible situation.
-So you see it as a mistake?
-Like you, apparently.
What happened should never happen again.
May lightning strike me if I open my heart to you again.
If in a fit of weakness I seek your help, ignore it completely.
Completely.
I saw the chief Constable's whore in Dåådh's neighbourhood this morning.
They did something together.
We'll take them both.
We need to wait.
Dåådh's gone to Uppsala-
-In Wåhlstedt's carriage.
For how long?
The secret lies with you now, Hedvig.
Yes, uncle.
We have a visitor from Stockholm the surgeon Johan Gustav Dåådh-
-One of my talented students.
Then I lost him to his duty to king and country.
Welcome.
You're very welcome.
Today's autopsy is devoted to examine radical surgery-
-Against breast cancer-
-Including excision of lymph nodes in the armpit.
Carl Peter Thorén will assist me.
I will make the first cut.
My God, you stink, Thorén!
Keep the mouth shut.
-Are you hung-over, man?
-No.
Now you'll see.
As a professor I have the privilege-
-Of my own small store in the basement.
Here is the same.
I know some of the students.
Old and new disciples mix together.
The challenge remains the same for me.
To get them to study hard, avoid resentment of others' speech and gossip.
The same as in your time, and I didn't always succeed.
To the King.
I have a small confession.
It wasn't just to see you that I asked you here.
I found one of our visiting students dead the other day.
Henry Monroe.
A brilliant student, the best.
-Cause of death?
-To be determined.
-Was there an autopsy?
-That's unthinkable.
Henry's father is famous in medical circles.
-Oliver Monroe?
Anatomy professor?
-Sir Oliver.
He'll surely come from Edinburgh to take back his son's remains.
I can't see Henry's body cut open.
-What did you notice?
-Only that his son died suddenly.
Possibly a ruptured appendix.
Henry had stomach pains for a long time-
-But he said nothing to me.
Well ...
What do you want me to do?
He'll probably choose to do the autopsy himself.
I'd have done so.
If he finds something improper it means the end of our academy.
I want you to keep your eyes open during your stay here.
I need your help and your absolute discretion.
Madame, your husband!
-Get Dåådh.
-He isn't in the city.
Bring Dr. Holmberg.
It's urgent.
-Johanna.
-Not in the city?
Where is he?
Carl-Fredrik what's happened to you?
Carl-Fredrik ...
Dåådh.
What are you doing?
-Whose room is this?
-A dead student.
At one time it was mine.
-And there, what is it?
-Nothing.
-You guys!
-Shh!
Come on.
I have met interesting people.
Moritz Dahlgren was tutor to the French ambassador's children.
He reads French novels.
Frid only drinks well water.
- "Tres interesting."
-What did you do tonight?
Played cards.
Look!
I won it from Thorén.
And tobacco.
-Where is it, then?
-Come on.
Thorén is a real player.
He asked if I could lend him money.
He assumed I work for a wealthy man when I said you are the district commissar.
You told him that?
Everyone.
Shh!
I wanted to show you'd come up in the world.
Thank you for bringing me here.
Far from Stockholm's alarms.
And no one dies.
No.
Freund, your chamber pot stinks.
Freund.
Freund!
From a crossbow.
Someone realized I'm examining the circumstances surrounding Monroe's death.
No one here knows you are the district commissar.
I told them.
Your husband suffers from a very fiery fever.
I can't promise cupping will cure the illness.
He may be in the final stage.
Final?
You shouldn't start to grieve in advance.
Yes ...
-But he will survive?
-Madame, I'm a doctor, not God.
I'll be back tomorrow morning.
No, no and no again.
Anything but pleasant.
No, there isn't anything the matter.
Don't you hear what I say?
You shall obey.
Obey, obey, obey.
I'm the chief Constable.
Show shame, man!
Get up.
What kind of cursed sack of hay is it?
Be ashamed!
Axel, send for Dåådh.
Send a courier with haste.
commissar Dåådh was attacked-
And the culprit may be here, in this hall.
While conscience may trip up that person, I ask the others to assist the commissar in his investigation.
It's about our Academy's reputation, our survival.
Well, then we'll move on to today's lecture.
Gentlemen! "Arret!"
Moritz Dahlgren is conceited, Carl Peter Thorén is a peasant.
I don't want to lose them, they are great talents.
-I have to question them.
-This is a disciplinary matter.
Their fight may pertain to Henry's murder, or the attack on me.
Yes ...
As you wish.
Dåådh, Mrs. Wåhlstedt wants you to come back.
The Chief Constable is sick.
-Don't they have their own doctor there?
-Yes.
-So what should I do?
-She wants you there.
I can't leave now.
-She begs you.
-That's what I say!
Take Wåhlstedt's carriage, go back to Stockholm.
I'll come when I can.
"Let Hedwig be.
She belongs to me."
"She finds your perpetual staring very uncomfortable."
"Obey the call, otherwise it won't go well. "
- "Thorén."
-This is a pure threat.
-When did you get this?
-Last night.
-Is that why you fought?
-Yes.
-Are you interested in Hedwig?
-It isn't illegal.
Hedwig is a special girl Thorén is a drunken player.
Except for the Professor, he wouldn't be allowed to remain here.
I don't know how well you know Professor ...
He favours Thorén.
There you are.
Thank you.
I'll be in touch when I need the next delivery.
We haven't introduced ourselves properly.
Johan Gustav Dåådh.
Hedwig Fälth.
Your uncle said you've taken over management of Henry's collection.
-Yes.
-Did you know him well?
Not so well.
He studied mostly, or worked on the collection.
We were fellow students.
Was he liked by the rest of you?
Uncle didn't hide, he considered Henry to be talented.
This isn't just a stronghold of knowledge, but also of envy.
You studied here yourself.
-Were you jealous of him?
-No, he was the best of us.
-A sad fate.
-What did he die of?
Burst appendix, according to Uncle.
He should know.
Do you recognize this?
No.
It's beautiful.
-Why do you ask?
-It isn't common to have women here.
I lost my parents when I was 13.
My uncle took care of me.
I've worked as a surgeon-apprentice for him ever since.
You must have many admirers.
The College doesn't like my presence, but uncle fought for me.
He doesn't distinguish between me and the others.
-Maybe he places greater demands on you.
-Maybe so.
I admired the collection before.
It amazes me it isn't infested with vermin.
Didn't Dåådh come with you?
Chief Constable.
It's me ...
Freund.
-I didn't realize the seriousness.
-And Dåådh?
He'll return as soon as he can.
Why wouldn't he come, when I asked him?
Complications occurred.
Freund, is he angry with me?
Why would he be, Mrs. Wåhlstedt?
He'll come.
He was summoned to Uppsala to act for the commissar.
He stays for a police reason?
It's so.
He didn't fully understand how serious the Chief Constable's condition was.
-You're staying.
-Yes.
How is your husband?
Did we agree you shouldn't stand up when we speak?
-You shouldn't stay in his study.
-Neighbourhood duties haven't stopped.
You may wait for further instructions.
-From who?
-My husband's superiors.
-And until then?
-You drink tea alone in our salon!
-Do you think it's fitting?
-I'm here during your husband's difficult time.
There's nothing more you can do this evening.
Go home.
Dåådh's needed here.
Persuade him.
I put all my trust in you.
Report all matters relating to the Chief Constable's health to me.
-No one but you can visit him.
-But Madame Wåhlstedt and children?
Let the immediate family in, but all other contacts come through me.
-Well.
-All right.
Johanna, pick up a bottle of wine, veal and butter.
-Roast veal?
I don't think ...
-Organize it.
I work around the clock, Chief Constable.
It is hard, very hard.
We are looking high and low for Dåådh, but he seems to be busy.
Or disappeared ...
we don't know.
Not even your wife managed to attract him.
Everyone seems to have abandoned you.
It's not really true, I stand by your side.
I've prepared a document-
And I humbly ask for a signature.
I think it's very important.
-Do you hear me Chief Constable?
-Yes ...
Can you move your hand?
A small signature only.
Thank you.
I wish you a speedy recovery.
-Frid?
-I must speak with you.
-Come in.
-No, the walls have ears here.
Wait.
What was it you wanted to say, Frid?
I saw Henry get increasingly worse.
He had enough to do with his job.
-His mission?
-The bird collection.
The collection is so unspoiled by vermin.
How is that?
The professor experimented with different preparations,
-To develop a revolutionary means.
I get water near here -
And I've seen the professor visit a crofter who deals in arsenic.
Arsenic?
Do his preparations contained arsenic?
Henry had all the familiar symptoms of arsenic poisoning ... chills, stomach pain.
The professor, then?
What would happen if a professor of medicine accidentally poisoned a student by exposing him to arsenic?
What was that?
-A bird.
-I heard voices.
We'll go back, you look tired.
Often I can't sleep because I hear voices.
I have bad dreams.
I'm happy you told me this.
I've tried to protect my collection from insects by all known means.
Tobacco, spices, sulphur, turpentine.
Nothing worked.
It took me three years to find a workable formula.
-Including arsenic?
-The visits of the crofter.
It's innocent.
-Who knew the recipe?
-No one.
-Not even Henry?
His duty was to prepare and catalogue.
I mixed the solution myself.
When he died, did you place further confidence in your niece.
Yes.
It is known exposure to arsenic is harmful.
Arsenic constitutes only a quarter of the compound that's brushed on.
Wouldn't it be a natural explanation for Henry's death?
The thought crossed my mind.
Maybe then I hope your ingenuity finds another cause.
Yes, yes ...
Sir Oliver's autopsy will clarify what is cause.
-When does he arrive?
-He's expected here in a few weeks.
-Do you recognize this?
-Hedwig.
Are you sure?
-Yes, she inherited it.
At one time it was my mother's.
-Where did you find it?
-Do you trust her?
-Sure.
-Fully?
Why wouldn't I do so?
Of course.
I'll give it back to her.
I'll be happy if I can do it.
-I want to talk to you.
-We have a lecture soon.
I found it under the bed in Henry's room.
Why did you lie?
I promised Uncle not to devote myself to love.
Not until I'd written my thesis.
-What did you say to Uncle?
-I found it in the hallway.
Thank you.
-Your feelings for Thorén, your affair ...
-Affair?
According to Dahlgren Thorén wrote in a letter.
Absolutely not.
Where did Dahlgren get that from?
Carl Peter never produced anything like that.
Who knew Henry worked with the professor's new preparation?
I heard you're a gambler, but not very successful.
The professor's prescription would bring great wealth if you discovered it.
-The recipe isn't written down.
-Perhaps Henry did.
It was just to get it.
All my debts are paid.
Really?
How so?
Have you inherited money?
I have a lecture now.
-How well did you know Henry?
-We used to drink together.
-You mimicked him.
-In a friendly way.
Your debts, who paid them?
Thorén!
I'll find out sooner or later.
Who was it?
-The Professor.
-Why?
I'd be grateful if you don't spread the discovery.
-You must come home now.
-I'm not ready.
Mrs. Wåhlstedt forbade me to return without you.
I beg you.
Why did you pay Thorén's gambling debts?
He's a brilliant talent
-Even if he doesn't always engaged in the books.
I'd pay more than that to get out of the clutches of his debtors.
Why do you ask?
Isn't that a large favour for an individual student?
Like letting Hedwig study here.
And try to ignore their radical views-
That you held during your time here.
Such a talent requires something out of the ordinary from me.
The mediocre come and go anyway.
Sorry.
Unfortunately I haven't been able to help you, and must leave the task unfinished.
I must return to Stockholm.
It may be as Leopold Frid says.
the professor's new preparations caused Henry's death.
The shot at me, then?
Who shot?
Someone will be happy to see you again ...
Mrs Wåhlstedt.
-What do you mean?
-Nothing.
-Has she said anything to you?
-About what?
-About Me?
-No.
-What would she say?
-I don't know.
She was angry, you didn't come when she asked.
-As if I were a dog.
-No.
She was unhappy and distressed with Mr. Wåhlstedt's illness.
-Have you started to drink water?
-Leopold Frid's well water.
Prima.
-It's the water.
-Excuse me?
-It's the water.
-A little water.
-Thank you.
-You have a long night ahead of you.
-Yes.
-Good night, Hedwig.
-Good night, Leopold.
-Can't you sleep?
-Do we have the right to leave everything?
I wish Erik were involved.
He'd be proud.
-Who goes there?
-Adel Krantz.
The carriage is on its way to Stockholm.
Where?
Thank you.
Wåhlstedt's carriage was sighted at the heights of Knivsta.
Did you drink the water?
You ...
You're back.
What's happened?
Frid, come to the professor's office.
There is an urgent autopsy.
-I had such a horrible dream.
-Come on.
Oh my god.
Henry, forgive me.
Where's Dåådh?
Henry Monroe would be appointed to take charge of Professor Medelheim's collection.
Otherwise it'd be entrusted to you, Frid.
You with all your knowledge of birds, animals and plants, no?
You get an idea you know the preparation, Henry works with- likely contains arsenic.
You acquire arsenic and blend it into your cold water
And try to get Henry's poisoning appear- as if caused by his work in the laboratory.
You also lead me to the tank.
you place all the blame on the professor.
Henry had arsenic poisoning symptoms.
Not least, the burning thirst that only water seems to slake.
You provided with him with arsenic poisoned water.
-You have no proof.
-You've already acknowledged.
That was no confession.
My concern for dead souls is familiar to everyone here.
Like my nightmares.
I haven't done anything!
When you realized I was here to investigate, you tried to kill me.
You wrote a fake letter to Dahlgren-
To focus responsibility for my assault in another direction.
-Which it did.
-This is just fantasy.
Really?
Dahlgren?
Your crossbow was hidden at the spring.
A weapon you normally use to shoot birds.
But now Henry Monroe is finally out of the way-
Hedvig gets the professor's trust.
It reinforces it for you ...
injustice rules the world.
Yes!
Justice isn't for me;
but for everyone else.
Women and foreigners get everything possible ...
You sad, miserable louse.
Freund?
Freund!
You must come and clear things up.
-Has something happened?
-It's Nordin, he's unruly.
I didn't know where to go.
-Is Freund with you?
-I thought he was with you.
The chief Constable is worse.
Only his wife and children have access to him.
Holmberg.
We haven't had the honour to meet before.
Johan Gustav Dåådh.
-You may contact Nordin directly.
-Nordin?
He is the acting chief Constable authorized by Wåhlstedt.
It's impossible.
Excuse me ...
You may speak with Nordin.
He's waiting for you.
Nordin.
Wåhlstedt's order, I want to see it.
The number who knew of his existence and had knowingly given battle to him was small indeed.
- Herman Melville's
Entrance to Dream Park
MOBY DICK
North Korea has agreed to allow an IAEA inspection on all seven of its declared nuclear facilities.
Wake up.
Hey, eat your lunch.
Your lunch!
Thanks.
What's up with them?
What happened to that report you promised?
'Redevelopment saves us!
'
Shut up and eat.
We have to start a war with them.
And blow up Pyeongyang to build new buildings.
A nuclear bomb?
We can make that.
Ignorance is your biggest charm, you know.
You can't make it without reprocessing facilities.
The smokestacks, you pathetic idiot.
Then make that first.
Don't call me an idiot!
The inspection would be successfully carried out.
Hey, this soup is really delicious.
BREAKING NEWS:
EXPLOSION AT THE BALAM BRIDGE
They hope it would deter Pyeongyang to?
Give me some money for the cab.
And now you're rubbing me?
I think I have a scoop.
Is there a new city about to redevelop?
That's what you say to get some money from me.
You twit.
Tell me.
See you tomorrow.
What the?
A small fry ran away with some internal data.
Where would he go?
A news company at best.
Who is it?
This morning, there was a mysterious explosion in the Balam Bridge on the outskirts of Seoul.
The police and troops set up an investigation headquarters.
This is crazy!
I'm on the site.
What's the problem if there is a survivor?
It'll be closed any minute.
Just work with the media.
We got the suspect, so why not announce it?
Being the Attorney General is not so easy.
You do what you're told to.
Wait.
We can't say anything about the case yet.
We're investigating so come later, people.
Hey!
Are you the head of the team?
Who the?
Two dead and one injured.
In a vegetative state, dammit!
The arms and legs were all...
- Identity?
- No known.
- The motive?
- Dunno.
The government says it's a spy from the North.
You shouldn't write that.
Okay!
A car bomb.
A spy from the North.
Don't write it!
Alright.
Here.
Hey, it'd be nicer if you'd put it in an envelope.
How long can you hold it?
Until the night at most.
Until then, nobody knows it but me.
Alright.
Don't tell anyone.
I know!
Thanks.
Hello.
Here.
YOON Hyeok?
Damn, it's been so long!
How have you been?
What?
You're in the army?
Becoming a real man.
So what is it that you want to tell me?
Come on.
Hey, coffee for me.
Just a moment.
Yeah, a North Korean spy.
Write it under that subject.
Tell boss I'll dig into the Balam case.
Thanks.
The guy who sat here, do you know where he is?
He left.
What the?
You look happy, you got a 'dokudie'?
Hey, that's Japanese.
'Scoop' is the word.
Hey!
Hello.
You two don't know each other?
He's a newcomer, SON Jin-gi.
- LEE Bang-u, right?
- That's right.
I'm SON Jin-gi.
Nice to meet you.
Glad to meet you.
Remember that election fraud?
He got the 'scoop prize' for it and got scouted by our boss.
Oh, impressive.
Thank you.
Scout?
It's not a baseball.
Hyo-guan!
Enjoying the chores?
Hey, these are the only copy.
Rule number one.
Make copies of all documents.
You have a long way to go, Gal.
You told boss, right?
Hey, boss!
Sorry.
I guess you heard from Hyo-guan.
A scoop in a long time.
It's the Balam explosion.
Cut the crap.
Already got the report hours ago.
Two dead, one injured.
It's early to suspect a North Korean spy.
Bullshit.
SON Jin-gi?
Focus on your case.
When will I get the list of female speculators?
Detective MA, you fucking bastard.
God, what's with the rain?
Bang-u.
For the mother of god!
What the?
You crazy little shit!
Sorry for what...
Shut up.
I'm freaking tired.
Go away?
I deserted.
You are hopeless.
Hey, deserter.
You're the man.
I want to desert from the company.
You'll go back tomorrow.
You hear me?
Yes.
Here's to you!
How did you get the scar on your thigh?
Huh, my thigh?
The scar?
It's a great story.
Where is it?
I was a star.
Look at this.
A citation.
An exclusive scar.
You know the JEONG corruption scandal?
There were 20 apple boxes.
So it was 4 billion, right?
What the?
You came to kill me.
What?
I don't know who the hell that is.
You said you'll come alone.
My leg!
Holy shit!
I'm so sorry.
I'm fine.
Don't come closer.
I'll forgive you if you answer my question.
Is JEONG behind it?
I'll tell you everything.
PARK!
Stop the rotary press!
PARK, you hear me?
Stop the rotary press!
Oh, god.
What's all this?
The Balam explosion.
Is it a symbolic action?
No civilian dead and there's no announcement.
The patient's not identified and doctors say nothing.
Just a second.
JEONG Seok-young.
KIM Sang-sik.
PARK Jeong-gil.
How's the patient?
Still in a coma.
The initial target of explosion is turned out to be the Dream Park.
- Hello, detective.
- Hey, what's up?
You get reports on deserters?
Sure.
Is YOON Hyeok on the list?
- YOON Hyeok?
- Yes.
YOON Hyeok?
- See his name?
- He's not on the list.
- He's not?
- No.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, are you on something finally?
What's all this?
Where are you going?
The NISI to find out about the bomb.
Oh, hey.
You majored in engineering.
Yeah, why?
Are you good with these?
It's locked, can't decode.
I'm off to NISI.
No, sit down.
- Bang-u, line no.3!
- Give it a try.
Hey!
Engineering majors should unlock a disk.
It takes ages.
Do it for me.
Thanks.
Line no. 3?
Hello?
Hey, where are you going?
Thanks for the money.
Hey!
It's LEE Bang-u.
It's me.
Who, Hyeok?
Where are you?
You got the bag?
Yeah, where are you?
Dongseong Cinema.
What?
Follow me.
I'll play with you.
Think again, ma'am.
Not an easy game.
You could lose big.
- MAENG.
- What's up?
- Info on the new town.
- Alright.
If you keep playing poker, I'll tell your wife about it.
Bye.
Don't tell her.
You're not on the list.
Who are you?
Where did that bag come from?
- The Army Security Command.
- What?
You are in the ASC?
You're fucked, man.
Take the bag tomorrow and you're going back.
They're gonna kill me.
Nonsense!
They are not gonna kill you.
You know the Balam incident.
Yeah.
What if it's fabricated?
You even know what it means?
Are you sure about that?
I'm not sure yet.
Ok, so the disks have the info on Balam.
Yes.
You stay here for a while.
If he gets in trouble, no info on new town.
Got it?
Yeah.
If there's any problem, page this number.
2848 meaning 'You're fucked'.
Alright, '2848'.
He got straight flush, ma'am.
- He's lying.
- I'll stop here.
- It's LEE Bang-u.
- It's me.
Who, Hyeok?
Where are you?
- You got the bag?
- Yeah, where are you?
- Dongseong Cinema.
- What?
So this informant of yours, can we trust him?
He's my hometown friend.
Don't worry about him.
- Can I come in?
- Yes, you got something?
I have to investigate further.
But the bridge was restricted.
If Dream Park was the target, why use...
What's this?
So I'll make up a team on the Balam case.
Make what?
I'm telling you.
This is a page-one scoop.
Then work with SON, here.
He's already on the case.
Good to work with you.
- Here.
- Thanks.
I can't believe it.
You have to agree on something.
What is it?
- Firstly!
- Yes.
My name comes before yours on the report.
No problem.
It's ok having your name only.
Secondly?
Yeah, secondly?
- You good with computer?
- No.
I knew it.
Is it required?
She's hot!
Hello, sir.
- Do we have a room?
- Sure.
A room?
Lucky bastard!
Here, multi-outlet strip.
Happy to work with you.
You said that before.
Take a look at this.
These are interesting.
This man went missing and found dead in the sea.
He went missing in Germany, allegedly killed by the KGB.
Cut the crap.
May I pass through?
Oh, I'm sorry.
My god.
THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT
Hey, we're supposed to have fun!
You came to the wrong room.
What're you looking at?
I'm sorry.
This is no place to work with those drunk twits.
The head editor of politics helped us borrow this room.
Computer is ready.
Alright.
Good.
Try every 4 digits.
That's only about 10,000.
What about the alphabets?
That's over 1,600,000.
Just try it.
We could get the password.
Maybe, after a year?
What other choice have we got?
What's in here, anyway?
Info on the Balam incident!
Maybe on other incidents too if we're lucky.
How about we focus on our case, Mr. KGB.
Please don't say that.
Go ahead.
Start with 0001.
Dongseong Cinema PR office.
Hello?
Who is it?
- You liked it?
- Yes, so delicious.
Let's go.
He had lunch and is headed to a bookstore.
It's freezing to death.
Let's go.
Oh, my god.
My apples!
- Please!
Let's go.
- But I just bought them.
Why did you put it there?
- I had to open the door.
- Give me a break.
Let's go.
What did you do in the ASC?
I typed the documents.
Not an easy job.
Did you make those documents?
No, I didn't
So you don't know the password.
I guess you've done some observation and phone-tapping.
Yes, for an inspection.
You mean civilian inspection?
Some of the targets are dead, now.
For what reason did you select the targets?
There's no specific rule.
There're so many targets.
How did you collect all those detailed information?
No specific method.
We just do everything we can.
Hey, we're supposed to have fun!
You came to the wrong room.
What're you looking at?
I'm sorry.
They are here.
The targets never know someone is following them.
- The reporters are all there?
- Yes, sir.
Wait until the backup comes.
Yes, sir.
We should wait for the backup.
You said the Balam bombing was fabricated.
I saw the names of suspects on documents a month ago.
But we don't even know who the suspects are.
I mean I can guess under the circumstances.
Have a drink.
- Here.
- Thanks.
You're not playing tricks on me, are you?
I'll bring the money.
Don't go anywhere.
Don't start without me.
I'll make it quick.
Are you familiar with these names?
JEONG Seok-young, KIM Sang-sik, PARK Jeong -gil.
Never heard of them.
What the?
Who the hell are they?
Then who's the suspect you saw on the document?
I can't remember.
It's been a long time.
Are you playing a joke on me?
You said it was only a month ago!
It doesn't make sense.
You aren't a deserter, are you?
Don't even think about lying to me.
What was the number?
1818?
He wrote it down on?
2848!
What the?
2848?
We're fucked!
What is this?
Hyeok, come here.
- Come here, you bastard!
- Run!
Stop!
Go up, hurry!
Upstairs!
Get in!
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know!
- Do something!
- Who are those people?
Block the window.
- Go!
- What?
You have to protect your informant, go!
Meet me at the bar.
Go, hurry!
Oh, my god.
No, you're gonna fall!
- Hyeok!
- No!
What am I gonna do?
You can open it?
Nice to meet you, guys.
I'm a reporter SON Jin-gi.
Hey, calm down.
Who are you?
- Shut up.
- Calm down.
Ok, I'll shut up.
I got it.
We were just scared.
Shut up.
Don't move.
Ok, I got it.
I just want to know Who you are.
I'm SON Jin-gi.
Are you a gang?
I'm a reporter!
MAENG, stop the car.
Get off, man!
Son of a...
You can threaten us but we won't stop.
There's a tunnel.
Get closer to the fence.
You shouldn't interfere with us.
What should we do?
Release the small fry.
I would rather not.
Closer to the fence!
Seoul 2, GA 4237.
Sit down.
Hey.
Why do you keep lying to me?
You believed me because I said I was from the ASC.
So you told that barefaced lie?
Ok, then.
Where did the documents come from?
That lighter I gave to you.
Those men, the disks all came from the same place.
Where is it?
I don't know for now.
It's been a game room, a bookstore, and a restaurant.
Are you kidding me?
Is this funny to you?
Do you think all reporters are fool?
I honestly don't know!
Yes, I did lie to you but this time, I'm honest.
If you don't trust me I have no one to turn to.
Who's PARK Jeong-gil?
Tell me!
He's on the document you had in your pocket.
.
Tell me who he is!
.
Why not say anything?
You're one of them, aren't you?
Alright.
Now, I don't trust you.
What's all this?
SON, what happened?
Where's all the documents?
What's up with your face?
Say something!
LEE!
What the hell happened?
This is a bug.
They tapped us.
Shit.
Let's just end it here.
We don't have the documents.
You do as you like.
We will carry on.
What are you saying?
Rule number one.
'Always make a copy'
I already made a copy.
Hey, you got me.
This is the plate number.
Are you in or out?
What?
Not identified?
Gosh, who the hell are these guys?
Alright, call me when the suspect wakes up.
Money?
What money?
Give back my 100,000 won!
Saejin Gas Station!
Give me a light.
I don't smoke.
Sorry.
Are you always so polite?
Not helpful when digging a scoop.
Being polite has nothing to do with getting a scoop.
An informant is my secret.
You have one?
Of course.
Impressive!
I only know his number, never met before.
Then what does he say about the Balam case?
He told me names.
What names?
I've said it before.
JEONG Seok-young.
KIM Sang-sik, and PARK Jeong-gil.
PARK Jeong-gil.
What's this?
It's an inspection report.
It's not a government document.
'On the government blacklist' Why?
They don't write 'government' on a government paper.
So?
I heard there's a power behind the government.
Cut the crap.
Please, give me a break!
SEO Eun-sook, fiance.
Here, have a drink.
I'm a friend of Jeong-gil and he is a detective.
I heard PARK went missing for some time now.
We've been investigating similar cases.
PARK recently met someone.
Do you know him?
YOON Hyeok.
Where did you get this?
I have an informant, too.
Let's exchange our information.
One call costs 10,000.
10,000 for a call?
Then it'd be so easy to get a scoop.
Why did you come to Seoul?
My kid is sick.
They have good doctors in Seoul.
Wanna see her picture?
My daughter, Hee-min.
She's really pretty, not like you.
She looks healthy.
It's cancer, children tumor.
Is that true?
I'm sorry to hear that.
She just has to deal with it.
SON!
Let's be a buddy.
Huh?
I mean we're the same age.
You look much older but...
Oh my, these Seoulites are so fast in everything.
I like that.
I like you, man.
They're here.
Let's change the lane.
Be careful.
Don't worry.
Don't forget the signal.
You're really good at this.
It's nothing.
So you do this often in Seoul?
It's the first time.
Lane change.
You saw the headlines?
Really effective.
'The Balam bomb terror.' Very good.
What's the point of the explosion, anyway?
Making the right mood.
We have a big one coming.
We need a small one before striking the big one.
One strike is not enough these days.
The Attorney General should do well.
I heard he's a bit slow.
This government officials are not so charming.
We have to rearrange the member of National Assembly.
Let's support the opposition party in the next election.
- I agree.
- You're right.
Have you read the document?
We have no objection as always.
Let's see what master says.
I guess we could make it public, right?
Who would care?
The country would be in chaos.
We should announce it.
The public need a shocking incident.
Have a drink.
Mr. JANG.
Are the reporters from my daily?
Mr, KIM...
See you later.
Stay here.
A bookstore, a game room.
And now it's a bar?
What do you mean?
Hyeok told me.
So that's where the reports came from.
Could be.
Let's wait and see.
It's a busy street.
Hey, what are you doing in the middle of the night?
Sit down!
I'm really glad you came.
The best photographer in our daily.
And this is SON.
Happy to work with you.
Work with me?
You have to sneak in.
You want a candid shot?
Follow me.
Let's go.
It's that bar, 'Moby Dick'.
Shooting criminals is not my thing.
I'm not going in.
This is a page-one scoop, right?
Right.
We want to go but they know our face.
I don't wanna go alone.
They have a unique dung smell.
It's fetid and little bit sour.
Sea otters know right away when human gets closer.
I gotta go to the toilet.
Yeah, go.
My story will help you do number two.
I hate waiting.
Let me ask you something.
You said about the secret power.
Why does it exist?
Because there are people who want to rule the world forever.
- Forever?
- Yes.
I said always close the door.
What's wrong with her?
Are you sure?
Yeah, those machines are in there for a reason.
Would it be difficult for LIM to sneak in and take a picture?
Hey, how about we use this?
You saying we record what they say?
No wonder you were scouted.
We'll do the same they did to us.
- Great, here.
- Yeah.
Take it.
God.
Didn't you hear me?
Lots of junkies here.
Yeah, I get a story and you get a promotion.
2am?
Alright.
See you later, bye.
Yes, sir.
I got it.
Hey, the boxes are here.
Can we have more beer?
Oh, I have one...
- He's here.
- Who?
The one who just got off.
LIM!
Frequent lecturing on current social issues.
Read slowly, you twit.
He gave lectures in churches to the poor and blind.
Excuse me.
The reporter from the bar!
You know me, right?
Let me go!
What the fuck!
Let me go!
Where's the toilet?
Just stay where you are.
Help me, please!
Get up!
Don't move!
- Are you ok?
- Hurry, it's down there.
Go down the hall!
Freeze!
What is it?
Wait a minute!
- You are suspended.
- Why?
I let you make a team, gave you a room and you harass innocent people?
- You're off the case.
- I'm sorry.
You shouldn't be.
They nearly killed him!
- You have evidence?
- Yes, we saw them.
The machines in there are only used in labs.
The suspect woke up.
And You, SEONG.
There was no room that you saw.
Go.
You were drunk.
- SON, Where are you going!
- It was part of investigation.
You need a search warrant and...
Be quiet!
Calm down.
Come later.
We're not open yet.
You come once every 4 years.
Are you the World Cup?
What's this?
You paying me back now?
I should've paid back earlier.
I'm sorry.
Gotta go.
Hey.
Have lunch here.
How many cups of soup did you eat?
No more soup for you.
Time to go, kids.
Such a nuisance.
Eating so much soup for free.
What happened to your eye?
None of your business.
I know you didn't come just to give me the money.
Yeah, that's right.
Can I crush in your place for a few days?
Cause you cleared your debt?
I have no friend to ask but you.
A friend?
I'm not your friend.
Stop!
We lost him.
Myeong-seob's injured.
Fucking bastard.
I called as soon as he got here.
Give me some soup.
My hand!
- Detective KIM?
- Yes?
What's this?
A bribe.
You're right.
This is wrong.
Go in.
He just woke up.
- Thank you.
- Go upstairs.
Hello.
I'm a reporter SON Jin-gi from Myoung-in Daily.
Detective!
The patient died!
Are you interrogating them?
Boss ordered me to release them.
What?
So you released them?
- What can I do?
- My god!
- Hello?
- Bang-u
- The suspect is dead.
- What?
I saw the killer.
I'm going to the police.
Who's behind all this?
Why are they killing people?
There's a conspiracy.
I can feel it.
What the hell!
You shouldn't bump car having a fender bender.
You suddenly stopped the car.
I didn't have time to slow down.
Hey, you didn't even try to slow down!
Why would I do such a thing?
Alright.
Wait here.
Huh?
No driver.
This is my number.
I'll call the insurance so call me later.
Would you pull out, please?
I have to go somewhere.
Are reporters rude like you?
Excuse me?
How would I know if you're just trying to run away?
Hey!
My god!
Who the hell is it?
Hello, Hello?
You must be Hee-min.
I'm your dad's friend.
Glad to meet you.
I'm more than glad to meet you.
You father went to Heaven, a much better place.
He's dead.
I saw him in the hospital.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, Jin-gi.
Suicide?
A patient who just woke up wouldn't commit a suicide.
We figure it as a murder case...
Mr. LEE
Just read this.
Don't take questions.
But people wouldn't believe it.
His suicide note.
I'm the Attorney General LEE Jae-poong.
The police found out that the Balam bombing was done by North Korean terrorists.
JEONG Seok-young, KIM Sang-sik had died.
The leader PARK Jeong-gil left a suicide note and killed himself.
Therefore, we couldn't find out...
We got PARK Jeong-gil.
I'm not saying I want a raise in salary.
When they caught a mouse, I sat there and...
You stink, man.
Change your coat, dickhead.
- What do you do with your wages?
- I invest in funds.
I send money to my parents.
Go home.
It was a car accident.
There's nothing you can do.
Yes, it was just an accident.
So you go home and rest.
Following around is not my job.
- LEE Bang-u!
- Just leave me alone!
I really don't want to think you're also one of them.
- Not once.
- You mean never?
I just did what I was told...
It's in the box.
Let's look for it.
It's dawn already.
Hurry up.
Let's start.
- Are you ready?
- Yes, start with HWANG.
Let's start.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Let's start.
Are you ready?
- Hello?
- Hyo-guan,
Get here right now.
- You should get some rest.
- Just get here, right now!
Hello?
Hyo-guan?
If it's not an emergency...
Here we go again.
Hyo-guan, don't hang up.
Listen to me, you bastards!
I don't know what you want but... you think you can rule the world?
I'll find out the truth and reveal it to the world!
You messed with the wrong guy.
You hear me?
Let's start.
Tap ta-da dap.
Are you ready?
Listen again.
- It's dawn already.
- Hurry up.
Let's start.
Tap ta-da dap.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Same letters in the middle.
That's right!
Can you do this?
There are 36 numbers and alphabets.
If you multiply it by 3...
About 40,000.
I can do it.
F, I, I, one to nine.
Then G...
- No?
- No.
- Now try GFF1.
- Thanks.
GJJ...
Hyeok, you haven't had your lunch, right?
No, I was about to go out.
Let's have lunch together.
I packed yours.
Happy birthday.
Why didn't you say anything?
Thank you.
I wouldn't call this a present but...
I want to hire you as a full-timer.
Pardon me?
You'd prefer a bigger store.
No, I'm not.
I like you, hyeok.
No match, next one.
Next one, please.
Bang-u!
What's the matter?
Found it.
You unlocked it?
JEONG SEOK-YOUNG
KIM SANG-SIK
PARK JEONG-GIL
PARK Jeong-gil?
Put them on.
The interrogation is over.
Be good, guys.
Go!
No!
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Get off!
Get off, now!
No!
Dream Park wasn't the target.
Then what's the purpose?
What's this?
This guy was found dead 3 years ago.
- This guy...
- Give me a break.
Where's SON's notes?
DIRECTOR
What if the director comes?
He never comes to work in the morning.
The most interesting thing about the Balam case was the Quick reaction of the police and the government.
This relates to what I've been investigating for a long time.
The secret power behind the government.
I do not know the identity and purpose of the group but whenever the government faced a politically sensitive issue, the public witnessed incidents that may affect the decision.
I hope the Balam incident uncover the veil of the secret power.
One call costs 10,000 won.
Excuse me, can I make a quick call on your phone?
4590812.
Hello?
I'm LEE Bang-u from Myeong-in Daily.
Please don't hang up.
I have an idea.
If what I've said is true, you don't do anything.
If I'm wrong, you hang up.
Is there a secret power behind the government?
Did they bomb the Balam Bridge?
Did they kill SON Jin-gi?
What's the next plan?
What's the purpose?
What the hell do they want?
Why are they killing people?
Listen, you bastards!
You think you can stop me by threatening?
Kill me just like you killed Jin-gi.
There're millions of reporters out there!
Kill me!
If I die, the world will...
Mr. LEE, you know the water vapor, right?
Water vapors make clouds and it makes the rain and snow.
What you know is only the rain and the snow.
The important thing is the water vapor.
You think you can show the water vapor to the world?
That freak!
Help me!
What do we do?
He'll go to YOON Hyeok.
He doesn't seem to know where YOON Hyeok is.
What happened to your face?
It hurts.
Here, this is the document on the Balam case.
This is the police report.
1047, 1047.
Same number.
The plate number of the car with the bomb.
I found another paper with the similar numbers.
But it has nothing on it.
803.
This is not a plate number.
11002011.
Nov. 20th 11 o'clock.
1047 is the plate number.
Then this is 08202911.
Nov. 29th 08:20
Fuck.
It's tomorrow.
Million people will die when a nuclear bomb explodes, right?
Yes, that's right.
The North is making a nuclear.
You think nuclear is a military weapon?
Nuclear is economy.
The winner takes it all.
It'd be better if I make it before them.
I want to ask one thing.
Why do you have to kill people?
Isn't that a terror?
You said killing one is a murder but killing hundred is politics.
Yes, if you kill hundred to save million, that's an art.
Will this bring me a nuclear?
Ok, be an artist.
I heard you lost all your disks.
What's this?
How did you know we lost the disks?
The board meeting.
Why?
I've never said it to anyone.
One of the board members is one of them.
Ok, you could be right about that.
But that doesn't mean I have to believe your story.
The bombing was a prelude and real terror happens tomorrow?
I know it's a bit hard to believe.
Don't run away with the idea and just write the facts.
You're a journalist.
Focus on the inspection reports.
PARK Jeong-gil was there.
How did they make a suspect even before the crime happened?
Find out that.
It might have the suspects of that terror tomorrow.
The inspection report.
PARK Jeong-gil was on that report.
So the next suspect is on it, too.
Let's check their schedule tomorrow.
Hello, is JOO Kyeong-seong there?
I wonder if he can come to the town meeting tomorrow.
KIM Dong-young?
This is the National Intelligence Service.
Don't play a joke!
Did he just hang up?
Hello, PARK In-jae?
This is alumni association.
We elect a manager for meeting.
Are you free tomorrow?
What are you up to tomorrow?
Jeju Island?
Hello, is HAN Min-ho there?
Can you come to the town meeting tomorrow?
Business trip.
Went abroad?
In the hospital?
Passed away?
I'm sorry.
I'M HEARING-IMPAIRED.
PLEASE CALL LEE BANG-U, 2634597.
Is it Myeongin Ilbo?
I'd like to speak to LEE Bang-u.
He's not here.
Please leave him a message.
Master approved.
Continue the process.

It's from work.
What is it?
A woman called?
The 5th feature?
What are you talking about?
I'm busy.
Gotta go.
The 5th feature?
The 5th feature.
Six o'clock?
Here!
Fire!
Fire!
Go to the front!
Out there!
Hey, Hyeok!
Hyeok!
There's a fire in Dongseong Cinema, hurry!
Dongseong Cinema.
Who are you?
He's not a spy.
PARK Jeong-gil's not a spy.
I killed him.
I'm so sorry.
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
He wanted to give this to you.
Hyeok!
SEO Eun-sook...
Let's go.
We found LEE Bang-u!
Let me go!
See the cameras?
You bastards will be on page one.
Hyeok!
Here, get in!
Let me go!
Pull out.
See the cameras?
Let's go.
Hey, stop!
Let's go!
I have to hide for the rest of my life, right?
Getting caught, I'll be killed like PARK Jeong-gil.
No, you should not hide.
You have to confess to people what you have done.
Then people would forgive and help you.
Thank you.
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't you.
Shut up.
Like you, I'll fight to the end.
How have you been?
- What happened to your face?
- This is what I do.
I told you.
He's your kind.
A jackass?
Nice to meet you.
- Do you go to church?
- No, I don't.
The priest was once my informant.
I think he will do well.
He needs courage.
08202911803.
God, what does it mean?
Some of those people were going to Jeju Island.
Yeah, I noticed.
Interesting, it's not even the high season yet.
I went there this summer.
It was chaos.
I got stuck in the airport because of the hurricane.
Boss nagged me for not coming back.
But the flight won't...
What the heck?
The fight number!
Flight number is 803 and departure time is 8:20.
Let's inform the police.
What are you doing?
It's no use.
You know there's nothing they can do.
Then what?
Just sit here?
Hundreds of people will die.
Don't you know?
We are journalists.
I can't believe there's nothing we can do.
No, there's one thing we can do.
BY THE LATE SON JIN-GI LEE BANG

I didn't put your name.
You two did all the work.
I'm cool with it.
That's not what I mean.
You shouldn't get fired.
Oh, and there's rule number two.
Have a great partner like you.
Good job.
There's no forecast in a newspaper other than the weather.
Put a false report for a terror that's not even certain?
Then the truth never unveils.
Saving people is more important.
Now, the false report is the truth.
No, I can't approve a false report.
I didn't come here for your approval.
I wanted to show you a real scoop.
A scoop for who?
A reporter only observes.
He doesn't solve the case.
When personal opinion comes first, you're not a reporter anymore.
Save the life of an ordinary man, rather than end the life of ten liars.
Boss told me when I was a cub reporter.
Honestly, I don't know who's behind the terror.
But I really want to save that ordinary man.
PARK!
Stop the rotary press!
FLIGHT NO. 803 HEADING TO JEJU ON 08:20 IS TO EXPLODE
Who approved this report!
Are you out of your mind?
Get out!
I don't want to see you!
You're such a pain.
Hopeless woman!
It's not true.
I'm really sorry.
LETTER OF RESIGNATION
We don't know anything about it.
The Truth about the Balam Explosion
My name is YOON Hyeok.
As I said, the article is not true.
The engineers are checking the plane.
So please wait for just a few minute.
I worked at PARK's store for 3 months.
And watched his every action.
He had a fiance he really loved.
He was an ordinary man just like you.
All this area is now a special region.
There are innocent victims who lost their lives...
Huh, that guy...
I beg for their forgiveness.
I know that guy.
Never thought he'd be on TV.
Excuse me, sir.
Am I the only passenger?
Yes, sir.
Others canceled because of the false report.
Oh, really?
It's good they believed it.
Sorry?
Nothing.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have landed in Jeju Airport.
Please remain seated until we park at the gate.
The weather is cloudy with a little chance of rain.
The temperature is 11 degree celsius and the humidity is 70%.
Thank you for choosing us and have a nice day.
Hello?
The number who knew of his existence and had knowingly given battle to him was small indeed.

Entrance to Dream Park
MOBY dick
North Korea has agreed to allow an lAEA inspection on all seven of its declared nuclear facilities.
Wake up.
Hey, eat your lunch.
Your lunch!
Thanks.
What's up with them?
What happened to that report you promised?
'Redevelopment saves us!
'
Shut up and eat.
We have to start a war with them.
And plow up Pyeongyang to build new buildings.
A nuclear bomb?
We can make that.
Ignorance is your biggest charm, you know.
You can't make it without reprocessing facilities.
The smokestacks, you pathetic idiot.
Then make that first.
Don't call me an idiot!
The inspection would be successfully carried out.
Hey, this soup is really delicious.
BREAKING NEWS:
explosion AT THE BALAM bridge
They hope it would deter Pyeongyang to?
Give me some money for the cab.
And now you're rubbing me?
I think I have a scoop.
Is there a new city about to redevelop?
That's what you say to get some money from me.
You twit.
Tell me.
See you tomorrow.
What the?
A small fry ran away with some internal data.
Where would he go?
A news company at best.
Who is it?
This morning, there was a mysterious explosion in the Balam Bridge on the outskirts of Seoul.
The police and troops set up an investigation headquarters.
This is crazy!
I'm on the site.
What's the problem if there is a survivor?
It'll be closed any minute.
Just work with the media.
We got the suspect, so why not announce it?
Being the Attorney General is not so easy.
You do what you're told to.
wait.
We can't say anything about the case yet.
We're investigating so come later, people.
Hey!
Are you the head of the team?
Who the?
Two dead and one injured.
In a vegetative state, dammit!
The arms and legs were all...
- ldentity?
- No known.
- The motive?
- Dunno.
The government says it's a spy from the North.
You shouldn't write that.
Okay!
A car bomb.
A spy from the North.
Don't write it!
Alright.
Here.
Hey, it'd be nicer if you'd put it in an envelope.
How long can you hold it?
Until the night at most.
Until then, nobody knows it but me.
Alright.
Don't tell anyone.
I know!
Thanks.
Hello.
Here.
YOON Hyeok?
Damn, it's been so long!
How have you been?
What?
You're in the army?
Becoming a real man.
So what is it that you want to tell me?
Come on.
Hey, coffee for me.
Just a moment.
Yeah, a North Korean spy.
Write it under that subject.
Tell boss I'll dig into the Balam case.
Thanks.
The guy who sat here, do you know where he is?
He left.
What the?
You look happy, you got a 'dokudie'?
Hey, that's Japanese.
'Scoop' is the word.
Hey!
Hello.
You two don't know each other?
He's a newcomer, SON Jin-gi.
- LEE Bang-u, right?
- That's right.
I'm SON Jin-gi.
Nice to meet you.
Glad to meet you.
Remember that election fraud?
He got the 'scoop prize' for it and got scouted by our boss.
Oh, impressive.
Thank you.
Scout?
It's not a baseball.
Hyo-guan!
Enjoying the chores?
Hey, these are the only copy.
Rule number one.
Make copies of all documents.
You have a long way to go, Gal.
You told boss, right?
Hey, boss!
Sorry.
I guess you heard from Hyo-guan.
A scoop in a long time.
It's the Balam explosion.
Cut the crap.
Already got the report hours ago.
Two dead, one injured.
It's early to suspect a North Korean spy.
Bullshit.
SON Jin-gi?
Focus on your case.
When will I get the list of female speculators?
Detective MA, you fucking bastard.
God, what's with the rain?
Bang-u.
For the mother of god!
What the?
You crazy little shit!
Sorry for what...
Shut up.
I'm freaking tired.
Go away?
I deserted.
You are hopeless.
Hey, deserter.
You're the man.
I want to desert from the company.
You'll go back tomorrow.
You hear me?
Yes.
Here's to you!
How did you get the scar on your thigh?
Huh, my thigh?
The scar?
It's a great story.
Where is it?
I was a star.
Look at this.
A citation.
An exclusive scar.
You know the JEONG corruption scandal?
There were 20 apple boxes.
So it was 4 billion, right?
What the?
You came to kill me.
What?
I don't know who the hell that is.
You said you'll come alone.
My leg!
Holy shit!
I'm so sorry.
I'm fine.
Don't come closer.
I'll forgive you if you answer my question.
Is JEONG behind it?
I'll tell you everything.
PARK!
Stop the rotary press!
PARK, you hear me?
Stop the rotary press!
Oh, god.
What's all this?
The Balam explosion.
Is it a symbolic action?
No civilian dead and there's no announcement.
The patient's not identified and doctors say nothing.
Just a second.
JEONG Seok-young.
kim Sang-sik.
PARK Jeong-gil.
How's the patient?
Still in a coma.
The initial target of explosion is turned out to be the Dream Park.
- Hello, detective.
- Hey, what's up?
You get reports on deserters?
Sure.
Is YOON Hyeok on the list?
- YOON Hyeok?
- Yes.
YOON Hyeok?
- See his name?
- He's not on the list.
- He's not?
- No.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, are you on something finally?
What's all this?
Where are you going?
The NlSl to find out about the bomb.
Oh, hey.
You majored in engineering.
Yeah, why?
Are you good with these?
It's locked, can't decode.
I'm off to NlSl.
No, sit down.
- Bang-u, line no.3!
- Give it a try.
Hey!
Engineering majors should unlock a disk.
It takes ages.
Do it for me.
Thanks.
Line no. 3?
Hello?
Hey, where are you going?
Thanks for the money.
Hey!
It's LEE Bang-u.
It's me.
Who, Hyeok?
Where are you?
You got the bag?
Yeah, where are you?
Dongseong Cinema.
What?
Follow me.
I'll play with you.
Think again, ma'am.
Not an easy game.
You could lose big.
- MAENG.
- What's up?
- Info on the new town.
- Alright.
If you keep playing poker, I'll tell your wife about it.
Bye.
Don't tell her.
You're not on the list.
Who are you?
Where did that bag come from?
- The Army Security Command.
- What?
You are in the ASC?
You're fucked, man.
Take the bag tomorrow and you're going back.
They're gonna kill me.
Nonsense!
They are not gonna kill you.
You know the Balam incident.
Yeah.
What if it's fabricated?
You even know what it means?
Are you sure about that?
I'm not sure yet.
Ok, so the disks have the info on Balam.
Yes.
You stay here for a while.
If he gets in trouble, no info on new town.
Got it?
Yeah.
If there's any problem, page this number.
2848 meaning 'You're fucked'.
Alright, '2848'.
He got straight flush, ma'am.
- He's lying.
- I'll stop here.
- It's LEE Bang-u.
- It's me.
Who, Hyeok?
Where are you?
- You got the bag?
- Yeah, where are you?
- Dongseong Cinema.
- What?
So this informant of yours, can we trust him?
He's my hometown friend.
Don't worry about him.
- Can I come in?
- Yes, you got something?
I have to investigate further.
But the bridge was restricted.
If Dream Park was the target, why use...
What's this?
So I'll make up a team on the Balam case.
Make what?
I'm telling you.
This is a page-one scoop.
Then work with SON, here.
He's already on the case.
Good to work with you.
- Here.
- Thanks.
I can't believe it.
You have to agree on something.
What is it?
- Firstly!
- Yes.
My name comes before yours on the report.
No problem.
It's ok having your name only.
Secondly?
Yeah, secondly?
- You good with computer?
- No.
I knew it.
Is it required?
She's hot!
Hello, sir.
- Do we have a room?
- Sure.
A room?
Lucky bastard!
Here, multi-outlet strip.
Happy to work with you.
You said that before.
Take a look at this.
These are interesting.
This man went missing and found dead in the sea.
He went missing in Germany, allegedly killed by the KGB.
Cut the crap.
May I pass through?
Oh, I'm sorry.
My god.
THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT
Hey, we're supposed to have fun!
You came to the wrong room.
What're you looking at?
I'm sorry.
This is no place to work with those drunk twits.
The head editor of politics helped us borrow this room.
Computer is ready.
Alright.
Good.
Try every 4 digits.
That's only about 10,000.
What about the alphabets?
That's over 1,600,000.
Just try it.
We could get the password.
Maybe, after a year?
What other choice have we got?
What's in here, anyway?
Info on the Balam incident!
Maybe on other incidents too if we're lucky.
How about we focus on our case, Mr. KGB.
Please don't say that.
Go ahead.
Start with 0001.
Dongseong Cinema PR office.
Hello?
Who is it?
- You liked it?
- Yes, so delicious.
Let's go.
He had lunch and is headed to a bookstore.
It's freezing to death.
Let's go.
Oh, my god.
My apples!
- Please!
Let's go.
- But I just bought them.
Why did you put it there?
- I had to open the door.
- Give me a break.
Let's go.
What did you do in the ASC?
I typed the documents.
Not an easy job.
Did you make those documents?
No, I didn't
So you don't know the password.
I guess you've done some observation and phone-tapping.
Yes, for an inspection.
You mean civilian inspection?
Some of the targets are dead, now.
For what reason did you select the targets?
There's no specific rule.
There're so many targets.
How did you collect all those detailed information?
No specific method.
We just do everything we can.
Hey, we're supposed to have fun!
You came to the wrong room.
What're you looking at?
I'm sorry.
They are here.
The targets never know someone is following them.
- The reporters are all there?
- Yes, sir.
Wait until the backup comes.
Yes, sir.
We should wait for the backup.
You said the Balam bombing was fabricated.
I saw the names of suspects on documents a month ago.
But we don't even know who the suspects are.
I mean I can guess under the circumstances.
Have a drink.
- Here.
- Thanks.
You're not playing tricks on me, are you?
I'll bring the money.
Don't go anywhere.
Don't start without me.
I'll make it quick.
Are you familiar with these names?
JEONG Seok-young, kim Sang-sik, PARK Jeong -gil.
Never heard of them.
What the?
Who the hell are they?
Then who's the suspect you saw on the document?
I can't remember.
It's been a long time.
Are you playing a joke on me?
You said it was only a month ago!
It doesn't make sense.
You aren't a deserter, are you?
Don't even think about lying to me.
What was the number?
1818?
He wrote it down on?
2848!
What the?
2848?
We're fucked!
What is this?
Hyeok, come here.
- Come here, you bastard!
- Run!
Stop!
Go up, hurry!
Upstairs!
Get in!
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know!
- Do something!
- Who are those people?
Block the window.
- Go!
- What?
You have to protect your informant, go!
Meet me at the bar.
Go, hurry!
Oh, my god.
No, you're gonna fall!
- Hyeok!
- No!
What am I gonna do?
You can open it?
Nice to meet you, guys.
I'm a reporter SON Jin-gi.
Hey, calm down.
Who are you?
- Shut up.
- Calm down.
Ok, I'll shut up.
I got it.
We were just scared.
Shut up.
Don't move.
Ok, I got it.
I just want to know Who you are.
I'm SON Jin-gi.
Are you a gang?
I'm a reporter!
MAENG, stop the car.
Get off, man!
Son of a...
You can threaten us but we won't stop.
There's a tunnel.
Get closer to the fence.
You shouldn't interfere with us.
What should we do?
Release the small fry.
I would rather not.
Closer to the fence!
Seoul 2, GA 4237.
Sit down.
Hey.
Why do you keep lying to me?
You believed me because I said I was from the ASC.
So you told that barefaced lie?
Ok, then.
Where did the documents come from?
That lighter I gave to you.
Those men, the disks all came from the same place.
Where is it?
I don't know for now.
It's been a game room, a bookstore, and a restaurant.
Are you kidding me?
Is this funny to you?
Do you think all reporters are fool?
I honestly don't know!
Yes, I did lie to you but this time, I'm honest.
If you don't trust me I have no one to turn to.
Who's PARK Jeong-gil?
Tell me!
He's on the document you had in your pocket.
.
Tell me who he is!
.
Why not say anything?
You're one of them, aren't you?
Alright.
Now, I don't trust you.
What's all this?
SON, what happened?
Where's all the documents?
What's up with your face?
Say something!
LEE!
What the hell happened?
This is a bug.
They tapped us.
Shit.
Let's just end it here.
We don't have the documents.
You do as you like.
We will carry on.
What are you saying?
Rule number one.
'Always make a copy'
I already made a copy.
Hey, you got me.
This is the plate number.
Are you in or out?
What?
Not identified?
Gosh, who the hell are these guys?
Alright, call me when the suspect wakes up.
Money?
What money?
Give back my 100,000 won!
Saejin Gas Station!
Give me a light.
I don't smoke.
Sorry.
Are you always so polite?
Not helpful when digging a scoop.
Being polite has nothing to do with getting a scoop.
An informant is my secret.
You have one?
Of course.
Impressive!
I only know his number, never met before.
Then what does he say about the Balam case?
He told me names.
What names?
I've said it before.
JEONG Seok-young.
kim Sang-sik, and PARK Jeong-gil.
PARK Jeong-gil.
What's this?
It's an inspection report.
It's not a government document.
'On the government blacklist' Why?
They don't write 'government' on a government paper.
So?
I heard there's a power behind the government.
Cut the crap.
Please, give me a break!
SEO Eun-sook, fiance.
Here, have a drink.
I'm a friend of Jeong-gil and he is a detective.
I heard PARK went missing for some time now.
We've been investigating similar cases.
PARK recently met someone.
Do you know him?
YOON Hyeok.
Where did you get this?
I have an informant, too.
Let's exchange our information.
One call costs 10,000.
10,000 for a call?
Then it'd be so easy to get a scoop.
Why did you come to Seoul?
My kid is sick.
They have good doctors in Seoul.
Wanna see her picture?
My daughter, Hee-min.
She's really pretty, not like you.
She looks healthy.
It's cancer, children tumor.
Is that true?
I'm sorry to hear that.
She just has to deal with it.
SON!
Let's be a buddy.
Huh?
I mean we're the same age.
You look much older but...
Oh my, these Seoulites are so fast in everything.
I like that.
I like you, man.
They're here.
Let's change the lane.
Be careful.
Don't worry.
Don't forget the signal.
You're really good at this.
It's nothing.
So you do this often in Seoul?
It's the first time.
Lane change.
You saw the headlines?
Really effective.
'The Balam bomb terror.' Very good.
What's the point of the explosion, anyway?
Making the right mood.
We have a big one coming.
We need a small one before striking the big one.
One strike is not enough these days.
The Attorney General should do well.
I heard he's a bit slow.
This government officials are not so charming.
We have to rearrange the member of National Assembly.
Let's support the opposition party in the next election.
- I agree.
- You're right.
Have you read the document?
We have no objection as always.
Let's see what master says.
I guess we could make it public, right?
Who would care?
The country would be in chaos.
We should announce it.
The public need a shocking incident.
Have a drink.
Mr. JANG.
Are the reporters from my daily?
Mr, kim...
See you later.
Stay here.
A bookstore, a game room.
And now it's a bar?
What do you mean?
Hyeok told me.
So that's where the reports came from.
Could be.
Let's wait and see.
It's a busy street.
Hey, what are you doing in the middle of the night?
Sit down!
I'm really glad you came.
The best photographer in our daily.
And this is SON.
Happy to work with you.
Work with me?
You have to sneak in.
You want a candid shot?
Follow me.
Let's go.
It's that bar, 'Moby Dick'.
Shooting criminals is not my thing.
I'm not going in.
This is a page-one scoop, right?
Right.
We want to go but they know our face.
I don't wanna go alone.
They have a unique dung smell.
It's fetid and little bit sour.
Sea otters know right away when human gets closer.
I gotta go to the toilet.
Yeah, go.
My story will help you do number two.
I hate waiting.
Let me ask you something.
You said about the secret power.
Why does it exist?
Because there are people who want to rule the world forever.
- Forever?
- Yes.
I said always close the door.
What's wrong with her?
Are you sure?
Yeah, those machines are in there for a reason.
Would it be difficult for lim to sneak in and take a picture?
Hey, how about we use this?
You saying we record what they say?
No wonder you were scouted.
We'll do the same they did to us.
- Great, here.
- Yeah.
Take it.
God.
Didn't you hear me?
Lots of junkies here.
Yeah, I get a story and you get a promotion.
2a.m?
Alright.
See you later, bye.
Yes, sir.
I got it.
Hey, the boxes are here.
Can we have more beer?
Oh, I have one...
- He's here.
- Who?
The one who just got off.
lim!
Frequent lecturing on current social issues.
Read slowly, you twit.
He gave lectures in churches to the poor and blind.
Excuse me.
The reporter from the bar!
You know me, right?
Let me go!
What the fuck!
Let me go!
Where's the toilet?
Just stay where you are.
Help me, please!
Get up!
Don't move!
- Are you ok?
- Hurry, it's down there.
Go down the hall!
Freeze!
What is it?
Wait a minute!
- You are suspended.
- Why?
I let you make a team, gave you a room and you harass innocent people?
- You're off the case.
- I'm sorry.
You shouldn't be.
They nearly killed him!
- You have evidence?
- Yes, we saw them.
The machines in there are only used in labs.
The suspect woke up.
And You, SEONG.
There was no room that you saw.
Go.
You were drunk.
- SON, Where are you going!
- It was part of investigation.
You need a search warrant and...
Be quiet!
Calm down.
Come later.
We're not open yet.
You come once every 4 years.
Are you the World Cup?
What's this?
You paying me back now?
I should've paid back earlier.
I'm sorry.
Gotta go.
Hey.
Have lunch here.
How many cups of soup did you eat?
No more soup for you.
Time to go, kids.
Such a nuisance.
Eating so much soup for free.
What happened to your eye?
None of your business.
I know you didn't come just to give me the money.
Yeah, that's right.
Can I crush in your place for a few days?
Cause you cleared your debt?
I have no friend to ask but you.
A friend?
I'm not your friend.
Stop!
We lost him.
Myeong-seob's injured.
Fucking bastard.
I called as soon as he got here.
Give me some soup.
My hand!
- Detective kim?
- Yes?
What's this?
A bribe.
You're right.
This is wrong.
Go in.
He just woke up.
- Thank you.
- Go upstairs.
Hello.
I'm a reporter SON Jin-gi from Myoung-in Daily.
Detective!
The patient died!
Are you interrogating them?
Boss ordered me to release them.
What?
So you released them?
- What can I do?
- My god!
- Hello?
- Bang-u
- The suspect is dead.
- What?
I saw the killer.
I'm going to the police.
Who's behind all this?
Why are they killing people?
There's a conspiracy.
I can feel it.
What the hell!
You shouldn't bump car having a fender bender.
You suddenly stopped the car.
I didn't have time to slow down.
Hey, you didn't even try to slow down!
Why would I do such a thing?
Alright.
Wait here.
Huh?
No driver.
This is my number.
I'll call the insurance so call me later.
Would you pull out, please?
I have to go somewhere.
Are reporters rude like you?
Excuse me?
How would I know if you're just trying to run away?
Hey!
My god!
Who the hell is it?
Hello, Hello?
You must be Hee-min.
I'm your dad's friend.
Glad to meet you.
I'm more than glad to meet you.
You father went to Heaven, a much better place.
He's dead.
I saw him in the hospital.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, Jin-gi.
Suicide?
A patient who just woke up wouldn't commit a suicide.
We figure it as a murder case...
Mr. LEE
Just read this.
Don't take questions.
But people wouldn't believe it.
His suicide note.
I'm the Attorney General LEE Jae-poong.
The police found out that the Balam bombing was done by North Korean terrorists.
JEONG Seok-young, KIM Sang-sik had died.
The leader PARK Jeong-gil left a suicide note and killed himself.
Therefore, we couldn 't find out...
We got PARK Jeong-gil.
I'm not saying I want a raise in salary.
When they caught a mouse, I sat there and...
You stink, man.
Change your coat, dickhead.
- What do you do with your wages?
- I invest in funds.
I send money to my parents.
Go home.
It was a car accident.
There's nothing you can do.
Yes, it was just an accident.
So you go home and rest.
Following around is not myjob.
- LEE Bang-u!
- Just leave me alone!
I really don't want to think you're also one of them.
- Not once.
- You mean never?
I just did what I was told...
It's in the box.
Let's look for it.
It's dawn already.
Hurry up.
Let's start.
- Are you ready?
- Yes, start with HWANG.
Let's start.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Let's start.
Are you ready?
- Hello?
- Hyo-guan,
Get here right now.
- You should get some rest.
- Just get here, right now!
Hello?
Hyo-guan?
If it's not an emergency...
Here we go again.
Hyo-guan, don't hang up.
Listen to me, you bastards!
I don't know what you want but... you think you can rule the world?
I'll find out the truth and reveal it to the world!
You messed with the wrong guy.
You hear me?
Let's start.
Tap ta-da dap.
Are you ready?
Listen again.
- It's dawn already.
- Hurry up.
Let's start.
Tap ta-da dap.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Same letters in the middle.
That's right!
Can you do this?
There are 36 numbers and alphabets.
If you multiply it by 3...
About 40,000.
I can do it.
F, I, I, one to nine.
Then G...
- No?
- No.
- Now try GFF1.
- Thanks.
GJJ...
Hyeok, you haven't had your lunch, right?
No, I was about to go out.
Let's have lunch together.
I packed yours.
Happy birthday.
Why didn't you say anything?
Thank you.
I wouldn't call this a present but...
I want to hire you as a full-timer.
Pardon me?
You'd prefer a bigger store.
No, I'm not.
I like you, hyeok.
No match, next one.
Next one, please.
Bang-u!
What's the matter?
Found it.
You unlocked it?
JEONG SEOK-YOUNG
KIM SANG-SlK
PARK JEONG-GlL
PARK Jeong-gil?
Put them on.
The interrogation is over.
Be good, guys.
Go!
No!
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Get off!
Get off, now!
No!
Dream Park wasn't the target.
Then what's the purpose?
What's this?
This guy was found dead 3 years ago.
- This guy...
- Give me a break.
Where's SON's notes?
director
What if the director comes?
He never comes to work in the morning.
The most interesting thing about the Balam case was the quick reaction of the police and the government.
This relates to what I've been investigating for a long time.
The secret power behind the government.
I do not know the identity and purpose of the group but whenever the government faced a politically sensitive issue, the public witnessed incidents that may affect the decision.
I hope the Balam incident uncover the veil of the secret power.
One call costs 10,000 won.
Excuse me, can I make a quick call on your phone?
459 0812.
Hello?
I'm LEE Bang-u from Myeong-in Daily.
Please don't hang up.
I have an idea.
If what I've said is true, you don't do anything.
If I'm wrong, you hang up.
Is there a secret power behind the government?
Did they bomb the Balam Bridge?
Did they kill SON Jin-gi?
What's the next plan?
What's the purpose?
What the hell do they want?
Why are they killing people?
Listen, you bastards!
You think you can stop me by threatening?
Kill me just like you killed Jin-gi.
There're millions of reporters out there!
Kill me!
If I die, the world will...
Mr. LEE, you know the water vapor, right?
Water vapors make clouds and it makes the rain and snow.
What you know is only the rain and the snow.
The important thing is the water vapor.
You think you can show the water vapor to the world?
That freak!
Help me!
What do we do?
He'll go to YOON Hyeok.
He doesn't seem to know where YOON Hyeok is.
What happened to your face?
It hurts.
Here, this is the document on the Balam case.
This is the police report.
1047, 1047.
Same number.
The plate number of the car with the bomb.
I found another paper with the similar numbers.
But it has nothing on it.
803.
This is not a plate number.
11002011.
Nov. 20th 11 o'clock.
1047 is the plate number.
Then this is 08202911.
Nov. 29th 08:20
Fuck.
It's tomorrow.
Million people will die when a nuclear bomb explodes, right?
Yes, that's right.
The North is making a nuclear.
You think nuclear is a military weapon?
Nuclear is economy.
The winner takes it all.
It'd be better if I make it before them.
I want to ask one thing.
Why do you have to kill people?
Isn't that a terror?
You said killing one is a murder but killing hundred is politics.
Yes, if you kill hundred to save million, that's an art.
Will this bring me a nuclear?
Ok, be an artist.
I heard you lost all your disks.
What's this?
How did you know we lost the disks?
The board meeting.
Why?
I've never said it to anyone.
One of the board members is one of them.
Ok, you could be right about that.
But that doesn't mean I have to believe your story.
The bombing was a prelude and real terror happens tomorrow?
I know it's a bit hard to believe.
Don't run away with the idea and just write the facts.
You're a journalist.
Focus on the inspection reports.
PARK Jeong-gil was there.
How did they make a suspect even before the crime happened?
Find out that.
It might have the suspects of that terror tomorrow.
The inspection report.
PARK Jeong-gil was on that report.
So the next suspect is on it, too.
Let's check their schedule tomorrow.
Hello, is JOO Kyeong-seong there?
I wonder if he can come to the town meeting tomorrow.
kim Dong-young?
This is the National Intelligence Service.
Don't play a joke!
Did he just hang up?
Hello, PARK In-jae?
This is alumni association.
We elect a manager for meeting.
Are you free tomorrow?
What are you up to tomorrow?
Jeju Island?
Hello, is HAN Min-ho there?
Can you come to the town meeting tomorrow?
Business trip.
Went abroad?
In the hospital?
Passed away?
I'm sorry.
I'M HEARlNG-lMPAlRED.
PLEASE CALL LEE BANG-U, 263 4597.
Is it Myeongin Ilbo?
I'd like to speak to LEE Bang-u.
He's not here.
Please leave him a message.
Master approved.
Continue the process.
THE 5th FEATURE
DONGSEOUNG cinema
It's from work.
What is it?
A woman called?
The 5th feature?
What are you talking about?
I'm busy.
Gotta go.
The 5th feature?
The 5th feature.
Six o'clock?
Here!
Fire!
Fire!
Go to the front!
Out there!
Hey, Hyeok!
Hyeok!
There's a fire in Dongseong Cinema, hurry!
Dongseong Cinema.
Who are you?
He's not a spy.
PARK Jeong-gil's not a spy.
I killed him.
I'm so sorry.
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?
He wanted to give this to you.
Hyeok!
SEO Eun-sook...
Let's go.
We found LEE Bang-u!
Let me go!
See the cameras?
You bastards will be on page one.
Hyeok!
Here, get in!
Let me go!
Pull out.
See the cameras?
Let's go.
Hey, stop!
Let's go!
I have to hide for the rest of my life, right?
Getting caught, I'll be killed like PARK Jeong-gil.
No, you should not hide.
You have to confess to people what you have done.
Then people would forgive and help you.
Thank you.
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't you.
Shut up.
Like you, I'll fight to the end.
How have you been?
- What happened to your face?
- This is what I do.
I told you.
He's your kind.
A jackass?
Nice to meet you.
- Do you go to church?
- No, I don't.
The priest was once my informant.
I think he will do well.
He needs courage.
08202911803.
God, what does it mean?
Some of those people were going to Jeju Island.
Yeah, I noticed.
Interesting, it's not even the high season yet.
I went there this summer.
It was chaos.
I got stuck in the airport because of the hurricane.
Boss nagged me for not coming back.
But the flight won't...
What the heck?
The fight number!
Flight number is 803 and departure time is 8:20.
Let's inform the police.
What are you doing?
It's no use.
You know there's nothing they can do.
Then what?
Just sit here?
Hundreds of people will die.
Don't you know?
We are journalists.
I can't believe there's nothing we can do.
No, there's one thing we can do.
BY THE LATE SON JlN-Gl LEE BANG
- U
I didn't put your name.
You two did all the work.
I'm cool with it.
That's not what I mean.
You shouldn't get fired.
Oh, and there's rule number two.
Have a great partner like you.
Good job.
There's no forecast in a newspaper other than the weather.
Put a false report for a terror that's not even certain?
Then the truth never unveils.
Saving people is more important.
Now, the false report is the truth.
No, I can't approve a false report.
I didn't come here for your approval.
I wanted to show you a real scoop.
A scoop for who?
A reporter only observes.
He doesn't solve the case.
When personal opinion comes first, you're not a reporter anymore.
Save the life of an ordinary man, rather than end the life of ten liars.
Boss told me when I was a cub reporter.
Honestly, I don't know who's behind the terror.
But I really want to save that ordinary man.
PARK!
Stop the rotary press!
flight NO. 803 heading TO JEJU ON 08:20 lS TO EXPLODE
Who approved this report!
Are you out of your mind?
Get out!
I don't want to see you!
You're such a pain.
Hopeless woman!
It's not true.
I'm really sorry.
LETTER OF resignation
We don't know anything about it.
The Truth about the Balam Explosion
My name is YOON Hyeok.
As I said, the article is not true.
The engineers are checking the plane.
So please wait for just a few minute.
I worked at PARK's store for 3 months.
And watched his every action.
He had a fiance he really loved.
He was an ordinary man just like you.
All this area is now a special region.
There are innocent victims who lost their lives...
Huh, that guy...
I beg for their forgiveness.
I know that guy.
Never thought he'd be on TV.
Excuse me, sir.
Am I the only passenger?
Yes, sir.
Others cancelled because of the false report.
Oh, really?
It's good they believed it.
Sorry?
Nothing.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have landed in Jeju Airport.
Please remain seated until we park at the gate.
The weather is cloudy with a little chance of rain.
The temperature is 11 degree cel and the humidity is 70%.
Thank you for choosing us and have a nice day.
Hello?
Benjamin...or Benny, as I understand he was known, was not a regular parishioner and sadly, I didn't know him personally.
But a sudden and unexpected loss like this is hard on all those left behind, and we share in the great sadness felt by each and every one of you, his friends, family and colleagues.
We now commit Benny's body to the flames, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in the sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life.
THUNDER RUMBLES
Well, if Benny's made it through the pearly gates, there's hope for us all.
Why, what was he like?
He was a good old-fashioned rogue, was Benny.
Could charm the birds from the trees.
A roper, was he?
Worked mainly as a fixer, but he could turn his hand to anything.
He was a natural.
He was amazingly intuitive, could spot a mark in the blink of an eye.
You should have seen his card tricks.
Fastest hands I ever saw.
See you back at the ranch.
Oi!
Where are you going?
I've got a meeting at the bank.
Oh, he has a winner.
Symphony Crest, 2.30 at Wincanton.
20-1 in Benny's honour!
CAR HORNS BEEP
Look, tell you what, mate, I'll jump out here.
Right-o.
There you go.
Cheers, mate.
Just been to a funeral.
The walk might do me good.
Keep the change.
Oi!
Hold up!
Ash...
Benny.
We just went to your funeral!
It's complicated.
Thought I saw him coming out of the bank, so I legged it.
Who?
Then I saw someone chasing me.
Didn't realise it was you.
Thought I was a dead man.
Easy mistake to make.
Why the bloody hell were you chasing me?
Cos I've always wanted to see a ghost up close.
Look, Benny, for Christ's sake calm down and have a drink.
Benny was an old school grifter.
Back then, all you had were your wits.
No mobile phones, no internet, no tricks, or gadgets.
The first person to say "those were the days" gets the next round.
He almost wound up on this crew.
Was a toss-up between him and Ash.
And you chose Ash?
He can't have been that smart.
Benny was smart, all right.
He even saved Mickey's butt once.
You?
From who?
The cops.
Well, this I have to hear.
It was a long time ago.
Ten years.
Fifteen.
Whatever.
Benny and I were working a scam together.
And I got sloppy.
The mark turned out to be old bill.
I hadn't checked him out properly.
But Benny recognised him and at the last moment, he switched the cases back.
So, what do we have here?
It's all there.
Count it if you want.
It cost me 20 grand, but if it wasn't for Benny, I'd have done five years.
Nice doing business, mate.
Thank you.
And all this time we've been under the misapprehension that you're invincible.
Yeah, this Benny guy sounds like a right legend.
Got to hand it to him.
The man had balls of steel.
I lost my mojo.
And when the self-doubt crept in, I knew I was in trouble.
I tried one last con.
A big one.
Came this close to selling a house that never existed.
Guess who to?
I dunno, mate, Paul Daniels.
An Arab sheikh.
Mmm, royalty.
Nice.
It was a beaut, Ash, you would have loved it.
There are four identical streets in Bath, right, all in a row.
So I invented a fifth.
Had him on the hook for an eight bedroom Regency Villa. ã3.5 million.
Reduced from four for a quick sale.
Bargain.
What happened?
His lawyer was at university there.
Knew the place back to front.
Got out by the skin of my teeth.
By now, I'm desperate, so I start doing the spreads.
Spread betting?
I know, mug's game, but if you do your homework...anyway, by this time I'm skint.
Can't get credit off the high street bookies, so I start dealing with this Iranian bloke, Danush.
Seems on the level, gives good prices, always pays up in cash.
Anyway, fast-forward to the World Cup.
All I need is for Rooney and the boys to do what they do every Saturday, and I'm sitting pretty on a dead cert 25 grand win.
You, cheering England?
Wish I'd seen that.
Nauseating, I know, but business is business.
Or so I thought.
Come the final whistle of that farcical Germany game, the telly's out through the window and I'm sitting there with a 40 grand stain in my trousers.
Nasty.
Very.
No, no, no, but it gets worse.
Turns out this bloke Danush, whose nickname I now learn is The Dentist on account of his favoured method of persuasion, has interest rates that make credit cards look like Save the bloody Children.
Cut to four weeks later, and an unscheduled extraction... my 40 grand debt's spiralled to a hundred.
Says I can pay it back at ten grand a month.
Yeah, right.
So you faked your own death.
What else could I do?
I dunno, get on a plane?
I can't afford a bus ticket, let alone a plane ticket.
What about the short con?
You were the best at that.
Oh, Ash, no, I've lost it.
Big time.
You know, I dunno, it's like these are someone else's hands.
I can't even shuffle a deck of cards any more, let alone pick a pocket.
MOBILE RINGS
Calm down.
Yeah.
Are you, er...are you sitting down?
Cheers.
Cheers.
You look pretty damn perky for a stiff.
Death ain't all it's cracked up to be, trust me.
Well, you certainly had us fooled.
Yeah, we bought a wreath and everything.
We even signed the book of condolence.
I'm touched.
Now the shortest book in the world.
Why, what was the turnout like?
A wet mid-week friendly between Brentford and Burton Albion.
Oh.
Still, there's always next time, eh?
You don't have to do this.
I know we don't, but we're gonna anyway.
In our game, we always take care of our own.
But this is your home, and these two don't even know me.
No, we'll get you back on your feet in no time.
I've taken the liberty of running you a bath.
Dump your clothes in the bin.
Try those.
Those are...
Thanks.
All of you.
You've seriously saved my nuts.
Couple of days, I'll get my head together, come up with a plan, and I'll be out of here.
Bathroom's that way.
Oh, yeah, thanks.
When you said you were collecting your winnings,
I was hoping you'd come back with a take-out and a bottle of fizz.
Instead, you bring us a lodger.
Was I supposed to leave him on the streets?
You did the right thing.
Benny's a wreck.
He wouldn't last five minutes out there with that nutter after him.
But with the best will in the world, we can't let him stay indefinitely.
We could give him cash, buy him a plane ticket.
He mentioned Spain.
Wanted to end up in Marbella.
We could.
Or alternatively...?
We could kill two birds with one stone.
DOOR OPENS
That's what I call a view.
You've done all right for yourselves.
Yeah, it's not easy, though.
Not meant to be easy, though, is it?
Wouldn't be worth doing if it was.
I dunno.
Sometimes I'd settle for easy.
No, no, no.
Easy means lazy.
Lazy means sloppy.
Sloppy means you get nicked.
Trust me.
Amen to that.
Listen, Benny, we've got a little plan we want to run past you.
I'm all ears.
This Danush character.
Why don't we take him down?
Are you serious?
He's a nasty piece of work, he's greedy and best of all, he's in the cash game.
Haven't you been listening?
This isn't a sleazy businessman looking to turn a quick buck.
He plays by a whole different set of rules.
You don't want to mess with Danush.
Yeah, well, like I said, it was just a thought, you know.
Anyway, Benny, there's someone we'd like you to meet.
A companion for you when we're out and about.
Someone, um...intelligent.
Charming.
Great sense of humour.
And terrific legs.
Eddie, Benny.
Benny, Eddie.
All right, mate.
You been strangling a cat again, Ed?
Very funny.
You're insulting the work of a genius.
Why, who is it?
Heathens, the lot of you.
Joe Oliver, one of the greatest exponents of jazz that ever lived.
Benny's confined to quarters for a while.
Thought you could babysit.
He's got to keep his head down.
Be my pleasure.
Be a bit of sophisticated company for a change.
Nice hoody, that, mate, by the way.
Don't worry, you'll be safe here.
Drinks all round, Ed.
We're his only customers, you know.
I heard that.
You know what, Benny, they've got a point Danush is ripe for the picking.
But he's also smart and extremely dangerous.
There are easier marks.
None that we've got on the hook right now.
Anyway, like you said, it's not about easy.
You're in a hole.
We want to help.
We'll cut you in on what we make.
Might be enough to get you on your feet.
Think of it as your Marbella fund.
All you have to do is help us out.
I appreciate you trying to help me, but I don't know.
Danush is seriously bad news.
Look, you need out of this town, fast.
You got any better ideas?
What would you need me to do?
Just give us the lowdown on Danush, help come up with a plan.
And then leave the rest to us.
OK.
OK, but don't say I didn't warn you.
Good lad.
OK, so what have you got?
On Danush?
Mmm.
Not a lot.
You lot gonna order another drink, or are you just gonna sit here?
We'll probably just sit here, actually, mate.
Oh, come on, Benny, you must remember something.
He's Iranian.
So you said.
Where does he operate from?
I dunno, he never said.
Where did you meet him?
At a boxing gym.
He does a workout every day.
He's got to have an office somewhere or something.
We weren't exactly drinking buddies.
I'm sorry,
I don't know anything about him.
But you'd recognise him if you saw him, yeah?
Of course I would.
Why?
Maybe he's not going today.
You said he goes for an hour every morning.
I meant regularly.
I don't know if he goes every day.
Could be a long wait, then.
If he sees me, I'm so dead.
I've shown you the gym and told you what he looks like.
Can't you drop me back at the bar?
This is west London, Benny.
He's Iranian, late thirties.
That doesn't narrow things down much round here.
Benny?
It's him!
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Now, would you please get me out of here!
You keep your head down, mate, we'll have you back at the ranch in no time.
Oi-oi.
Yeah, you'd best keep your head down, Benny.
Why, what's he doing now?
He's, er...helping an old lady with her shopping, but he is looking this way.
Oh, he's fit.
I just mean he looks like he works out a lot.
Didn't you say that, Benny?
This is Danush.
We think his surname's Larijani, but he's likely to have lots of aliases.
This is where he's based, an industrial unit in Stanmore.
But he meets punters like Benny here in the cafe at the Silver Street Boxing Gym after his morning workout.
And that's it?
Come on, Benny.
Benny.
You must remember something else.
A face, a name, a little snippet of something.
Anything.
I'm...sorry.
Right, OK, we'll have to get out there ourselves.
Use the usual contacts.
Someone must have heard of him.
Sean, Emma, we need access to his laptop and his mobile, anything that'll get us the inside track.
This man is elusive.
Do whatever you need to.
You all off out, then?
Relax, we'll be back before you know it.
No, I haven't seen him.
Have you seen this geezer?
All right, cheers anyway.
Nothing?
OK.
So, anything?
Not a sausage.
You?
Zip.
Nada.
Zero.
No-one's heard of him.
No-one we know, anyway.
Like I said, he flies under the radar.
Let's hope Sean and Emma find something at the lock-up.
Don't let him leave.
You've got till half past.
Don't be late.
Piece of cake.
Hey, yeah.
I just remembered something about Danush.
What's that?
He's got a dog.
Oh, yeah?
DOG BARKS
DOG GROWLS
Good boy.
PHONE RINGS
Ash, it's me.
Listen, I've got the laptop, but it's password protected.
Can you bypass it?
Not from here.
Start by trying the usual passwords.
Which are?
The top five are the numbers 123, then "password", then "letmein", then the numbers one to six, then one to eight.
No.
Listen, I'm kind of running out of time here.
Partner's name?
What?
Birthdays?
No idea.
Pet's name.
I don't know, I don't know.
Pet!
What's the dog's name?
Are you having a laugh?
You knew about the dog?
Has it got a collar?
No.
No collar, no.
Just read the name on the collar, Sean.
Listen, I'm not getting my bloody hand bitten off trying to get a name which I guarantee you will not be the password!
Good lad.
Let us know how you get on.
Ash?
Ash?
Yeah, bound to be the dog's name.
PHONE BEEPS
Oh.
LOW GROWLING
HE MURMURS
Tyson.
Tyson.
HE MOUTHS
Sorry, mate, have you lost your keys?
Yes.
I just found them on the floor down there.
Thank you.
Er...before you go...
Sorry, excuse me?
It won't take long.
LOW GROWLING
BARKING
FRANTIC BARKING
What is it?
The club is running a contest against a couple of the local gyms.
Some of the trainers wanted to know if you could fight.
Just forget it.
Well, the Olympic trials start in two weeks.
Olympic trials?
What are you talking about?
No, I'm just kidding.
It's not funny, all right?
I could have been mauled.
It's a dog's life, eh, Sean?
If you're looking for sympathy, you're barking up the wrong tree.
It's a dog-eat-dog world, kid.
Very funny(!
) All right, the important thing is you got in there.
Ash, what have we got from his laptop?
Lots of admin, spreadsheets, betting forecasts, photos of women's privates and loads of emails.
Anything interesting?
It's vague but it looks like he's got his finger in lots of pies - gambling, loan-sharking, and the key to his business - smuggled duty-free fags.
His lock-up was full of 'em.
Ah, the sweet smell of cash.
But here's the best bit.
His supplier's been nicked at Dover with half a million quid's worth of cigarettes on board.
So he's a middle man?
Exactly.
And the distributors he sells the fags on to are threatening to find another dealer if he can't get more product in.
Good, good.
I think we've just found our way in.
You sure we're doing the right thing here, Mick?
What's bothering you?
Well, we've got a lot riding on the top of this.
If it backfires, it's not just the cash we're going to have to worry about.
We're in the risk business, Ash.
There's always more than cash at stake.
Yeah, but are we doing this for the right reason?
Why are you doing it?
Guilt, I suppose.
Guilt?
What for?
Bottom line, Mick...
Benny's a better all-round grifter than me.
He always has been.
There's nothing he can't do.
But you chose me for this crew, not him.
Yeah, and I had my reasons.
There's nothing for you to feel guilty about.
Sometimes life boils down to a few little moments.
When you turned Benny down, that was one of his.
He's been on a downer ever since.
At the end of the day, we're each responsible for our own destiny.
It's not your fault, or mine.
Yeah, maybe.
So why do you want to nail Danush?
He's a worthy mark.
Oh, right.
So it's nothing to do with repaying Benny for saving your skinny arse?
If we can take down a scumbag and get a six-figure sum in the process and help a fellow grifter, I call that a win-win.
All right, but answer me this.
If you take Benny out of the equation, would you still run a scam on Danush?
Yeah.
You?
Oh, I dunno.
Ask me when it's over.
How we doing?
Get you a drink?
No, you're all right mate, thanks.
You known them long?
Oh, we go way back, yeah.
You?
Yeah, yeah, a few years, actually.
I'm sort of like the sixth member of the team, you know?
Well, more like a silent partner, really, but I give them a few ideas and that, you know?
The brains behind the gang?
Yeah, that sort of thing, yeah.
Morning, Eddie.
Do us a coffee, would you?
Yes.
- Oh, yeah, make that two.
- OK.
Three, please.
Peppermint tea, please, Ed.
- Yeah, I'll have a decaf skinny latte, cheers.
Oh, and some of those almond biscuits.
Yes, all right!
62 quid for ten packs, can you believe that?
Yeah, and 50 of that's tax.
50 quid?
Government duty, there's the racket.
Yeah, ever wonder why you never see cigarette brands on the side of lorries?
Cargo's too valuable.
Precisely.
A big lorry can hold about just under half a million packs of cigarettes - that's 60,000 of these.
Which makes just over ã3 million.
And if you can get a lorry-load of duty-free packs in, well, you're talking huge margins.
Yeah, but without a supplier, Danush is out of the game.
Hmm, which is where we come in.
How's your German accent?
POOR GERMAN ACCENT:
Not so convincing, I think.
HE LAUGHS OK.
Dutch?
Speak it like a native.
ALL LAUGH
Dutch it is, then.
First, we'll need a lock-up near Danush.
Emma, that's your job.
Excuse me?
Hello there.
You really can't take any chances with asbestos.
Should get the results back in the next couple of weeks, but in the meantime, we'll need the car out.
She's a beauty, though.
Sean and I will play dealers selling smuggled cigarettes out our lock-up.
So lose the designer wardrobe, Sean.
We work for Albert, who's a big shot from New York looking to... set up in London.
Danush won't question why he's never heard of him.
I'll bump into Danush, flash the product, and make sure he witnesses a delivery of cigarettes from our dodgy Dutch truck driver.
If we can pull all of this off convincingly Danush will come to us.
He'll want an introduction to Albert, and a way in with Ash.
Hello, hello?
Anybody at home?
Hey.
BARKING
My, that's a big 'un, innit?
What do you want?
I'm just doing the rounds, bruv, introducing myself to the neighbours and that.
Saying hello.
Hey, listen, do you smoke?
No.
Maybe your wife, your girlfriend?
DOG CONTINUES TO BARK
All right, all right.
I can see you're busy man and I'm holding you up, yeah?
Later.
Hey, I've got the boss on the phone.
Thanks, mate.
Have you got an HGV license?
Yeah.
A real one?
No.
What's the biggest thing you've driven, Ash?
I dunno.
Seven-and-a-half tonner, probably.
This thing can carry 44 tonnes.
One wrong move and you'll flatten buildings.
Really?
Well, well, well.
To be honest, I'm getting fed up with them always playing tricks on me.
What tricks?
Coin tricks, card tricks, that sort of thing.
Anything to get out of paying for their tab.
It's costing me a fortune.
So...
I've been practising a few tricks of my own.
Oh, yeah?
Time to turn the tables.
Mind if I use you as my guinea pig?
No.
Sure, sure.
I think I've got it pretty much sussed, like, but you can't practice too much, can you?
No, you're right enough there, Eddie.
No, no, no, no.
Hide the king in your right hand...
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Got you, yeah, all right.
That's right.
And now you... flash the final card off the top of the deck like that.
Voila!
What do you reckon?
Well...
Let's try it again.
Hang on a minute, it's here somewhere.
Um...
That's your card.
No.
Oh.
Erm...
That one?
No, it's not.
You sure?
100%.
Here, give them to me.
There it is.
Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Give them here, I'll try it again.
The other one I've been perfecting is where you steal someone's watch without them noticing.
Here we go, just a minute.
Oi!
Are you going to spend all day in front of that mirror?
What do you reckon?
Honestly?
Honestly.
It's a definite improvement.
Cheers.
Look sharp, we've got an audience.
Know how much it's costing to rent this set of fancy wheels?
Go on, how much?
Five whole minutes of sweet-talking, that's how much.
HE MURMURS
I'm telling you, Mick, it's a waste of time.
Be patient.
He probably hasn't even noticed us yet.
Everything comes to he who waits.
Yeah?
Well, 50 quid says nothing happens till we make it happen.
50 quid?
50 quid.
Make it 100.
What?
Yeah!
If you're so sure, let's make it 100.
All right. 100 it is.
Why are you selling these on my turf?
You all right?
You changed your mind?
You continue to sell these anywhere between here and Kensal Green and I will break your arms, and then I will break your legs, then I break your head.
Do you understand?
All right, bruv, take it easy.
I'm just doing a job, you get me?
Do you understand?
Yes, absolutely.
But...
just chill, all right?
Now, obviously, you've got a beef, yeah?
So, look, I'll call my boss, we'll get things sorted out nice and proper.
It'll be sweet, man.
Yeah, yeah, it's me.
Sorry to bother you.
Mr Dent, there's someone I think you need to meet.
Turf wars are so 20th century, don't you think?
They're one of the many reasons that I left New York.
Where I come from, Mr Dent, it shows disrespect to move into the territory of another businessman.
In my country, they cut off your hand for such things.
Well, I'm sure we can resolve this problem in a more amicable way.
Sure.
All you have to do is stop selling in my territory.
Well, the truth is, Mr Larijani, that there are plenty of distributors in your patch begging me to supply them.
Either they don't know about you or you about them, but they're out there.
They're right on your doorstep.
I have... temporary problems with my supplier.
But that does not excuse you to muscle in and try to take over.
Look, there are one million smokers in London, and they smoke over 80 million cigarettes every week.
So finding customers is not the problem, Mr Larijani.
To supply them, as you know, IS the problem.
Maybe I can help.
So Danush thinks we're going to sell him smuggled duty free fags.
But we don't want to do that.
See, what we're going to give him is...
Bundles of newspaper, courtesy of Big Dave down the corner shop.
Good lad.
But our friend, who has paranoid tendencies, will check he's not being ripped off, which, of course, he is.
It would take hours to check every single box, so he'll only check some of them.
How do we know where to place the real cartons?
We don't.
Luckily, I've found a behavioural scientist who does.
A what?
A behavioural scientist - the systematic analysis of human behaviour.
A grifter, but with letters after his name.
How will he help?
If we know which boxes our friend's going to check, we know where to stick the real cartons.
So we just steer him in the right direction?
Exactly.
Bit of coercive persuasion.
You're going to hypnotise him?
No, not exactly.
I'll show you.
Here you go, Sean, pick one of them.
Eh?
Go on, choose one.
Good lad.
Turn it over, read what it says.
"Sean will pick the pyramid."
Same one I would have picked.
Very nice.
What's the trick?
Bit of suggestion, that's all.
What we're going to give him is...
A-ha.
For Danush, we'll use a symbol on the box we want him to choose, linked to visual cues we'll plant which he'll see en route to the meet.
Little job for you, Sean.
There you go.
And verbal cues we'll use when we're there.
A little word we'll drop into the conversation every few minutes.
How confident are you this is going to work?
The prof reckons 95%.
Hope he's right.
How many boxes will there be in total?
I've told him we had 10,000 cartons of 200.
He'll take half, and he expects us to buy the other half.
Yeah, 10,000 of these is 20 of those.
How is the money going to work?
Ash is the supplier so you'll give your money to him.
Danush will follow.
Phoney cash, yeah?
What do you think, Benny?
You've met him.
Do you want to risk that?
No.
No, it better be real cash.
How much?
125 grand.
HE WHISTLES
Do we have that much?
Yeah, I know you don't rent fridges, Charlie, but you can make an exception for me.
Tenner a day each, and I'll have them back to you by the weekend.
Oh, and I need them still in their boxes, yeah?
Good lad.
I'm wasted.
Obviously.
OK, pack the rest with newspaper, Sean.
Mr Larijani.
Charlie Dent.
Yeah.
I just wanted to confirm that our Dutch friend will be making the delivery tomorrow as we discussed.
There'll be 5,000 cartons - ã125,000, plus a 10% fee, non-negotiable.
Ah?
Right!
Excellent.
You all right?
No.
We shouldn't be messing with Danush.
If it goes tits up, it'll all be my fault.
It's a good plan.
It'll be fine.
Let's hope you're right for all our sakes.
Eddie's lined up a quick breakfast.
We'll go through the plan one last time and then we're on.
You coming?
No, you guys crack on.
I'm too nervous to eat.
Benny, are you sure?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right, we'll see you later.
Hey guys...
Good luck, eh?
As soon as I've dumped the lorry, I'll bring the cash back here.
Nothing overlooked?
Covered all angles?
Left nothing to chance?
I think we're there.
All right then.
There you go.
Good lad.
And now, ladies and gentleman, live from Eddie's Bar,
I give you The Great Eddini himself.
Have you slipped him something?
Now, I'll need a volunteer.
Er, Eddie...
Ah, ah, ah!
You, sir, you, sir.
Pick a card, any card.
Guarantee I'll find it.
Double or quits on your tab.
Oh, get him, eh?
Eddie, look, we're in the middle of something here.
Oh, I see.
Running scared, are we?
Yeah, we're quaking Ed(!
)
Right, I'll see you there.
We'll be one minute behind you.
Don't let him think we've arrived together.
Mr Dent.
Impeccable timing, Mr Larijani.
Let's get down to business.
Sure.
The clock's ticking, yeah?
So, who's getting what?
It's five thousand for Mr Larijani here, and another five thousand for us man.
Cool.
That's easy.
That's ten boxes each.
Yeah.
You wanna check inside?
No, I trust you this time.
Well, what about you?
Well take your time, man.
This one at the top?
Dat one there?
What we're gonna give him is...
Bundles of newspaper, courtesy of Big Dave.
The clock's ticking...
No, I trust you this time.
Well, take your time man.
No this one in the middle.
Good.
Now let's see the money.
A 125 grand.
Looks good, yeah?
Mr Dent, it's all there.
TYRES SCREECH
Hands up!
Nobody move!
Right you lot try anything and you're all dead.
Stay where you are boy, stay there!
Stay where you are!
Go, go, go, go!
What was that?
What the hell was that?
You tell me.
You set me up...
Who you pointing at, man?
How do we know it wasn't you!
?
I'm going after them.
It's me.
Bloody hell, that was quick.
How did it go?
Like bloody clockwork, man!
Get in...
Good luck, eh.
Bunch of bloody half-wits.
I spent years trying to come up with a plan they'd fall for.
Then a few months back I read about this undertaker who'd organised a fake funeral...
And bingo!
I knew I had it.
Ash Morgan, fixer.
Or so he says.
He's the back-stabbing bastard that nicked my place on Mickey's team.
He's spent years sharing the glory, and the money, when everyone knows I'm the better grifter.
Well, now it's payback time.
This is the great Mickey Bricks.
King of the conmen, or so he'd have you believe.
Well, the king is deadm Mickey.
Long live the king.
So what's the plan, boss?
I'm going to play to their massive egos and let them think they're coming up with the plan when all the time I'll be the background, controlling everything.
Nice.
The tougher we make it for them, the less they'll suspect they're being had.
Oh, come on Benny you must remember something else...
A face, a name...
Sorry...
You'll need an office.
Aye I'm interested in renting a small industrial unit.
Lloyd, now you.
Your name is...
Danush Larijani.
Mess with me and I will pull your teeth out.
We'll need a dog.
Something nasty.
Me aunty's got a Rottweiler.
Benji, soft bugger... but he looks the part.
Perfect.
There are some emails on there that'll say you're in the right direction.
They'll break into the office, so put it in a desk drawer.
Make sure it's password protected.
Name of the dog'll do.
Not Benji.
Tyson.
Get a tag.
How are they gonna figure that out?
Trust me, they will.
Benny sent us.
We'll need some cash for the exchange.
Get it from Vic.
Vic the Mic you're joking.
It's fine we'll only need it for a few hours.
So, how's Benny?
Aye, he's good.
137 grand.
Do you wanna count it?
No, you're all right.
Remind Benny that I want it back by seven o'clock tonight.
Plus my five grand fee.
If it's not, I'll find him and cut his legs off.
Capish?
What I wouldn't give to see their little faces right now.
Beaten, broke and humiliated.
Oh, I've been dreaming of this moment for years.
Oh, this is sweet!
Ash Morgan and Mickey Stone, you are the weakest link...
goodbye!
You having a laugh?
It can't be!
Where's the bloody money?
!
I saw the cash with my own eyes!
Well, where is it, then!
?
It's those bloody muppets you hired!
They've double crossed you!
What?
Where the bloody hell are you?
Where are you?
It's 5.10pm.
What?
!
I don't understand.
How the hell did they find out?
Well, the days of fleecing Eddie are over.
Benny's shown me a few moves.
Sounds expensive.
Trust me, it will be.
The man's a genius.
He can do things with a deck you wouldn't believe.
He's got the fastest hands I've ever seen.
Give me the bloody cards, Eddie.
It's like these are someone else's hands.
I can't even shuffle a deck of cards any more, let alone pick a pocket.
Houston, we have a problem.
So he's remembered how to shuffle a deck of cards.
Benny didn't come up with the plan, we did.
We're covering ourselves.
We won't actually do anything until we're sure that Benny is up to something.
Ash, what you got?
This is identical to Benny's.
Every time he makes or receives a call I'll hear the conversation.
Get back to the penthouse and swap that for his.
If you're wrong about this, it's gonna blow the whole con?
I'm not.
Less than six hours before the exchange goes down.
Say Benny is doing the dirty, and we somehow manage to find out his plan, what then?
We do what we do best.
Sean...
That was quick.
Ash wants us to load a couple of extra boxes.
Here you go, let me help you with that.
Oh, thanks.
Thank you.
This isn't going to work.
Well, if you've got a better idea, I'm all ears.
The deal goes down at five.
That leaves us 4 hours 52 minutes.
To find out his plan, assuming he has one that is, and then turn the tables on him.
If there's a chance we're being conned, shouldn't we just walk away?
PHONE RINGS
'It's me.
You all set?
'
'Aye, just off to Vic's to pick up the cash.'
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?
I said sorry!
Is Vic there?
Benny sent us.
You arrive at exactly ten past five... not a second earlier.
Balaclavas on.
Take the two briefcases and dump them in the green bin at the end of the dirt road.
I'll see you there.
RADIO INTERFERENCE
Looks good, yeah?
OK Mr Dent, it's all there.
Hands up!
Nobody move!
Stay where you are, boy.
Stay there!
Stay where you are!
Go, go, go, go!
What the hell was that?
You tell me.
You set me up...
How do we know it wasn't you!
?
I'm going after them.
I'll kill them!
Lloyd we've got to pack up.
Vic's gonna come looking for us in less than two hours.
Not me, man.
You're on your own.
Sorry.
Lloyd!
Not staying for the party, Lloyd?
Apparently not.
Can you believe it, Mick?
He's gone and found himself some new digs without so much as a thank you.
Benny, Benny?
Where are your manners.
Oh, here we go.
Come to gloat, have you?
Us?
Gloat?
Never.
You think you're so bloody clever.
Well, you're not.
Really?
So how come we've got the cash, and you've got the Sunday papers.
You really thought you owed me one, didn't you, Mickey?
Yeah, I did.
You kept me out of jail.
And now I try to return the favour, you try to double cross us.
You idiot.
I didn't keep you out of jail.
I conned you all those years ago.
You were the mark.
Excuse me?
That wasn't a real copper.
It was my old mate, Les.
So thanks for the twenty grand, Mickey.
My pleasure.
And thank you for the 137 grand.
I'm a better grifter than you are any day of the week.
Oww, ouch(!
)
You're wrong Benny.
You're a jack of all trades and not a team player.
That's why I chose Ash, not you.
He's not only a better grifter, he's a better man.
You think what you like, but trust me.
This ain't over.
I play the long game.
And one day I'll have you.
Every con you pull from now on you'll be wondering if it's me pulling the strings.
And one day it will be.
And I'll bring you both down!
Oh, I doubt that, Benny.
What goes around, comes around.
Especially in our game.
That little yarn you spun us about you being a dead man if Danush ever caught up with you?
Well, it's come to pass.
Only this time it's Vic the Mick.
And it's for real.
You owe him a lot of money, remember?
Remind Benny that I want it back by seven o'clock tonight.
If it's not, I'll find him and cut his legs off.
Capish?
And from what I hear his interest rates are...
Interesting.
So, if we so much as hear your name, let alone see your face, we'll have a chat with Vic, put out a few feelers and help him find you.
You wouldn't.
After what you just pulled, we would.
Oh...
What's this?
It's a little farewell present.
Bye, bye Benny.
MUSIC DROWNS SPEECH
Oh, that was sweet.
What?
Well, that better fixer, better man thing.
Cheers for that.
Well, it's true.
Ash, we couldn't do what we do without you.
Not just as a fixer but as a friend.
You're always there for me, watching my back.
I appreciate that.
Was that a bit OTT?
Yeah, it was a bit yeah.
Sorry!
Mind you, you've got to hand it to Benny.
It was a tasty plan.
Yeah, it was.
Can't believe you fell for his phony copper and the switched briefcase scam.
Twenty grand.
Ooh!
No, nor can I.
I think it's best we don't tell the others.
No, you're probably right.
Why's that then?
Well, we don't want to undermine confidence.
No, absolutely not.
Can't have everyone thinking Mickey Bricks is a gullible plonker, can we?
No.
We can't.
No.
You know what your trouble is, Ash?
Yeah.
Too much sex appeal.
You're too trusting.
Rubbish.
I had my suspicions, right from the start.
Admit it.
He had you.
Hook, line and sinker.
There's no shame in it.
He was good, I'll give him that.
If it hadn't been for Eddie...
What?
You saved his bacon.
Who, Ash's?
How?
I grant you, he had me going for a couple of days...
What?
!
More like a week.
Well, I just can't help seeing the best in people.
At least you know you can always trust us, Ash.
Isn't that right, Eddie?
Oh, yeah, totally yeah(!
)
About now our friend should be on his way to sunnier climes.
Gotcha!
Oi!
Give it here!
Winklepicker!
Nice one!

(# Organ music)
Benjamin, or Benny, as I understand he was known, was not a regular parishioner and sadly I didn't know him personally.
But a sudden and unexpected loss like this is hard on all those left behind.
And we share in the great sadness felt by each and every one of you - his friends, family, and colleagues.
We now commit Benny's body to the flames - earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust - in the sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life.
(Thunder rumbling)
(Thunder crashing)
Well, if Benny's made it through the pearly gates, there's hope for us all.
Why?
What was he like?
Ah, he was good old-fashioned rogue, was Benny.
- Could charm the birds from the trees.
- A roper, was he?
Worked mainly as a fixer but he could turn is hand to anything.
He was a complete natural.
He was amazingly intuitive.
He could spot a mark in the blink of an eye.
Yeah, you should have seen his card tricks.
Fastest hands I ever saw.
Look, I'll see you back at the ranch.
- (Emma) Oi!
Where you going?
- I got a meeting at the bank.
Oh, he has had a winner.
Yeah.
Symphony Crest, 2:30 at Wincanton, 20 to 1, in Benny's honour.
(Horns blaring)
(Sighs) Look, I'll tell you what, mate, I'll jump out here.
- (Driver) Righto.
- There you go.
Cheers, mate.
(Ash) Just been to a funeral, the walk might do me good.
(Horn blaring)
Keep the change.
Oi!
(Ash) Hold up!
(Panting)
(Gasping)
(Panting)
(Ash) Oh...
(Both breathing heavily)
(Gasping)
Ash.
Benny.
(Ash) We just went to your funeral!
- It's complicated.
- Yeah.
Thought I saw him coming out of the bank, so I legged it.
- (Ash) Who?
- Then I saw somebody chasing me.
Didn't realise it was you, thought I was a dead man.
(Ash) Easy mistake to make, apparently.
Why the bloody hell were you chasing me?
Cos I've always wanted to see a ghost up close.
Look, Benny, for Christ's sake, calm down and have a drink.
Benny was an old-school grifter.
Back then all you had were your wits.
No mobile phones, no internet tricks or gadgets.
Yeah, the first person to say "Those were the days" gets the next round in.
You know, he almost wound up on this crew.
It was a toss-up between him and Ash.
- And you chose Ash?
- Mmm.
Oh.
He can't have been that smart.
Benny was smart all right.
He even saved Mickey's butt once.
- You?
From who?
- Cops.
Well, this I have got to hear.
(Mickey) It was a long time ago.
- (Albert) No, ten years.
- (Mickey) Fifteen.
(Emma) Whatever.
(Mickey) Benny and I were working a scam together and I got sloppy.
The mark turned out to be Old Bill.
I hadn't checked him out properly.
But Benny recognised him and at the last moment he switched the cases back.
(Man) So, what do we have here?
(Mickey) It's all there.
Count it if you want.
It cost me 20 grand, but if it wasn't for Benny I'd have done five years.
Nice doing business, mate.
Thank you.
And all this time, Mickey, we've been under the misapprehension that you're invincible.
Yeah, this Benny guy sounds like a right legend.
You gotta to hand it to him, the man had balls of steel.
(Benny) I lost my mojo.
And when the self-doubt crept in, I knew I was in trouble.
I tried one last con.
A big one.
Came this close to selling a house that never existed.
Guess who to?
- I dunno, mate.
Paul Daniels?
- An Arab sheikh.
Mmm.
Royalty.
Nice.
It was a beaut, Ash, you would have loved it.
There are four identical streets in Bath, right.
All in a row.
So, I invented a fifth.
Had him on the hook for an eight-bedroom Regency villa, 3.5 million, reduced from four for a quick sale.
Bargain.
So what happened?
His lawyer was at university there, knew the place back to front.
Got out by the skin of my teeth.
By now I'm desperate so I start doing the spreads.
- Spread betting?
- I know.
I know, mug's game.
But if you do your homework...
Anyway, by this time, I'm totally skint.
Can't get any credit off the high-street bookies so I start dealing with this Iranian bloke, Danush.
Seems on the level, gives good prices, always pays up in cash.
Anyway, fast-forward to the World Cup, all I need is for Rooney and the boys to do what they do every Saturday afternoon and I'm sitting pretty on a dead-cert 25-grand win.
What you, cheering England?
Wish I'd seen that.
Nauseating, I know, but business is business.
Or so I thought.
Now, come the final whistle of that farcical Germany game the telly's out through the window and I'm sitting there with a 40-grand stain in my trousers.
- Nasty.
- Very.
No, no, no, but it gets worse.
Turns out this bloke Danush, whose nickname I now learn is "the Dentist"
on account of his favoured method of persuasion, has interest rates that make credit cards look like Save the bloody Children.
(Drilling and crunching)
Cut to four weeks later and an unscheduled extraction right here, my 40-grand debt's spiralled to 100.
Says I can pay it back at 10 grand a month.
Yeah, right.
- So you faked your own death.
- What else could I do?
I dunno, get on a plane?
I can't afford a bus ticket, let alone a plane ticket.
What about the short con?
- I mean, you were the best at that.
- Oh, Ash, man, no.
I've lost it.
Big time.
(Sniffling) You know, it's...
I dunno, it's like these are someone else's hands.
I can't even shuffle a deck of cards any more, let alone pick a pocket.
(Phone ringing)
Calm down.
(Ash) Yeah.
(Chuckles)
Are you, er...
Are you sitting down?
- (Ash) Cheers.
- Cheers.
You look pretty damn perky for a stiff.
Death ain't all it's cracked up to be, trust me.
Well, you certainly had us fooled.
Yeah, yeah, we bought a wreath and everything.
- We even signed the book of condolence.
- I'm touched.
Officially now the shortest book in the world.
Why, what was the turnout like?
A wet, midweek friendly between Brentford and Burton Albion.
- Oh.
- Still, there's always next time, eh?
You don't have to do this.
No, no, I know we don't, but we're gonna anyway.
In our game we always take care of our own.
(Benny) But this is your home and...
These two don't even know me.
No, we'll get you back on your feet in no time.
I've taken the liberty of running you a bath.
So, you can just dump your clothes in the bin, try those for size.
- Those are...
- Thanks.
All of you.
You've seriously saved my nuts.
Couple of days to get my head together, come up with a plan, I'll be out of here.
- Bathroom's that way.
- Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
So when you said you were collecting your winnings,
I was hoping you'd come back with a take-out and a bottle of fizz.
Instead you bring us a lodger.
Yeah, well, what was I supposed to do, leave him on the streets?
No, you did the right thing.
Benny's a complete wreck.
He wouldn't have lasted five minutes out there.
Especially with that nutter after him.
But with the best will in the world, we can't let him stay indefinitely.
No, we could give him some cash, buy him a plane ticket.
We mentioned Spain, wanted to end up in Marbella.
Hmm.
We could.
Or alternatively...
We could kill two birds with one stone.
(Door opening)
That's what I call a view.
- You've done all right for yourselves.
- Yeah, it's not easy, though.
Not meant to be easy though, is it?
Wouldn't be worth doing if it was.
I dunno, sometimes I'd settle for easy.
No, no, no, no.
Easy means lazy.
Lazy means sloppy.
Sloppy means you get nicked.
Trust me.
Amen to that.
Listen, Benny, we've got a little plan we want to run past you.
- I'm all ears.
- This Danush character.
- Why don't we take him down?
- Are you serious?
Yeah, I mean, he's a nasty piece of work, he's greedy,
- and best of all, he's in the cash game.
- (Benny) Haven't you been listening?
This isn't some sleazy businessman looking to turn an quick buck.
He plays by a whole different set of rules.
You don't want to mess with Danush.
Yeah, well, like I said, it was just a thought, you know.
Anyway, Benny, there's someone we'd like you to meet.
A companion for you when we're out and about.
Someone... intelligent.
Yeah.
Charming.
- Great sense of humour.
- And terrific legs.
- Eddie, Benny.
Benny this is Eddie.
- (# Jazz playing)
- You been strangling the cat again, Ed?
- Very funny.
Cos, actually, you're insulting the work of a genius.
- Why, who is it?
- Heathens, the lot of you.
Joe Oliver.
One of the greatest exponents of jazz that ever lived.
Er, Benny's confined to quarters for a while.
Thought you could baby-sit.
He's got to keep his head down.
Be my pleasure.
Be a bit of sophisticated company for a change.
That's a nice hoody that, mate, by the way.
- Don't worry, you'll be safe down here.
- Drinks all round, Ed.
- We're his only customers.
- I heard that.
D'you know what, Benny, they've got a point.
- Danush is ripe for the picking.
- Yeah, maybe.
But he's also smart and extremely dangerous.
There are easier marks.
None that we've got on the hook right now.
Anyway, like you said, it's not about easy.
Benny, you're in a bit of a hole right now and we want to help you out of it.
All right?
We'll cut you in on anything we make.
It may be enough to get you back on your feet.
Think of it as your Marbella fund.
All you have to do is help us out.
Guys, I appreciate you trying to help me, but I don't know.
Danush is seriously bad news.
Look, you need out of this town, fast.
You got any better ideas?
What would you need me to do?
Just give us the lowdown on Danush, help come up with a plan, and then leave the rest to us.
(Sighs)
OK.
OK.
But don't say I didn't warn you.
- Good lad.
- OK, so what have you got?
- What, on Danush?
- Mmm.
There's not a lot.
You lot gonna order another drink, or are you just gonna sit here?
We're probably just gonna sit here actually, mate.
Oh, come on, Benny, you must remember something.
- He's Iranian.
- So you said.
Where does he operate from?
I don't know, he never said.
Where did you meet him?
Er...
At a boxing gym.
He does a workout every day.
Well, he's got to have an office somewhere or something.
Look, we weren't exactly drinking buddies, you know?
I'm sorry, but I don't know anything about him.
But you'd recognise him if you saw him, yeah?
Yeah, of course I would.
Why?
Maybe he's not going today.
(Ash) You said he goes for an hour every morning.
I meant he goes regularly.
I don't know if he goes every single day.
- Could be a long wait, then.
- (Benny) If he sees me, I'm so dead.
I've shown you the gym and told you what he looks like.
Can't you just drop me back at the bar?
This is West London, Benny.
He's Iranian, late '30s.
That doesn't narrow things down very much round here.
- Benny?
- It's him!
- (Ash) Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.
Now, would you please get me out of here?
Yeah, you keep your head down, mate.
We'll have you back at the ranch in no time.
Aye, aye.
Yeah, you best keep your head down, Benny.
Why?
What's he doing now?
He's, er... helping an old lady with her shopping, but he is looking this way.
Ooh, he's fit.
(Emma) What?
I just mean, he looks like he works out a lot.
- Didn't you say that, Benny?
- This is Danush.
We think his surname's Larijani, but he's likely to have lots of aliases.
This is where he's based - an industrial unit in Stanmore - but he meets a few of his punters, like Benny here, in the café at the Silver Street Boxing Gym after his morning workout.
And that's it?
Come on, Benny, Benny?
You must remember something else.
A face, a name, a little snippet of something.
Anything.
I'm sorry.
Right, OK, we'll have to get out there ourselves.
Use the usual contacts, someone must have heard of him.
Oh, Sean, Emma, we need access his laptop and his mobile phone, anything that'll get us the inside track.
This man is elusive, do whatever you need to.
You all off out, then?
Yeah, relax, Benny.
We'll be back before you know it.
No.
Haven't seen him.
Have you seen this geezer?
No?
All right, pal.
Cheers anyway.
Nothing?
OK.
(Sighs)
- So, anything?
- No, not a sausage.
You?
Zip.
Nada.
Zero.
No one's heard of him.
No one we know, anyway.
Well, I said, he flies under the radar.
Let's hope Sean and Emma find something at the lockup.
(Sean) Got 'em.
Don't let him leave.
- You've got till half-past.
Don't be late.
- Yeah.
Piece of cake.
Oh, hey, yeah, I just remembered something about Danush.
What's that?
- He's got a dog.
- Oh, yeah?
(Barking and growling)
(Barking)
(Growling)
Good boy.
There.
(Growling)
(Grunting)
(Drill whistling)
(Dog growling)
(Phone ringing)
Ash, yeah, it's me.
Listen, I've got the laptop but it's password protected.
- Can you bypass it?
- No, not from here.
- Start by trying the usual passwords.
- Which are?
The top five are the numbers one, two, three.
Then "password".
Then "letmein".
Then the numbers one to six.
- Then one to eight.
- (Sean) No.
(Keys jangling)
Listen, Ash, mate, to be honest, I'm kind of running out of time here.
- Partner's name.
- What?
- Birthdays.
- No idea.
What?
- Pet's name.
- I don't know.
- Pet!
What's the dog's name?
- Are you having a laugh?
- You knew about the dog?
- Has it got a collar?
- (Growling)
- No.
No collar, no.
Just read the name on the collar, Sean.
Listen, I'm not getting my bloody hand bitten off trying to get a name which I guarantee you will not be the password!
Good lad.
Let us know how you get on.
Ash?
Ash?
Yeah.
Bound to be the dog's name.
(Growling)
Seriously?
Tyson.
Tyson.
- Sorry, mate?
Have you lost your key?
- Yes.
Yeah, I just found one on the floor down there.
Thank you.
Er...
Before you go...
Sorry, excuse me.
It won't take long.
(Dog growling)
(Barking)
- What is it?
- The club's running a contest against a couple of the local gyms, and some of the trainers here wanted to know if you could fight.
Just forget it.
Well, the Olympic trials start in two weeks.
Olympic trials?
What are you talking about?
No, I'm just kidding.
It's not funny, all right?
I could have been mauled.
It's a dog's life, eh, Sean?
Yeah, if you're looking for sympathy, you're barking up the wrong tree.
- It's a dog eat dog world, kid.
- Very funny.
All right, all right.
The important thing is you got in there.
Ash, what have we got from his laptop?
Lots of admin, spreadsheets, betting forecasts, photos of women's privates, and loads of emails.
- Anything interesting?
- Well, it's all a bit vague, but it looks like our friend's got his finger in lots of pies.
Gambling, loan sharking, and, the key to his business, smuggled duty-free fags.
- (Sean) His lockup was full of 'em.
- Ah, the sweet smell of cash.
But here's the best bit.
His regular supplier's been nicked at Dover with half a million quid's worth of cigarettes on board.
- So, what's he, the middle man?
- (Ash) Exactly.
And the distributors he sells the fags on to are threatening to find another dealer if he can't get more product in, sharpish.
Good, good.
I think we've just found our way in.
(Ash) You sure we're doing the right thing here, Mick?
(Mickey) What's bothering you?
(Ash) Well, we've got a lot riding on the top of this.
If it backfires, it's not just the cash we're going to have to worry about.
We're in the risk business, Ash.
There's always more than cash at stake.
Yeah, but are we doing this for the right reason?
- Why are you doing it?
- Well, guilt, I suppose.
Guilt?
What for?
Bottom line, Mick -
Benny's a better all-round grifter than me.
Always has been.
There's nothing he can't do.
But, you chose me for this crew, not him.
Yeah, and I had my reasons.
There's nothing for you to feel guilty about.
Sometimes life boils down to a few little moments.
When you turned Benny down, that was one of his.
He's been on a downer ever since.
At the end of the day, we're each responsible for our own destiny.
- It's not your fault, or mine.
- Yeah, maybe.
- So why do you want to nail Danush?
- He's a worthy mark.
Oh, right, so it's nothing to do with repaying Benny
- for saving your skinny arse, then.
- (Chuckles)
If we can take down a scumbag and get a six-figure sum in the process and help a fellow grifter, I call that a win-win.
Yeah, all right, but answer me this.
You take Benny out of the equation, would you still run a scam on Danush?
(Sighs) Yeah.
You?
Oh, I don't know.
Ask me when it's over.
(Eddie) How we doing?
Get you a drink?
No, you're all right, mate, thanks.
(Sighs)
- So, you known them long?
- Oh, we go way back, yeah.
- You?
- Yeah, yeah, a few years, actually.
I'm sort of like the sixth member of the team, you know?
Well, you know, more like a silent partner really.
But I give them a few ideas and that.
- Oh, like the brains behind the gang.
- Yeah, that sort of thing, yeah.
Morning, Eddie.
Do us a coffee, would you?
- Yes.
- (Mickey) Oh, yeah, make that two.
- OK.
- (Albert) Three, please.
(Emma) Peppermint tea, please, Ed.
Yeah, I'll have a decaf skinny latte.
Cheers, Ed.
- Oh, and some of those almond biscuits.
- Yes, all right!
Sixty-two quid for ten packs.
Can you believe that?
Yeah, and fifty of that's tax.
- (Sean) Fifty quid?
- Government duty, there's the racket.
Yeah, ever wonder why you never see cigarette brands on the side of lorries?
- Cargo's too valuable.
- (Mickey) Yeah, precisely.
A big lorry can hold about just under half a million packs of cigarettes.
That's 60,000 of these.
Which makes just over three million pounds.
And if you can get a lorryload of duty-free packs in, well, you're talking huge margins.
Yeah, but without a supplier, Danush is out of the game.
Which is where we come in.
What's your German accent like?
(German accent) Oh, it's not so convincing, I sink.
- OK.
Dutch?
- (Dutch accent) Shpeak it like a native.
- (All laugh)
- Dutch it is, then.
(Mickey) First, we'll need a lockup near Danush.
Emma, that's yourjob.
(Emma) Excuse me?
Hello there.
You really can't take any chances with asbestos.
Should get the initial results back in the next couple of weeks, but in the meantime we're going to need the car out.
She's a beauty though.
Sean and I will play street dealers selling smuggled packs of cigarettes out of our lockup.
(Mickey) So, lose the designer wardrobe, Sean.
We work for Albert, who's a big shot from New York looking to set himself up in London.
That way Danush won't question why he's never heard of him.
I'll bump into Danush, I'll flash the product and make sure he witnesses a delivery of cigarettes from our dodgy Dutch truck driver.
(Mickey) Now if we can pull all of this off convincingly,
Danush will come to us, he'll want an introduction to Albert, and a way in with Ash.
Hello, hello.
Anybody at 'ome?
- (Mickey) Hey.
- (Barking)
- Oh, my, that's a big'un, innit?
- What do you want?
I'm just doing the rounds, bruv, introducing myself to the neighbours and that.
Saying hello.
Hey, listen, do you smoke?
No.
- Maybe your wife, your girlfriend?
- (Dog barking)
All right, G, all right.
I can see you're a busy man and I'm holding you up, yeah?
Laters.
Hey, yo!
I've got the boss on the phone!
- Here.
- Thanks, mate.
Hello.
- (Ash) All right, mate.
How you doing?
- Hi, you all right?
- Have you got an HGV licence?
- Yeah.
- A real one?
- No.
What's the biggest thing you've driven, Ash?
I dunno.
Seven-and-a-half tonner, probably.
Well, this thing can carry 44 tons.
One wrong move and you'll flatten buildings.
Really?
Well, well, well.
To be honest with you, Benny,
I'm getting a bit fed up with them always playing tricks on me.
What kind of tricks?
You know, coin tricks, card tricks, that sort of thing.
Anything to get out of paying for their tab.
It's costing me a fortune.
So...
I've been practising a few tricks of me own.
- Oh, yeah?
- Time to turn the tables.
- Mind if I use you as my guinea pig?
- No, sure, sure.
I think I've got it pretty much sussed, like, but you can't practise too much, can you?
You're right enough there, Eddie.
No, no, no, no, hide the king in your right hand.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, got it, yeah, all right...
That's right and now you... you flash the final card off the top of the deck, like that.
Voilà!
What do you reckon?
Well...
Let's try it again, eh?
(Eddie) Hang on a minute, it's here somewhere.
Erm...
- That's your card.
- No.
Oh.
Erm, that one?
No, it's not.
- You sure?
- Hundred per cent.
Here, give them to me.
- There it is.
- Oh, right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Give them here, I'll try it again.
The other one I've been perfecting is where you steal someone's watch without them noticing.
Now, just a minute.
(Grunting)
Oi!
Are you gonna spend all day in front of that mirror?
What do you reckon?
Honestly?
(Dutch accent) Honestly.
It's a definite improvement.
Cheers.
(Ash) Look sharp, we've got an audience.
(Ash) Do you know how much it's costing to rent this set of fancy wheels for an hour?
Go on, how much?
(Ash) Five whole minutes of sweet-talking, that's how much.
- I'm telling you, Mick, it's a waste of time.
- Be patient.
He probably hasn't even noticed us yet.
- Everything comes to he who waits.
- Yeah?
Well, 50 quid says nothing happens till we make it happen.
- Fifty quid?
- Fifty quid.
Make it a hundred.
- What?
- Yeah, if you're so sure.
Let's make it a hundred.
All right, a hundred it is.
Why are you selling these on my turf?
All right there, geez.
You changed your mind, then?
You continue to sell these anywhere between here and Kensal Green and I will break your arms, then I will break your legs, then I break your head.
Do you understand?
All right, bruv, take it easy.
I'm just doing a job.
You get me?
- Do you understand?
- Yes, absolutely.
But just chill, all right?
Now obviously you've got a beef, yeah?
So, look, I'll call my boss.
We'll get things sorted out nice and proper.
It'll be sweet, man.
Yeah, yeah, it's me.
Sorry to bother you.
Mr Dent, there's someone I think you need to meet.
Turf wars are so 20th century, don't you think?
They're one of the many reasons that I left New York.
Where I come from, Mr Dent, it shows disrespect to move into the territory of another businessman.
In my country, they cut off your hand for such things.
Well, I'm sure we can resolve this problem in a more amicable way.
Sure.
All you have to do is stop selling in my territory.
Well, the truth is, Mr Larijani, that there are plenty of distributors in your patch begging me to supply them.
Either they don't know about you or you don't know about them, but they're out there.
I mean, they're right on your doorstep.
I have temporary problems with my supplier.
But that does not excuse you to muscle in and try to take over.
Look, there are one million smokers in London, and they smoke over eighty million cigarettes every week.
So, finding customers is not the problem, Mr Larijani.
To supply them, as you know, is the problem.
Maybe I can help.
So, Danush thinks we're going to sell him smuggled duty-free fags.
But we don't wanna do that.
Oh, no.
See, what we're going to give him is...
Bundles of newspaper, courtesy of Big Dave down the corner shop.
Good lad.
But our friend, the Dentist, who we know has paranoid tendencies, is going to wanna check that he's not being ripped off, which of course he is.
Now, it would take hours to check every single box, so he'll only check some of them.
So, how do we know where to place the real cartons?
We don't.
But I've found us a behavioural scientist who does.
- A what?
- A behavioural scientist, the systematic analysis of human behaviour.
Basically a grifter, but with letters after his name.
How's he gonna help?
Well, if we know which boxes our Iranian friend's gonna check, we know where to stick the real cartons.
So we just steer him in the right direction.
- Exactly.
Bit of coercive persuasion.
- You're gonna hypnotise him.
No, not exactly.
Here, I'll show you.
Here you go, Sean, pick one of them.
- Eh?
- Go on, choose one.
Good lad.
Turn it over, read what it says.
"Sean will pick the pyramid."
- It's the same one I would have picked.
- Very nice.
- What's the trick?
- Bit of suggestion, that's all.
What we're going to give him is...
For Danush, we'll use a similar technique but with a symbol on the box we want him to choose, linked to visual cues we'll have planted which he'll see en route to the meet.
Little job for you, Sean.
There you go.
And verbal cues we'll use when we're there.
A little word we'll drop into the conversation every few minutes.
How confident are you this is going to work?
- The prof reckons 95 per cent.
- Let's hope he's right.
How many boxes will there be in total?
I told him we had a consignment of 10,000 cartons of 200.
He said he'd take half and expects us to buy the other half.
Yeah, 10,000 of these is 20 of those.
How is the money going to work?
Ash is the supplier, so you'll give your money to him and Danush will follow.
- Phoney cash, yeah?
- (Ash) What you think, Benny?
You've met him.
Do you want to risk that?
(Mickey) No.
- No, er, it'd better be real cash.
- How much?
Hundred and twenty-five grand.
(Whistling)
Do we have that much?
Yeah, yeah.
I know you don't rent fridges, Charlie, but you can make an exception for me.
Yeah, a tenner a day each, and I'll have them back to you by the weekend.
Oh, and I need them still in their boxes, yeah?
Good lad.
I'm wasted.
Obviously.
(Ash) OK, pack the rest with newspaper, Sean.
Mr Larijani.
Charlie Dent.
Yeah, I just wanted to confirm that our Dutch friend will be making the delivery tomorrow, as we discussed.
There'll be 5,000 cartons,
£125,000.
Plus a 10 per cent fee.
Non-negotiable.
Huh?
Right.
Excellent.
- You all right?
- No.
I'm not all right.
We shouldn't be messing with Danush.
If this goes tits up, it'll all be my fault.
It's a good plan, Benny.
It'll be fine.
Let's hope you're right, for all our sakes.
OK, everyone, Eddie's lined up a quick breakfast.
We'll go through the plan one last time and then we're on.
- You coming?
- No, no, no, you guys crack on.
- I'm too nervous to eat.
- Benny, are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Right, we'll see you later.
Hey, guys.
Good luck, eh?
Then as soon as I dump the lorry, I'll bring the cash straight back here.
And there's nothing we've overlooked?
We've covered all the angles?
Left nothing to chance?
- No, I think we're there, Mick.
- All right, then.
- There you go.
- Good lad.
And now, ladies and gentleman, live from Eddie's Bar,
I give you the great Eddini himself.
- Have you slipped him something?
- Now, I'll need a volunteer.
- Er, Eddie...
- No, Ash.
You, sir.
You, sir.
Pick a card, any card.
Guarantee I'll find it.
- Double or quits on your tab.
- Oh, get him, eh?
Eddie, look, we're in the middle of something here.
Oh, I see, I see.
Running scared, are we?
Yeah, yeah, we're quaking, Ed, yeah.
- Right, I'll see you there.
- We'll be one minute behind you.
Yeah, don't let him think we've arrived together.
- Mr Dent.
- Impeccable timing, Mr Larijani.
Let's get down to business, shall we?
Sure, the clock's ticking, ja?
So, er...
So who's getting what?
It's 5,000 for Mr Larijani here and another 5,000 for us, man.
Cool, that's easy, that's ten boxes each.
- Yeah.
- (Ash) Do you wanna check inside?
No, no, I trust you this time.
Well, what about you?
(Sighs)
(Chuckles) Well, take your time, man.
This one at the top.
That one there?
What we're gonna give him is...
Bundles of newspaper, courtesy of Big Dave down the corner shop.
- The clock's ticking.
- No, no, I trust you this time.
Well, take your time, man.
No, this one in the middle.
(Grunting)
Good.
- So, now let's see the money.
- A hundred and twenty-five grand.
Looks good, ja?
Mr Dent, it's all there.
(Car tyres screeching)
(Man) Hands up!
Nobody move!
Right, you lot try anything and you're all dead!
Stay where you are, boy!
Stay there!
Stay where you are!
Go, go, go, go!
(Mickey) What was that?
What the hell was that?
- You tell me, all right?
- You set me up.
Who you pointing at, man?
How do we know it wasn't you?
I'm going after them.
(Knocking) It's me.
Bloody hell, that was quick.
How did it go?
(Geordie accent) Like bloody clockwork, man.
Get in.
Good luck, eh?
Yeah.
Bunch of bloody half-wits.
(Benny) I spent years trying to come up with a plan they'd fall for.
Then a few months ago I read about this undertaker who'd organised a fake funeral.
And bingo, I knew I had it.
Ash Morgan, fixer.
Or so he says.
He's the back-stabbing bastard that nicked my place on Mickey's team.
He's spent years sharing the glory and the money, when everybody knows I'm the better grifter.
Well, now it's payback time.
This is the great Mickey Bricks, king of the con men, or so he'd have you believe.
Well, the king is dead, Mickey.
Long live the king.
So, what's the plan, boss?
I'm going to play to their massive egos.
Let them think they're coming up with the plan when all the time I'll be in the background, controlling everything.
Nice.
The tougher we make this for them, the less they'll suspect they're being had.
Oh, come on, Benny, you must remember something else.
A face, a name, a little snippet of something.
Sorry, I...
You'll need an office.
Hi, I'm interested in renting a small industrial unit.
OK, Lloyd, right now.
Now you.
Your name is...
Danush Larijani.
Mess with me and I will pull your teeth out.
(Benny) We'll need a dog.
Something nasty.
(Lloyd) Me aunty's got a Rottweiler - Benji, soft bugger, but he looks the part.
Perfect.
Borrow it for the week.
There are some emails on there that'll steer them in the right direction.
They'll break into the office, so put it in a desk drawer.
Make sure it's password protected.
Name of the dog'll do.
Not Benji.
Tyson.
Get a tag sorted.
How the bloody hell are they gonna figure that out?
Trust me, they will.
Benny sent us.
(Benny) We'll need some cash for the exchange.
Get it from Vic.
(Lloyd) Vic the Mick, you're joking.
It's fine.
We'll only need it for a few hours.
- So, how's Benny?
- Aye, he's good.
A hundred and thirty-seven grand.
Do you wanna count it?
No, you're all right.
Remind Benny that I want it back by seven o'clock tonight.
Plus my five-grand fee.
If it's not, I'll find him and cut his legs off.
Capeesh?
(Benny) What I wouldn't give to see their little faces right now, beaten, broke, and humiliated.
I've been dreaming of this moment for years.
(Benny) Oh, boy, this is sweet.
Ash Morgan and Mickey Stone, you are the weakest link.
Goodbye!
You having a laugh?
- Can't be.
- Where's the bloody money?
This isn't possible.
I saw that cash with me own eyes!
Well, where is it, then?
It's those bloody muppets you've hired!
They've double-crossed you!
What?
(Phone rings)
Where the bloody hell are you?
- Where the hell are you?
It's ten past five.
- What?
I don't understand.
How the hell did they find out?
Well, the days of fleecing Eddie are over.
- Benny's shown me a few moves.
- Well, that sounds expensive.
Trust me, it will be.
Man's a genius.
He can do things with a deck of cards like you wouldn't believe.
He's got the fastest hands I've ever seen.
Here, give me the bloody cards, Eddie.
It's like these are someone else's hands.
I can't even shuffle a deck of cards any more, let alone pick a pocket.
Houston, we have a problem.
(Sean) So he's remembered how to shuffle a deck of cards.
That doesn't mean anything.
(Emma) And Benny didn't come up with the plan, we did.
Look, we're just covering ourselves.
OK?
We won't actually do anything until we're sure that Benny is up to something.
Ash, what you got?
This is identical to Benny's.
Every time he makes or receives a call, it'll ring my phone, and I'll hear both sides of the conversation.
Get back to the penthouse and swap that for his.
Ash, if you're wrong about this, it's gonna blow the whole con.
- I'm not.
Trust me, all right?
- (Sean) We've got less than six hours before this exchange goes down.
Say Benny is doing the dirty, and we somehow manage to find out his plan, what then?
Then we do what we do best.
Sean?
- That was quick.
- Yeah, Ash wants us to load
- a couple of extra boxes just in case.
- Ah.
Hey, here you go, let me help you with that.
Oh, thanks.
Thank you.
This isn't going to work.
Yeah, well, if you've got a better idea, I'm all ears.
Ash, the deal goes down at five.
That leaves us four hours and 52 minutes and counting.
To find out his plan, assuming he has one, that is, and then turn the tables on him.
If there's a chance we're being conned, shouldn't we just walk away?
(Phone ringing)
(Benny) Yeah, it's me.
You all set?
(Lloyd) Aye, just off to Vic's to pick up the cash.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Are you all right?
I said sorry!
Is Vic there?
Benny sent us.
(Lloyd) You arrive at exactly ten past five, not a second earlier.
Balaclavas on.
You take the two briefcases and you dump them in the green bin at the end of the dirt road.
Right, I'll see you there.
(Radio interference)
(Radio off)
Looks good, ja?
OK, Mr Dent, it's all there.
Hands up!
Nobody move!
Stay where you are, boy!
Stay there!
Stay where you are!
Go, go, go, go!
- What the hell was that?
- You tell me, all right?
You set me up!
Who you pointing at, man?
How do we know it wasn't you?
I'm going after them.
(Laughing)
I'll kill them!
Lloyd, we've got to pack up and get out of here,
Vic'll come looking for us in less than two hours.
Not me, man.
You're on your own.
Sorry.
Lloyd!
You not staying for the party, Lloyd?
Apparently not.
(Knocking)
(Ash) Can you believe it, Mick?
He's gone and found himself some new digs without so much as a thank you.
(Tuts) Benny, Benny, Benny.
Where are your manners?
Oh, here we go.
- Come to gloat, have you?
- Us, gloat?
Never.
Think you're so bloody clever, don't you?
- Well, you're not.
- (Mickey) Really?
So how come we've got the cash and you've got the Sunday papers?
You really thought you owed me one, didn't you, Mickey?
Yeah, I did.
You kept me out of jail.
And when I try to return the favour, you try to double-cross us.
You idiot.
I didn't keep you out of jail.
I conned you all those years ago.
- You were the mark.
- Excuse me?
(Benny) That wasn't a real copper.
It was my old mate, Les.
So, thanks for the 20 grand, Mickey.
My pleasure.
And thank you for the 137 grand.
As for you, I'm a better grifter than you are any day of the week.
- Oh, ouch.
- You're wrong, Benny.
You're a jack of all trades and not a team player.
That's why I chose Ash and not you.
He's not only a better grifter, he's a better man.
You think what you like, but trust me - this ain't over.
I play the long game, and one day I'll have you.
Every con you ever pull from now on, you'll be looking over your shoulder, wondering if it's me that's pulling the strings, and guess what?
One day it will be and I'll bring you both down.
Oh, I doubt that, Benny.
Haven't you heard?
What goes around, comes around.
Especially in our game.
That little yarn you spun us about you being a dead man if Danush ever caught up with you?
Well, it's come to pass.
Only this time it's Vic the Mick.
And it's for real.
You owe him a lot of money, remember?
Remind Benny that I want it back by seven 'o clock tonight.
If it's not, I'll find him and cut his legs off.
Capeesh?
And from what I hear, his interest rates are interesting.
So, if we so much as hear your name, let alone see your face, we'll have a chat with Vic, put out a few feelers... and help him find you.
- You wouldn't.
- After what you just pulled, we would.
(Ash) Oh.
- What's this?
- It's a little farewell present.
Bye-bye, Benny.
(Aeroplane taking off)
(Ash) Oh, that was sweet.
(Mickey) What?
Well, that "better fixer, better man" thing.
Cheers for that.
Well, it's true.
You know, Ash, we couldn't do what we do without you.
Not just as a fixer, but as a friend.
You're always there for me, watching my back.
I appreciate that.
- Was that a bit OTT?
Sorry.
- Yeah, it was a bit, yeah.
Mind you, you've got to hand it to Benny.
It was a pretty tasty plan.
Yeah, it was.
I can't believe you fell for his phoney copper and the switched briefcase scam, though.
Twenty grand.
Ooh-hoo-hoo.
No, nor can I.
I think it's best we don't tell the others.
Nah, you're probably right.
Why's that, then?
We don't want to undermine their confidence.
No, absolutely not.
We can't have everyone thinking that the invincible Mickey Bricks is in fact a gullible plonker, can we?
- No.
We can't.
- No.
(Ash laughs, Mickey chuckles)
Know what your trouble is, Ash?
- Yeah, too much sex appeal.
- No, you're too trusting.
Rubbish.
I had my suspicions, right from the start.
Hey, admit it.
He had you - hook, line and sinker.
There's no shame in that.
He was good, I'll give him that.
- If it hadn't been for Eddie here...
- What?
- You saved his bacon, you know.
- Who, Ash's?
How?
All right, I grant you, he had me going for a couple of days.
What?
More like a week.
Well, you know, I just can't help seeing the best in people.
That's all right, at least you know you can always trust us, Ash.
- Isn't that right, Eddie?
- Oh, yeah, totally, yeah.
Well, about now our friend will be on his way to sunnier climes.
Gotcha!
- Oi!
Give it here!
- Winkle picker!
(All laughing)
Nice one!
Benjamin, or Benny, as I understand he was known, was not a regular parishioner and sadly I didn't know him personally.
But a sudden and unexpected loss like this is hard on all those left behind.
And we share in the great sadness felt by each and every one of you - his friends, family, and colleagues.
We now commit Benny's body to the flames - earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust - in the sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life.
Well, if Benny's made it through the pearly gates, there's hope for us all.
Why?
What was he like?
Ah, he was good old-fashioned rogue, was Benny.
- Could charm the birds from the trees.
- A roper, was he?
Worked mainly as a fixer but he could turn is hand to anything.
He was a complete natural.
He was amazingly intuitive.
He could spot a mark in the blink of an eye.
Yeah, you should have seen his card tricks.
Fastest hands I ever saw.
Look, I'll see you back at the ranch.
- Oi!
Where you going?
- I got a meeting at the bank.
Oh, he has had a winner.
Yeah.
Symphony Crest, 2:30 at Wincanton, 20 to 1, in Benny's honour.
Look, I'll tell you what, mate, I'll jump out here.
- Righto.
- There you go.
Cheers, mate.
Just been to a funeral, the walk might do me good.
Keep the change.
Oi!
Hold up!
Oh...
Ash.
Benny.
We just went to your funeral!
- It's complicated.
- Yeah.
Thought I saw him coming out of the bank, so I legged it.
- Who?
- Then I saw somebody chasing me.
Didn't realise it was you, thought I was a dead man.
Easy mistake to make, apparently.
Why the bloody hell were you chasing me?
Cos I've always wanted to see a ghost up close.
Look, Benny, for Christ's sake, calm down and have a drink.
Benny was an old-school grifter.
Back then all you had were your wits.
No mobile phones, no internet tricks or gadgets.
Yeah, the first person to say "Those were the days" gets the next round in.
You know, he almost wound up on this crew.
It was a toss-up between him and Ash.
- And you chose Ash?
- Mmm.
Oh.
He can't have been that smart.
Benny was smart all right.
He even saved Mickey's butt once.
- You?
From who?
- Cops.
Well, this I have got to hear.
It was a long time ago.
- No, ten years.
- Fifteen.
Whatever.
Benny and I were working a scam together and I got sloppy.
The mark turned out to be Old Bill.
I hadn't checked him out properly.
But Benny recognised him and at the last moment he switched the cases back.
So, what do we have here?
It's all there.
Count it if you want.
It cost me 20 grand, but if it wasn't for Benny I'd have done five years.
Nice doing business, mate.
Thank you.
And all this time, Mickey, we've been under the misapprehension that you're invincible.
Yeah, this Benny guy sounds like a right legend.
You gotta to hand it to him, the man had balls of steel.
I lost my mojo.
And when the self-doubt crept in, I knew I was in trouble.
I tried one last con.
A big one.
Came this close to selling a house that never existed.
Guess who to?
- I dunno, mate.
Paul Daniels?
- An Arab sheikh.
Mmm.
Royalty.
Nice.
It was a beaut, Ash, you would have loved it.
There are four identical streets in Bath, right.
All in a row.
So, I invented a fifth.
Had him on the hook for an eight-bedroom Regency villa, 3.5 million, reduced from four for a quick sale.
Bargain.
So what happened?
His lawyer was at university there, knew the place back to front.
Got out by the skin of my teeth.
By now I'm desperate so I start doing the spreads.
- Spread betting?
- I know.
I know, mug's game.
But if you do your homework...
Anyway, by this time, I'm totally skint.
Can't get any credit off the high-street bookies so I start dealing with this Iranian bloke, Danush.
Seems on the level, gives good prices, always pays up in cash.
Anyway, fast-forward to the World Cup, all I need is for Rooney and the boys to do what they do every Saturday afternoon and I'm sitting pretty on a dead-cert 25-grand win.
What you, cheering England?
Wish I'd seen that.
Nauseating, I know, but business is business.
Or so I thought.
Now, come the final whistle of that farcical Germany game the telly's out through the window and I'm sitting there with a 40-grand stain in my trousers.
- Nasty.
- Very.
No, no, no, but it gets worse.
Turns out this bloke Danush, whose nickname I now learn is "the Dentist"
on account of his favoured method of persuasion, has interest rates that make credit cards look like Save the bloody Children.
Cut to four weeks later and an unscheduled extraction right here, my 40-grand debt's spiralled to 100.
Says I can pay it back at 10 grand a month.
Yeah, right.
- So you faked your own death.
- What else could I do?
I dunno, get on a plane?
I can't afford a bus ticket, let alone a plane ticket.
What about the short con?
- I mean, you were the best at that.
- Oh, Ash, man, no.
I've lost it.
Big time.
You know, it's...
I dunno, it's like these are someone else's hands.
I can't even shuffle a deck of cards any more, let alone pick a pocket.
Calm down.
Yeah.
Are you, er...
Are you sitting down?
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
You look pretty damn perky for a stiff.
Death ain't all it's cracked up to be, trust me.
Well, you certainly had us fooled.
Yeah, yeah, we bought a wreath and everything.
- We even signed the book of condolence.
- I'm touched.
Officially now the shortest book in the world.
Why, what was the turnout like?
A wet, midweek friendly between Brentford and Burton Albion.
- Oh.
- Still, there's always next time, eh?
You don't have to do this.
No, no, I know we don't, but we're gonna anyway.
In our game we always take care of our own.
But this is your home and...
These two don't even know me.
No, we'll get you back on your feet in no time.
I've taken the liberty of running you a bath.
So, you can just dump your clothes in the bin, try those for size.
- Those are...
- Thanks.
All of you.
You've seriously saved my nuts.
Couple of days to get my head together, come up with a plan, I'll be out of here.
- Bathroom's that way.
- Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
So when you said you were collecting your winnings,
I was hoping you'd come back with a take-out and a bottle of fizz.
Instead you bring us a lodger.
Yeah, well, what was I supposed to do, leave him on the streets?
No, you did the right thing.
Benny's a complete wreck.
He wouldn't have lasted five minutes out there.
Especially with that nutter after him.
But with the best will in the world, we can't let him stay indefinitely.
No, we could give him some cash, buy him a plane ticket.
We mentioned Spain, wanted to end up in Marbella.
Hmm.
We could.
Or alternatively...
We could kill two birds with one stone.
That's what I call a view.
- You've done all right for yourselves.
- Yeah, it's not easy, though.
Not meant to be easy though, is it?
Wouldn't be worth doing if it was.
I dunno, sometimes I'd settle for easy.
No, no, no, no.
Easy means lazy.
Lazy means sloppy.
Sloppy means you get nicked.
Trust me.
Amen to that.
Listen, Benny, we've got a little plan we want to run past you.
- I'm all ears.
- This Danush character.
- Why don't we take him down?
- Are you serious?
Yeah, I mean, he's a nasty piece of work, he's greedy,
- and best of all, he's in the cash game.
- Haven't you been listening?
This isn't some sleazy businessman looking to turn an quick buck.
He plays by a whole different set of rules.
You don't want to mess with Danush.
Yeah, well, like I said, it was just a thought, you know.
Anyway, Benny, there's someone we'd like you to meet.
A companion for you when we're out and about.
Someone... intelligent.
Yeah.
Charming.
- Great sense of humour.
- And terrific legs.
Eddie, Benny.
Benny this is Eddie.
- You been strangling the cat again, Ed?
- Very funny.
Cos, actually, you're insulting the work of a genius.
- Why, who is it?
- Heathens, the lot of you.
Joe Oliver.
One of the greatest exponents of jazz that ever lived.
Er, Benny's confined to quarters for a while.
Thought you could baby-sit.
He's got to keep his head down.
Be my pleasure.
Be a bit of sophisticated company for a change.
That's a nice hoody that, mate, by the way.
- Don't worry, you'll be safe down here.
- Drinks all round, Ed.
- We're his only customers.
- I heard that.
D'you know what, Benny, they've got a point.
- Danush is ripe for the picking.
- Yeah, maybe.
But he's also smart and extremely dangerous.
There are easier marks.
None that we've got on the hook right now.
Anyway, like you said, it's not about easy.
Benny, you're in a bit of a hole right now and we want to help you out of it.
All right?
We'll cut you in on anything we make.
It may be enough to get you back on your feet.
Think of it as your Marbella fund.
All you have to do is help us out.
Guys, I appreciate you trying to help me, but I don't know.
Danush is seriously bad news.
Look, you need out of this town, fast.
You got any better ideas?
What would you need me to do?
Just give us the lowdown on Danush, help come up with a plan, and then leave the rest to us.
OK.
OK.
But don't say I didn't warn you.
- Good lad.
- OK, so what have you got?
- What, on Danush?
- Mmm.
There's not a lot.
You lot gonna order another drink, or are you just gonna sit here?
We're probably just gonna sit here actually, mate.
Oh, come on, Benny, you must remember something.
- He's Iranian.
- So you said.
Where does he operate from?
I don't know, he never said.
Where did you meet him?
Er...
At a boxing gym.
He does a workout every day.
Well, he's got to have an office somewhere or something.
Look, we weren't exactly drinking buddies, you know?
I'm sorry, but I don't know anything about him.
But you'd recognise him if you saw him, yeah?
Yeah, of course I would.
Why?
Maybe he's not going today.
You said he goes for an hour every morning.
I meant he goes regularly.
I don't know if he goes every single day.
- Could be a long wait, then.
- If he sees me, I'm so dead.
I've shown you the gym and told you what he looks like.
Can't you just drop me back at the bar?
This is West London, Benny.
He's Iranian, late '30s.
That doesn't narrow things down very much round here.
- Benny?
- It's him!
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.
Now, would you please get me out of here?
Yeah, you keep your head down, mate.
We'll have you back at the ranch in no time.
Aye, aye.
Yeah, you best keep your head down, Benny.
Why?
What's he doing now?
He's, er... helping an old lady with her shopping, but he is looking this way.
Ooh, he's fit.
What?
I just mean, he looks like he works out a lot.
- Didn't you say that, Benny?
- This is Danush.
We think his surname's Larijani, but he's likely to have lots of aliases.
This is where he's based - an industrial unit in Stanmore - but he meets a few of his punters, like Benny here, in the café at the Silver Street Boxing Gym after his morning workout.
And that's it?
Come on, Benny, Benny?
You must remember something else.
A face, a name, a little snippet of something.
Anything.
I'm sorry.
Right, OK, we'll have to get out there ourselves.
Use the usual contacts, someone must have heard of him.
Oh, Sean, Emma, we need access his laptop and his mobile phone, anything that'll get us the inside track.
This man is elusive, do whatever you need to.
You all off out, then?
Yeah, relax, Benny.
We'll be back before you know it.
No.
Haven't seen him.
Have you seen this geezer?
No?
All right, pal.
Cheers anyway.
Nothing?
OK.
- So, anything?
- No, not a sausage.
You?
Zip.
Nada.
Zero.
No one's heard of him.
No one we know, anyway.
Well, I said, he flies under the radar.
Let's hope Sean and Emma find something at the lockup.
Got 'em.
Don't let him leave.
- You've got till half-past.
Don't be late.
- Yeah.
Piece of cake.
Oh, hey, yeah, I just remembered something about Danush.
What's that?
- He's got a dog.
- Oh, yeah?
Good boy.
There.
Ash, yeah, it's me.
Listen, I've got the laptop but it's password protected.
- Can you bypass it?
- No, not from here.
- Start by trying the usual passwords.
- Which are?
The top five are the numbers one, two, three.
Then "password".
Then "letmein".
Then the numbers one to six.
- Then one to eight.
- No.
Listen, Ash, mate, to be honest, I'm kind of running out of time here.
- Partner's name.
- What?
- Birthdays.
- No idea.
What?
- Pet's name.
- I don't know.
- Pet!
What's the dog's name?
- Are you having a laugh?
- You knew about the dog?
- Has it got a collar?
No.
No collar, no.
Just read the name on the collar, Sean.
Listen, I'm not getting my bloody hand bitten off trying to get a name which I guarantee you will not be the password!
Good lad.
Let us know how you get on.
Ash?
Ash?
Yeah.
Bound to be the dog's name.
Seriously?
Tyson.
Tyson.
- Sorry, mate?
Have you lost your key?
- Yes.
Yeah, I just found one on the floor down there.
Thank you.
Er...
Before you go...
Sorry, excuse me.
It won't take long.
- What is it?
- The club's running a contest against a couple of the local gyms, and some of the trainers here wanted to know if you could fight.
Just forget it.
Well, the Olympic trials start in two weeks.
Olympic trials?
What are you talking about?
No, I'm just kidding.
It's not funny, all right?
I could have been mauled.
It's a dog's life, eh, Sean?
Yeah, if you're looking for sympathy, you're barking up the wrong tree.
- It's a dog eat dog world, kid.
- Very funny.
All right, all right.
The important thing is you got in there.
Ash, what have we got from his laptop?
Lots of admin, spreadsheets, betting forecasts, photos of women's privates, and loads of emails.
- Anything interesting?
- Well, it's all a bit vague, but it looks like our friend's got his finger in lots of pies.
Gambling, loan sharking, and, the key to his business, smuggled duty-free fags.
- His lockup was full of 'em.
- Ah, the sweet smell of cash.
But here's the best bit.
His regular supplier's been nicked at Dover with half a million quid's worth of cigarettes on board.
- So, what's he, the middle man?
- Exactly.
And the distributors he sells the fags on to are threatening to find another dealer if he can't get more product in, sharpish.
Good, good.
I think we've just found our way in.
You sure we're doing the right thing here, Mick?
What's bothering you?
Well, we've got a lot riding on the top of this.
If it backfires, it's not just the cash we're going to have to worry about.
We're in the risk business, Ash.
There's always more than cash at stake.
Yeah, but are we doing this for the right reason?
- Why are you doing it?
- Well, guilt, I suppose.
Guilt?
What for?
Bottom line, Mick -
Benny's a better all-round grifter than me.
Always has been.
There's nothing he can't do.
But, you chose me for this crew, not him.
Yeah, and I had my reasons.
There's nothing for you to feel guilty about.
Sometimes life boils down to a few little moments.
When you turned Benny down, that was one of his.
He's been on a downer ever since.
At the end of the day, we're each responsible for our own destiny.
- It's not your fault, or mine.
- Yeah, maybe.
- So why do you want to nail Danush?
- He's a worthy mark.
Oh, right, so it's nothing to do with repaying Benny for saving your skinny arse, then.
If we can take down a scumbag and get a six-figure sum in the process and help a fellow grifter, I call that a win-win.
Yeah, all right, but answer me this.
You take Benny out of the equation, would you still run a scam on Danush?
Yeah.
You?
Oh, I don't know.
Ask me when it's over.
How we doing?
Get you a drink?
No, you're all right, mate, thanks.
- So, you known them long?
- Oh, we go way back, yeah.
- You?
- Yeah, yeah, a few years, actually.
I'm sort of like the sixth member of the team, you know?
Well, you know, more like a silent partner really.
But I give them a few ideas and that.
- Oh, like the brains behind the gang.
- Yeah, that sort of thing, yeah.
Morning, Eddie.
Do us a coffee, would you?
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah, make that two.
- OK.
- Three, please.
Peppermint tea, please, Ed.
Yeah, I'll have a decaf skinny latte.
Cheers, Ed.
- Oh, and some of those almond biscuits.
- Yes, all right!
Sixty-two quid for ten packs.
Can you believe that?
Yeah, and fifty of that's tax.
- Fifty quid?
- Government duty, there's the racket.
Yeah, ever wonder why you never see cigarette brands on the side of lorries?
- Cargo's too valuable.
- Yeah, precisely.
A big lorry can hold about just under half a million packs of cigarettes.
That's 60,000 of these.
Which makes just over three million pounds.
And if you can get a lorryload of duty-free packs in, well, you're talking huge margins.
Yeah, but without a supplier, Danush is out of the game.
Which is where we come in.
What's your German accent like?
Oh, it's not so convincing, I sink.
- OK.
Dutch?
- Shpeak it like a native.
Dutch it is, then.
First, we'll need a lockup near Danush.
Emma, that's yourjob.
Excuse me?
Hello there.
You really can't take any chances with asbestos.
Should get the initial results back in the next couple of weeks, but in the meantime we're going to need the car out.
She's a beauty though.
Sean and I will play street dealers selling smuggled packs of cigarettes out of our lockup.
So, lose the designer wardrobe, Sean.
We work for Albert, who's a big shot from New York looking to set himself up in London.
That way Danush won't question why he's never heard of him.
I'll bump into Danush, I'll flash the product and make sure he witnesses a delivery of cigarettes from our dodgy Dutch truck driver.
Now if we can pull all of this off convincingly,
Danush will come to us, he'll want an introduction to Albert, and a way in with Ash.
Hello, hello.
Anybody at 'ome?
Hey.
- Oh, my, that's a big'un, innit?
- What do you want?
I'm just doing the rounds, bruv, introducing myself to the neighbours and that.
Saying hello.
Hey, listen, do you smoke?
No.
Maybe your wife, your girlfriend?
All right, G, all right.
I can see you're a busy man and I'm holding you up, yeah?
Laters.
Hey, yo!
I've got the boss on the phone!
- Here.
- Thanks, mate.
Hello.
- All right, mate.
How you doing?
- Hi, you all right?
- Have you got an HGV licence?
- Yeah.
- A real one?
- No.
What's the biggest thing you've driven, Ash?
I dunno.
Seven-and-a-half tonner, probably.
Well, this thing can carry 44 tons.
One wrong move and you'll flatten buildings.
Really?
Well, well, well.
To be honest with you, Benny,
I'm getting a bit fed up with them always playing tricks on me.
What kind of tricks?
You know, coin tricks, card tricks, that sort of thing.
Anything to get out of paying for their tab.
It's costing me a fortune.
So...
I've been practising a few tricks of me own.
- Oh, yeah?
- Time to turn the tables.
- Mind if I use you as my guinea pig?
- No, sure, sure.
I think I've got it pretty much sussed, like, but you can't practise too much, can you?
You're right enough there, Eddie.
No, no, no, no, hide the king in your right hand.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, got it, yeah, all right...
That's right and now you... you flash the final card off the top of the deck, like that.
Voilà!
What do you reckon?
Well...
Let's try it again, eh?
Hang on a minute, it's here somewhere.
Erm...
- That's your card.
- No.
Oh.
Erm, that one?
No, it's not.
- You sure?
- Hundred per cent.
Here, give them to me.
- There it is.
- Oh, right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Give them here, I'll try it again.
The other one I've been perfecting is where you steal someone's watch without them noticing.
Now, just a minute.
Oi!
Are you gonna spend all day in front of that mirror?
What do you reckon?
Honestly?
Honestly.
It's a definite improvement.
Cheers.
Look sharp, we've got an audience.
Do you know how much it's costing to rent this set of fancy wheels for an hour?
Go on, how much?
Five whole minutes of sweet-talking, that's how much.
- I'm telling you, Mick, it's a waste of time.
- Be patient.
He probably hasn't even noticed us yet.
- Everything comes to he who waits.
- Yeah?
Well, 50 quid says nothing happens till we make it happen.
- Fifty quid?
- Fifty quid.
Make it a hundred.
- What?
- Yeah, if you're so sure.
Let's make it a hundred.
All right, a hundred it is.
Why are you selling these on my turf?
All right there, geez.
You changed your mind, then?
You continue to sell these anywhere between here and Kensal Green and I will break your arms, then I will break your legs, then I break your head.
Do you understand?
All right, bruv, take it easy.
I'm just doing a job.
You get me?
- Do you understand?
- Yes, absolutely.
But just chill, all right?
Now obviously you've got a beef, yeah?
So, look, I'll call my boss.
We'll get things sorted out nice and proper.
It'll be sweet, man.
Yeah, yeah, it's me.
Sorry to bother you.
Mr Dent, there's someone I think you need to meet.
Turf wars are so 20th century, don't you think?
They're one of the many reasons that I left New York.
Where I come from, Mr Dent, it shows disrespect to move into the territory of another businessman.
In my country, they cut off your hand for such things.
Well, I'm sure we can resolve this problem in a more amicable way.
Sure.
All you have to do is stop selling in my territory.
Well, the truth is, Mr Larijani, that there are plenty of distributors in your patch begging me to supply them.
Either they don't know about you or you don't know about them, but they're out there.
I mean, they're right on your doorstep.
I have temporary problems with my supplier.
But that does not excuse you to muscle in and try to take over.
Look, there are one million smokers in London, and they smoke over eighty million cigarettes every week.
So, finding customers is not the problem, Mr Larijani.
To supply them, as you know, is the problem.
Maybe I can help.
So, Danush thinks we're going to sell him smuggled duty-free fags.
But we don't wanna do that.
Oh, no.
See, what we're going to give him is...
Bundles of newspaper, courtesy of Big Dave down the corner shop.
Good lad.
But our friend, the Dentist, who we know has paranoid tendencies, is going to wanna check that he's not being ripped off, which of course he is.
Now, it would take hours to check every single box, so he'll only check some of them.
So, how do we know where to place the real cartons?
We don't.
But I've found us a behavioural scientist who does.
- A what?
- A behavioural scientist, the systematic analysis of human behaviour.
Basically a grifter, but with letters after his name.
How's he gonna help?
Well, if we know which boxes our Iranian friend's gonna check, we know where to stick the real cartons.
So we just steer him in the right direction.
- Exactly.
Bit of coercive persuasion.
- You're gonna hypnotise him.
No, not exactly.
Here, I'll show you.
Here you go, Sean, pick one of them.
- Eh?
- Go on, choose one.
Good lad.
Turn it over, read what it says.
"Sean will pick the pyramid."
- It's the same one I would have picked.
- Very nice.
- What's the trick?
- Bit of suggestion, that's all.
What we're going to give him is...
For Danush, we'll use a similar technique but with a symbol on the box we want him to choose, linked to visual cues we'll have planted which he'll see en route to the meet.
Little job for you, Sean.
There you go.
And verbal cues we'll use when we're there.
A little word we'll drop into the conversation every few minutes.
How confident are you this is going to work?
- The prof reckons 95 per cent.
- Let's hope he's right.
How many boxes will there be in total?
I told him we had a consignment of 10,000 cartons of 200.
He said he'd take half and expects us to buy the other half.
Yeah, 10,000 of these is 20 of those.
How is the money going to work?
Ash is the supplier, so you'll give your money to him and Danush will follow.
- Phoney cash, yeah?
- What you think, Benny?
You've met him.
Do you want to risk that?
No.
- No, er, it'd better be real cash.
- How much?
Hundred and twenty-five grand.
Do we have that much?
Yeah, yeah.
I know you don't rent fridges, Charlie, but you can make an exception for me.
Yeah, a tenner a day each, and I'll have them back to you by the weekend.
Oh, and I need them still in their boxes, yeah?
Good lad.
I'm wasted.
Obviously.
OK, pack the rest with newspaper, Sean.
Mr Larijani.
Charlie Dent.
Yeah, I just wanted to confirm that our Dutch friend will be making the delivery tomorrow, as we discussed.
There'll be 5,000 cartons,
£125,000.
Plus a 10 per cent fee.
Non-negotiable.
Huh?
Right.
Excellent.
- You all right?
- No.
I'm not all right.
We shouldn't be messing with Danush.
If this goes tits up, it'll all be my fault.
It's a good plan, Benny.
It'll be fine.
Let's hope you're right, for all our sakes.
OK, everyone, Eddie's lined up a quick breakfast.
We'll go through the plan one last time and then we're on.
- You coming?
- No, no, no, you guys crack on.
- I'm too nervous to eat.
- Benny, are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Right, we'll see you later.
Hey, guys.
Good luck, eh?
Then as soon as I dump the lorry, I'll bring the cash straight back here.
And there's nothing we've overlooked?
We've covered all the angles?
Left nothing to chance?
- No, I think we're there, Mick.
- All right, then.
- There you go.
- Good lad.
And now, ladies and gentleman, live from Eddie's Bar,
I give you the great Eddini himself.
- Have you slipped him something?
- Now, I'll need a volunteer.
- Er, Eddie...
- No, Ash.
You, sir.
You, sir.
Pick a card, any card.
Guarantee I'll find it.
- Double or quits on your tab.
- Oh, get him, eh?
Eddie, look, we're in the middle of something here.
Oh, I see, I see.
Running scared, are we?
Yeah, yeah, we're quaking, Ed, yeah.
- Right, I'll see you there.
- We'll be one minute behind you.
Yeah, don't let him think we've arrived together.
- Mr Dent.
- Impeccable timing, Mr Larijani.
Let's get down to business, shall we?
Sure, the clock's ticking, ja?
So, er...
So who's getting what?
It's 5,000 for Mr Larijani here and another 5,000 for us, man.
Cool, that's easy, that's ten boxes each.
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna check inside?
No, no, I trust you this time.
Well, what about you?
Well, take your time, man.
This one at the top.
That one there?
What we're gonna give him is...
Bundles of newspaper, courtesy of Big Dave down the corner shop.
- The clock's ticking.
- No, no, I trust you this time.
Well, take your time, man.
No, this one in the middle.
Good.
- So, now let's see the money.
- A hundred and twenty-five grand.
Looks good, ja?
Mr Dent, it's all there.
Hands up!
Nobody move!
Right, you lot try anything and you're all dead!
Stay where you are, boy!
Stay there!
Stay where you are!
Go, go, go, go!
What was that?
What the hell was that?
- You tell me, all right?
- You set me up.
Who you pointing at, man?
How do we know it wasn't you?
I'm going after them.
It's me.
Bloody hell, that was quick.
How did it go?
Like bloody clockwork, man.
Get in.
Good luck, eh?
Yeah.
Bunch of bloody half-wits.
I spent years trying to come up with a plan they'd fall for.
Then a few months ago I read about this undertaker who'd organised a fake funeral.
And bingo, I knew I had it.
Ash Morgan, fixer.
Or so he says.
He's the back-stabbing bastard that nicked my place on Mickey's team.
He's spent years sharing the glory and the money, when everybody knows I'm the better grifter.
Well, now it's payback time.
This is the great Mickey Bricks, king of the con men, or so he'd have you believe.
Well, the king is dead, Mickey.
Long live the king.
So, what's the plan, boss?
I'm going to play to their massive egos.
Let them think they're coming up with the plan when all the time I'll be in the background, controlling everything.
Nice.
The tougher we make this for them, the less they'll suspect they're being had.
Oh, come on, Benny, you must remember something else.
A face, a name, a little snippet of something.
Sorry, I...
You'll need an office.
Hi, I'm interested in renting a small industrial unit.
OK, Lloyd, right now.
Now you.
Your name is...
Danush Larijani.
Mess with me and I will pull your teeth out.
We'll need a dog.
Something nasty.
Me aunty's got a Rottweiler - Benji, soft bugger, but he looks the part.
Perfect.
Borrow it for the week.
There are some emails on there that'll steer them in the right direction.
They'll break into the office, so put it in a desk drawer.
Make sure it's password protected.
Name of the dog'll do.
Not Benji.
Tyson.
Get a tag sorted.
How the bloody hell are they gonna figure that out?
Trust me, they will.
Benny sent us.
We'll need some cash for the exchange.
Get it from Vic.
Vic the Mick, you're joking.
It's fine.
We'll only need it for a few hours.
- So, how's Benny?
- Aye, he's good.
A hundred and thirty-seven grand.
Do you wanna count it?
No, you're all right.
Remind Benny that I want it back by seven o'clock tonight.
Plus my five-grand fee.
If it's not, I'll find him and cut his legs off.
Capeesh?
What I wouldn't give to see their little faces right now, beaten, broke, and humiliated.
I've been dreaming of this moment for years.
Oh, boy, this is sweet.
Ash Morgan and Mickey Stone, you are the weakest link.
Goodbye!
You having a laugh?
- Can't be.
- Where's the bloody money?
This isn't possible.
I saw that cash with me own eyes!
Well, where is it, then?
It's those bloody muppets you've hired!
They've double-crossed you!
What?
Where the bloody hell are you?
- Where the hell are you?
It's ten past five.
- What?
I don't understand.
How the hell did they find out?
Well, the days of fleecing Eddie are over.
- Benny's shown me a few moves.
- Well, that sounds expensive.
Trust me, it will be.
Man's a genius.
He can do things with a deck of cards like you wouldn't believe.
He's got the fastest hands I've ever seen.
Here, give me the bloody cards, Eddie.
It's like these are someone else's hands.
I can't even shuffle a deck of cards any more, let alone pick a pocket.
Houston, we have a problem.
So he's remembered how to shuffle a deck of cards.
That doesn't mean anything.
And Benny didn't come up with the plan, we did.
Look, we're just covering ourselves.
OK?
We won't actually do anything until we're sure that Benny is up to something.
Ash, what you got?
This is identical to Benny's.
Every time he makes or receives a call, it'll ring my phone, and I'll hear both sides of the conversation.
Get back to the penthouse and swap that for his.
Ash, if you're wrong about this, it's gonna blow the whole con.
- I'm not.
Trust me, all right?
- We've got less than six hours before this exchange goes down.
Say Benny is doing the dirty, and we somehow manage to find out his plan, what then?
Then we do what we do best.
Sean?
- That was quick.
- Yeah, Ash wants us to load
- a couple of extra boxes just in case.
- Ah.
Hey, here you go, let me help you with that.
Oh, thanks.
Thank you.
This isn't going to work.
Yeah, well, if you've got a better idea, I'm all ears.
Ash, the deal goes down at five.
That leaves us four hours and 52 minutes and counting.
To find out his plan, assuming he has one, that is, and then turn the tables on him.
If there's a chance we're being conned, shouldn't we just walk away?
Yeah, it's me.
You all set?
Aye, just off to Vic's to pick up the cash.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Are you all right?
I said sorry!
Is Vic there?
Benny sent us.
You arrive at exactly ten past five, not a second earlier.
Balaclavas on.
You take the two briefcases and you dump them in the green bin at the end of the dirt road.
Right, I'll see you there.
Looks good, ja?
OK, Mr Dent, it's all there.
Hands up!
Nobody move!
Stay where you are, boy!
Stay there!
Stay where you are!
Go, go, go, go!
- What the hell was that?
- You tell me, all right?
You set me up!
Who you pointing at, man?
How do we know it wasn't you?
I'm going after them.
I'll kill them!
Lloyd, we've got to pack up and get out of here,
Vic'll come looking for us in less than two hours.
Not me, man.
You're on your own.
Sorry.
Lloyd!
You not staying for the party, Lloyd?
Apparently not.
Can you believe it, Mick?
He's gone and found himself some new digs without so much as a thank you.
Benny, Benny, Benny.
Where are your manners?
Oh, here we go.
- Come to gloat, have you?
- Us, gloat?
Never.
Think you're so bloody clever, don't you?
- Well, you're not.
- Really?
So how come we've got the cash and you've got the Sunday papers?
You really thought you owed me one, didn't you, Mickey?
Yeah, I did.
You kept me out of jail.
And when I try to return the favour, you try to double-cross us.
You idiot.
I didn't keep you out of jail.
I conned you all those years ago.
- You were the mark.
- Excuse me?
That wasn't a real copper.
It was my old mate, Les.
So, thanks for the 20 grand, Mickey.
My pleasure.
And thank you for the 137 grand.
As for you, I'm a better grifter than you are any day of the week.
- Oh, ouch.
- You're wrong, Benny.
You're a jack of all trades and not a team player.
That's why I chose Ash and not you.
He's not only a better grifter, he's a better man.
You think what you like, but trust me - this ain't over.
I play the long game, and one day I'll have you.
Every con you ever pull from now on, you'll be looking over your shoulder, wondering if it's me that's pulling the strings, and guess what?
One day it will be and I'll bring you both down.
Oh, I doubt that, Benny.
Haven't you heard?
What goes around, comes around.
Especially in our game.
That little yarn you spun us about you being a dead man if Danush ever caught up with you?
Well, it's come to pass.
Only this time it's Vic the Mick.
And it's for real.
You owe him a lot of money, remember?
Remind Benny that I want it back by seven 'o clock tonight.
If it's not, I'll find him and cut his legs off.
Capeesh?
And from what I hear, his interest rates are interesting.
So, if we so much as hear your name, let alone see your face, we'll have a chat with Vic, put out a few feelers... and help him find you.
- You wouldn't.
- After what you just pulled, we would.
Oh.
- What's this?
- It's a little farewell present.
Bye-bye, Benny.
Oh, that was sweet.
What?
Well, that "better fixer, better man" thing.
Cheers for that.
Well, it's true.
You know, Ash, we couldn't do what we do without you.
Not just as a fixer, but as a friend.
You're always there for me, watching my back.
I appreciate that.
- Was that a bit OTT?
Sorry.
- Yeah, it was a bit, yeah.
Mind you, you've got to hand it to Benny.
It was a pretty tasty plan.
Yeah, it was.
I can't believe you fell for his phoney copper and the switched briefcase scam, though.
Twenty grand.
Ooh-hoo-hoo.
No, nor can I.
I think it's best we don't tell the others.
Nah, you're probably right.
Why's that, then?
We don't want to undermine their confidence.
No, absolutely not.
We can't have everyone thinking that the invincible Mickey Bricks is in fact a gullible plonker, can we?
- No.
We can't.
- No.
Know what your trouble is, Ash?
- Yeah, too much sex appeal.
- No, you're too trusting.
Rubbish.
I had my suspicions, right from the start.
Hey, admit it.
He had you - hook, line and sinker.
There's no shame in that.
He was good, I'll give him that.
- If it hadn't been for Eddie here...
- What?
- You saved his bacon, you know.
- Who, Ash's?
How?
All right, I grant you, he had me going for a couple of days.
What?
More like a week.
Well, you know, I just can't help seeing the best in people.
That's all right, at least you know you can always trust us, Ash.
- Isn't that right, Eddie?
- Oh, yeah, totally, yeah.
Well, about now our friend will be on his way to sunnier climes.
Gotcha!
- Oi!
Give it here!
- Winkle picker!
Nice one!
Terra Nova H.Q., this is Foster.
Terra Nova command, copy that.
I just pulled up at communications relay station 19-A.
- Copy that.
Commence repair.
- Roger that.
Terra Nova Command out.
Smithson, is that you?
You sleeping off another bender in there, or did you lock yourself in again?
Smithson, wake up.
Smithson?
Yeah, it looks pretty straightforward what happened here to me.
Foster made the mistake of leaving the shed door open while he was working.
Must have snuck up behind him.
Never saw it coming.
What did it to him?
Nykoraptor.
The bite Marks on his torso were a dead giveaway.
They've got three rows of incisors.
Nykos are vicious.
Basically two-legged sharks.
Easy with him.
Do they hunt around here?
No, no, not usually.
But these Ankylosaur nests...
Their eggs are easy prey.
With easy prey nearby, why'd the Nyko go after a human?
You got an endless supply of chicken...
Doesn't mean you're going to turn your nose up at a bloody rare steak.
Good morning, Josh.
I need to talk to you for a sec about our arrangement.
There's been a complication.
It's about your girl.
Kara?
We had a deal.
You told me you could get her here on one of the next pilgrimages.
Like I said, there's been a complication.
Now if you want me to get her here, you're going to have to do something.
I'm listening.
You might want a shot of courage first.
Hey.
- Hi.
- Good morning.
What brings you to my end of the compound?
Oh, well, Jim asked me to autopsy this soldier that was killed.
See if anything out of the ordinary turned up.
- I won't distract you.
- Okay.
Amazing.
Just amazing.
Ankylosaurus.
Where'd you get it?
In a nest near the scene of the accident.
Oh, wow, looks pretty damaged.
The others had hatched.
This one, unfortunately, didn't make it.
But it is an incredible research opportunity.
I'd say so.
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.
Hey, Zoe.
Why aren't you at school?
Well, her teacher sent for me.
Somebody has an earache.
Oh.
And yesterday it was your tummy, wasn't it?
I just miss you, mommy.
I know you do, sweetheart, but school is really important.
Look, I need to just have a quick word with daddy.
So why don't you go and take a look at some of that cool stuff over there.
Just be careful not to touch anything, all right?
Go on.
The autopsy turn up anything?
Yeah, I was just in the middle of something when you came in.
Great.
So I found two types of blood on Foster's torso.
One was his.
And the second's probably from the Nyko.
Yes, that's what I was thinking.
Hmm, it says the second type of blood came from one of those.
I don't understand.
I think I do.
Malcolm.
What's a Nykoraptor's favorite food?
You're looking at it.
It's a Galesaur.
Sort of a prehistoric Turkey.
Why?
I think this was a murder.
Help me out here.
How do you kill a man with a dinosaur?
You trap it somewhere where you know the victim's going to show up.
All you need is the right bait and knowledge of your Vic's schedule.
We found blood from the bait that was used to lure the Nyko inside the shed.
And the back of that door was covered in scratches from when it was trying to get out.
We've lost our share of folks, but never like this.
Not to murder.
Foster was a good soldier.
If somebody killed him, I want to know who.
Find out.
Do it quick and do it quiet.
Wash, you're on this with him.
First thing, we should talk to his friends.
A day like today, I think I know where they'll be.
- Boys.
- Lieutenant.
Hi, Mr. Shannon.
Hey.
Sorry about Foster.
And I'm sorry to interrupt you guys.
I know this isn't a good time, but I've got a few questions I need to ask if that's okay?
Sure.
Did Foster get along with everyone in your unit?
Uh, pretty much.
Why?
Can you think of anyone who would have wanted to harm him?
Hold on, you're investigating this as a murder or something?
I don't believe this.
You know, Foster was seeing a woman.
- Yeah?
What's her name?
- I don't know.
None of us do.
He never told us who she is.
Yeah, but he was always up in his bunk looking at pictures of her on his tag.
I thought they only held personal info and blood type.
Yeah, plus a medical history and a locator.
You're not supposed to, but everyone hacks in and throws a couple of pictures of loved ones on there.
Maybe some music for when you're holed up someplace or on a long patrol.
Well, thanks, gentlemen,
- and again, sorry for your loss.
- Yeah.
You find it odd that this mystery woman hasn't stepped forward?
Now you're getting the hang of this.
So let's go take a look at Foster's tag.
Foster's personal effects...
Can we, uh, can we see them?
Well, yeah.
Could you get me the deceased's - personal effects, please?
- Right away.
Thanks.
What's going on?
Well, Foster had a dog tag...
Be careful!
Be, be very careful with that.
Gently, sweetheart.
Sorry.
It's broken.
Are you trying to fix it?
The baby wants to come out.
- My God, it's still alive!
- It's unbelievable.
You're going to help it, right?
Um...
Yeah, of course we are, sweetheart, yeah.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
OK.
Foster's personal effects.
Terra's, a flashlight.
But the tag wasn't recovered.
You said it has a locator.
- It's on the move.
- Yeah.
A Nyko must have eaten it.
Then we're going to have to go get that Nyko.
Shannon, you copy?
Copy.
You two have eyes on the Nyko?
Negative, sir.
We lost it.
Stand by.
Contact!
Eyes on target, 9:00!
20 meters!
Good.
Flank him to the right.
Swing him back towards me.
Coming your way.
All right, up ahead is the choke point.
It dead-ends in dense forest.
Force it into the shooting gallery.
We got you now.
Anybody got a visual?
No joy, sir.
All right, just so we're clear...
We're not killing this thing, right?
No need.
Whatever we get out of its belly, we're going to obtain on site.
Lieutenant Washington there is about the finest combat medic
I've ever had the pleasure to be stitched up by, isn't that right, lieutenant?
If you say so, sir.
How many stitches you put in my side that time?
- 67, sir.
- Yeah.
Where'd it go?
How long can he stay up there?
You got somewhere you need to be, lieutenant?
I'd love not to be here when the sun sets.
How long can he stay up there?
- We got him.
- Open him up.
This was the bait.
Ugh.
And, uh, this is what else he ate when he was in the shed.
And here's what we came for.
Foster's tag.
It's pretty banged up.
There he is, and he's with a woman, but I don't think I know her.
We can run a facial rec against our database.
Damn it to hell.
It's okay, sir.
I recognize her.
She works at the mess hall.
Yeah, I know Foster.
I know you, too.
Working in the mess, I meet my share of soldiers.
Well, his friends seem to think it was, um... more than that.
I was nice to him.
Support staff, it's our job to be nice.
I'm sorry if he took it the wrong way.
Look at this.
Terra Nova lottery notification.
How long you guys been married?
Three years.
And was the wedding before or after he... got this?
So what happened?
You loved him until he got you through the portal, then you traded up for another man?
I mean, I'm just spitballing here.
I'm a married woman.
You can't just come in here and make accusations.
Honey?
Afternoon, Mr. Milner.
I'm Jim Shannon from security.
This is lieutenant Washington.
Why are you here?
It's about the soldier who died, Ken Foster.
It's nothing, Howard.
They're just asking some questions.
Yeah.
Are you okay, Mr. Milner?
You-you seem upset.
I'm fine.
'Cause your wife knew this man Foster from the mess hall.
Of course I do;
I serve these guys every day.
Look, I told them this already.
I don't know what the hell they're still doing here.
Shut up.
Just shut up.
Do you think I didn't know?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Well, you're here, right?
You're gonna find out sooner or later.
I killed that son of a bitch Foster.
And given the chance, I'd kill him again.
Hey.
I just dropped Zoe back at school.
All she could talk about was this egg.
Please give me some good news.
Well, I wish I could.
It looks like the reason it didn't hatch with the others is that it has birth defects.
- You see this dark patch here?
- Yeah.
Its front right leg is fused to its neck, which has compromised its windpipe and its blood flow.
And if it were to hatch now, it wouldn't get nearly enough oxygen.
Wouldn't survive three minutes.
The mother must've had to abandon it
- to care for the other hatchlings.
- Yes.
And I'm afraid we have to abandon it, too.
Oh, no, that's not gonna work for me.
You saw the look on her face.
No, there must be something we can do to help it along.
I don't know yet.
Um... in Ovo surgery through the shell if we have to.
There's gotta be something.
When did you find out that your wife was having an affair?
I just did;
Who cares when?
I do.
The shed...
How'd you get it open?
Anything with a circuit board can be hacked.
But how'd you know his shifts?
That he'd be the one to get the call?
Well, I tailed him for a week.
That night I went out and broke the piece of equipment that caused the repair beacon to sound.
I tied up some bait inside the shed.
Then I waited in the rover until the Nykoraptor came.
When it went after the bait, I closed the door behind it, and then I drove away.
Very elaborate.
I mean, you must, you must really love this woman.
With all my heart.
You can't imagine what is like winning the lottery.
Maybe you both had love in your lives, maybe not.
But I haven't.
And then all of a sudden there was a flood of it.
And the best thing to come along was Rebecca.
And it was perfect.
You know, coming back to a world like this...
How could she not love me for bringing her here?
How could I have been so stupid?
Why didn't I see that she was using me?
But you know what the stupidest thing of all was?
Thinking that it could actually be different for me this time.
You were right.
It was murder.
Lieutenant Washington knows
I expect my people to adhere to a strict code of honor.
For one of them to get involved with a married Terra Novan, well...
That's not just frowned upon,
I won't tolerate it.
But Foster didn't deserve to die for it.
Shannon, have you been out to memorial field?
Not yet.
It's beyond the fields before those low hills.
Simple headstones buried in the Earth.
We have sustained losses...
Fallen soldiers, accidents, citizens who succumbed to syncillic fever.
But we've never had a murder in Terra Nova.
Unless I commute Milner's sentence to imprisonment, the bylaw says banishment.
- Out there?
- Out there.
I'm going to go bury our soldier.
And I'm going to make a decision.
I don't recall ever having to make a tougher one.
So Boylan said if I want to get Kara here,
I have to meet with someone.
- It's outside the gates.
- Why can't you just meet at the bar?
It's Mira.
Leader of the Sixers, Mira?
Is there another one?
'Cause if there is, it'd be pretty awesome if I just misunderstood this whole thing.
You can't go.
There's no telling what she might be up to.
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do.
Look, I know you promised Kara, but it's not worth getting yourself killed.
You have no idea what 2149 is like.
I had three friends junior year that killed themselves.
Nobody believes they have a future.
Nobody believes in anything anymore.
Nothing means anything.
I have to get her out of there.
Okay.
But you're not going alone.
It was quite moving today.
Sad.
The procession.
Everyone in the streets.
Can you imagine that back in Chicago?
No.
Honestly, it felt like something from another time we've only ever read about.
So what do you think will happen tomorrow?
I don't know, but the good news is, there's not gonna be a drawn-out trial.
You don't think he deserves one?
He confessed.
There's something to be said for swift justice.
But, Jim, come on, this is wrong.
It's frontier justice;
You know that.
You say that like it's a bad thing, like I should miss the system we left behind.
You remember the crap I dealt with.
Everything moved iceberg slow, and I'd work a good case for months only to have someone buy the verdict out from under me.
Yeah, I know, I know that was bad, but I fail to see how it's worse than barbaric decisions being made by one man alone.
- Barbaric?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Don't forget Milner's a confessed killer.
What do you think we should do with him?
Confine him.
Put him on trial.
And if he's guilty, then put him in prison, but try to show some mercy.
I was just in prison.
And "mercy" is not the first word that comes to mind when I think back on my time.
Maybe we should talk about this later.
If someone had given me the choice between an eight-by- eight in goladand and a chance in the wild with a gun in my hand, I know which one I would've picked.
Okay, I didn't think before I spoke, all right?
I didn't mean it that way.
Maybe...
I'm trying to take this back!
What do you want from me, Liz?
I mean, I got a confession.
You're acting like I beat it out of the guy.
Jim...
I'm sorry.
Like no one's ever had reason to falsely confess?
Hey.
I'm sorry about Foster.
Thanks.
Let's hope the guy that did this gets banished like he deserves.
Sorry, I, uh...
I know it sounds harsh.
No.
Look, I know you want justice for your friend, but whatever happens, it's a really sad day for the colony.
I mean, this place is supposed to be a new beginning.
And I guess I shouldn't be surprised that some of the old problems followed us here.
Howard Milner, you've confessed to the murder of Ken Foster.
Do you have anything else to say for yourself?
Ours is a colony of laws.
A violation such as murder is a crime against every one of us.
Terra Nova cannot survive unless we hold ourselves... hold each other...
To standards higher than our standards of the past.
With a heavy heart...
I carry out this judgment of banishment.
Taylor!
You know this is a death sentence.
Isn't there another way?
The only way is forward, for the good of the colony.
What we're building here...
There's no place for a crime like this.
Just as we've come back to remake this world, we have to let this world remake us.
If we can't dare to live lives that are worthy of this remarkable place, well, we should have just stayed in the future to perish with the planet.
Milner, you have a fighting chance out there.
That's more than you gave Ken Foster.
Don't ever come back to the colony.
You've made your own fate.
Now live or die with it.
- What are you doing here?
- Take it easy.
Just put the weapon down.
So.
How you doing out here so far?
I would be scared out of my mind.
I mean, between the wildlife and the Sixers, there's a lot of ways to die in this jungle.
Well, I...
I deserve what I get.
I gotta admit,
I was surprised when Taylor went through with the sentence.
Seemed like a lot of people were.
What about you?
Were you...
Were you surprised?
We have a law.
He followed it, so...
No.
Not sure I believe you, Howard.
I think you were surprised.
I think you were betting on Taylor commuting the sentence.
I mean, it would have been a lot easier to be the hero in a colony jail than it is out here.
The hero?
What are you talking about?
Well, I saw the way you and Rebecca were looking at each other back there, and it got me thinking.
I mean, what if she killed Foster?
I know you're crazy about her.
The question is, are you crazy enough to fall on your sword for her when it means facing this jungle alone?
What do you want?
Howard!
I'm sorry.
I couldn't go through with it.
Go through with what?
I know Foster broke things off with you a couple of weeks ago.
So, isn't that why you did it?
Did what?
Hang on, what... you...
You think I killed him?
What...?
So, you didn't?
Of course not!
Is that why you confessed?
Well, I...
I didn't want you sent out there to die alone.
So, Howard, when you confessed to me, how did you know what to say?
I'd heard the details of the crime flying around the colony.
Whoever killed Foster clearly had a reason to spread them.
But Rebecca...
Foster did end it with you, right?
To be honest, I was happy that he did.
I'm better off without him.
Why is that?
He turned out to be a jerk.
He chose his friends, and his drinking, and his gambling over me.
Gambling?
It was all he cared about.
He was always over at Boylan's playing cards.
There's quite a scene over there.
But it's illegal, so people stay pretty quiet about it.
Just what exactly were you thinking, Shannon?
Look, you told me to do my job, and I did.
Milner recanted his confession.
Well, how do you know he didn't just take it back 'cause he got scared to death out there?
My gut's telling me.
Oh.
Oh, well, why didn't you say so?
Commander, let me explain.
No, you let me explain.
Banishing Milner,
I put a huge chunk of my reputation on the line.
You saw as well as I did, not everybody was overjoyed with my decision to stick to the letter of the law on this, and now you tell me that I got the wrong guy?
But he's alive.
And I got a new lead.
So if we keep the Milner return under wraps just long enough for me to follow it...
You do exactly that.
'Cause your gut's not good enough on this.
You follow that new lead.
Otherwise, I guarantee you I am bouncing Milner's ass right back outside that gate.
Rotate ten degrees.
Stop.
There we go.
Almost there.
Amazing.
Shame Jim couldn't be here to see you work your magic.
Well, surgery's not really a spectator sport.
Well, with you holding the knife, it should be.
You're very sweet, but...
I'm sure Jim has many more important things to do today than watch me attempt to alter nature's course.
Okay.
Uh...
Foster's financials.
I've got them right here.
Looks like Rebecca was right about what goes on at Boylan's.
That is interesting.
Look who owed Foster a lot of money.
Okay.
Let's take it to Taylor.
He's going to want a real confession this time.
Yeah.
And I know how to get it.
Mr. sheriff!
Welcome back.
And Commander Taylor.
Now, what a pleasure.
You never darken my door.
- Josh?
- Hi, dad.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
We're very impressed with your boy.
Josh has already proven himself a very worthy member of the team.
We'll talk about that, you bet your ass, but first things first.
Boylan, I been looking forward to saying this for a long time.
We're taking you in.
- Yes sir.
- What are you doing?
- On your feet.
- Come on.
You nuts?
You have never made a bigger mistake in your life, Taylor.
Okay, get up!
Let's go!
Walk with me!
- The long and the short of-
You're going to come clean about gambling at your place, or I might have to shut you down.
Oh, Commander.
Your loyal subjects would just love that.
I created the one place in Terra Nova that operates just outside your grip.
Close my shop, and see how people respond when you take that away.
You run card games.
And we know you take a cut.
Are there card games that take place under my roof?
Yeah.
Do I take a small percentage off the top?
Well...
Define small.
Now, is that unreasonable?
No.
No, it is not.
Foster played at your shop, didn't he?
Yeah.
So?
Well, you don't think I killed him.
- Did you?
- No.
Why would I?
Same reason you do everything.
Money.
See, Boylan, colony financials told us something good, but...
Well, we dug deeper and found something even better.
You keep offline financial records.
Old-school.
On, on paper.
And they're going to tell us everything we need to know about you and Ken Foster.
Bar's closed.
You, too.
Get out.
Get some air.
Josh, come here.
I want you to check behind the bar, in the back room, every inch.
That ledger's here somewhere.
Find it.
Yes, sir.
Today's your last day, buddy.
You're not working here.
Yes, I am.
No, no.
There's no discussion.
You're always on me about taking responsibility, and then all of a sudden you don't approve of the job I get?
No, it's not just that this is a bar.
It's that you should have talked to me and your mother first.
Why?
So you could just shoot it down?
Either I'm supposed to be an adult here, or I'm not.
You better get your stories straight.
Tore the place apart.
If he's got that ledger, it definitely isn't here.
Boylan ran.
And he had help.
Let's go.
Move it out!
Let's go!
Wash, you copy?
Copy.
I want you and Reynolds to check the security logs.
I want to know who helped that scum.
Command out.
You got anything on the scanner?
Yeah, life up ahead.
Hang on, sir.
Signal stopped moving, sir.
We're closing in on the signal.
Right up ahead.
Wash, what's the status on that security cam?
Nothing yet.
I'm still scanning.
Copy that.
Taylor out.
This is supposed to be the spot.
Signal's coming from right here.
Boylan!
Well, maybe the scanner's busted.
If I were a betting man, I'd say he's not here.
You a betting man, Jim?
No, I am not.
But, Curran...
You are.
What are you talking about?
The money you owe Foster.
Your account's been tapped.
Last four transactions all payments made to Foster.
How much more did you owe him, son?
How much couldn't you pay him?
You're way off, sir.
Now, you look me in the eye and you tell me you didn't kill Foster.
I didn't.
I didn't kill him.
You're lying.
Prove it.
I don't have to.
I know you did it.
I can tell.
The Boylan arrest was staged?
Yeah.
So, why'd you bring me out here?
Couldn't we have just done this inside the gates?
No.
You didn't think I'd give you a live one?
It's over.
One of my soldiers kills one of our own?
I should separate your head from your shoulders!
You didn't kill Foster?
You didn't kill Foster?
- Huh?
!
- No!
Then why'd you steal this from the bar, huh?
Except to hide the fact that you owed Foster money.
You're staying here.
You can't do this.
I can, and I am.
No!
Are you out of your mind?
!
You can't prove I did anything.
We-we're going back, and I get a court-martial.
You just had one.
Start walking.
With nothing?
No.
Sir, come on.
Well, you gave Milner a gun.
You can't send me out there with nothing!
Okay.
I'm going.
I'm going.
You think he'll survive out there on his own?
I did.
It can be done.
Whatever happens,
I'm not gonna lose any sleep over it.
Hell of a thing.
Him taking a fall like that for her.
And him taking her back.
If that ain't love.
Hey, Boylan, thanks for playing along today.
You know, that's the first and last time
I do a favor for you for free.
And here I was starting to think you might actually be good for something.
That man does not like you.
You could die trying to please everybody.
Sounds good.
Where is everybody?
Uh, Zoe wanted to go and watch the egg hatch, so mom took her over there.
Maddy called it an early night.
Okay, and what are you still doing here?
Aren't you late for work?
Are you serious?
Look, uh, I would have liked for you to have talked to us before taking this job, but guess you're old enough now to start making your own decisions.
Stay out of trouble over there.
And, Josh, in this family, no secrets.
My dad changed his mind.
As long as you can pay me, the deal's back on.
What the hell's she doing here?
She's not gonna tell anyone;
She just wants to help.
Oh, great.
Well, there's a stack of dirty dishes back at the bar.
Look, how much do you trust Mira?
I don't.
But I've been told I have issues.
Okay, well, you send him OTG in the middle of the night and he doesn't come back, that's bad for everyone.
You know he stands a better chance with me.
Okay, you're meeting just outside the perimeter mines, so you should be safe from predators.
But just in case, take this.
Follow this map exactly, and you'll get to the rendezvous point.
Then what?
Then you pray Mira likes surprises better than I do.
Should be just up ahead.
Okay.
Hey, whoa.
I'm not going in there blind.
This way.
Where are they?
Behind those rocks.
Ok.
I didn't ask for her.
You're right, you should probably just turn her loose.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Enough!
You're the cop's kid.
Or Josh.
But "the cop's kid" works.
For Boylan to work his magic, get your girl here, he's got to be able to talk to 2149.
Which means he's got to go through me.
You want money, too, is that it?
Not money.
But someday I'm gonna ask you to do something for me.
And when that day comes, you'll comply without question.
Without hesitation.
Do we have a deal?
Yes.
Yes.
Take them back to where you found them and point them home.
Hey.
- Shh!
Anything yet?
No, still waiting.
Where's Malcolmus?
He went home.
You did it, mommy.
Very gently, very gently.
Can we keep him?
Can we?
Just for a little while?
Terra Nova H.Q., this is Foster.
Terra Nova command, copy that.
I just pulled up at communications relay station 19-A.
- Man:
Copy that.
Commence repair.
- Roger that.
Terra Nova Command out.
(Loud clattering)
Smithson, is that you?
You sleeping off another bender in there, or did you lock yourself in again?
(Distant roaring)
(Beeping)
Smithson, wake up.
Smithson?
(Screaming) (Snarling)
Yeah, it looks pretty straightforward what happened here to me.
Foster made the mistake of leaving the shed door open while he was working.
Must have snuck up behind him.
Never saw it coming.
What did it to him?
Nykoraptor.
The bite Marks on his torso were a dead giveaway.
They've got three rows of incisors.
Nykos are vicious.
Basically two-legged sharks.
Easy with him.
Jim:
Do they hunt around here?
No, no, not usually.
But these Ankylosaur nests...
Their eggs are easy prey.
Jim:
With easy prey nearby, why'd the Nyko go after a human?
You got an endless supply of chicken...
Doesn't mean you're going to turn your nose up at a bloody rare steak.
Good morning, Josh.
I need to talk to you for a sec about our arrangement.
There's been a complication.
It's about your girl.
Kara?
We had a deal.
You told me you could get her here on one of the next pilgrimages.
Like I said, there's been a complication.
Now if you want me to get her here, you're going to have to do something.
I'm listening.
You might want a shot of courage first.
Hey.
- Hi.
- Good morning.
What brings you to my end of the compound?
Oh, well, Jim asked me to autopsy this soldier that was killed.
See if anything out of the ordinary turned up.
- I won't distract you.
- Okay.
(Whistles)
Amazing.
Just amazing.
Ankylosaurus.
Where'd you get it?
In a nest near the scene of the accident.
Oh, wow, looks pretty damaged.
The others had hatched.
This one, unfortunately, didn't make it.
But it is an incredible research opportunity.
I'd say so.
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.
Hey, Zoe.
Why aren't you at school?
Well, her teacher sent for me.
Somebody has an earache.
Oh.
And yesterday it was your tummy, wasn't it?
I just miss you, mommy.
I know you do, sweetheart, but school is really important.
Look, I need to just have a quick word with daddy.
So why don't you go and take a look at some of that cool stuff over there.
Just be careful not to touch anything, all right?
Go on.
The autopsy turn up anything?
Yeah, I was just in the middle of something when you came in.
Great.
So I found two types of blood on Foster's torso.
One was his.
And the second's probably from the Nyko.
Yes, that's what I was thinking.
Hmm, it says the second type of blood came from one of those.
I don't understand.
I think I do.
Malcolm.
What's a Nykoraptor's favorite food?
You're looking at it.
It's a Galesaur.
Sort of a prehistoric Turkey.
Why?
I think this was a murder.
Help me out here.
How do you kill a man with a dinosaur?
You trap it somewhere where you know the victim's going to show up.
All you need is the right bait and knowledge of your Vic's schedule.
We found blood from the bait that was used to lure the Nyko inside the shed.
And the back of that door was covered in scratches from when it was trying to get out.
We've lost our share of folks, but never like this.
Not to murder.
Foster was a good soldier.
If somebody killed him, I want to know who.
Find out.
Do it quick and do it quiet.
Wash, you're on this with him.
First thing, we should talk to his friends.
A day like today, I think I know where they'll be.
- Boys.
- Lieutenant.
Hi, Mr. Shannon.
Hey.
Sorry about Foster.
And I'm sorry to interrupt you guys.
I know this isn't a good time, but I've got a few questions I need to ask if that's okay?
Sure.
Did Foster get along with everyone in your unit?
Uh, pretty much.
Why?
Can you think of anyone who would have wanted to harm him?
Hold on, you're investigating this as a murder or something?
I don't believe this.
You know, Foster was seeing a woman.
- Yeah?
What's her name?
- I don't know.
None of us do.
He never told us who she is.
Yeah, but he was always up in his bunk looking at pictures of her on his tag.
I thought they only held personal info and blood type.
Yeah, plus a medical history and a locator.
You're not supposed to, but everyone hacks in and throws a couple of pictures of loved ones on there.
Maybe some music for when you're holed up someplace or on a long patrol.
Well, thanks, gentlemen,
- and again, sorry for your loss.
- Yeah.
You find it odd that this mystery woman hasn't stepped forward?
Now you're getting the hang of this.
So let's go take a look at Foster's tag.
Foster's personal effects...
Can we, uh, can we see them?
Well, yeah.
Could you get me the deceased's - personal effects, please?
- Right away.
Thanks.
What's going on?
Well, Foster had a dog tag...
Be careful!
Be, be very careful with that.
Gently, sweetheart.
Sorry.
Zoe:
It's broken.
Are you trying to fix it?
(Gasps)
The baby wants to come out.
Malcolm:
My God, it's still alive!
It's unbelievable.
You're going to help it, right?
Um...
Yeah, of course we are, sweetheart, yeah.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
OK.
Foster's personal effects.
Terra's, a flashlight.
Washington:
But the tag wasn't recovered.
You said it has a locator.
(Beeping)
- It's on the move.
- Yeah.
A Nyko must have eaten it.
Then we're going to have to go get that Nyko.
(Snarling)
Shannon, you copy?
Copy.
You two have eyes on the Nyko?
Negative, sir.
We lost it.
Stand by.
(Animal chittering)
Contact!
Eyes on target, 9:00!
20 meters!
Good.
Flank him to the right.
Swing him back towards me.
Coming your way.
All right, up ahead is the choke point.
It dead-ends in dense forest.
Force it into the shooting gallery.
We got you now.
(Loud chittering)
Anybody got a visual?
No joy, sir.
All right, just so we're clear...
We're not killing this thing, right?
No need.
Whatever we get out of its belly, we're going to obtain on site.
Lieutenant Washington there is about the finest combat medic
I've ever had the pleasure to be stitched up by, isn't that right, lieutenant?
If you say so, sir.
How many stitches you put in my side that time?
- 67, sir.
- Yeah.
(Growling)
Where'd it go?
How long can he stay up there?
You got somewhere you need to be, lieutenant?
I'd love not to be here when the sun sets.
How long can he stay up there?
(Roaring)
- We got him.
- Open him up.
This was the bait.
Ugh.
And, uh, this is what else he ate when he was in the shed.
And here's what we came for.
Foster's tag.
It's pretty banged up.
Taylor:
There he is, and he's with a woman, but I don't think I know her.
We can run a facial rec against our database.
Damn it to hell.
It's okay, sir.
I recognize her.
She works at the mess hall.
Yeah, I know Foster.
Hmm.
I know you, too.
Working in the mess, I meet my share of soldiers.
Well, his friends seem to think it was, um... more than that.
I was nice to him.
Support staff, it's our job to be nice.
I'm sorry if he took it the wrong way.
Look at this.
Terra Nova lottery notification.
How long you guys been married?
Three years.
And was the wedding before or after he... got this?
Hmm.
So what happened?
You loved him until he got you through the portal, then you traded up for another man?
I mean, I'm just spitballing here.
I'm a married woman.
You can't just come in here and make accusations.
(Door opens) Honey?
Jim:
Afternoon, Mr. Milner.
I'm Jim Shannon from security.
This is lieutenant Washington.
Why are you here?
It's about the soldier who died, Ken Foster.
It's nothing, Howard.
They're just asking some questions.
Yeah.
Are you okay, Mr. Milner?
You-you seem upset.
I'm fine.
'Cause your wife knew this man Foster from the mess hall.
Of course I do;
I serve these guys every day.
Look, I told them this already.
I don't know what the hell they're still doing here.
Shut up.
Just shut up.
Do you think I didn't know?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Well, you're here, right?
You're gonna find out sooner or later.
I killed that son of a bitch Foster.
And given the chance, I'd kill him again.
Hey.
I just dropped Zoe back at school.
All she could talk about was this egg.
Please give me some good news.
Well, I wish I could.
It looks like the reason it didn't hatch with the others is that it has birth defects.
- You see this dark patch here?
- Yeah.
Its front right leg is fused to its neck, which has compromised its windpipe and its blood flow.
And if it were to hatch now, it wouldn't get nearly enough oxygen.
Wouldn't survive three minutes.
The mother must've had to abandon it
- to care for the other hatchlings.
- Yes.
And I'm afraid we have to abandon it, too.
Oh, no, that's not gonna work for me.
You saw the look on her face.
No, there must be something we can do to help it along.
I don't know yet.
Um... in Ovo surgery through the shell if we have to.
(Sighs)
There's gotta be something.
Jim:
When did you find out that your wife was having an affair?
Milner:
I just did;
Who cares when?
(Slamming)
I do.
The shed...
How'd you get it open?
Anything with a circuit board can be hacked.
But how'd you know his shifts?
That he'd be the one to get the call?
Well, I tailed him for a week.
That night I went out and broke the piece of equipment that caused the repair beacon to sound.
I tied up some bait inside the shed.
Then I waited in the rover until the Nykoraptor came.
When it went after the bait, I closed the door behind it, and then I drove away.
(Sighs)
Very elaborate.
I mean, you must, you must really love this woman.
(Voice breaking):
With all my heart.
You can't imagine what is like winning the lottery.
Maybe you both had love in your lives, maybe not.
But I haven't.
And then all of a sudden there was a flood of it.
And the best thing to come along was Rebecca.
And it was perfect.
You know, coming back to a world like this...
How could she not love me for bringing her here?
(Sighs)
Milner (On-screen):
How could I have been so stupid?
Why didn't I see that she was using me?
But you know what the stupidest thing of all was?
Thinking that it could actually be different for me this time.
(Video stops)
You were right.
It was murder.
Lieutenant Washington knows
I expect my people to adhere to a strict code of honor.
For one of them to get involved with a married Terra Novan, well...
That's not just frowned upon,
I won't tolerate it.
But Foster didn't deserve to die for it.
Shannon, have you been out to memorial field?
Uh...
Not yet.
It's beyond the fields before those low hills.
Simple headstones buried in the Earth.
We have sustained losses...
Fallen soldiers, accidents, citizens who succumbed to syncillic fever.
But we've never had a murder in Terra Nova.
Unless I commute Milner's sentence to imprisonment, the bylaw says banishment.
- Out there?
- Out there.
I'm going to go bury our soldier.
And I'm going to make a decision.
I don't recall ever having to make a tougher one.
Josh:
So Boylan said if I want to get Kara here,
I have to meet with someone.
- It's outside the gates.
- Why can't you just meet at the bar?
It's Mira.
Leader of the Sixers, Mira?
Is there another one?
'Cause if there is, it'd be pretty awesome if I just misunderstood this whole thing.
You can't go.
There's no telling what she might be up to.
- I don't have a choice.
- Yes, you do.
Look, I know you promised Kara, but it's not worth getting yourself killed.
You have no idea what 2149 is like.
I had three friends junior year that killed themselves.
Nobody believes they have a future.
Nobody believes in anything anymore.
Nothing means anything.
I have to get her out of there.
(Sighs)
Okay.
But you're not going alone.
♪
It was quite moving today.
- Sad.
- Mm.
The procession.
Everyone in the streets.
Can you imagine that back in Chicago?
No.
Honestly, it felt like something from another time we've only ever read about.
So what do you think will happen tomorrow?
I don't know, but the good news is, there's not gonna be a drawn-out trial.
You don't think he deserves one?
He confessed.
There's something to be said for swift justice.
But, Jim, come on, this is wrong.
It's frontier justice;
You know that.
You say that like it's a bad thing, like I should miss the system we left behind.
You remember the crap I dealt with.
Everything moved iceberg slow, and I'd work a good case for months only to have someone buy the verdict out from under me.
Yeah, I know, I know that was bad, but I fail to see how it's worse than barbaric decisions being made by one man alone.
- Barbaric?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Don't forget Milner's a confessed killer.
What do you think we should do with him?
Confine him.
Put him on trial.
And if he's guilty, then put him in prison, but try to show some mercy.
I was just in prison.
And "mercy" is not the first word that comes to mind when I think back on my time.
Maybe we should talk about this later.
If someone had given me the choice between an eight-by- eight in goladand and a chance in the wild with a gun in my hand, I know which one I would've picked.
Okay, I didn't think before I spoke, all right?
I didn't mean it that way.
Maybe...
I'm trying to take this back!
What do you want from me, Liz?
I mean, I got a confession.
You're acting like I beat it out of the guy.
Jim... (Sighs)
I'm sorry.
Like no one's ever had reason to falsely confess?
Hey.
I'm sorry about Foster.
Thanks.
Let's hope the guy that did this gets banished like he deserves.
Sorry, I, uh...
I know it sounds harsh.
No.
Look, I know you want justice for your friend, but whatever happens, it's a really sad day for the colony.
I mean, this place is supposed to be a new beginning.
(Sighs)
And I guess I shouldn't be surprised that some of the old problems followed us here.
(Murmuring)
Howard Milner, you've confessed to the murder of Ken Foster.
Do you have anything else to say for yourself?
Ours is a colony of laws.
A violation such as murder is a crime against every one of us.
Terra Nova cannot survive unless we hold ourselves... hold each other...
To standards higher than our standards of the past.
With a heavy heart...
I carry out this judgment of banishment.
Taylor!
You know this is a death sentence.
Isn't there another way?
The only way is forward, for the good of the colony.
What we're building here...
There's no place for a crime like this.
Just as we've come back to remake this world, we have to let this world remake us.
If we can't dare to live lives that are worthy of this remarkable place, well, we should have just stayed in the future to perish with the planet.
Milner, you have a fighting chance out there.
That's more than you gave Ken Foster.
Don't ever come back to the colony.
You've made your own fate.
Now live or die with it.
(Dinosaur trilling)
(Cawing)
Hey!
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What are you doing here?
- Take it easy.
Just put the weapon down.
(Dinosaur snarling)
So.
How you doing out here so far?
I would be scared out of my mind.
I mean, between the wildlife and the Sixers, there's a lot of ways to die in this jungle.
Well, I...
I deserve what I get.
I gotta admit,
I was surprised when Taylor went through with the sentence.
Seemed like a lot of people were.
What about you?
Were you...
Were you surprised?
We have a law.
He followed it, so...
No.
(Screeches)
Not sure I believe you, Howard.
I think you were surprised.
I think you were betting on Taylor commuting the sentence.
I mean, it would have been a lot easier to be the hero in a colony jail than it is out here.
The hero?
What are you talking about?
Well, I saw the way you and Rebecca were looking at each other back there, and it got me thinking.
I mean, what if she killed Foster?
I know you're crazy about her.
The question is, are you crazy enough to fall on your sword for her when it means facing this jungle alone?
What do you want?
Howard!
I'm sorry.
I couldn't go through with it.
Go through with what?
I know Foster broke things off with you a couple of weeks ago.
So, isn't that why you did it?
Did what?
Hang on, what... you...
You think I killed him?
What...?
So, you didn't?
Of course not!
(Sighs)
Is that why you confessed?
Well, I...
I didn't want you sent out there to die alone.
So, Howard, when you confessed to me, how did you know what to say?
I'd heard the details of the crime flying around the colony.
Whoever killed Foster clearly had a reason to spread them.
But Rebecca...
Foster did end it with you, right?
To be honest, I was happy that he did.
I'm better off without him.
Why is that?
He turned out to be a jerk.
He chose his friends, and his drinking, and his gambling over me.
Gambling?
It was all he cared about.
He was always over at Boylan's playing cards.
There's quite a scene over there.
But it's illegal, so people stay pretty quiet about it.
Hmm.
Just what exactly were you thinking, Shannon?
Look, you told me to do my job, and I did.
Milner recanted his confession.
Well, how do you know he didn't just take it back 'cause he got scared to death out there?
My gut's telling me.
Oh.
Oh, well, why didn't you say so?
Commander, let me explain.
No, you let me explain.
Banishing Milner,
I put a huge chunk of my reputation on the line.
You saw as well as I did, not everybody was overjoyed with my decision to stick to the letter of the law on this, and now you tell me that I got the wrong guy?
But he's alive.
And I got a new lead.
So if we keep the Milner return under wraps just long enough for me to follow it...
You do exactly that.
'Cause your gut's not good enough on this.
You follow that new lead.
Otherwise, I guarantee you I am bouncing Milner's ass right back outside that gate.
Rotate ten degrees.
Stop.
There we go.
Almost there.
Amazing.
Shame Jim couldn't be here to see you work your magic.
Well, surgery's not really a spectator sport.
Well, with you holding the knife, it should be.
You're very sweet, but...
I'm sure Jim has many more important things to do today than watch me attempt to alter nature's course.
Okay.
Uh...
Foster's financials.
I've got them right here.
Whoa, whoa.
Looks like Rebecca was right about what goes on at Boylan's.
That is interesting.
Look who owed Foster a lot of money.
Okay.
Let's take it to Taylor.
He's going to want a real confession this time.
Yeah.
And I know how to get it.
Mr. sheriff!
Welcome back.
And Commander Taylor.
Now, what a pleasure.
You never darken my door.
- Josh?
- Hi, dad.
What are you doing here?
I work here.
Boylan:
We're very impressed with your boy.
Josh has already proven himself a very worthy member of the team.
We'll talk about that, you bet your ass, but first things first.
Boylan, I been looking forward to saying this for a long time.
We're taking you in.
- Yes sir.
- What are you doing?
- On your feet.
- Come on.
You nuts?
You have never made a bigger mistake in your life, Taylor.
Curran:
Okay, get up!
Let's go!
Walk with me!
Taylor:
The long and the short of it is this, Boylan:
You're going to come clean about gambling at your place, or I might have to shut you down.
Oh, Commander.
Your loyal subjects would just love that.
I created the one place in Terra Nova that operates just outside your grip.
Close my shop, and see how people respond when you take that away.
You run card games.
And we know you take a cut.
Are there card games that take place under my roof?
Yeah.
Do I take a small percentage off the top?
Well...
Define small.
Now, is that unreasonable?
No.
No, it is not.
Foster played at your shop, didn't he?
Yeah.
So?
Well, you don't think I killed him.
- Jim:
Did you?
- No.
Why would I?
Same reason you do everything.
Money.
See, Boylan, colony financials told us something good, but...
Well, we dug deeper and found something even better.
You keep offline financial records.
Old-school.
On, on paper.
And they're going to tell us everything we need to know about you and Ken Foster.
Bar's closed.
You, too.
Get out.
Get some air.
Josh, come here.
I want you to check behind the bar, in the back room, every inch.
That ledger's here somewhere.
Find it.
Yes, sir.
Today's your last day, buddy.
You're not working here.
Yes, I am.
No, no.
There's no discussion.
You're always on me about taking responsibility, and then all of a sudden you don't approve of the job I get?
No, it's not just that this is a bar.
It's that you should have talked to me and your mother first.
Why?
So you could just shoot it down?
Either I'm supposed to be an adult here, or I'm not.
You better get your stories straight.
Tore the place apart.
If he's got that ledger, it definitely isn't here.
Boylan ran.
And he had help.
Let's go.
Move it out!
Let's go!
Wash, you copy?
Washington:
Copy.
I want you and Reynolds to check the security logs.
I want to know who helped that scum.
Command out.
You got anything on the scanner?
Yeah, life up ahead.
Hang on, sir.
Signal stopped moving, sir.
Curran:
We're closing in on the signal.
Right up ahead.
Wash, what's the status on that security cam?
Nothing yet.
I'm still scanning.
Taylor:
Copy that.
Taylor out.
Curran:
This is supposed to be the spot.
Signal's coming from right here.
Boylan!
Well, maybe the scanner's busted.
If I were a betting man, I'd say he's not here.
You a betting man, Jim?
No, I am not.
But, Curran...
You are.
What are you talking about?
The money you owe Foster.
Your account's been tapped.
Last four transactions all payments made to Foster.
How much more did you owe him, son?
How much couldn't you pay him?
You're way off, sir.
Hmm.
Now, you look me in the eye and you tell me you didn't kill Foster.
I didn't.
I didn't kill him.
You're lying.
Prove it.
I don't have to.
I know you did it.
I can tell.
The Boylan arrest was staged?
Yeah.
So, why'd you bring me out here?
Couldn't we have just done this inside the gates?
No.
(Gun clicking empty)
You didn't think I'd give you a live one?
It's over.
(Groaning)
One of my soldiers kills one of our own?
I should separate your head from your shoulders!
(Groaning)
You didn't kill Foster?
You didn't kill Foster?
- Huh?
!
- No!
Then why'd you steal this from the bar, huh?
Except to hide the fact that you owed Foster money.
You're staying here.
You can't do this.
I can, and I am.
No!
Are you out of your mind?
!
You can't prove I did anything.
We-we're going back, and I get a court-martial.
You just had one.
Start walking.
With nothing?
No.
Sir, come on.
Well, you gave Milner a gun.
You can't send me out there with nothing!
Okay.
I'm going.
(Spits)
I'm going.
You think he'll survive out there on his own?
I did.
It can be done.
Whatever happens,
I'm not gonna lose any sleep over it.
(Dinosaur bellowing in distance)
(Dinosaur roaring)
Taylor:
Hell of a thing.
Him taking a fall like that for her.
And him taking her back.
If that ain't love.
(Vehicle approaching)
Hey, Boylan, thanks for playing along today.
You know, that's the first and last time
I do a favor for you for free.
And here I was starting to think you might actually be good for something.
That man does not like you.
You could die trying to please everybody.
(Playing bluesy music)
Sounds good.
Where is everybody?
Uh, Zoe wanted to go and watch the egg hatch, so mom took her over there.
Maddy called it an early night.
Okay, and what are you still doing here?
Aren't you late for work?
Are you serious?
Look, uh, I would have liked for you to have talked to us before taking this job, but guess you're old enough now to start making your own decisions.
Stay out of trouble over there.
And, Josh, in this family, no secrets.
(Sighs)
My dad changed his mind.
As long as you can pay me, the deal's back on.
What the hell's she doing here?
She's not gonna tell anyone;
She just wants to help.
Oh, great.
Well, there's a stack of dirty dishes back at the bar.
Look, how much do you trust Mira?
I don't.
But I've been told I have issues.
Okay, well, you send him OTG in the middle of the night and he doesn't come back, that's bad for everyone.
You know he stands a better chance with me.
Okay, you're meeting just outside the perimeter mines, so you should be safe from predators.
But just in case, take this.
Follow this map exactly, and you'll get to the rendezvous point.
Then what?
Then you pray Mira likes surprises better than I do.
(Dinosaur roaring)
Should be just up ahead.
Okay.
Hey, whoa.
I'm not going in there blind.
This way.
Where are they?
Behind those rocks.
(Screams)
Ok.
I didn't ask for her.
You're right, you should probably just turn her loose.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Mira:
Enough!
You're the cop's kid.
Or Josh.
But "the cop's kid" works.
For Boylan to work his magic, get your girl here, he's got to be able to talk to 2149.
Which means he's got to go through me.
You want money, too, is that it?
Not money.
But someday I'm gonna ask you to do something for me.
And when that day comes, you'll comply without question.
Without hesitation.
Do we have a deal?
Yes.
Yes.
Take them back to where you found them and point them home.
- (Whispers):
Hey.
- Shh!
Anything yet?
No, still waiting.
Where's Malcolmus?
He went home.
(Eggshell crackling)
(Groaning weakly)
You did it, mommy.
Very gently, very gently.
Can we keep him?
Can we?
Just for a little while?
June 15th, 1944.
The U.S. military invades Saipan and the Northern Mariana's group of islands.
The marines moved ashore, establishing themselves on the Southwest coast.
On their way, taking control of the island.
Under Japanese control Saipan is called home by 20,000 of its citizens.
And defended by over 30,000 highly trained members of the Imperial fighting forces.
Though one of the most strategically important of the Japanese strongholds in the Pacific
Saipan's defenses folded
Under the onslaught of the American war machines, numbering over 70,000 strong.
In the ensuing battle the majority of the Japanese defenders are annihilated.
And the survivors flee to Mount Tapochau.
Located at the centre of the island.
Taiheiyou no Kiseki ~ Fox to Yobareta Otoko (Miracle in Pacific – The man called Fox)
Keep your heads down!
Down!
Medic!
Medic!
Help!
I'll go.
Medic!
- Ammo!
- We're out!
Ammo!
Medic!
Enemy planes!
Stay put!
It burns!
Hey!
Naito!
Naito!
Unbeknownst to the Japanese on the island
The Imperial navy suffers a humiliating defeat in the seas off of the Mariana's
Leaving the Imperial command no choice but to abandon the defense of Saipan.
The uninformed defenders however continued to fight.
Believing in the inevitable victory of their hallowed Imperial forces
And their nation.
Get outta the way!
Get a move on!
Clear the way!
Pull this thing over!
C'mon move outta the way!
Sorry 'bout that!
Captain!
Carry on!
C'mon!
C'mon!
Get outta the road!
Hey!
Clear the way!
God damn many Japs!
This time tomorrow!
The camp's gotten be overflown in no time!
Just a few days, those yellow monkeys in the mountains are gonna be history.
You know their orders are to stop us no matter what.
These Japanese soldiers are tough.
They don't give up.
You have no idea what you're talking about, Corporal.
I advise you to keep your opinions to yourself.
Right, sir.
Dammit!
Watch it!
Hey!
Take it easy, Corporal!
Or I'm taking the jeep and you're walking.
You read me?
!
Yes, sir.
Are you alright?
Shit...
- I should've stopped.
- Look.
They're just Japs, sir.
They'll be fine.
Every Japanese knows there's only once in a lifetime to be sincere.
What's that mean, sir?
The Japanese treasure every meeting for if it may never recur.
If you pay attention.
You might actually learn something while you're here.
Where'd you learn your lingo, sir?
You date a Jap girlfriend or something?
I studied in Japan for two years.
Unfortunately, I never got around having a girlfriend.
Bet you wanted to.
Keep your eyes on the road mister.
Yes, sir.
The remaining troops are to evacuate immediately to Mt.
Tapochau.
Our Imperial Japanese Army...
Of the 43rd, division.
Under the command of His Excellency Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito.
Will prevail til the end.
We will hold til the 4th of July.
What did the Imperial command say?
Victory finally.
The enemy will finally see our wrath.
Command requires that only the capable and healthy go to Mt.
Tapochau.
Those unwell are to stand down.
That is all!
Hold him tight!
Hold on!
Hurts doesn't it?
I understand.
Do it!
Captain?
I do not wish to go to Mt.
Tapochau.
I would like to stay and perish here.
With my unit.
Please grant my wish.
You're Lewis?
Yes, sir.
Have a seat, Captain.
We're not that formal here.
Not in this damn place...
Thank you, sir.
I hear you speak Japanese.
Well, the Japanese would say otherwise.
I know the basics, sir.
Where're you from?
Boston, sir.
So you're a Ivy Leaguer, huh?
You could say that.
I'll try not to hold it against you.
I need your help, Lewis.
I don't understand these Japs.
This ah...
Bushido suicide thing...
It's ah...
Well!
It's crazy.
Well, It's ah... it's a matter of pride.
It's a way of thinking.
They've been nurturing in their heads for centuries.
What?
Killing themselves?
Are you..
Are you familiar with these, sir.
Can't say that I am.
What are they?
Some kinda...
Jap lucky charms?
No, sir.
They're shoji pieces.
They're Japanese chess pieces if you will.
They all look the same except for the writing inside.
So?
Well...
The only thing that differentiates your pieces from mine, is the direction they're facing on the board.
Get to the point, Captain.
Yes sir.
Unlike our chess
If I were to take one of your pieces.
I don't hold onto it waiting for you to reclaim it.
I just simply turn it around.
And use it against you.
As part of my army.
What the hell does that have to do with them killing themselves!
?
The Japanese put a high price on loyalty to one's master.
If one were to be taken prisoner.
It would be expected behaviour for them to serve the new lord...
With equal loyalty.
Now if that were true.
Why wouldn't they just surrender and come fight on our side?
Well, sir.
If they were to be taken prisoner there's a chance they could end up betraying their emperor.
So they choose to die.
Instead of taking the chance that might happen.
You see, sir, the Japanese...
Captain!
I didn't come here to play fucking chess.
Now if these Japs want to die I'll be more than happy to oblige them.
Honorably or otherwise.
I just want to get this damn war over with.
Are we clear?
Crystal clear, sir.
Sister...
She's running a fever.
Water.
Enemies!
Man the machinegun!
Quickly!
Get up!
Attack!
There's the entrance!
You're up!
Frag that cave!
Now he throws it in!
Merry Christmas!
Nips!
Hold it!
- Cover the entrance!
- Got it!
Cave's clear!
- Are they dead?
- Go in and find out?
- I'm not going in there.
- Get in there!
- Go on!
- Get in there.
Check him out!
- Check those pockets!
- I don't have all day.
Get those souvenirs, watches...
What've you got?
Got one!
- Move out!
- Yeah!
yeah!
- I want a belly band!
- What's a belly band?
Give it.
I have two children of my own.
Follow me.
We need to stock up on supplies.
Don't we have enough?
We need to stock up on more.
Later we won't have a chance.
Naval command's not ready, so continue to hold.
We'll wait for the combined fleet to recapture the island.
Arrival of the combined fleet won't be long.
Who is this?
My subordinate.
Even without naval support?
We are going to fight?
!
- Insolence!
- Quiet!
Keep silent.
Captain, I will tell the rest tonight.
That even without naval support I am not afraid to die.
I want to win the war.
As do I!
No!
You just want to die.
That's not true.
Dying may be necessary.
But not unnecessary sacrifice.
Death will not ensure our victory!
We must kill as many enemies as we can to ensure our army's victory!
Bear that in mind!
I am addressing the officers and men to the Imperial Army on Saipan.
For more than twenty days since the American devils attacked, the officers, men and civilian employees of the Imperial Army and Navy on this island.
Have fought well and bravely.
I expected... that every man would do his duty.
Heaven has not given us a chance.
We have fought in unison up to the present time
Despite the bitterness of defeat we pledge "seven lives to repay our country".
Whether we attack or stay, there is only death.
Men who realize the true value of the Empire
Utilize this opportunity to exalt true Japanese manhood.
Saipan is the breakwater in the Pacific.
Leave my bones on Saipan as a bulwark of the Pacific.
As in the Senjinkun battle ethics,
Never suffer disgrace and will offer up the courage of my soul.
For the eternal life of the emperor and the welfare of the country!
BANZAI!
July 7th, 1944
On the day following the suicide of General Saito and his four commanders
The tattered remnants of the Japanese forces
Gathered near the western coast of the island for a final assault against the invaders.
The Americans however, remained completely unaware of their movements.
Keep us posted on a regular basis.
If we find anything out there you boys'd be interested in
I'll let you know.
Come home normal.
- Stay sharp.
- Roger.
- Mikey!
Let's go.
- Coming, sir.
I sure miss those Hawaiian gals.
Oh yeah, those girls are sweet.
Incoming!
- Holy Shit!
Japs everywhere!
- We got company!
Japs!
Get to your firearm!
Charge!
Charge!
Here they come!
Long live the Empire of Japan!
Cover!
Cover!
Get on the horn!
Able Victor Crow.
This is Victor Blue.
Can you read?
Over!
Victor Blue.
This is Able Victor Crow.
Go ahead, over.
Look out!
This is Victor Crow!
We're getting a god damn Jap banzai attack!
- We'll be trying to hold them back!
- Get the Captain...
Get the Captain!
Captain!
Requesting immediate fire mission on my mark!
1 stick 4 items!
I say again!
1 stick 4 items!
Fire for effect...!
C'mon!
Get outta here!
Victor Blue.
Repeat last transmission.
Over.
Victor Blue.
Repeat last transmission.
Over.
Mike!
Get your ass up!
We're going in the field!
Captain.
That's Travis.
- I think it's been overrun.
- Shit...
Find out what's going on now.
Banzai...!
Banzai...!
On the 7th of July.
And what came to be known as the Banzai Attack.
Over 4,000 Japanese and close to 2,000 American lives were lost in a space of only a few hours.
Two days later, the American commanders would declare a total military victory on the island of Saipan.
Keep your eyes open!
Check em' out!
Could be some live ones!
So you fear death?
Who are you?
Speak of the dead.
Horiuchi Kesamatsu.
Private First Class.
Here!
Near Mt Tapochau.
It's a place the Japanese are calling the Valley of Hell.
It was here that General Saito along with his other commanders committed suicide in front of their men.
And they did this the night before they launched the attack.
The night before?
!
That's right, sir.
The night before the attack.
They want to die for their god emperor.
Though they just assume, take us with them.
They kill themselves...
The night before hitting the battlefield.
What sense does that make!
?
Well, by dying this way in front of their men
They're showing their men the way.
They're setting an example.
Continue, Sergeant.
Now up here.
Marpi Point.
Calling these cliffs, the Banzai cliffs.
Because apparently civilians are throwing themselves into the rocks in the sea below.
Women, children and entire families are killing themselves, sir.
Women and children?
Why?
!
Seems that the Japanese military has told them
That we Americans are cannibals and torturers.
They are terrified, sir.
The Japs have lost their commanders.
And we've crushed their armies.
Now I tell you boys The end is in sight.
Thank god for that.
Because this must stop right now!
You're right Colonel.
But I feel we can't be too optimistic about this.
This is still a volatile situation.
I'd like to try and convince them to surrender, sir.
You want to talk to them?
They have no more food left.
With no fresh water on this island,
They've also got nothing to lose.
I refuse to lose even one more man on that mountain!
You've got one month, Captain!
After that I'll blow them all to hell.
Thank you, sir.
Hey!
Water!
Water!
Open Open
Where?
Live.
Captain.
Kind as you are.
This may expose us to the enemy.
The enemy may save this child.
And the price for that is our death?
You're ridiculous.
What are we fighting for?
If not for the people.
Hey!
Whatever the commander wishes.
Alright!
Let's do this.
You!
Over the fence!
Check the back!
What kinda name is Atkelelini?
- You don't look Italian.
- Check those bodies.
Navajo, sir.
- Atkelelini
- You two over there by the shed!
Means "troublemaker".
Grandfather rode with Roosevelt and the roughriders in Cuba.
Met my grandmother in Cuba.
- Now that's trouble.
- You two!
Go round the back!
Exactly.
You don't mind if I call you Trouble?
Everybody else does.
Let's go.
Guys hear that?
It's probably a trap.
I don't think you should go in there, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant.
Calm down...
Oh...
I gotcha...
He's weak.
Let's make sure we get this little guy some help, huh?
Yes, sir.
- You got him ?
- Yeah.
He's got your eyes, Sergeant.
Here.
Make sure not to lose him on the way back to camp.
Get him some water.
How'd you suggest I do that?
You take your thumb, you're gonna dip it in your canteen.
And you're gonna let him suck on it, just like you do.
Shut up!
You want the Japs to hear you?
Now spread out and finish clearing the area.
Move!
And take that damn thing off your head.
Bito?
Captain?
Captain's alive?
You guys, alright?
With the Captain, we're fine.
Stand...
Salute!
Toshio of 1st Battalion, 18th Regiment.
I'm Oba.
We're on our way to base camp, through the western slope of Mt Tapochau.
We'll use the dense jungle.
Even light hardly penetrates.
Best for concealment.
Look at this!
What is it?
Here.
American devils have been here.
Why are we delaying?
Ambush.
How are we sure they'll cross here?
Based on my calculations, they'll probably cross here.
And my gut feeling.
Alright take five!
Anyone got any water?
Here.
I've got a little.
Private, how many times do I have to tell ya
About the marvels of water conservation?
- Sergeant, it was full this morning.
- You're fucking useless!
You go without.
You get me killed,
And I'm coming back and I'm gonna kill you.
- You got it?
- Yes, Sergeant.
Take a load off...
Get down.
Grenade...
Grenade
There's another one over here, LT...
Sergeant?
There's a hidden path over here.
Fucking yellow monkeys.
How stupid do they think we are...
Well.
What are you waiting on?
Alright.
Let's see what this takes us.
C'mon.
Get.
Let's go...
Watch your spacing...
Quiet...
Munroe?
I don't like this.
Let's get outta here.
Everyone fall back!
- Attack!
- Incoming!
- Dammit!
It's a trap!
- Cover me!
Watch out!
Fall back!
Cease fire!
I suppose you're gonna try and tell me the Japs did this on purpose.
Well, sir!
They just disappeared!
Check the wounded!
- He's gone, Sergeant.
- Get his tags.
Was mist also in your calculations?
Coincidence.
Show yourself!
Please hold your fire.
Who are you?
Kazuo Oshiro.
How many people live here?
I haven't done a count...
Maybe about... 200.
200!
?
We have got supplies of food,
Medicine from a hospital.
And a nurse's station.
News of those in the shelter (Susupe Camp) suffers from hunger and torture.
That's why most stay back.
Marine Corps, Lieutenant Kinbara.
Private Nagata.
Sakae Oba of the 18th Infantry Regiment of the Imperial Japanese Army.
What's the situation on weapons and ammunition?
1 light machine gun.
Few launchers and 20 rifles.
However.
We've got 5 American rifles.
10 pistols and ammo.
We're ready to engage the enemy!
I'll leave you in charge of the camp.
I have utmost trust in your leadership.
Do not fail me!
Yes!
You're in good hands.
Captain?
Why can't you lead us?
Our mission is... to take out as many of the enemy as possible.
You're leaving us to die.
Why you...
Leave her.
The plane's headed towards the camp.
Back to camp!
Yes!
Stretcher!
Stretcher!
Tragedy.
hold!
Tend to him.
Move!
I'm sorry.
Out of the way!
Look at what've you done.
Verify the number of surviving civilians and soldiers.
Yes!
Scout for an alternative.
We need another location to accommodate 200 people.
Yes!
Right now!
We have 100 soldiers and 86 civilians.
We have already looked for an alternative camp sites.
Under the command of Captain Oba.
We have 3 locations.
1st location will be here!
2nd location is on the western slope of Mt Tapochau!
3rd alternative is the caves!
- Speed up!
It's getting dark!
- Yes!
Please be aware of your surrounding, and don't let your families wander off.
Transition to the camp site will soon be completed.
Kazuo?
I have come to realize.
That the civilians and the soldiers.
Are our duty.
I understand that now.
Oh.
Very detailed.
I taught geography in school.
Are we located here?
You understand?
I know where the mango is.
Very good.
You and your sister can map it out.
Alright.
I'll teach the rest.
What's wrong?
Hungry...
Saying it makes you more hungry.
You can't eat a raw snail.
You have to boil it first.
Those hidden in Mt Tapochau!
Japanese soldiers and civilians!
We will not harm you!
The U.S. army will not harm you!
Lay down your arms and surrender!
Feels nice.
C'mon in!
Feels wonderful!
Quit moving around.
Don't listen to Captain Oba.
Why?
Because his, command is like a God's.
Oba and God are in the same league.
You there!
Stop it!
- Get him out!
- Yes!
Nothing to see!
Disperse!
Disperse!
God said to me.
God loves you too.
- Quickly!
- Yes!
Quiet!
Heard he was a Priest.
Lost his mind eventually.
Captain Oba!
Alright.
You try.
C'mon!
You doing it wrong!
Relax your shoulders!
Tuck your knees in!
Thatta girl!
Hey!
Horiuchi.
Didn't I warn you not to approach the camp?
Align your sight to the tip.
Tuck your knee, Aono.
Knees.
Knees.
Alright!
Straighten up!
Straighten!
Shit!
Damn!
You really pulled the trigger!
That's dangerous!
Thank you.
I'm grateful for the lesson.
Why do you want to learn to shoot?
Eh...
Your name's Chieko, right?
Try not to act like you're one of the soldiers.
I used to be a performer.
Now without a family.
The only thing I want for myself.
Aono wants.
To kill American soldiers.
Captain, how old are your children?
Much older.
I see...
I'm not related to the children.
Been looking after them ever since their mother got sick.
I'm not worried when you're the guardian.
Neither am I.
When you are leading.
We are grateful for someone such as yourself.
Thank you for your effort.
How much food do we have left?
Don't think about that.
Yes!
They will return.
We need to relocate.
Fast!
We'll move to the 2nd alternative tonight.
What about the food supplies?
Move them out separately.
Regrettable.
Just settle into some normalcy and this happens.
Now we have to give it up.
How much further?
It's here.
The base of the mountain that we spotted the camp.
Anything from the grasshopper?
The last report:
There's no signs of life.
Japs must've gone up.
And over that ridge.
What about the other side of the mountain?
Can they even make it over the coral ridge?
One thing's for certain.
They're gonna leave a pretty big trail.
Let's hope so.
Alright!
Munroe.
Move out!
They must've known we were coming.
Hey!
Water!
Wait!
There's no fresh water on this island!
- Corpsman!
- Captain!
Captain, over here!
- Get the corpsman over here!
- Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
- Sergeant!
Don't move.
Oh my god!
Alright, you better keep it safe.
40cc's
Captain?
Oh, Jesus Christ!
How you doing pal?
First they...
Disappear into the mist?
And then he baits us for water?
And we don't even know what he looks like?
- Sergeant.
- He's a fucking fox.
Sergeant, take it easy.
Save your energy.
You take care buddy.
Atten hut!
Men!
I have a problem.
And you can bet you fucking me, if I have a problem
You now have a problem!
I've just received an ass chewing from Washington!
The brass is wondering why they've received reports of enemy activities on Saipan!
?
An island that I assured them that we had secured!
Over 4 months ago!
Now I would like to report back in the not too distant fucking future!
That all enemy hostilities have ceased on this island!
Gentlemen we will hunt.
And we will destroy any and all opposition on that mountain
Within the next 7 days.
Further!
I'm hearing some kinda nonsense!
About a Japanese officer who thinks he's too smart to be caught!
A Fox!
Sir.
Say again?
Some of the men say He's smart like a fox, sir.
Some of the men say He's smart like a fox, sir.
Bullshit!
That is complete and utter bullshit!
Even if there's a guy up there running the show!
I will tell you this!
He will be gone.
Gone.
Gone straight to hell.
In under a week.
I promise you that.
The enemies' area of operation is limited to 4 miles long and 3 miles wide Around the base of the mountain.
These 200 or so Jap soldiers are holed up in this area.
And I know
I have your assurance that every last one of them will be flushed out.
You will make a full division sweep of the whole god damn area.
I want a line 3 miles wide and marines at arms length.
Forget about the Japs.
Anything that's moving or alive I want found.
I want those Japs in custody or in the ground.
Good luck, gentlemen.
Huge lines of Americans outflanking us.
The situation will quickly spiral out of control.
We need the civilians out of the way.
The civilians are hampering us.
We need to ensure the civilians are safe!
Mt Tapochau's eastern side is endless stretches of cliffs.
But there are caves interjecting the cliffs.
We will keep the civilians out of harm's way there.
Slowly
The caves are camouflaged by the jungle's tree line.
They will be safe up there.
Those searching the jungle will never find them.
It's our only way.
C'mon.
I am sorry.
- Slowly.
- Mother.
What is it?
Okuno's not going up.
My mother's too old and frail, sir.
She's afraid of heights and claustrophobia.
She'll be more trouble than help.
Fucking...
You guys got anything down there?
- Nothing here!
- Alright!
Move out!
What about that area at the base of the mountain?
Over!
- Yeah!
Okay...
- See anything?
See anything up there?
Over.
Nothing buddy.
Don't see a thing.
- Keep your eyes up!
- Hey, pick it up.
They know the land a lot better than we do.
- Sis, I'm not feeling well.
- A little while longer...
I'm uncomfortable.
Check your left.
Check your right.
Coast is clear.
- Pick it up...
- Let's go...
What have you got?
- Keep your eyes open.
- See anything?
- Not a damn thing.
Fuck!
Incoming!
Shit!
How many!
?
- You gotta be...
- Here they come!
C'mon!
Go, go...!
- Go, go, go!
- He's on me!
He's on me!
- Keep firing!
Shit!
- Ambush!
Grenade!
- That guy's behind that rock!
- Move it for the right!
Motherfuckers!
Down!
- To your left!
- Move!
Move...!
Grenade!
Let's take a look at how we did.
Captain!
What have we gained?
All those marines at our disposal.
We captured six scared civilians!
Killed 3 Jap soldiers!
And lost 11 U.S. marines!
We failed.
We underestimated, sir.
underestimated?
We couldn't even find them for Christ's sake!
Who is this Fox character Lewis?
What is his fucking name?
Is he some kinda magician?
Is he Harry Houdini!
?
He's responsible for the booby traps.
And he's probably the one who marked the baby for us to find Colonel.
He's a clever man.
Clever my ass.
What do you think the brass is gonna say?
We did shit!
That's what they're gonna say.
And they'd be right!
Get outta my fucking office!
Don't hate the military...
Iron rice bowl and chopsticks...
Unfortunately, not Buddha...
For a meal.
Really good for nothing...
Nothing like some labor work.
I am that kinda person.
That's right!
I'll kill 100 American soldiers.
Already killed 31.
If I kill 10 everyday.
I'll achieve lots in a week!
What are you doing?
I want to kill them all.
Excuse me?
I heard you had a woman here that knows about "The Fox".
Fox.
What fox?
All the civilians we brought down from the mountain?
They're all civilians here, Captain.
Where's the people that came down the mountain?
Mountain.
Oh Yes!
Haruko.
- Ms. Haruko.
- Captain.
Wait!
You can't go in there.
Haruko?
I am Haruko.
- Sorry.
- It's alright.
I would like to inquire about "The Fox"?
Fox?
The Japanese commander of Mt Tapochau.
Is that your commander?
He left a red marker for the rescue of a baby.
Is he a good commander?
I'm not sure if it's the same person?
You call him...
"The Fox" but we call him
Captain Oba.
Oba?
Oba Sakae, the Commander.
Oba Sakae...
- Colonel.
- Big man.
Thank you , sir.
I still don't get the Japs, Captain.
Captain Sakae Oba.
18th Imperial Infantry.
"The Fox"
That's his name, Colonel.
Is that a fact?
Take care, Lewis.
Good luck, sir
When you get this Oba character You tell him something for me.
Yes, sir.
What's that sir?
You tell him
Tell him he's a son of a bitch.
Be sure to let him know, sir.
Attention!
Breezy.
Take me to the airfield.
Yes, sir.
Dismissed!
You know the first thing that I did when I found out I was assigned to Saipan.
Was to grab that fishing rod.
Might never use it but at least I can think about it.
Well.
I hope the day we can all go fishing will come sooner than later, sir.
So do I, Captain.
So do I.
Atten hut!
It's no secret you know more about this place than I do.
I would like to hear your thoughts.
Tell me what you know.
Well, sir.
We've been carrying out the directives from the psych warfare boys in an effort to get them to surrender.
We've had... some success with individual stragglers but...
Not with the larger groups we think that are still hiding out in the mountain.
Sit down.
And what would you do differently?
Well, sir I'd like to continue with this leaflets.
But I would like to make some on our own.
Tailored specifically to the holdouts on this island.
And we have to stop using the word Toku (benefit).
The Japanese are very proud people and they would not surrender.
I'm aware of that, Captain.
Go on.
We need to give them a way out without shaming themselves.
Perhaps tell them to cease resistance rather than surrender.
Alright, Captain.
Right now you pursue that course of action.
But just know that our time is limited.
So keep me in the loop.
That's all, dismissed.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Captain?
You seem to have an understanding of this culture.
What is at the heart of this absolute commitment the Japanese have to no surrender?
Are you familiar with this, sir?
"Camp Susupe" Internment camp for Japanese civilians.
"Assembly Hall"
I would like to save the lives of the Japanese people in the mountains.
I do not want any more to die.
I'll be sending messages dropped by planes.
Help me.
Please consider?
For myself.
Due to the invading Americans
I have lost friends and family.
My two children are dead.
We must decline.
Captain.
I don't want Japan or America
To further engage in this unnecessary war.
I would like to help.
Really.
Really help me?
Yes.
Don't pick it up!
That's enemy propaganda!
Leave it!
What's this?
Is it real?
Photos of Tokyo.
Bito?
You were born in Asakusa, right?
I'm not sure...
But it's near Ginza.
Tokyo's a ghost town.
Kazuo?
Yes.
I have seen the photo on the flyers.
Know any of the civilians in the shelter (Susupe Camp)?
Oba.
Akio.
C'mon.
Two days ago.
Leaflets were dropped.
The photo on the flyer...
Is it real?
I had a hand in producing the flyer.
This photo is not the only one.
There are others.
Numerous horrific photos of Japan.
It is to make you understand.
Cease your operations.
This is as good a time as any.
We... will not respond to claims in the flyers.
Please reconsider, Captain.
I heard,
There are enough bombs to destroy the whole of Japan.
Everyday planes take off from this island.
Oba?
May I enquire?
Up in the mountain.
Is there a pair of siblings?
Yes.
Wonderful!
Great.
They are my children.
Since the war.
I haven't seen them.
Please take care of them.
Oba?
Do you have time?
Here.
Look at him before leaving.
Are you living well?
Captain.
Leave.
- Please...
- Who was that!
?
- I don't understand...
- What was he doing?
Take a look!
- I got nothing!
- Check the windows!
- No one's here.
- You got anything?
What was Oba doing in the camp?
Gathering information and supplies.
He was trying to
- verify some photo.
- And?
I told him it was true.
He was shocked.
Colonel.
I think we need to try something more aggressive to get them to surrender.
Such as?
We should promise them Food and medicine.
- When they come we set a trap.
- And capture them.
- No... no.
Absolutely not!
That would not be honorable nor very effective.
If we do that the others left on the mountain will never surrender.
Colonel, treachery here is not the answer.
Motoki, I will go up the mountain.
Please translate that I will convince the commander to surrender.
Mr. Baba says he will go up the mountain.
And convince them to come down.
Well, Mr. Baba, if a Japanese person like yourself can convince them to down down
I'm happy to have you try.
Perhaps a little Japanese to Japanese talk will do us all some good.
At this point, we have nothing to lose.
The Colonel agrees.
Thank you.
Captain, you have my permission to do whatever you need to do.
To bring about a better peaceful resolution.
Please make sure Motoki-san here, gets whatever he needs too.
Ito?
Ito!
We're out of medicine and bandages.
How do you expect me to work this way?
Cool down.
We are aware of the lack medical supplies.
Don't you understand!
?
I have no antibiotics to help anyone!
People will die!
My comrades have died as well!
Enough!
Both of you.
We can get drugs and medicine from the shelter hospital (Susupe Camp).
Only I know what is needed.
- So let me go with you
- For the drugs...
I will find a way.
- Commander?
- Move it!
Faster!
Walk faster!
Move!
- Kneel.
- This bastard is a Yankee lackey.
Baba?
Why are you here?
I'm here to convince you to surrender.
Do you think we're weak!
?
Stop!
The Americans put you up to this?
I'm doing this for my children...
You're not here to see your children.
You're here to sniff out our defenses.
I want to save my children!
I want to take them safe!
Is that wrong!
?
Shut up!
Traitor!
You have shamed Imperial Japan!
Stop your tears.
Your children will never look up to you again.
Leave.
Oba?
If my children are killed
I'll never forgive you.
Aono, what is it?
Where are we going?
Gonna show me something?
What?
I need your help.
What is it?
Please wait outside.
I will call you if he agrees to meet with you.
Okay.
But if and only if he agrees.
I don't want him to think that we're trying to track him.
Of course, captain.
Don't worry about us.
We'll stay outta your way.
Thank you.
"Medical Supply Room"
Quickly...
Wait...
It's time.
Thank you.
This will be most helpful.
Oba?
Would you not reconsider?
Enough!
We will fight to the last breath.
In fact, I have brought the U.S. Captain.
Fall back!
No. it isn't me.
Get back!
Get back!
Get em' clear!
Go...!
C'mon!
Let's go!
Don't shoot!
Stop!
You don't understand!
Don't shoot!
- Fire!
- Men down!
Fire!
Fire...!
- Captain!
- Cover!
Help the Captain!
- Japs through the fence!
- Japs on the left!
Get em' ...!
Aono!
Captain!
Fall back!
Going into the trees!
Cover!
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
Copper?
Danny?
Get them out of here.
- The hell just happened?
- Alright!
Check these men!
- Yes, sir!
- I don't know.
River's not gonna make it.
Somebody's over here!
Let's get these guys to the hospital.
Captain.
You alright?
I'm fine.
A traitor?
What?
Traitor's Japanese.
Horiuchi's dead.
Aono... may still be alive.
We must not let the civilians go to the shelters.
Don't you understand?
They will only be a pawn for the enemy.
They'll be killed.
Food and medicine are in short supply.
We can no longer take care of them.
Think of the civilians.
Wouldn't it be better for them in the shelter?
Captain.
Though you are the commander.
You are no different from the enemy.
I beg to differ.
I believe.
Japan will once again set foot on this land.
And when that time comes.
I hope you will
Remember Mount Tapochau often.
During this time that we have stayed together.
And through everything we've endured.
These memories will not be in vain.
Bring these back with you to Japan!
Oshiro?
It's been an honour.
Truth is.
I'm relieved to leave.
C'mon.
TO OUR GOOD AND LOYAL SUBJECTS:
We have ordered our government to communicate to the governments of the United States,
Great Britain, China and the Soviet Union that Our Empire accepts the provisions of their Joint Declaration.
Emperor Hirohito's announcement of Japan's unconditional surrender was recorded and later broadcast to his loyal subjects.
Here too at Camp Susupe.
This is impossible!
This is propaganda!
They have time and again tried to deceive us!
They want all of us dead!
Enough of this nonsense!
Ikegami?
Why didn't you leave with the rest?
Why are you still here?
I believe in the commander
And your ability to overcome.
I will not leave.
I am not sure I'll win.
What will you say then?
I never thought of that.
Think carefully.
Report.
Security at the shelter has become lax.
We can penetrate effortlessly.
Find out why!
According to the Americans.
The Army of the Empire of Greater Japan has lost.
August 6th, Hiroshima.
August 9th, Nagasaki.
A new bomb was detonated.
Cities and towns were destroyed
Countless dead.
That's why..
His Majesty, the Emperor
Ordered an end of hostilities.
Japan...
Lost.
Fight to the last breath!
Remember our commands!
Even with the knowledge of Japan's total capitulation.
Neither Oba nor his men are willing to come down off the mountain.
You wanted to meet me, Colonel?
Yeah!
Come in, Captain.
according to a message from the Japanese camp.
Oba is saying that he wants to meet.
Oba does?
Has he agreed to surrender?
No.
He wants to meet with the representatives of the American armed forces.
Captain Oba is nothing, if not consistent.
He wants it his way, right til the bitter end.
I like to be the one to meet him.
If you would permit me, sir.
Permission granted.
Thank you, sir.
You admire him.
Don't you, Captain?
I do, sir.
Where'd you learn English?
In Singapore.
Because of war.
You speak good English.
Thank you.
You got a American girlfriend?
No.
Watch the road.
Please stop.
What's that?
You guys wait here.
That man that night killed...
I apologize.
Captain Lewis is able to speak Japanese.
He would like speak to you.
Commander Oba?
It's a real honour.
I lived in Japan for 2 years.
I really like Kabuki actor Uzaemon.
Unfortunately he died.
If there's another war
That will be most tragic.
You fought honorably.
But the war is over.
We are no longer your enemy.
Captain Oba.
Let's return to Japan.
We will not surrender.
Neither do we intend come down the mountain.
However...
Imperial military doctrine states absolute obedience to their superiors.
Commands with strict compliance.
Really?
- Hold your fire!
- Wait, wait...!
Why?
He is a traitor.
I was just doing my duty.
Commander Oba?
Will you let this go on?
Will you let this go on!
?
Okuno?
Yes?
I heard the Captain is coming down from the mountain.
Really?
We'll prepare some clean clothes for them.
We'll soon see the Captain?
Captain and his men can wear these.

At the foot of Mount Tapochau on the island of Saipan.
Following 512 days of fighting, the war finally ended for Captain Sakae Oba and his army of 47.
Did you know Captain Oba?
That we have named you "The Fox".
Fox?
Possesses stealth, highly crafty and evasive.
I do not have that kind of ability.
Just fighting dedication.
Sir?
You'll stay here.
Thank you.
Captain Oba?
No matter what others think.
You have commanded well, for the last 2 and half years you spent in the mountain.
You saved the lives of 200 Japanese.
I believed.
Personally that to be awarded more lives
is more rewarding than gaining an island.
Am I right?
Aono.
May I hold him?
This child knows nothing about Japan.
I will teach him.

June 15th 1944
The U.S. military forces invade Saipan in the Northern Marianna's group of island
The Marines moves ashore establishing themselves on the south-west coast on their way of taking control of the island
under The Japanese control, Saipan is called home by 20,000 of its citizens and defended by over 30 thousand highly trained members of the imperial fighting forces.
Though one of the most strategically most important of the Japanese strong holds in the Pacific
Saipan defenses folds under the onslaught of the
American war machine numbering over 70,000 strong
In issuing battle, the majority of Japanese defenders are annihilated
And the survivors flee to Mount Tapochau located at the center of the island
Unbeknownst to the Japanese on the island, the Imperial Navy suffers a humiliating defeat in the sea of the Mariannes
Leaving the Imperial command no choice but to abandon the defense in Saipan
The uniformed defenders however continue to fight believing in inevitable victory of their imperial forces and their nation
Get out the way
Get a move on
Move this thing over, come on.
Move out of the way
Sorry about that Captain.
Carry on
Come on. come on.
Get out of the road.
Hey clear the way
God damn, mini Japs.
This time tomorrow their pants going to be overflow in no time, just a few days those yellow monkeys in the mountain are going to be history
You know their orders are to stop us no mater what
Those Japanese soldier are tough, they don't give up
You have no idea what you're talking about corporal,
I advise you to keep opinion to yourself
Right, sir.
Watch it
You take it easy corporal, or I'm taking the jeep and you walk, you read me?
Yes, sir.
Shit!
We should've stopped
Look they just Japs sir.
They'll be fine
What thats mean sir?
The Japanese treasure every meeting for it they never recur
If you pay attention, you might actually learn something while you're here
We did you learn to Lingo sir?
You date a Jap girlfriend or something?
I studied it in Japan two years, unfortunately never got around a Japanese girlfriend.
I bet you wanted to
Keep your eyes on the road Mr.
Yes sir
- You're Lewis?
- Yes, sir.
Have a seat Captain, we're not that formal here not in this damn heat
Thank you, sir.
I hear you speak Japanese.
The Japanese would say otherwise.
I know the basic sir
- Where you're from?
- Boston, sir.
So you're any Ivy league huh?
You could say that.
I'll try not to hold against you.
I need your help, Lewis
I do not understand these Japs
Bushido suicide thing.
Its a...
Well its crazy.
Well it's a matter of pride.
Its a way of thinking you been nurturing their head for centuries
What?
Killing themselves?
Are you?
Are you familiar with this, sir.
Can't say that I am, what are they?
Kinda Jap lucky charms?
No sir.
There are shogi pieces
Japanese chess pieces if you like.
They are all look the same except for the writing and the sign
So?
The only thing differentiate your pieces from mine, is the direction that their facing on the board
Get to the point Captain
Yes sir.
Unlike our chess, if I were to take one of your pieces
I don't hold on to it waiting for you to reclaim it
I just simply turn it around and use it against you.
As part of my army
What the hell does it have to do with them killing themselves
The Japanese put a high price on loyalty to one master
If one were to be taken a prisoner, it would expect a behaviour for them to serve the new lord with equal loyalty
Well now, if that were true why wont they come surrender and come fight on our side
Well sir, if they were to be taken prisoner, there's a chance they could end up betraying their emperor
So they choose to die instead of taking the chance that might happen
You see sir, The Japanese
Captain, I didn't come here to play a fucking chess.
Now, if these Japs want to die, I'll more than happy to oblige that
Honorably or otherwise
I just want to get this damn war over with
Are we clear?

On the day following the suicide General Saito and his four commanders the tattered remnant of Japanese forces gathered near the western coast of the island for a final assault against the invaders
The Americans however remain completely unaware of their movements
Alright
Keep us posted on a regular basis
You find out there you boys will be interested in, I let you know
Come home and stay sharp

On the 7th of July in what came to be known by the banzai attack
Over 4,000 Japanese and close to 2,000 American lives were lost in a space of only a few hours
Two days later, the American commander would declare a total military victory on the island of Saipan
Alright pick it up
Keep your eyes open
- Hangs up
- See if you don't pay attention
Keep your eyes open, check out them out because it could be some lives one
Here, near Mount Toucha
Its the place where the Japanese are calling the valley of hell
It was here that General Saito along with his other commanders committed suicide in front of men
And they did this the night before they launch the attack
The night before?
Thats right sir
The night before the attack
If they want to die for their god emperor
Though they just assume to take us with them
They kill themselves the night before even the battlefield.
What sense does that make?
Well by dying this way in front of their men,
They're showing their men the way.
They setting an example
Continue sergeant
Now up here, mark your point
Calling this cliff, The Banzai Cliff
Because apparently civilians are threw themselves into the rock the sea below
Women, children, entire families spar-killing themselves sir
Women and children?
Why?
Seem that the Japanese military had told them
That we Americans are cannibals and torturers
They're terrified sir
The Japs has lost their commanders and we've crushed their army
Now I tell you boys, the innocent thing
Thank god for that
Because this must stop right now
You're right colonel
But I feel we can't be too optimistic about this, this is still a volatile situation
I like try and convince them to surrender sir
You want to talk to them?
They have no food left, with no freshwater around this island
They're also have go nothing to lose
I refuse to lose even one more man on that mountain
You got one month captain

One thing for certain they going to leave a big trail

Men, I have a problem
And you can bet you fucking me when I have a problem, you now have a problem
I've just received word from washington
The brass are wondering why they are receiving reports of enemy activity in Saipan.
On the island I assured them we had secured over 4 months ago
Now I would like report back in not to distance fucking future that all enemy hostility has ceased on this island
Gentlemen, we will hunt, and we will destroy any and all opposition on that mountain, within the next 7 days
Further I'm hearing some kind of nonsense about a
Japanese officer who thinks he too smart to get caught
A fox, sir.
Say again
Some of the say he's smart like a fox, sir.
Someone been saying he's smart like a fox
Bullshit
That is complete and utter bullshit
If there is a guy out there running the show, I will tell you this
He will be gone
Gone.
Gone straight to hell in under a week
I promise you that
The enemies area of operation is limited to 4 miles long and 3 miles wide around the base of the mountain
These 300 or so Japanese soldiers are hold up in this area and I know I have your insurances every last one of them will be flush out
You will make a full division sweep of that whole god damn area
I want a line 3 miles wide and a width an arm length
Forget about the Japs, anything thats moving or alive I want found
I want those Japs in custody or in the ground
Good luck gentlemen
Fucking log

Looks clear

Lets take a look at what we did captain
What have we gain?
All those marines are at our disposal
We captured six scared civilians
Kill three Japs soldiers and lost 11 US marines
We failed
We underestimate them, sir.
Underestimate them?
We could even find them for christ sake
Who is this fuck character Lewis?
What is his fucking name?
ls he some kind of a magician?
ls he Harry Houdini?
He's responsible for the bobby traps and he's probably the who mark the baby for us to find colonel
He's a clever man
Clever my ass
What do you think The Brass are going to say?
We did shit, thats what they're going to say and they maybe right
Get out of my fucking office
Excuse me, I heard you got a woman here who knows about the fox
The fox, what fox?
All the civilians we brought down from the mountains
They're all civilians here captain
Captain wait you can't go in there
- Colonel
- Big man
Thank you sir
I still don't get the Japs captain
Captain Sekae Oba, 18th Imperial Infantry

Well I hope one day we can go fishing come sooner than later sir
So do I captain.
So do I
Atten-hut
There's no secret you know more about this place than I do
I like to hear your thoughts, tell me what you know
Well sir we been carry the directus from the site warfare boys in an effort to get them to surrender
We had some success with individual stragglers
Not with the larger group whom we think they still hiding out in the mountains
Sit down
What would you do differently?
Well sir I want to continue this leaflets
But I would like to make some of our own.
Tailored specifically to the hold out on this island and we have to stop using the word Toco
The Japanese are a very proud people and they will not surrender
I'm aware of that captain
Go on
We need to give them a away out without shaming themselves sir
Perhaps tell them to cease resistance rather than surrender
Alright captain
Right now you pursue that course of action
Just that know our time is limited so keep me in the loop
That's all, dismissed
Yes sir, thank you sir
Captain
You seem to have an understanding of this culture
What is at the heart of this absolute commitment to Japanese have in no surrender?
Are you familiar with this sir?
Captain
I do not want Japan or America to further engage in this unnecessary war
I would try to help
Really?
Who was that?
What was he doing?
Take a look
- I got nothing
- Check the windows
- No one's here
- You got anything?
What was Oba doing in the camp?
Gathering information and supplies
He was trying to verify some photos and?
I told him, it was true, he was shocked
Colonel I think we need to try something more aggressive to get them to surrender
Such as?
We should promise them food and medicine
When they come, we lay a trap and capture them
No, absolutely not, that will not honorable nor very effective
If we do that, the other left on the mountain will never surrender
Colonel, treachery here is not the answer
Mr Baba says he will go up the Mountain and convince them to come down
Well Mr Baba, The Japanese person like yourself can convince them to come down, I'm happy have you try
Perhaps a little Japanese to Japanese talk will us all some good
At this point we have nothing to lose
Captain, you have my permission to do what ever you need to do to bring back a peaceful resolution
Please make sure that Motoki-son here gets what ever he needs to
Please wait outside
I will call you if he agrees to meet with you
Okay, if only if he agrees

Emperor Hirahito announcement of Japan unconditional surrenders were recorded and later broadcast to his loyal subject
Even with the knowledge of Japan total capitulation, neither Oba nor his men are willing to come down off the mountain
- You wanted to see me colonel
- Yeah come in captain
According to a message from the Japanese camp,
Oba is saying that he wanted to meet
Oda does?
Has he agree to surrender?
No

June 15th, 1944.
The U.S. military invades Saipan and the Northern Mariana's group of islands.
The marines moved ashore.
Establishing themselves on the Southwest coast.
On their way, taking control of the island.
Under Japanese control Saipan is called home by 20,000 over citizens.
And defended by over 30,000 highly trained members of the imperial fighting forces.
Though one of the most strategically important of the Japanese strongholds in the pacific.
Saipan's defenses folded.
Under the onslaught of the American war machines, numbering over 70,000 strong.
And in the ensuing battle the majority of the Japanese defenders are annihilated.
And the survivors flee to Mount Tapochau.
Located at the centre of the island.

Enemy planes!
Stay put!
It hurts!
Hey!
Naito!
Naito!
Unbeknownst to the Japanese on the island.
The imperial navy suffers a humiliating defeat in the seas off the mariana's
Making the imperial command no choice.
But to abandon the defense of Saipan.
The uninformed defenders however continued to fight.
Believing in the inevitable victory of their hallowed imperial forces.
And their nation.
Get outta way!
Get a move on!
Clear the way!
Pull this thing over!
C'mon move outta the way!
Sorry bout that!
Captain!
Carry on!
C'mon!
C'mon!
Get outta the road!
Hey!
Clear the way!
God damn, many Japs!
This time tomorrow!
The camp's gotten be overflown in no time!
Just a few days, those yellow monkey's in the mountain gonna be history.
You know their orders are to stop us no matter what.
This Japanese soldiers are tough.
They don't give up.
You have no idea what you're talking about, Corporal.
I'll advise you to keep your opinions to yourself.
Right, sir.
Dammit!
Watch it!
Hey!
Take it easy, Corporal!
Or I'm taking the jeep and you're walking.
You read me!
?
Yes, sir.
Are you alright?
Shit...
- I should've stopped.
- Look.
They're just Japs, sir.
They'll be fine.
Every Japanese knows there's only once in a lifetime to be sincere.
What's that mean, sir?
The Japanese treasure every meeting for it.
They never recur.
If you pay attention.
You might actually learn something while you're here.
Where'd you learn your lingo, sir?
You date a Jap girlfriend or something?
I studied in Japan two years.
Unfortunately, I never got around having a girlfriend.
Bet you wanted to.
Keep your eyes on the road mister.
Yes, sir.
The remaining troops are to evacuate immediately to matanza.
Our, Imperial Japanese Army...
Of the 43rd, division.
Under the command of His Excellency Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito.
Will prevail til the end.
We will hold our line til the 4th of July.
Is this the final offensive?
Victory finally.
The enemy will finally see our wraith.
Command requires that only capable and those healthy to matanza.
Those unwell are to stand down.
That is all!
Hold him tight!
Hold on!
Hurts doesn't it?
I understand.
Captain
If I may...
I do not wish to go to matanza.
I want to stay and tend to the wounded.
It's only right.
I cannot leave them to the enemy.
You're Louis.
Yes, sir.
Have a sit, Captain.
We're not that formal here.
Not in this damn place...
Thank you, sir.
I hear you speak Japanese.
Well, the Japanese would say otherwise.
I know the basic's, sir.
Where' you from?
Boston, sir.
So you're a Ivy leaguer, huh?
You could say that.
I'll try not to hold it against you.
I need your help, Louis.
I don't understand this Japs.
This a...
Bushido and suicide thing...
It's a...
Well!
It's crazy.
Well, It's a... it's a matter of pride.
It's a way of thinking.
They've been nurturing in their heads for centuries.
What?
Kill themselves?
Are you?
Are you familiar with this, sir.
Can't say that I am.
What are they?
Some kinda...
Jap lucky charms?
No, sir.
Their shogi pieces.
Their Japanese chess pieces.
If you will.
They all look the same except for the writing inside.
So?
Well...
The only thing that differentiates your pieces from mine, is the direction their facing.
Get to the point, Captain.
Yes sir.
Unlike our chess.
If I were to take one of your pieces.
I don't hold onto it.
Waiting for you to reclaim it.
I just simply turn it around.
And use it against you.
As part of my army.
What the hell does that have to do with killing themselves!
?
The Japanese put a high price on loyalty to one's master.
If one were to be taken prisoner.
It would be expected behaviour for them to serve the new lord...
With equal loyalty.
Now if that were true.
Why wouldn't they just surrender and fight on our side?
Well, sir.
If they were to be taken prisoner.
There's a chance they could end up betraying their emperor.
So they choose to die.
Instead of taking the chances that might happen.
You see, sir.
The Japanese...
Captain!
I didn't come here to play fucking chess.
Now if these Japs want to die?
I'll be more than happy to oblige them.
Honorably or otherwise.
I just want to get this damn war over with.
Are we clear?
Crystal clear, sir.
Little girl...
She's running a fever.
Drink some water.
Enemies!
Man the machinegun!
Quickly!
Get up!
Attack!
Here's the entrance!
You're up!
Frag that cave!
Now he throws it in!
Merry Christmas!
Nips!
Hold!
- Cover the entrance!
- Got it!
Cave's clear!
What'd you got?
Got one!
- Move out!
- Yeah!
yeah!
- I want a belly man!
- What's a belly man?
Give it.
I have two children of my own.
Follow me.
We need to get supplies from naval.
Won't our army do that?
Once the offensive is at hand.
We won't have a chance.
Naval command's not launching any offensive, so continue to hold the defense.
We'll wait for the combined fleet to recapture the island.
Arrival of the combined fleet will not be long.
Who is this?
My subordinate.
Even without naval support?
We are going to fight!
?
- Insolence!
- Quiet!
Keep your silence.
Captain, I will tell the rest tonight.
That even without naval support I am not afraid to die.
I want to win the war.
As do I!
No!
You just want to die.
That's not true.
Dying may be necessary.
But not unnecessary sacrifice.
Death will not ensure our victory!
We must kill as many enemies to ensure our army's victory!
Never forget this!
I am addressing the officers and men to the Imperial Army on Saipan.
For more than twenty days since the American devils attacked, the officers, men and civilian employees of the Imperial Army and Navy on this island.
Have fought well and bravely.
I expected that every man would do his duty.
Heaven has not given us an opportunity.
We have fought in unison up to the present time
Despite the bitterness of defeat we pledge "seven lives to repay our country".
Whether we attack or we stay, there is only death.
Man who realize the true value of the Empire
Utilize this opportunity to exalt true Japanese manhood.
Saipan is the breakwater in the Pacific.
Leave my bones on Saipan as a bulwark of the Pacific.
As it says in the Senjinkun battle ethics,
Never suffer disgrace and will offer up the courage of my soul.
For the eternal life of the emperor and the welfare of the country!
BANZAI!
July 7th, 1944
On the day following the suicide of General Saito and his four commanders.
The tattered remnants of the Japanese forces.
Gathered near the western coast of the island for a final assault against the invaders.
The Americans however, remained completely unaware of their movements.
Keep us posted on a regular basis.
You find anything out there, you boys will be interested in?
I'll let you know.
Come home normal.
- Stay sharp.
- Roger.
- Mikey!
?
Let's go.
- Coming, sir.
I sure miss those Hawaiian gals.
Oh yeah, those girls are sweet.
Incoming!
- Holy Shit!
Japs everywhere!
- We got company!
Japs!
Get to your firearm!
Charge!
Charge!
Long live the Empire of Japan!
Cover!
Cover!
Get on the horn!
Able Victor Crow.
This is Victor Blue.
Can you read?
Victor Blue.
This is Able Victor Crow.
Go ahead, over.
Look out
This is Victor Crow!
We getting a god damn Jap banzai attack!
- We'll be trying to hold them back!
- Get the Captain...
Get the, Captain!
Captain!
?
Requesting immediate fire mission on my mark!
1 stick 4 items!
I say again!
1 stick 4 items!
Fire for effect...!
C'mon!
Get outta here!
Victor Blue.
Repeat last transmission.
Over.
Victor Blue.
Repeat last transmission.
Over.
Mike!
Get your ass up!
We're going in the field!
Captain.
That's kravits.
- I think it's been overrun.
- Shit...
Find out what's going now.
On the 7th of July.
And what came to be known as the Banzai Attack.
Over 4,000 Japanese and close to 2,000 American lives were lost in a space of over 2 hours.
Two days later, the American commanders would declare a total military victory on the island of Saipan.
Keep your eyes open!
Check em' out!
Could be some live ones!
So you fear death?
Who are you?
Speak of the dead.
Horiuchi, Kesamatsu.
Private First Class.
Here!
Near Mt Tapochau.
It's a place the Japanese are calling the Valley of Hell.
It was here that General Saito along with his other commanders here committed suicide in front of their men.
And they did this the night before they launched the attack.
The night before!
?
That's right, sir.
The night before the attack.
They want to die for their god emperor.
Though they just assume, take us with them.
They kill themselves...
The night before hitting the battlefield.
What sense does that make!
?
Well, by dying this way in front of their men.
They're showing their men the way.
They're setting an example.
Continue, sergeant.
Now up here.
Marpi point.
Calling these cliffs, the Banzai cliffs.
Because apparently civilians are throwing themselves into the rocks in the sea below.
Women, children and entire families are killing themselves, sir.
Women and children?
Why!
?
Seems that the Japanese military has told them.
That we Americans are cannibals and torturers.
They are terrified, sir.
The Japs has lost their commanders.
And we've crushed their armies.
Now I tell you boys.
The end is in sight.
Thank god for that.
Because this must stop now!
You're right colonel.
But I feel we can't be too optimistic about this.
This is still a volatile situation.
I'd like to try to convince them to surrender, sir.
You want to talk to them?
They have no more food left.
With no fresh water on this island.
They've also got nothing to lose.
I refuse to lose even one more men on that mountain!
You've got one month, Captain!
After that!
I'll blow them all to hell.
Thank you, sir.
Hey!
Water!
Water!
Open Open
Where?
Live.
Captain.
Kind as you are.
This may expose us to the enemy.
The enemy may save this child.
And the price for that is our death?
How could this line
We Mania is to retrieve only to fight
come on
Ah this is really a dilemma
What kinda name is that?
Kellangly.
- You don't look italian.
- Check those bodies.
Navajo, sir.
- Articquelly
- You two over there by the shed!
Means troublemaker.
Grandfather rode with roosevelt and the roughriders in Cuba.
Meet my grandmother in Cuba.
Now that's trouble.
Fact.
You don't mind if I call you trouble?
Everybody else does.
Guys hear that?
Probably a trap.
I don't think you should go in there, sir.
Thank you, sergeant.
Let's make sure we get this little guy some help, huh?
Yes, sir.
He's got your eyes, sergeant.
Make sure no to lose him on the way back to camp.
Get him some water.
How you suggest I do that?
You take your thumb.
You're gonna dip it in your canteen.
And you're gonna let him suck on it.
Just like you do.
Shut up!
You want Japs to hear you?
Now spread out and finish clearing the area.
Move!
And take that damn thing off your head.
Captain?
Captain's alive?
You're guys alright?
Captain's back and we're be better.
Stand...
Salute!
Toshio of 1st Battalion, 18th Regiment.
I'm Oba.
We're on our way to base camp, western slope of Mt Tapochau.
We'll use the dense jungle.
Even light hardly penetrates.
Best for concealment.
Look at this!
What is it?
Here.
American devils been here.
Why are we delaying?
Ambush.
How are we sure they're cross here?
It's the only road leading to Marpi point.
And my gut feeling.
Alright take five!
Anyone got any water?
Here.
I've got a little.
Private, how many times have I got to tell ya.
About the marvels of water conservation?
- Sergeant, it was full this morning.
- You're fucking useless!
You go without it.
You get me killed.
And I'm coming back and I'm gonna kill you.
- You got it?
- Yes, Sergeant.
Take a load fuckin...
Grenade...
Grenade
There's another one over here, LT...
Sergeant?
There's a hidden path over here.
Fucking yellow monkeys.
How stupid do they think we are...
Well.
What are you waiting on?
Alright.
Let's see what this takes us.
C'mon.
Get.
Let's go...
Watch your spaces...
Quiet...
Munroe?
I don't like this.
Let's get outta here.
Everyone fall back!
- Attack!
- Incoming!
- Aim high!
- Cover me!
Look out
Fall back!
Cease fire!
I suppose you're gonna try and tell me the Japs did this on purpose.
Well, sir!
They just disappeared!
Check the wounded!
He's gone, sergeant.
Is smoke also in your calculations?
Coincidence.
Show yourself!
Hold your fire.
Who are you?
Kazuo Oshiro.
How many people live here?
I have not done a count...
Maybe about... 200.
200!
?
We have got storages of food,
Drugs from a hospital.
And a nurse's station.
I heard the words to the shelter will endure hunger and torture
There are many people stranded here
Marine Corps, lieutenant Kinbara.
Nagata.
Sakae Oba of the 18th Infantry Regiment of the Imperial Japanese Army.
What's the weapons and ammunition sitrep?
1 light machine gun.
Few launchers and 20 rifles.
However.
We've got 5 U.S. M1 carbine.
10 pistols and ammo.
We're ready to engage the enemy!
We will use the mountain as base.
And conduct guerilla style raids.
This will be one of our military base camp.
Yes!
I hope you will fight bravely.
Captain?
Why can't you led us here?
Our mission is... to take out as many enemies as possible.
You lot are disillusioned.
Why you...
Leave her.
They're heading towards the camp.
Back to camp!
Yes!
Stretcher!
Stretcher!
Tragedy.
hold!
Get him up.
Move!
I'm sorry.
Out of the way!
Look what've you done.
Verify the number of surviving civilians and soldiers
Yes!
Scout for an alternative.
We need another location to accommodate 200 people.
Yes!
Right now!
We have 100 soldiers and 86 civilians.
We are already looking for an alternative camp site.
Under the command of Captain Oba.
We will worked out 3 locations.
1st location will be here!
2nd alternative is to the western slope of Mt Tapochau!
3rd alternative is to the Death Valley!
- Speed up!
It's getting dark!
- Yes!
Please be aware of your surrounding, and not let your families wander off.
Transition to the camp site will soon be completed.
Kazuo?
I have come to realize.
That the civilians and the rest of the soldiers.
Is our duty.
I finally understand.
Oh.
Very detailed.
I taught geography in school.
Are we located here?
You can read?
I know where the mango is.
Very good.
You and sister can mark it out.
Alright.
I can also teach the children.
What's wrong?
Hungry...
Saying it makes you more hungry.
You can't eat a raw snail.
You have to boil it first.
Those hidden in Mt Tapochau!
Japanese soldiers and civilians!
We will not harm you!
The U.S. army will not harm you!
Lay down your arms and surrender!
Feels nice.
C'mon in!
Feels wonderful!
Quit moving around.
Don't listen to the Captain Oba.
Why?
Because he's, commands is like a God's.
Oba and God are in the same league.
You there!
Stop it!
- Get him out!
- Yes!
Crazy bastard!
God said to me.
God love you too.
- Take him away.
- Yes!
Quiet!
I heard he was a Priest.
Losing his mind.
Captain Oba!
Alright.
You try.
C'mon!
You doing it wrong!
Relax your shoulders!
Tuck your knees in!
That a girl!
Hey!
Horiuchi.
Didn't I warn you not to approach the camp?
Align your sight to the tip.
Tuck your knee, Aono.
Knees.
Knees.
Alright!
Straighten up!
Straighten!
Shit!
Damn!
You really pulled the trigger!
Dammit!
Thank you.
Please continue.
Eh...
Your name's Chieko, right?
Try not to act like you're one of the soldiers.
Call me Aono.
Everyone does.
The only thing I want for myself.
Aono is.
To kill U.S. soldiers.
Captain, how old are your children?
Much older.
I see...
I do not know the child.
Been looking after him since his mother was sick.
I'm not worried when you are the parent.
Neither am I worried.
When you are our Captain.
We are grateful for someone such as yourself.
Food for thought.
How much do we have left?
Don't think about this.
Yes!
They will return.
We need to relocate.
Fast!
We move to the 2nd alternative tonight.
What about the food supplies?
Move them out separately.
Regretful.
Just settle for some normally and this happens.
Now we have to give it up.
How much further?
It's here.
The base of the mountain that we spotted the camp.
Anything from the grasshopper?
The last report:
There's no signs of life.
Japs must've gone up.
What about the other side of the mountain?
Can they even make it over the coral ridge?
One thing's for certain.
They're gonna leave a pretty big trail.
Let's hope so.
Alright!
Munroe.
Move out!
They must've know we were coming.
Hey!
Water!
Wait!
There's no fresh water on this island!
Oh my god!
Captain?
Oh, Jesus Christ!
How you doing pal?
Where's they...
Disappears into the mist?
And then he baits us for water?
And we don't even know what he looks like?
- Sergeant.
- He's a fucking fox.
Sergeant, take it easy.
Save your energy.
You take care buddy.
I have a problem.
And you can bet!
You fucking me if I have a problem!
You now have a problem.
I've just received an ass chewing from Washington!
The brass is wondering why they've received reports of enemy activities on Saipan!
?
An island that I assure them that we had secured!
Over 4 months ago!
Now I would like to report back in the not too distant fucking future!
That all enemy hostilities has ceased on this island!
Gentlemen.
We will hunt.
And we will destroy.
Any and all opposition on that mountain.
Within the next 7 days.
Further!
I'm hearing some kinda nonsense!
About a Japanese officer who thinks he's too smart to be caught!
A Fox!
Sir.
Say again?
Some of the men says.
He's smart like a fox, sir.
Some of the men says.
He's smart like a fox, sir.
Bullshit!
That is complete and utter bullshit!
Even if there's a guy up there running the show!
I will tell you this!
He will be gone.
Gone.
Gone straight to hell.
In under a week.
I promise you that.
The enemies' area of operation is limited to 4 miles long and 3 miles wide.
Around the base of the mountain.
These 200 so Jap soldiers are hold up in this area.
And I know!
I have your assurance that every last one of them will be flushed out.
You will make a full division sweep of the whole god damn area.
I want a line. 3 miles wide and marines at arms length.
Forget about the Japs.
Anything that's moving or alive.
I want found.
I want those Japs in custody or in the ground.
Good luck, gentlemen.
Huge lines of Americans outflanking us.
The situation will quickly spiral out of control.
We need the civilians out of the way.
We need to assure the civilians are safe.
Mt tapochau's eastern side are endless stretches of cliffs.
But there are caves interjecting the cliffs.
We will keep the civilians out of harms way there.
Slowly
The caves are camouflaged by the treeline.
They will be safe there.
Those searching the jungle will never find them.
It's our only way.
C'mon.
I am sorry.
- Slowly.
- Mother.
What is it?
Okuno's not going up.
My mother's too old and frail,.sir
She's afraid of heights and claustrophobia.
She will give you trouble inside.
Fucking...
You guys got anything down there?
- Nothing here!
- Alright!
Move out!
What about that area at the base of the mountain!
?
Over!
- Yeah!
Okay...
- See anything?
- I'm not feeling well.
- A little while longer...
I'm uncomfortable.
Incoming!
Shit!
How many!
?
- You gotta be...
- Here they come!
C'mon!
Go, go...!
- Go, go, go!
- He's on me!
He's on me!
- Keep firing!
Shit!
- Ambush!
- That guy's behind that rock!
- Move it for the right!
- To your left!
- Move!
Move...!
Grenade!
Let's take a look at how we did.
Captain!
What have we gained?
All those marines at our disposal.
We captured six scared civilians!
Killed 3 Jap soldiers!
And lost 11 U.S. marines!
We failed.
We underestimated, sir.
underestimated?
We couldn't even find them!
For the Christ's sake!
Who is this Fox character?
Louis?
What is his fucking name?
ls he some kinda magician?
ls he Harry Houdini!
?
He's responsible for the booby traps.
And he's probably the one who marked the baby first to find.
Colonel.
He's a clever man.
Clever my ass.
What do you think the brass is gonna say?
We did shit!
That's what they're gonna say.
And they be right!
Get outta my fucking office!
Don't hate the military...
Iron rice bowl and chopsticks...
Unfortunately, not Buddha...
For a meal.
Really good for nothing...
Nothing like some labour work.
I am that kinda person.
That's right!
I'll kill one hundred American soldiers.
How about killing 31.
If I kill 10 everyday.
I'll achieve lots in a week.
What are you doing?
I want to kill them all.
Excuse me?
I heard you had a woman here that knows about the fox.
The fox.
What fox?
All the civilians we brought down from the mountain?
They're all civilians here, captain.
You can't go in there.
Haruko?
I am Haruko.
Sorry.
It's alright.
I would like to inquire about the fox?
Fox?
The Japanese commander of Mt Tapochau.
That is your commander?
He left a red marker for the rescue of a baby.
Is he a good commander?
Are we talking about the same person?
You call him... the fox?
Captain Oba.
Oba?
Oba, the commander.
Commander.
I still don't get the japs, captain.
Captain Sakae Oba.
18th imperial infantry.
The fox.
That's his name, colonel.
Is that a fact?
Take care, Louis.
Good luck, sir
When you get this Oba character.
You tell him something for me.
Yes, sir.
What's that sir?
You tell him
Tell him he's a son of a bitch.
Be sure to let him know, sir.
Attention!
Breezy!
Take me to the airfield.
Yes, sir.
Dismissed!
You know the 1st thing that I did when I found out I was assigned to Saipan.
Was to grab that fishing rod.
May never use it but at least I can think about it.
Well.
I hope the day would come that we can all go fishing can come sooner or later, sir.
So do I, captain.
So do I.
It's no secret you know more about this place then I do.
I would like to hear your thoughts.
Tell me what you know.
Well, sir.
We've been carrying out the director's from the psych warfare boys in an effort to get them to surrender.
We've had... some success with individual stragglers but...
Not with the larger groups we think that are still hiding out in the mountain.
Sit down.
What would you do differently?
Well, sir.
I'd like to continue with this.
But I would like to make some on our own.
Tailored specifically to the holdouts on this island.
And we have to stop using the words Toko.
The Japanese are very proud people and they wouldn't want to surrender.
I'm aware of that, captain.
Go on.
We need to give them a way out without shaming themselves.
Perhaps tell them to cease resistance rather than surrender.
Alright, captain.
Right now you pursue that coarse of action.
But just know that our time is limited.
That's all!
Dismissed.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Captain?
You seem to have a understanding of this culture.
What is at the heart of this absolute commitment.
The Japanese have to no surrender?
Are you familiar with this, sir?
I would like to save the lives of the Japanese people in the mountains.
I do not want any more to die.
I'll be sending messages by plane dropped flyers.
Think about it?
For myself.
Due to the invading Americans.
I have lost friends and family.
My two sons are dead.
We decline.
Captain.
I don't want Japan or America.
To further engage in this unnecessary war.
I would like to help.
Don't pick it up!
That's enemy propaganda!
Leave it!
What's this?
Is it real?
Photos of Tokyo.
Bito?
You were born in Asakusa, right?
I'm not sure...
But it's near the Ginza.
Tokyo has become like a ghost town.
Kazuo?
Yes.
I have seen the photo on the flyer.
Know any of the civilians in the shelter?
Oba.
Akio.
C'mon.
Two days ago.
Leaflets was dropped.
The photo on the flyer...
Is it real?
I had a hand in producing the flyer.
This photo is not the only one.
There are others.
Numerous horrific photos of Japan.
It is to make you understand.
Make the transition now.
This is a good time as any.
We... will not respond to claims in the flyers.
Please reconsider, captain.
I heard,
There's enough bombs to destroy the whole of Japan.
Everyday the planes take off from this island.
Oba?
May I enquire?
Up in the mountain.
Are there a pair of siblings?
Yes.
Wonderful?
Great.
They are my children.
We got separated.
I have never seen them since.
Please take care of them.
Oba?
Do you have time?
Here.
Look at him before leaving.
Safe?
Captain.
Leave.
- Please...
- Who was that!
?
- I don't understand...
- What was he doing?
Take a look!
- I got nothing!
- Check the windows!
- No one's here.
- You got anything?
What was Oba doing in the can?
Gathering information and supplies.
He was trying to
- verify some photo.
- And?
I told him, it was true.
He was shocked.
Colonel.
I think we need to try something more aggressive to get them to surrender.
Such as?
We should promise them.
Food and medicine.
- When they come, we set a trap and capture them.
- No... no.
Absolutely not!
That wouldn't be honorably nor very effective.
If we do that.
The others left on the mountain will never surrender.
Colonel, treachery here is not the answer.
Motoki.
I will go up the mountain.
Please translate that I will convince the commander to surrender.
Mr. Baba says.
He will go up the mountain.
And convince them to come down.
Well, Mr. Baba.
If a Japanese person like yourself can convince them to down down.
I'm happy to have you try.
Perhaps a little Japanese to Japanese talk will do us all some good.
At this point, we have nothing to lose.
The colonel agrees.
Thank you.
Captain, you have my permission to do whatever you need to do.
To bring about a better peaceful resolution.
Please make sure Motoki- san here, gets whatever he needs to.
Ito?
Ito!
We're out of medicine and bandages.
How do you expect me to work this way?
Cool down.
We are privy to the lack medical supplies.
Don't you understand!
?
I could've done a lot more with drugs!
I have also lost comrades!
Enough!
Both of you.
We can get the drugs and medicine from the shelter hospital.
I find out what else we need.
So let him go with me
For the drugs...
I will find a way.
- Commander?
- Move it!
Faster!
Walk faster!
Move!
This bastard is a Yankee lackeys.
Baba?
Why are you here?
I'm here to convince you to surrender.
Do you think we're weak!
?
Stop!
The Americans put you up to this?
I would like to see my children...
You're not here to see your children.
You're here to sniff out our defenses.
I want to see the children!
I want to take them back!
Is that!
wrong?
Shut up!
Traitor!
You have shamed Imperial Japan!
Stop your tears.
Your children will never look up at you again.
Leave.
Oba?
If my children are killed.
I will never forgive you.
Aono, what is it?
Where are we going?
Gonna show me something?
Here?
I need to know?
What?
Please wait outside.
I will call you.
If he agrees to meet with you.
Okay.
But if and only if he agrees.
I don't want him to think that we're trying to track him.
Of course, captain.
Don't worry about us.
We'll stay outta your way.
Thank you.
Quickly...
Wait...
It's time.
This is most helpful.
Oba?
Would you not reconsider?
Enough!
We will fight to the last breath.
In fact, I have brought the U.S. captain.
Fall back!
No... believe me.
Get back!
Get back!
Get em' clear!
Go...!
C'mon!
Let's go!
Don't shoot!
Stop!
You don't understand!
Don't shoot!
- Fire!
- Men down!
Fire!
Fire...!
Cover!
Hey.
Cover!
- Japs through the fence!
- Japs on the left!
Get em' ...!
Aono!
Captain!
Fallback!
Going into the trees!
Cover!
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
- The hell just happened?
- Alright!
Check these men!
- Yes, sir!
- l don't know.
Reverend's not gonna make it.
Somebody's over here!
Let's get these guys to the hospital.
Captain.
You alright?
I'm fine.
A traitor?
What?
Traitor's Japanese.
Horiuchi's dead.
Aono... may still have a chance.
We must not let the civilians go to the shelters?
We mustn't!
They will only be a pawn for the enemy?
They're be killed.
Food and medicine are in short supply.
We can no longer take care of them.
Think of the civilians.
Wouldn't it be better for them in the shelter?
Captain.
Though you are the commander.
You are no different from the enemy.
I beg to differ.
I believe.
Japan will once again set foot on this land.
And when that time arrives.
I hope you will.
Often recall.
Mount Tapochau.
During this time that we have stayed together.
And through everything we've endured.
The memories will not be in vain.
Bring these back with you to Japan!
Oshiro?
It's been an honour.
Truth is.
I'm relieved to leave.
C'mon.
TO OUR GOOD AND LOYAL SUBJECTS:
We have ordered Our Government to communicate to the Governments of the United States,
Great Britain, China and the Soviet Union that Our Empire accepts the provisions of their Joint Declaration.
Emperor Hirohito's announcement of Japan's unconditional surrender was recorded and later broadcasted to his loyal subjects.
Here too at Camp Susupe.
This is impossible!
This is propaganda!
They have time and again used this tactic.
In order to make us believe.
Enough of this nonsense!
Ikegami?
Why are you back here?
Captain has given his best.
Faced with numerous challenges.
I'm sorry we.
I did say we'd win.
Isn't that what I said?
I don't recall.
Well.
You're wrong.
Just returned.
Security at the shelter have become complacent.
We can penetrate effortlessly.
Find out why?
Due to the brainwashing by the American's.
Majority of Japanese believed.
6th August.
Hiroshima.
9th August.
Nagasaki.
A new bomb was detonated.
Cities and towns were destroyed
Countless dead.
That's why..
His Majesty, the Emperor.
Declared down of arms.
Japan.
Lost.
Fight to the last breath!
Remember our commands!
Even with the knowledge of Japan's total copulation.
Neither Oba nor his men are willing to come down off the mountain.
You wanted to meet me, colonel?
Yeah!
Come in, captain.
according to a message from the Japanese camp.
Oba is saying that he wants to meet.
Oba does?
Has he agreed to surrender?
No.
He wants to meet with the representatives of the American armed forces.
Captain Oba is nothing if not consistent.
He wants it his way right til the bitter end.
I like to be the one to meet him.
If you would permit me, sir.
Permission granted.
Thank you, sir.
You admire him.
Don't you, captain?

Commander Oba?
It's a real honour.
I lived in Japan for 2 years.
I really like Kabuki actor Uzaemon.

That will be most tragic.
You fought honorably.
But the war is over.
We are no longer your enemy.
Captain Oba.
Let's return to Japan.
We will not surrender.
Neither do we intend to back down.
However...
Imperial military doctrine states absolute obedience to their superiors.
Commands with strict compliance.

You are our enemy.
I will never surrender.
Commander Oba?
Is he under your command?

On December 1st, 1945.
At the foot of Mount Tapochau on the island of Saipan.
Following 512 days of fighting, the war finally ended for Captain Sakae Oba and his army of 47.
Did you know Captain Oba?
That we have named you The Fox.
Fox?
Possesses stealth, highly crafty and evasive.
I do not have that kind of ability.
Just fighting dedication.
We're here.
Thank you.
Captain Oba?
No matter what others think.
You have commanded your soldiers well, for the last 2 and half years you spent in the mountain.
You saved the lives of 200 Japanese.
I believed.
Personally that to be awarded more lives.
is more rewarding than gaining an island.
Am I right?
Aono.
May I hold him?
This child know not of Japan.
I'll teach him.
15 June 1944.
U.S. military forces invaded Saipan.
Marines entering from the beach and take over island.
And The Japanese in control of more than 20 thousands of civilians.
And are defended by over 30 thousand trained troops.
One of the most Japanese's strategic defense in the Pacific,
Saipan withstand the onslaught fighting machine American about 20 thousand more troops.
And in the war a large number of Japanese troops destroyed.
And who survived, fled to the middle forest.
And the Japanese imperial troops suffered a humiliating defeat.
Make them no choice but to leave Saipan.
The troops are not told, continued battle.
leaving the victory for their forces and their mission.
Let's step aside.
Forward captain.
Let's get out of here, hey, step aside.
Damn, Japan ...
This time we will kill them instantly.
In two days, the yellow monkey on the mountain will living history.
You know their orders are to stop us at any cost.
Japanese troops are tough, they do not quitter.
You do not know what you're talking corporal, I suggest keep your opinion to yourself own.
Right, sir.
Look out
Quiet corporal, I bring the car, you're way, understand.
Right, sir.
Pesky.
This Japanese pack, we'll be fine.
What does he mean pack.
Japan appreciates every effort.
If you notice, you can learn something here.
We learn to pack.
You have a boyfriend or anything Japanese.
I learned in Japan two years, unfortunately there was never a Japan's girlfriend.
I bet you want.
Eyes watching the streets alone.
You're Louise.
Yes, sir.
Captain, please sit down, here is not too Formal.
Thank you, sir.
I heard you speak Japanese.
Japanese will say the opposite, I know Basically pack.

So you believe it.
You could say that.
Try not to be against you.
I need your help, Louise.
I do not understand this Japanese.
Bushido and suicide.
This is crazy.
But it's a matter of pride.
One thought for future.

Are you familiar with this, sir.
Can't say I know, what it is, sort of Japanese good luck charms.
I know, sir.
Those seeds shogi.
Japanese chess.
They are all similar except this.

One thing that distinguishes your pawn from me.
is the direction they point at the board.
Jump on the captain's goal.
Yes sir.
We do not like chess, if I want to take one your pawn.
I did not keep him waiting for pick.
I just turned it, and use it against you.
As part of my
What's to do with their suicide.
Japan upholds faithfulness.
If one is on hold, they must serve a new master.
With fidelity.
That's right.
Why did not they give up and fight on our side.
If they are captive, they can't betray their emperor.
So they chose to die rather than take the risk.
You see sir.
Captain,
I'm not here to play chess.
If Japan was willing to die, I'm happy gave
Honorably or not.
I just want to finish this war
What we clearly

June 15th 1944
The U.S. military forces invade Saipan in the Northern Marianna's group of island
The Marines moves ashore establishing themselves on the south-west coast on their way of taking control of the island
under The Japanese control, Saipan is called home by 20,000 of its citizens and defended by over 30 thousand highly trained members of the imperial fighting forces.
Though one of the most strategically most important of the Japanese strong holds in the Pacific
Saipan defenses folds under the onslaught of the
American war machine numbering over 70,000 strong
In issuing battle, the majority of Japanese defenders are annihilated
And the survivors flee to Mount Tapochau located at the center of the island
Unbeknownst to the Japanese on the island, the Imperial Navy suffers a humiliating defeat in the sea of the Mariannes
Leaving the Imperial command no choice but to abandon the defense in Saipan
The uniformed defenders however continue to fight believing in inevitable victory of their imperial forces and their nation
Get out the way
Get a move on
Move this thing over, come on.
Move out of the way
Sorry about that Captain.
Carry on
Come on. come on.
Get out of the road.
Hey clear the way
God damn, mini Japs.
This time tomorrow their pants going to be overflow in no time, just a few days those yellow monkeys in the mountain are going to be history
You know their orders are to stop us no mater what
Those Japanese soldier are tough, they don't give up
You have no idea what you're talking about corporal,
I advise you to keep opinion to yourself
Right, sir.
Watch it
You take it easy corporal, or I'm taking the jeep and you walk, you read me?
Yes, sir.
Shit!
We should've stopped
Look they just Japs sir.
They'll be fine
What thats mean sir?
The Japanese treasure every meeting for it they never recur
If you pay attention, you might actually learn something while you're here
We did you learn to Lingo sir?
You date a Jap girlfriend or something?
I studied it in Japan two years, unfortunately never got around a Japanese girlfriend.
I bet you wanted to
Keep your eyes on the road Mr.
Yes sir
- You're Lewis?
- Yes, sir.
Have a seat Captain, we're not that formal here not in this damn heat
Thank you, sir.
I hear you speak Japanese.
The Japanese would say otherwise.
I know the basic sir
- Where you're from?
- Boston, sir.
So you're any Ivy league huh?
You could say that.
I'll try not to hold against you.
I need your help, Lewis
I do not understand these Japs
Bushido suicide thing.
Its a...
Well its crazy.
Well it's a matter of pride.
Its a way of thinking you been nurturing their head for centuries
What?
Killing themselves?
Are you?
Are you familiar with this, sir.
Can't say that I am, what are they?
Kinda Jap lucky charms?
No sir.
There are shogi pieces
Japanese chess pieces if you like.
They are all look the same except for the writing and the sign
So?
The only thing differentiate your pieces from mine, is the direction that their facing on the board
Get to the point Captain
Yes sir.
Unlike our chess, if I were to take one of your pieces
I don't hold on to it waiting for you to reclaim it
I just simply turn it around and use it against you.
As part of my army
What the hell does it have to do with them killing themselves
The Japanese put a high price on loyalty to one master
If one were to be taken a prisoner, it would expect a behaviour for them to serve the new lord with equal loyalty
Well now, if that were true why wont they come surrender and come fight on our side
Well sir, if they were to be taken prisoner, there's a chance they could end up betraying their emperor
So they choose to die instead of taking the chance that might happen
You see sir, The Japanese
Captain, I didn't come here to play a fucking chess.
Now, if these Japs want to die, I'll more than happy to oblige that
Honorably or otherwise
I just want to get this damn war over with
Are we clear?
Crystal clear, sir.
Check out at the entrance
You're up, fire that cave
Now you throw that in
Marry Christmas Nicks
Look out
Cover the entrance
Cave's clear

Go in and find out

Check the pockets
We don't have all day
Get all the souvenir and watch your 6
What do you got?
Got one
- Move up
- Yeah yeah
- I want a belly band
- What a belly band?
On the day following the suicide General Saito and his four commanders the tattered remnant of Japanese forces gathered near the western coast of the island for a final assault against the invaders
The Americans however remain completely unaware of their movements
Alright
Keep us posted on a regular basis
You find out there you boys will be interested in, I let you know
Come home and stay sharp
Roger
- Mikey, lets go

On the 7th of July in what came to be known by the banzai attack
Over 4,000 Japanese and close to 2,000 American lives were lost in a space of only a few hours
Two days later, the American commander would declare a total military victory on the island of Saipan
Alright pick it up
Keep your eyes open
- Hangs up
- See if you don't pay attention
Keep your eyes open, check out them out because it could be some lives one
Here, near Mount Toucha
Its the place where the Japanese are calling the valley of hell
It was here that General Saito along with his other commanders committed suicide in front of men
And they did this the night before they launch the attack
The night before?
Thats right sir
The night before the attack
If they want to die for their god emperor
Though they just assume to take us with them
They kill themselves the night before even the battlefield.
What sense does that make?
Well by dying this way in front of their men,
They're showing their men the way.
They setting an example
Continue sergeant
Now up here, mark your point
Calling this cliff, The Banzai Cliff
Because apparently civilians are threw themselves into the rock the sea below
Women, children, entire families spar-killing themselves sir
Women and children?
Why?
Seem that the Japanese military had told them
That we Americans are cannibals and torturers
They're terrified sir
The Japs has lost their commanders and we've crushed their army
Now I tell you boys, the innocent thing
Thank god for that
Because this must stop right now
You're right colonel
But I feel we can't be too optimistic about this, this is still a volatile situation
I like try and convince them to surrender sir
You want to talk to them?
They have no food left, with no freshwater around this island
They're also have go nothing to lose
I refuse to lose even one more man on that mountain
You got one month captain
After that, I blow them all to hell
Thank you sir
Alright lets do this.

Give him some water
How do you suggest I do that?
You take your thumb, you're going to dip it in your canteen and you going to let him suck on it just like you do
Shut up!
You want the Japs to hear you?
Now spread out and finish clearing the area
Move and take that damn thing off your head
Alright take 5
Anyone got any water?
Here I got a little

Anything form the grasshopper?
The last report there were no sign of life

Men, I have a problem
And you can bet you fucking me when I have a problem, you now have a problem
I've just received word from washington
The brass are wondering why they are receiving reports of enemy activity in Saipan.
On the island I assured them we had secured over 4 months ago
Now I would like report back in not to distance fucking future that all enemy hostility has ceased on this island
Gentlemen, we will hunt, and we will destroy any and all opposition on that mountain, within the next 7 days
Further I'm hearing some kind of nonsense about a
Japanese officer who thinks he too smart to get caught
A fox, sir.

He will be gone
Gone.
Gone straight to hell in under a week
I promise you that
The enemies area of operation is limited to 4 miles long and 3 miles wide around the base of the mountain
These 300 or so Japanese soldiers are hold up in this area and I know I have your insurances every last one of them will be flush out
You will make a full division sweep of that whole god damn area
I want a line 3 miles wide and a width an arm length

I like to hear your thoughts, tell me what you know
Well sir we been carry the directus from the site warfare boys in an effort to get them to surrender
We had some success with individual stragglers
Not with the larger group whom we think they still hiding out in the mountains
Sit down
What would you do differently?
Well sir I want to continue this leaflets
But I would like to make some of our own.
Tailored specifically to the hold out on this island and we have to stop using the word Toco
The Japanese are a very proud people and they will not surrender
I'm aware of that captain
Go on
We need to give them a away out without shaming themselves sir
Perhaps tell them to cease resistance rather than surrender
Alright captain
Right now you pursue that course of action
Just that know our time is limited so keep me in the loop
That's all, dismissed
Yes sir, thank you sir
Captain
You seem to have an understanding of this culture
What is at the heart of this absolute commitment to Japanese have in no surrender?
Are you familiar with this sir?
Captain
I do not want Japan or America to further engage in this unnecessary war
I would try to help
Really?
Who was that?
What was he doing?
Take a look

- Check the windows
- No one's here
- You got anything?
What was Oba doing in the camp?
Gathering information and supplies
He was trying to verify some photos and?
I told him, it was true, he was shocked
Colonel I think we need to try something more aggressive to get them to surrender
Such as?
We should promise them food and medicine
When they come, we lay a trap and capture them
No, absolutely not, that will not honorable nor very effective
If we do that, the other left on the mountain will never surrender
Colonel, treachery here is not the answer
Mr Baba says he will go up the Mountain and convince them to come down
Well Mr Baba, The Japanese person like yourself can convince them to come down, I'm happy have you try
Perhaps a little Japanese to Japanese talk will us all some good
At this point we have nothing to lose

Emperor Hirahito announcement of Japan unconditional surrenders were recorded and later broadcast to his loyal subject
Even with the knowledge of Japan total capitulation, neither Oba nor his men are willing to come down off the mountain

According to a message from the Japanese camp,
Oba is saying that he wanted to meet

This child did not know Japan
I ... will teach him subs for japanese part done by mcus subs for english part done by Led Zepp
Hey, congrats.
I know how hard you worked.
Thanks.
Finally get to show what I can do.
I'm a little nervous, though.
Oh, you're on Broadway now, girl.
The whole world's gonna be at your feet.
Excuse me.
Oh, life is not that bad.
Give me a smile.
You look so prettier when you smile, Danielle.
Look at me.
Now look at my face.
Look at me.
Look at my face.
Look at my face.
My friends wanted me to stay for another drink, but I have a rehearsal in the morning.
I should have just smiled when he asked.
You did everything right.
You survived.
Danielle, have you ever seen this man before?
No.
But he knew all about me.
There are bike tracks.
Get the cement.
Wow, he really got you good, huh?
He was wearing latex gloves.
Did he have any distinguishing marks on him, a tattoo, anything like that?
I saw one on his neck.
A Tai Chi thing.
A Tai Chi thing?
Can you describe that?
Half black, half white, in a circle.
The Yin-Yang?
Yeah.
Sorry.
Did he say anything to you during the incident?
He said, "tell me you love me, mommy."
Those exact words?
You're sure?
Did you notice how he got away?
On a bike.
Danielle, will you excuse us for one second, okay?
Detective, can I have a word with you?
Uh, I don't know how you do things down South, but here, in New York, we think it's best if one person does the intake as to not overwhelm the victim.
Okay, look, I know this may sound crazy, but I think I know this guy.
- I recognize his M.O.
- Recognize him?
From where?
- You just got here.
- We were tracking a serial rapist in Georgia.
- It's the same signature.
- Okay.
Olivia, it's the same signature--the way he stalks,
- the tattoo--
- Rollins, with all due respect, the city is filled with rapists with the same M.O.
"Tell me you love me, mommy"?
I mean, he said the exact same thing, our perp.
I understand that.
It's still a stretch.
Could be.
Could be he's here.
We call him "The Atlantic Coast Rapist"
the white male, 30s.
With a Yin-Yang tattoo on his neck.
Yeah, he struck in Georgia, in Virginia, Maryland.
We gave him the name at APD, and it just kind of stuck.
He's a power reassurance serial rapist.
15 rapes over 9 years.
Nothing in the last three.
So we thought he was either in prison or dead.
Until last night.
Now detective Benson thinks I'm reaching, but, I mean, follow me here.
The victims are all young.
They're fit, athletic, the planted bike in the woods.
A lot of people ride bikes in the city.
Deliverymen, messengers.
This guy's never been north of Charm City.
He jumps the Mason-Dixon?
Can we hear her out, fellas?
Okay, so, what, you thinkin' he followed you to New York on the heels of your move?
- Could he be taunting you?
- No.
No, that's not his way.
He's avoided us all these years by staying under the radar.
How about any mistakes?
Yeah, the first four rapes, he didn't wear a condom.
So we got his DNA.
What, there's no matches?
Nothing on CODIS?
Like I said, under the radar, but there was another slip-up.
Gaithersburg, Maryland.
Got a partial print on a screwdriver left at the scene Halloween 2003.
Well, he likes blondes.
I'd call it an obsession.
Danielle Hynes did the perfect thing.
She pulled out her attacker's hair, kept it, roots and all.
Did you get a sketch?
Captain, hope you don't mind.
I brought in Fujita.
- Who's that?
- Freelance.
Best sketch artist in the city.
Fujita takes hours, he's exorbitant.
Well, these aren't gonna catch anyone.
Excellent.
But these will.
There's his tattoo.
Well, let's get this out, call One PP, we got a serial rapist on our hands.
Whoa, whoa, let's just hold on here.
No need to cause a panic.
Let's go with what we know.
Put it out, but just link him to last night's attack.
We keep the rest in our pocket for now.
We have lift-off.
The sketch is up.
Big brother is most definitely watching, amigo.
I mean, what's next?
They take your DNA at birth and put it in some government database?
The only people that should have a problem with that are criminals.
Or people who care about civil liberties.
What I said.
You're missing the bigger picture here.
Which schmuck are they gonna get to manage all these calls?
There's nothing to worry about, Mrs. Reidy.
No, just lock your front door.
No, that's not him.
Because we're looking for a white man.
Can somebody please take over for me?
I'm gonna go chew some glass.
Hey, Munch.
Check these out, willya?
You are the sergeant.
I got two colds and a crazy.
Detectives...
When were you attacked, Lana?
Two months ago in Morningside Park.
I never reported it.
And today I saw his face on the news and...
And how did you know it was him?
The tattoo on his neck.
Did he say anything to you?
Anything specific that you can remember?
He said, "look at me.
Look at my face."
Did he say anything else to you?
"Tell me you love me, mommy.
Tell me you love me."
He kept-- he kept saying it.
Cell phone image came in on the tip line.
Recognize him?
Yeah.
Anyone asks, I never showed that to you.
How do you know him?
He started coming to the park with his boy this summer.
Did you ever talk to him?
His son Luke plays with my daughter.
They live around here?
Across the street from me off Ninth.
I don't think they have cars in Antarctica.
I think--I don't know.
They might have some trucks.
- Excuse me.
- I think it'd be kind of hard--
- Yes?
- NYPD, Mr., uh...
Gabriel Thomas.
Can we speak to you alone, Mr. Thomas?
Oh, of course.
Hey, Luke, go in and find mom, okay?
Okay.
What's this about?
You see the papers this morning?
- Yes.
- Let me guess.
The times.
You should read the tabloids.
Well, there has to be a mistake.
Honey?
What's going on?
We're asking your husband where he was two nights ago.
Home with his family.
- All night.
- I went for a bike ride.
Around 9:00, after I put my son to sleep.
Was anybody with you?
No.
I ride alone.
Look, you don't want to do this here.
Just come down to the station with us,
- we'll straighten this out.
- I'm calling my brother.
Janey, I don't need a lawyer.
I didn't do anything.
I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- If that's your guy--
- This is my guy.
Well, he's pretty cool.
He doesn't even want a lawyer.
Oh, really?
That's funny 'cause he's already got one.
Sherri West.
Okay, you know the drill.
Face forward.
Counselor.
Guess they gave the new guy the short straw.
Good to see you too, captain.
Let's get this started.
- Where's your vic?
- Try two.
And that's just in New York.
You get this guy off, you're worth the money they're throwing at you.
Number four, step forward.
Back.
Number five, step forward.
Number five.
Back.
Number six, step forward.
Back.
Okay, all you gentlemen can leave.
Pick up your $10 down the hall.
Number five, please stay.
I don't understand.
Should have stayed down South, Gabriel.
Your game wasn't ready for the big city.
Those girls you raped, they just made you, both of 'em.
Well, that can't be.
You're done.
We're all friend here so let's just cut to the chase.
Look, I may be new to defense, but even a paralegal knows not to let a client talk to cops.
So why are we here, counselor?
You got the wrong guy.
Gee, never heard that before.
Cut me a break.
Did you see him in there?
Saw the line-up.
Those women didn't hesitate.
Yeah, and you know how unreliable eye-witnesses are.
Gabriel's a straight arrow.
He's got a family, a job.
That was my take on him.
So let us get his side.
I'd love to take the confession.
Look, if you go in there with your mind already made up,
I will advise him to shut up.
Could we have the room for a second?
Thank you.
It's him.
He fits the profile to a "T".
You hear yourself, Rollins?
Look, we need to go in there looking for reasons to exclude him, not to find him guilty.
He is guilty.
I mean, what-- what are we waiting on?
How about the DNA?
And the fingerprint on that screwdriver.
We still don't know who that belongs to.
Okay.
All right.
So while we're waiting for that, why don't you let me take my shot?
You hold on.
Benson, Amaro, you take the lead.
Rollins, you watch with me.
Yes, sir.
Let's--let's just try this again.
I am--I'm a good citizen.
The only trouble I've ever had is a speeding ticket.
Really?
'Cause there's a domestic assault complaint against you in 1994.
Are you--
I had--I had an argument with my girlfriend in college.
And her roommate called the cops.
That--it was 15 years ago.
I was a kid.
I would like to go through your lives.
Okay, why don't we calm down?
Okay?
So what line of work are you in?
I'm a pharmaceutical rep.
I've worked for the same company for ten years.
Just got a promotion.
That's why I moved here to New York in June.
So let's go back to Wednesday night.
Now, you told us that you were bicycling alone?
As I always do.
Any way that you can prove that?
Maybe you stopped by at a bodega, used an ATM?
No, I never take my wallet when I bike-- just my cash, keys, and my bag.
What about a Thursday night, July 21st?
- Were you in the city?
- I was probably home, watching TV.
I take it my client was in New York City the night both rapes occurred.
- So were four million other men.
- No, you're right.
There's lots of guys in New York.
So let's go back a little further.
Where'd you move here from?
Geneva.
That's my company's home office.
So you were in Switzerland the past ten years.
No, just for the past three.
Before that I was a sales rep.
Georgia, South Carolina, Maryland.
What does that have to do with anything?
Any chance we could get your employment records for the past ten years?
I mean, cities, dates.
That's a pretty wide net you're casting.
No, no, no, that's fine.
No, you take anything that you need.
Well, we appreciate that.
All right.
So can I go home now?
My wife's probably out of her mind.
She's home alone with our six-year-old.
When we're done here, you can call her.
Nice work.
Y'all put him in every state a rape was reported.
No, we didn't do anything.
He put himself there.
We gave him every opportunity to exclude himself.
He couldn't.
He's supposed to be obsessed with blondes?
He barely even noticed you, Rollins.
No, he likes submissives.
We got him.
This is our guy.
All right.
All right, look.
He volunteered his work records.
Connect the dots.
So the red lights are attacks.
And these blue lights here, they indicate Gabriel Thomas's homes over the same period.
Anyone got the odds on that?
And there's more.
In 2002, he was transferred to Maryland.
The next year he struck three times in Gaithersburg.
South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia.
Same pattern.
And no rapes the three years
- he was in Switzerland.
- Right.
Coinciding with the gap in the spree.
Switzerland.
There's a lot of blondes there.
Any crimes fit his M.O. during that time period?
We got a wire out to Interpol.
Don't hold your breath.
Anyway, but he repatriates June 1st to New York.
Then there's two rapes in three months.
You guys get anything off the warrant?
CSU picked up a screwdriver and a knife in his bike bag.
Again, fitting his M.O.
And matching the contents of every cyclist's bike bag.
Look, I get it.
His life dovetails with the rapist's, but does anyone think it's weird he just offered all that up?
Is he always like this?
Listen to this.
Lab report:
Gabriel Thomas is a DNA match for the rape kits for the first four victims and Danielle Hynes.
Checkmate.
Book him.
I wish they were all this easy.
I'm gonna call my captain in Atlanta, tell him the good news.
Hey, Rollins.
Yeah.
Nice job.
The DNA results are wrong.
I work for a pharmaceutical company.
Labs make mistakes all the time.
The thing is, DNA doesn't lie.
Neither do I.
Hey.
It isn't me.
Listen, you're in a tight spot here.
Is there anything you want to tell me, hmm?
Something you didn't want your wife to know?
Something you didn't want to say in front of that pretty attorney?
No.
Nothing.
Like, with these women in New York.
Look, I-I saw them.
And they sent mixed signals?
Is that what it is?
How would I know that?
I have never seen them.
Okay.
You got a son, right?
Luke?
Yes.
What is he, six, seven?
Six.
Yeah, I got a four-year-old.
And they grow up fast.
And pretty soon, it's high school graduation, then college.
I mean, you want to see Luke ever again, Gabriel?
Look, you come clean right now, and I'll make sure you do your time in New York, full visitation.
You want to hug your son?
And you want to see him grow up?
'Cause you get sent out of state, that's a long trip for your wife and boy to make.
My wife loves me.
She knows I would never do this.
Look, Gabriel, up to now I've given you every chance I can, but you're not helping yourself.
Turn around.
I won't admit to something I didn't do.
And I'll tell you another thing, detective.
Yeah, what's that?
Your rapist is still out there.
Let's go.
How does the defendant plea?
Not guilty.
Ms. West, I realize you're new to the defense side, but let's follow protocol.
Not guilty, your honor.
People on bail?
Remand, your honor.
The defendant is facing trial for two counts of forcible rape in New York, and other states are preparing arrest warrants and extradition requests for rapes in their jurisdictions.
And DNA evidence from four separate labs confirms he's been terrorizing women for years with impunity.
He has a motive to flee and the means to do so.
Your honor, my client is a loving family man with a stable job and no prior convictions.
The police and the DA's office are rushing to judge--
Please, Ms. West, you know better.
Given the nature and the magnitude of the crimes he's charged with, the defendant is to be remanded to rikers.
- Janey.
- Bailiff!
Janey, you can't believe that I did this.
Janey!
All right, sign here, guy.
Hold your pen here.
Once that piece of garbage is processed, transport will be made to rikers.
Thank God this lockout ended, huh?
Amen to that.
Giants got a nice group of receivers.
Starts up front.
Got to win the war
- in the trenches first--
- Bleeder!
We got a bleeder, detectives.
Your guy.
Call the bus.
Somebody get a medic!
Gabriel, hey, hey.
Can you hear me?
You're gonna be all right.
All right, just relax.
We're gonna get you some help.
All right?
You tell my boy
I never raped anybody.
You tell him that for me.
Get a medic in here now!
He lost a lot of blood.
Okay, but how many times have we seen this?
I mean, a guy finally gets caught and he takes the easy way out.
What'd you tell Luke?
That you were on a business trip for a long time.
Kids at school, parents are gonna talk.
I've already spoken to the headmaster.
They're aware of the situation.
How could you believe I could do this?
I'm sorry.
I just...
Doc, I have to ask, is there any way Gabriel could commit all these crimes and have no awareness of it?
I'm here 20 years, I've never seen it.
There are psychiatrists who will say yes, and those are the ones his lawyer will hire when they try to get him off.
Have you ever seen anyone attempt suicide to bolster an insanity defense?
I had a guy try to chew his arm off to convince a jury he was crazy.
It worked.
Janey.
Janey, the doctor says that he's going to be okay.
Please don't pretend you care about him.
Okay.
I just can't believe it.
I was married to someone for 15 years, had a child with him, and I didn't see one sign of this.
How is that possible?
The true predators, the ones that get away with it, they're--they're masterful at this.
But all this time?
What he did to those women is...
It makes me sick.
But you're here.
In spite of it.
My mom wants me to cut him loose, but he doesn't have anyone else.
Gabriel doesn't have any family?
No.
He was an only child, and his parents died within six months of each other when he was in college.
That's quite a trauma.
How did he deal with that?
Pretty well, I thought.
Same way he handled our miscarriage.
He said it was just nature's way of saying it wasn't the right time.
He never left my side that whole weekend.
Not even to wash the stupid makeup off his face.
Makeup?
We had on pirate costumes.
Halloween party.
Gabe had on eyeliner like captain Jack.
When he cried, it ran.
Halloween?
Do you remember what year?
2003.
Counselor.
You know, I have this idea.
What if somebody designed a place where you sit down and another person brings you food.
You think that could catch on?
What do you want, Nick?
Your alternate theory of the crime.
And I know you must have one.
Don't bust my balls.
I never should have let you talk to him.
Except, at the time, you believed him.
Are we done gloating yet?
Look, Sherri, I have a few loose ends.
My captain thinks this case is closed.
You might want to look into some dates for your client.
Halloween weekend, 2003.
It was rape number four in Gaithersburg.
His DNA was all over that one.
What's there to look for?
A man in two places at the same time.
What's bugging you, new guy?
Hmm?
Nothing.
Suit yourself.
You know, when we found Gabe in his cell, just blood everywhere, he said to me,
"tell my son I didn't do this."
Last words of a dying man thing.
Nah.
I know he's guilty.
I mean, we got this guy dead to rights, but... his affect... it just bugs me that, after all these years, a guy could play me like that.
Are you sure that's all that's bugging you?
We have his DNA.
Back when I got my shield, all we had to go on was blood type and fingerprints.
We went with our gut.
You know what, kid?
I miss those days.
Five separate crime scenes all a match
- for the same perp.
- Yeah, I know.
I know, but is there any chance you got it wrong?
The odds of matching 400 base pairs at 13 loci, which we have in this case, from two random strangers, are so astronomically high.
There haven't been that many people ever born on the planet.
There was a scandal in the Nassau county lab recently and Virginia.
Evidence tampering to raise conviction rates, pad the stats.
So you're saying all four of these labs and our lab, the best in the country, conspired to take Gabriel down.
You got a motive?
Olivia says you have something, Amaro?
Maybe.
It's a victim's report from Halloween night, 2003.
Look, she states her rapist had a chipped tooth and a long abdominal scar.
Gabriel Thomas has perfect teeth, no scar.
Victim also describes a Yin-Yang tattoo, which Gabriel does have.
Scars get removed, teeth fixed.
Except, that night, Gabriel was 100 Miles away at Johns Hopkins.
His wife miscarried.
Two sworn affidavits-- one from a doctor, one from Gabriel's mother-in-law-- both claim he never left Janey's bedside the entire night.
Doctor wasn't there 24/7.
And mother-in-laws have been known to lie.
This one never liked him.
Someone could have planted his DNA.
Really?
And just stopped after the fourth time?
What do we know about the family?
Let's ask him.
What's going on?
Uh, Benson and Amaro are dotting some "I"s.
I'll fill you in.
No, I was an only child as far as I know.
What does that mean?
I was adopted.
Have you ever contacted your biological mother?
I was never interested.
What are you asking me that for?
What... don't fit the profile, so you're... trying to blame the fact that I was adopted.
You know... screw you.
My parents were great people.
I was raised right.
It was 1975, 1976.
Something like that.
I was 17.
Couldn't look after myself, let alone two babies, so...
I gave 'em up.
Two babies?
So twin boys?
You don't miss a thing, do you?
Did they go to the same home?
No.
Back then, you know, they separated identicals.
I don't know why.
Some crazy experiment.
They paid me good, though.
Have you ever heard from your sons?
One of 'em.
Brian.
Good-looking kid.
Came to visit me... maybe 20 years ago.
Do you have any idea where we could find Brian?
That was a long time ago.
Read about him in the paper the next year, though.
He had it tough.
Wait, why was he in the paper?
His parents-- well, his adopted parents.
The mother killed the father.
She was jealous.
So she drugged him, then she burned him up in front of Brian.
Poor kid had to testify.
Do you know where this happened?
Richmond.
Norfolk.
Uh-huh.
Okay, and that was the last time you saw Brian?
Oh, he came to see me again a couple months after the trial.
Wanted me to be in his life.
Like, what am I gonna do?
Take him to Arthur treacher's, the movies?
I gave him up once.
He should have taken the hint.
Are we done?
'Cause I need to use--
Just one more thing.
Did you ever tell Brian he had a twin?
Yeah, I told him.
And he goes on and on about how he always knew something was missing.
Jeez, you could hear the violins.
1992, Richmond, Catherine Smith gets the death penalty for murdering her husband.
"The jury watched in horror as their teenage son Brian gave chilling testimony about the brutal murder."
So we're looking for a Brian Smith.
I'm already on it.
Yeah, well, good luck with that.
What's there, like, 10,000 people named Brian Smith in the United States?
But how many of them follow their twin to New York?
There are 126 Brian Smiths in New York City.
But they're twins, guys.
Let's look at their birthdates.
Okay, February 6th, 1975.
Brian Smith started as a provisional for the parks department
July of this year.
Son of a bitch.
- Let's go pick him up.
- Hold on.
Let's bring the DA up to speed.
There are some issues here.
You have got to be kidding me.
This is still a win.
Same DNA.
Same ID.
For two different suspects.
Right?
Who are twins.
This is the definition of reasonable doubt.
Why didn't Gabriel bring this up?
He didn't know.
It's been Brian's plan from the start.
He tracked Gabriel city to city.
He knew, if he ever got caught, he could put it on his twin.
Well, it is a very good plan.
Because there's no way a jury can tell them apart.
Well, how about if we caught Brian in the act?
How are you gonna do that, captain?
This guy, he has self-control.
He won't strike while his brother's in prison.
What if we let him think Gabriel's out?
And terrorize the whole city?
We set a trap.
He does like blondes.
On further consideration, the court agrees to release Gabriel Thomas for the sum of $250,000.
You're confined to the New York City borders, and you must continue psychiatric treatment.
Your next hearing will be October 6th.
The public is outraged at your release.
How are you enjoying your freedom?
If you set me free, why aren't I home?
Or should I even bother asking?
Look, I know this has been a crazy ride.
- Cra--
- But you'll know everything once we have it sorted out.
What kind of game are you playin'?
Just tell me what's going on.
Can I get you something to eat?
My attorney won't even tell me.
Sit tight, Gabe.
Oh, do I have a choice?
Anybody got eyes on him?
He's still sweeping.
Oh, he's been watching you for four days.
And all Brian's done is snap a few pictures.
Maybe you aren't his type after all.
Come on.
He hasn't taken his eyes off me since I stepped into the park.
Wait a minute, hold up, he's on the move.
Where?
I got him too.
Heading north toward the overlook by the flower garden.
I'm there now.
I think you hooked him.
Stay in sight.
Stay close, Rollins.
Agh.
Rollins, update your location.
Rollins!
You're a feisty one.
- Rollins!
- Give me a smile.
Okay.
No, no, just slow it down.
Slow it down.
I'll give you what you want.
Look at me.
Look at my face.
Police!
Put down your weapon.
Now!
Put it down.
All right, Amaro!
Hey, enough!
Enough!
Whoa, whoa, come on, come on, easy, easy.
We got him.
I got him.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You were supposed to stay close.
I had my shot, and I took it.
Okay, what the hell was that?
You trying to ruin this case?
I know this guy better than anybody.
I know what makes him tick, captain.
Just save it.
Right now, we've only got him on one charge-- his attack on you.
And that makes you a witness.
Hold on, guys.
This is her collar.
No, he attacked Rollins.
She gets his confession to anything else, the defense'll get it thrown out
- on prejudice.
- I think I know how to conduct myself on a witness stand.
You heard the counselor.
The second I got into that tunnel, she came onto me.
Then why'd you need the knife?
We caught you in the act.
It's over, dude.
Is that what you think?
You don't know the half of it.
Well, please, tell us.
We're listening.
You want me to talk, I will talk.
To her.
The blonde.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh.
Okay, then.
Lawyer.
Well, he said the magic word.
We got enough to get him without it?
The wire went in and out in the tunnel.
Amaro may have used excessive force.
Rollins ran out of his view.
It was the only way to--
The defense will paint this as two new detectives trying to make a name for themselves.
And there's still reasonable doubt on everything because of his twin.
So, if he doesn't talk to the blonde, he walks?
Captain, we need a statement.
Heard you wanted to see me.
You look so much prettier when you smile.
So do you.
You know, I've actually been-- been wanting to talk to you for a long time.
Oh, is that right?
I'm a southern girl.
I worked sex crimes in Atlanta.
I'm actually the one that named you.
I've been obsessed with you a little bit, to tell you the truth.
I always thought I was your type.
Mm-hmm.
Down to a "T".
A hell of a run.
Brian, you were the best.
- I'll give you that.
- I am the best.
You and me in the--in the park, that was another thing.
You were... oh, all cute and bouncy.
You teased me.
Just like all the other girls.
What other girls?
Oh, that was my brother.
It's the same DNA.
So that was the plan all along.
Just leave enough of your DNA so we can pin it on your brother.
And you even made sure to get the tattoo just like him.
It's...
- it's genius.
- You said that, not me.
Couple of holes, though.
Hmm?
- Can you lift up your shirt?
- What?
Lift up your shirt for me, baby.
I want to show you something.
It is your party.
See, that's some scar.
Your twin brother doesn't have that scar.
Doesn't have a chipped tooth either.
We have victims that saw both.
Is that the best that you got?
I mean, it was dark.
Witnesses make mistakes all the time.
You know that.
What about that Halloween rape?
2003.
Did your brother do that one?
I don't know.
He could have.
Did you know his wife had a miscarriage that weekend?
Doctors and nurses all claim that he never left her side.
There is always a back door.
He was 100 miles away, Brian.
Sit down.
'Cause you, you made another mistake.
You lost your screwdriver that night in the dark.
You left a fingerprint.
It's sloppy work, you know, for you.
That one, it's gonna cost you big time.
'Cause twins have the same DNA, but different fingerprints, but you knew that.
Right?
That's why you started wearing the gloves.
Brian.
I know.
You had to teach yourself everything.
Not your brother, not Gabriel.
Gabriel got to go to school, got to go to college.
He's got a great life.
I mean, you've seen his wife, his cute son.
You followed him all these years, and you never...
never said hello.
You don't know anything about me.
Yeah?
We met your mother.
Your real mother.
At the halfway house.
And she told us that you came and found her.
You know what she said?
"I gave him up once.
You would think he'd take the hint the first time."
And that must have hurt.
She's a drunk whore.
Who cares?
You do.
Especially since you know what good care she took of your twin.
She took such good care of your brother.
She told us that she made sure he found a good home.
She made sure to send birthday cards.
I had good parents.
Your mother killed your father in front of you, Brian.
That's horrible.
Nobody should have to go through that.
Nah, it didn't break me.
No?
I disagree.
Your own mother gave you up.
Your second mother, she's a nightmare.
Brian.
It's okay.
Anybody would be broken.
No one's ever really listened to you, have they?
I want to hear your whole story.
Not just these... mistakes.
Everything.
I've got all night.
And I'm not leavin' you.
Look at me.
Look at my face.
It's over, Gabriel.
You're free to go home.
Just like that?
Why?
Why?
What happened?
We found the guy.
Who?
Who is that?
Your twin brother.
My...
I didn't know that.
He did.
Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad
Mother, are you okay?
Where are we going?
We should head for Mahan or Silla.
You're abandoning Baekje now?
I don't have any soldiers.
Isn't Yeohwi siding with Yeogu?
Let's go to Hanseong.
Mother
The Wiryegung ruler's dead.
You're now the 13th Eroha of Baekje.
A king mustn't abandon his country.
Let's go to Hanseong.
I, Hae Geon as commander of Baekje, Sutanseong Fortress, Daebang
I killed Bu Yeojun for trying to make Baekje fall.
Is that true?
Is this a plot to have us open the fortress gate?
Tie him up.
Yes!
We should show Hae Geon to the Choseongni soldiers and have them surrender.
That means we'll accept him.
He must be eliminated.
Attacking Gomori's important.
Is killing Hae Geon an urgent matter?
Establishing our lord's authenticity is more important.
If you embrace him because Hae Geon has the royal seal, it'll be a flaw in your great cause.
Besides, we can't trust him.
Let's say we win over the Choseongni soldiers and attack Gomori.
What if they collude with the Goguryeo soldiers and attack us?
Get everyone together.
You can't let him live.
He tried to kill you several times.
You can't let him live.
He murdered his lord, Eoraha.
How can you trust him?
You can't let him live.
The Hae clan lied at the center of all the internal dispute in Baekje.
You've to cut off Hae Geon's head and hang it up.
You can't let him live.
I only kill Eoraha for Baekje's sake.
I'm just trying to be a loyal servant, how can you make me a traitor?
You can't let him live
The people of Liaoxi won't have any ill feelings for him.
It's not easy for a servant to kill his master.
You can't trust him.
We don't know the internal matters of Baekje well.
We should stay out of this.
Brother.
How did it go?
There's no answer yet.
My lord's hesitating.
Why is he hesitating over Hae Nyeong's son?
He killed Bu Yeojun.
So, he'll let him live?
If Hae Geon stays alive, it'll give the Hae clan means to rise.
You must convince our lord to kill Hae Geon.
Okay, father.
Hae Geon's sly.
Whether the result's good or not, there's no need to let him live.
Baekje has two clans with deep roots.
The Jin clan and Hae clan.
They have to keep each other in check for there to be room for us.
So it's better for us if Hae Geon's alive.
The Queen of Goguryeo will have power if Hae Geon remains alive.
[Gomoriseong Fortress, Daebang, Goguryeo]
We'll attack Moroseong as soon as general Ko Noja arrives.
Isn't the Baekje king's corpse there?
It's a great opportunity for Goguryeo to take Ungniha.
This is no time for such etiquette.
We'll have to divide up the soldiers to attack Moroseong and the salt seller.
Your Highness.
Your highness, no.
You'll be put in prison again.
Let go.
Your Majesty!
- Is he here?
- The soldiers crossed Neoreunyeoul.
The ice melted.
I can't believe they came so fast.
King Chumo's soul's helping us.
You'll attack Moroseong.
Ko Noja and Sou will attack Yeogu with me.
I'll send 1,000 soldiers to Moroseong and 4,000 to Sutanseong.
Your Majesty.
What is it?
The former queen got caught trying to leave the fortress.
What?
Were you trying to go to your father?
Father passed away.
I might just be a servant of Eosugwan, but I can't cook right now.
I have to go to my father.
Wait a little while.
I'll let you go.
Your Majesty, we're going to attack Moroseong, why are you letting the queen go?
My father was your father-in-law.
His coffin's still in Moroseong... how...
As soon as Ko Noja arrives, we'll attack Sutanseong first.
Get a carriage ready to take the queen to Moroseong.
Bring her back right away when she's done paying her condolences.
The jwapeong's here!
What brings you here?
I'm here for the traitor who murdered Eoraha.
There's no need for hesitation.
There's no reason to let him live.
Ko Heung, what do you think?
You've to be very careful.
You need the Choseongni soldiers, but you can't let your morality be damaged by embracing a traitor.
Do you believe him?
Hae Geon murdered the Wiryegung ruler?
Wiryegung ruler: 12th Eoraha of Baekje
Well...
Execute him for murdering Eoraha.
- My lord.
- What is it?
Jwapyeong Hae came for Hae Geon.
The Choseongni soldiers are really happy to see their master.
Choseongniseong Fortress:
Hae clan base
Hello.
Eoraha.
Who are you calling Eoraha?
Eoraha was murdered by a traitor.
Even if you don't accept it,
I'm the true Eoraha of Baekje enthroned by King Biryu.
Prince Yeogu.
You immoral and corrupt fool.
I thought you'd seek a high position.
Just look at you.
Father.
Father!
Father!
Don't call me your father.
You're not my son.
You're a traitor!
I did it for Baekje.
It wasn't personal reasons.
Who asked you to worry about Baekje?
Eoraha worries about Baekje.
You just had to protect your lord.
Traitor!
I'm going to kill you, your mother and myself.
I'll ask Eoraha for forgiveness by doing so.
Father, you gave me life.
Take it if you wish.
But, I only did it out of loyalty for Baekje.
Every word you say has foul odor.
I'll cut off that tongue too.
Stop!
How dare you act like this in front of our lord?
Is the Liaoxi Gungong my lord?
If you don't want to see his head cut off, hand him over to me.
I'll take him to Moroseong and cut it off in front of Eoraha's coffin.
Leave yourself.
You're going to let him live?
He surrendered to me.
I'll decide whether he lives or not.
Will having him by your side do you any good?
If you won't hand him over, kill him with your hands.
Hand him over to his father.
Hand him over.
I can't do that.
Unlock the chains.
You mustn't let him live.
You can't let him live.
Our lord has made a decision, why are you questioning him?
This isn't a matter of your concern.
This isn't an urgent matter right now.
We should focus on attacking Gomori.
Have the Choseongni soldiers retreat.
Just cut off Hae Geon's head.
Did you ever have a private conversation with my father?
I'm sure you were this close many times even if you weren't alone.
Why didn't you murder my father then?
The Wiryegung ruler could have risen to the throne sooner.
I wanted to, but everyone knew that doing so would ruin Baekje.
So, have the Choseongni soldiers retreat.
If we fight against each other, Goguryeo will have Baekje.
I know you love Baekje.
Have the Choseongni soldiers retreat.
Hand over the two princes first.
I will.
I won't blame Yeomin and Yeomun for Bu Yeojun's sins.
Hand over Hae Geon too.
I couldn't call myself a king if I sent someone who surrendered to me to die.
I came for the Wiryegung princes.
Is it true that Hae Geon murdered father?
It's all my fault.
I'm sorry.
How can he do such a thing?
You call yourself a loyal servant of Wiryegung?
Eoraha waited 40 years.
From now on, I'll serve you and make you king.
You can fight at Moroseong.
Let's get out of here first.
I'm only taking the Wiryegung princes.
You're on your own.
Eoraha's coffin can't be carried without a chief mourner.
That's why our lord's sending you.
Just think of the funeral.
If you don't keep the promise to have the Choseongni soldiers retreat, your safety won't be guaranteed.
You!
Prince.
I just didn't want Baekje to fall into the hands of Goguryeo.
That's a bit excessive.
Get up.
Father.
I don't have a son.
You're a humiliation to the Hae clan.
You're just a criminal who murdered Eoraha.
Whether you eat, walk or hold your child in future, don't put your guard down.
Wiryegung will be after your head.
They went to Moroseong with the Choseongni soldiers.
Did you observe Hae Geon?
It didn't seem like it was a plot.
- Watch every move Hae Geon makes.
- I will.
I have to see Yeohwi.
Are you in despair over this?
You're like a heroine who can embrace the entire world.
But, I'm such a small dish!
- Yeochan.
- Is Yeohwi my brother?
Is he your son?
Yeochan.
What do you want to do in Hanseong?
Nothing's over there.
We don't have anything.
King Biryu started as a salt seller and became the 11th Eoraha of Baekje.
Yeogu came this far using Cheonghawon as a basis.
Cheonghawan: salt manor in Liaoxi
You're the crown prince.
You're in despair over this?
That's why father abandoned me and Yeogu's doing this to me.
Be quiet!
It's not soldiers you need.
You need a will to protect your throne...
Mother.
Mother.
I'm alright.
I can beat poison.
What I can't stand isn't death or poison.
It's you falling to pieces.
I'm sorry.
I won't fall to pieces...
I'll hang in there.
This was father's order which he was going to give to Namdang.
I thought Wanwoldang had it.
Hyungnim, did you have it?
I'm making a huge decision for the sake of Baekje, so listen.
Sayu of Goguryeo's strong and I'm getting old.
Will the present crown prince be able to stop Goguryeo?
We lost Gomoriseong because of Bu Yeochan's incompetence.
He can't be crown prince anymore.
I designate Queen Jin Saha's son, Bu Yeogu, as crown prince.
Bu Yeochan's to be removed from crown prince and executed for getting 4,000 soldiers killed.
Father.
Hyungnim.
I would like to ask for this part of the order.
When you return to Hanseong, you must clear your name with this order and become Eoraha.
I have to.
The members of Namdang will use father's order as an excuse to try and kill Yeochan.
Whatever Namdang's reason is,
I can't let a criminal who murdered father live.
Of course not.
Mother mustn't live.
She killed her husband.
She deserves to die.
However, Yeochan didn't murder father.
I'm sure of that.
He tried to be recognized by father all his life, but father tried to have him killed, so you could rule Baekje.
He's my older brother and you're the crown prince I must serve.
Give it to Namdang or give it to me.
Do as you wish.
I'll give it to you.
Crown prince, I'll go and stop Ko Noja.
I can't send you.
Ko Noja's bringing a large army.
I know the Daebang land best.
Give me Bu Gantae and Bok Gugeom.
I'll buy you time to take Gomori.
I'd like to see our lord.
You won't be able to.
He's preparing to go to war.
You can't go out.
You can't take a step out of here.
Jin Seung will attack the west gate, Ajikai will attack the north gate,
Ko Heung will attack the east gate and I'll attack the south gate.
Dugo will surround the fortress, so Ko Noja can't communicate.
Yes, sir.
We don't know how long Yeohwi can hold up Ko Noja.
We've to take Gomori.
Even if we stop communications, it won't be easy to take the fortress.
They only have 500 soldiers.
Gomori's the main fortress, It was deemed to be impregnable.
Don't expect to open the gate at once.
If we cut off communications with Ko Noja, it'll drive them crazy.
Sayu will open the gate and come out.
My lord.
Why did you barge in here?
You're not our lord's servant.
Take me with you.
If you give me Eul Mahul and ten soldiers,
I'll open the south gate.
Just stay here.
I know you don't trust me completely and want to keep me hostage.
Then be quiet and leave.
I have to go in order to be able to open the gate.
Give me a chance to prove my loyalty.
Brother!
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Go ahead.
Not here.
You don't have to follow us.
Come on.
What's so urgent?
Does it have to do with the Queen of Goguryeo?
You can't bring Yeohwa here.
You can't out the Queen of Goguryeo by our lord's side.
Are you jealous of her now?
Maybe.
I can't say I'm not.
But, it's for the same reason you said Hae Geon must remain alive.
She's right.
She should stay in Goguryeo or not be here at all.
She'll be a burden to our lord.
Hongran will also suffer.
Nobody will want her by our lord's side.
Neither do I.
Okay.
I'm going to attack Gomori.
Cut off Sayu's head.
Show Wi Birang that he can't be equal to the leader of the Jin clan.
I'll remember that.
Seung, you mustn't bring back Princess Yeohwa.
The Queen of Baekje must be from the Jin clan.
Princess Yeohwa mustn't become queen.
Wiryegung mustn't be allowed to rise again.
I understand.
Good.
The future of our Jin clan lies in your hands.
Taking Gomoriseong was a long time wish of our previous Eoraha.
We're going to retake Gomoriseong today.
We'll attack Goguryeo and make all of the Daebang land into Baekje territory!
Will they take such a narrow path with a large army?
It's the fastest way to Gomori.
It's a narrow path.
Many soldiers will be sacrificed.
I'll take the lead.
No, you can't.
Gugeom, I'll take the lead.
Don't say anything.
Soseono, King Biryu.
You should pray to King Dongmyeong.
King Dongmyeong: founder of Buyeo
Who are you praying to?
Wait outside.
I'll be quiet.
I said wait outside.
Help my lord conquer Goguryeo.
Help him win and return safely to my side.
If you can't leave Yeohwa at Sayu's side, take her life at Gomori.
Father, this isn't jealousy.
I'm not jealous of her yet.
I'm sure you don't want Yeohwa by his side either.
What a bold prayer.
We're sorry for interrupting.
It's alright.
I'm sure you both came to pray too.
Join me.
- Are you treating us like servants?
- Godo.
My husband's your lord.
Doesn't that make you my servants?
You prayed for Princess Yeohwa's death and now this?
You're really bold.
I don't want Yeohwa to die.
I just don't want her to come back.
Isn't that what you wanted too?
You don't want the Hae clan to be in power and I don't want Yeohwa to be in power.
Right, but we don't want you to become the queen either.
The queen has to be from the Jin clan.
Is that so?
But, what can you do?
I'm going to be your queen.
[Outside Gomoriseong Fortress, Daebang, Goguryeo]
It won't be easy for our soldiers to go around like this and take the fortress.
I'll take the Choseongni soldiers and take the fortress.
If this is a plot, I'll kill you.
Who's there?
Annamjanggun Hae Geon.
What do you want?
I need to discuss something with the queen.
I'll be going now.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty, don't let the former queen leave yet.
What's going on?
Hae Geon's at the south gate.
Hae Geon?
He must be here to tell her about the Baekje king's death.
Let him in.
Push through!
Gomoriseong's in danger.
Push through!
Don't let a single soldier live.
Kill them!
Let's go.
Let's go!
The Saori soldiers will come with me!
Proceed behind us.
It was a plot to open the gate?
Where's the queen?
Your Majesty, open the door!
Your Majesty!
The Baekjans are in the fortress.
Hurry.
Hurry, you've to get out of here, Your Majesty.
What?
Was it Hae Geon's doing?
- Where's Sayu?
- We're looking for him.
Find Sayu
- Sayu mustn't get away.
- Yes, my lord.
Stop!
I'm going to kill that salt seller.
No.
Get out of my way!
If you die fighting Yan, you'll be the pride of Goguryeo.
But, if you die here, you'll be a humiliation.
How can we fight them with 500 soldiers?
It's not losing to take refuge for now.
Use the east gate.
Take the king's flag to the south gate to distract them.
Sou will go to the north gate.
I'll go to the west gate.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
You won't get out of here.
You want me to die?
Baekje soldiers are everywhere.
You won't be able to leave by yourself.
You need my help.
You're going to save my life?
I said I would never forget you sparing my life when I returned.
I'm going to repay you today.
The king's flag!
Go after them!
It's the King of Goguryeo.
Don't let them get away.
Who are you?
Don't you recognize me?
I'm the queen's lady-in-waiting, Dandan.
Oh, Dan...
Then, is Princess Yeohwa in the carriage?
Yes.
Lower the carriage.
You can't leave right now.
Stay inside, the soldiers will take you.
Are you trying to stop me?
I'm going to see my father.
You dare to stop me?
Then, please get approval from my lord.
We're at war right now.
You can't leave the fortress.

MAN:
There was a cartoon when I was young called "Jungle Book."
I'm sure you've heard of it -
- Disney.
Now, at the end,
Mowgli... goes off with the men, with the fire.
And he leaves the... the jungle.
And I remember watching it, and the lights were down real low, and I remember I cried my eyes out.
Now, I wasn't one given to cry much,
I mean, not about movies, but this one made me cry.
And I was like, "No, don't leave!
Don't go with the men!
Trust me, I mean it!
I know how horrible it is.
You do not want to," you know.
I didn't know y'all as "neurotypicals" back then, but you did not want to come into society.
Trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be.
Not because I hated society, but because I thought I knew enough to tell them, "Oh, I wouldn't have made that decision."
You know, I had been abused and hurt so much by people trying to make me normal, that if, you know, if you went with them,
I was like, "Oh, gosh, they're going to be trying to make you normal."
And that just would have -- for me, everybody else saw that as a good thing.
I saw it as the saddest movie I'd ever seen.
[Laughing]
MAN:
All right, we're going to get going, Violet, let's go.
GIRL:
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
MAN:
Time to go home.
GIRL:
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!
[Crying, screeching]
Daddy, no!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Aagh!
Ow!
[Crying]
MAN:
Okay.
Okay.
GIRL:
Daddy, no!
Daddy!
[Girl shrieking]
Time to go.
Stand up.
[Girl shrieking]
Stand up.
GIRL:
Dad, no!
Okay.
[Girl crying]
It's okay, it's okay.
[Girl coughing]
All right.
MAN:
Everything I did between one and eight... was basic, almost direct prompting.
If you prompted me to do something, I would do it.
I was really big in mimicking.
So if you showed me how to do something, you know, if you sat there and you did this,
I'd do the exact same thing.
Now, it doesn't -- so that if you didn't do this, this part wasn't gonna get clean.
Before eight, there was no database.
So you could teach me something, but I didn't have a place to store it.
It wasn't until I failed third grade that I realized you have to store this stuff, because when they teach it to you, they expect you to be able to pull it back up.

Oh, whoa!
Ah, ah, ah!
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, yeah!
[Humming]
Try again, Mr. Noodle!
Try again.
Oh, oh!
CHILD ON TV:
Try again, Mr. Noodle.
ELMO:
Try again.
WOMAN:
Just because you can't speak the way we're speaking right now, it doesn't mean you're not thinking and that you don't have ideas and opinions.
We get so fixated, I think, on hitting that median, hitting that main number.
Most kids do "X" by this age.
And if your kid doesn't do it by that age, there's so much anxiety and so much worry.
I don't want to paint this rosy picture that just because we are very accepting of Violet and just because she has her good days and she has amazing qualities as a human being, it doesn't mean things are always perfect
or that we always stay patient -- we try really hard.
We've all lost our cool at some point or another.
I mean, what parent doesn't, at some point, go,
"Aagh!
Why won't you just listen?
!"
You know, and it's frustrating.
MAN:
Here, wash your hands.
WOMAN:
We didn't care if she was autistic or not, so why bother getting a diagnosis, because that's just going to put a big stamp on her -- "autistic."
People are going to write her off, people are going to underestimate her, they're going to put her in a little pigeonhole of like, "Okay, you're autistic, so this is your capacity.
And here's the regular kid, and there's their capacity."
MAN:
All right, civilization!
I came from an educated, middle-class black family.
And we knew that education was the way out of poverty, and it was the way into success.
So when I failed third grade, it was the biggest scandal I'd ever seen.
And my grandmother went down to University of Maryland Hospital, and she basically told those doctors,
"You are going to tell me why my son failed.
What is wrong with him?"
And she knew that there was something wrong.
My grandmother, my great-grandmother -- everybody in the family said,
"There's something wrong with this kid."
And three doctors came downstairs.
And they sat there, and they pored over my notes and everything, and they said, "Well, we think it's autism."
And they said, "Well, you have two choices.
You can put him in a hospital, but you seem like you've got him pretty far along.
I would suggest whatever it is you're doing, continue doing it."
And meanwhile, another doctor told me what I had.
And he said, "How did you get this far, because you're really remarkable?"
And I was like, "First time I ever heard this."
And I told him, I said, "I have systems.
Systems for everything."
And he says, "Well, keep building the systems."
And in the room, I could hear my grandmother crying.
Up until that time, I had never heard her cry.
And I was mad.
I was gonna go in there and tear somebody's head off.
But then this great big, fat doctor --
I'll never forget him -- he was tall and he was fat.
And he walked over to my grandmother, and he said,
"Mom," 'cause he didn't know my mother's name.
He said, "Mom, I want you to continue and encourage your son in building these systems.
This is how he understands the world, so you're gonna have to encourage him."
He says, "Now, Wolf, I want you to continue to build the systems."
He says, "Now, Mom, when his systems go outside of society's norms, I want you to tell him so he can, you know, chop that piece off.
And keep him inside of the norms.
And, Wolf, when she tells you to take a piece apart, or take it apart, take it apart and rebuild it."
He said, "And keep rebuilding it until you can rebuild it into something that works in this society."
And I've been doing that ever since.
What's this?
What's that?
-Four!
-What's that?
GIRL:
Seven.
-What's that?
-Five.
-What's that?
-Nine.
-What's that?
-Six.
-What's that?
-Two.
-What's that?
-Three.
-What's that?
-Eight!
-What's that?
-One.
High five!
Yes!

[Woman inhales]
[Exhales]
[Girl inhales]
[Woman inhales]
Boo!
[Girl shrieks, giggles]
[Playing somber tune]
We're kind of whittling it down to the ideal for her, of like no dairy and all.
Something to help her rigidity and just being really open and not treating her like she has a disability.
WOMAN:
The medication was a huge decision, too.
We thought about that for months.
Are we gonna put our three-year-old on antidepressants?
It just seemed crazy.
MAN:
There's an element of not being able to go back after that.
That's what I was always worried about, is that, okay, we're going to put her on this, and is there any turning back?
Is there any stopping?
WOMAN:
Right, she might be on it for the rest of her life.
And, in fact, a lot of autistic adults take one or more medications to help them cope with their anxiety and cope with depression.
VJ was at a point of frustration when we lived in Louisa where I'd come home from work, and she would cry to me, like, every day.
And something was wrong -- and she knew it and I knew it.
So -- and I had always battled depression really badly, too, but I'd never gotten on medication for it.
So she goes to the doctor and gets a pill, and then, like, a week later, she's like, totally -- not a totally different person,
I'm not gonna say that.
But she's not -- she's happier, and, like, just more even.
You know, and I was like, "I need me some of that."
[Laughter]
[Laughing]
WOLF:
There's some people that use medication as a chemical straitjacket, and that's always wrong, especially with autism because, with autism, you have tantrums.
And I'm still pretty good at tantrums.
I don't think you ever lose it.
But when I was a kid, I was especially good.
And some people will use medication to just keep them quiet, and, you know, so that they can have a nice eight hours, you know, working with the kids.
And that's always going to be wrong.
Because my tantrums gave my parents insights to how to help me, what things were I having trouble with.
Now, medication is fine as long as the medication is only trying to help the autistic person work better and work smarter.
But if it's just meant to be a chemical straitjacket, no.
The autistic person has to be a partner in their success.
They have to be a partner in growing up to be the successful person I've become.
The cool thing about my family is that they made me a full partner.
You know, they showed me the world the way it really is and they said, "Wolf, this is the world the way it really is.
You might not like it, but you're going to have to deal with it.
And you can't have tantrums and you can't throw a chair across the room, you know, when somebody makes you mad.
Or when somebody blows one of your systems.
When somebody does something you don't expect.
You can't kick everybody in the face just because they touch you.
You know, and that's the way the real world is."
And my parents gave me that.
And because of that, you know -- and if medicine helps me to calm down to the point to where, okay, I understand why I don't need to kick them in the face, then that's a good use of medicine.
Because medicine is helping you to keep your system calm.
But it's not calming you so much that you are involuntarily calmed and you have no input and no part to play in who you become.
MAN:
Okay, stop.
Stop.
Turn around.
Turn around.
Go on.
GIRL:
No!
[Whining]
Let's go this way.
[Girl shrieking]
GIRL:
Stand up?
MAN:
No, you don't have to.
I think she just wants to keep going, keep exploring forever.
Like always, like that's...
I don't know, man, she just doesn't...
Like she just doesn't want to go back, you know.
It just seems to us like she'd just want to keep walking until she just collapsed.
You know.
And then she'd wake up, eat some grass,
[Chuckles] and then just keep going.
We can't figure out, you know, like we just can't.
We know some things.
We know how she's going to react to some things, but like, we don't know.
She's a mystery.
That's like the whole point.
She's so mysterious, and like you said yesterday, really stoic.
No, thank you.
GIRL:
No!
-Be a good girl, please.
GIRL:
No!
MAN:
Please be a good girl.
GIRL:
N-N-No.
MAN:
Be a good girl.
We're going to have to go this way.
[Girl shrieks]
GIRL:
Stand up?
MAN:
You don't have to stand up.
You just can't go any further.
[Girl whines]
Just be a good girl.
[Kiss] Yes, that's right.
I mean, it was definitely a lot easier when we got the diagnosis, but...
Big hug?
Okay.
Oh!
[Girl whines]
MAN:
I know.
I know.
That feels good on your face, doesn't it?
[Chuckles]
Feels good on your face, that breeze.
[Girl coos]
I don't like looking in people's eyes for some reason.
It really distracts me.
It's something that I actually had to be coached for a while to do.
I remember it was a big thing, actually, and I felt a little bit miffed when I got to middle school because half the time, people talked to you without looking at you.
It...
I kind of always felt like, if people are normal, they are allowed to act however they want to some extent, socially, but if people have a syndrome, everybody feels like they need to improve them.
Let your buddy across.
Thanks, dudes.
Hey, Billy, can you grab the door?
BOY:
Close the thing up.
MAN:
It's okay.
GIRL:
Can't reach.
MAN:
Hey, man, how'd it go?
Good.
MAN:
It's a predictable question, but...
Made it through another week.
BOY:
Yeah.
Alan Wolf came and talked to us today.
MAN:
Oh, did he?
Yeah.
MAN:
Did you talk to him?
-Yeah.
MAN:
Did he know who you are?
No.
I just told him he did a good job.
MAN:
Oh, jeez, man, you should have told him, uh...
You should have told him who you were.
How?
Why?
MAN: 'Cause we know him.
Oh.
MAN:
His mom helped do a poem at our wedding.
We're really good friends with them.
-Crap.
MAN:
Yeah, man.
GIRL:
Okay, can we put a dunce cap on him now?
MAN:
No, he doesn't need a dunce cap.
I just wished he'd have told Alan.
My whole life, until I was maybe like 22 or so, when I was diagnosed,
I thought that the reason people made small talk -- you know, like standing in line at the grocery store, and, "oh, nice day today" --
I thought that the reason people did stuff like that was because they had nothing interesting to think about inside their heads.
So, I thought that most of the rest of the world were a bunch of idiots with no thoughts.
So, if somebody was friendly and said like, "Oh, nice day!"
I didn't really -- sometimes I'd just be like, "Mm-hmm, yeah."
'Cause I just didn't see the point in carrying on a conversation when, one, this person was being really rude.
They're interrupting my thought process.
I had interesting things going on up here.
You know, they want to talk to me about the weather?
What?
And my dad explained to me, people get little positive vibes from interacting with other people, even strangers, and even on really benign things.
He said, "It's like when you play the Sims and they get little plus signs above their head when they talk to each other."
And I was like, "Huh."
So that was why people did that.
I was like, I don't feel like I get little plus signs above my head when I talk to people.
And I still don't, but like I understand that other people do.
So now I engage in small talk more, because I respect other people more, because I'm understanding their behavior.
And I no longer think that people are idiots.
WOMAN:
You're eating so quick that I thought maybe something really interesting was going on.
MAN:
You anxious to get back to the game?
Hmm?
BOY:
Yeah.
MAN:
You got homework?
[Boy mumbling]
MAN:
Okay.
WOMAN:
Thank you.
[Chuckling]
MAN:
Nonverbal cues.
People take them for granted.
But trust me, when you don't pick up on them, there's nothing that's more important.
Um, how to have a conversation without... without taking it over, or without losing interest and getting bored.
"I'm sorry, what were you saying?
I just, you know, was in outer space."
I had to literally analyze how did people, how did they converse?
What you do is, first, make sure you learn their name.
A person's own name is their favorite word in the whole wide world, always remember that, so use it.
And you can actually convince them that you're listening if all you do is just repeat the last three to four words of what they're saying.
It works like magic.
They will continue talking, mesmerized by your validating what they're saying by repeating the last three words.
They're going on and on and on.
"Oh, yeah, and then he practically went off the cliff."
Off the cliff?
"Yeah, off the cliff.
He lost control of the car, and the next thing you know, he rolled it and he got out.
He couldn't believe he walked away from the wreck and everybody was fine, and it was just amazing!"
And then you just follow, "Amazing."
And they're so captivated by you.
And it's probably best not to talk, because, as somebody with Aspies, you might not pick up on the nonverbal cue as to when you're going on a little bit too long or being a little bit too revealing.
Um, not censoring properly.
But trust me, there's verbal cues that people give off, so, when in doubt, just repeat the last three words of whatever they're saying.
They'll go on for hours.
And they will talk about you as if you were the greatest thing next to the iPhone.
Oh, my God!
[Off-screen laughter, indistinct conversation]
I don't know.
A lot of the girls in Morganton I just can't relate to.
[Sighs]
Some of them are just mean as hell and...
Some...
Some are nice, but I just can't relate to them.
We don't have much in common.
There's one girl that kind of liked me.
Her name was Sarah.
We went out once.
Uh...
[Scoffs]
As far as music, she was onto like Christian rock and stuff like that and...
I like alternative rock, some metal, and... some old rap.
So...
We didn't really have much in common.
She didn't play video games or anything.
She's on Runescape, sometimes, but that's about it.
Uh...
And she didn't skateboard or anything.
WOMAN:
I read Entertainment Weekly because I'm obsessed with reading movie reviews now.
I read that apparently "Grey's Anatomy" is getting this female doctor with Asperger Syndrome.
And, you know, ordinarily, you'd think that was really good, but they mention that her problems are going to be like communicating with people, and that she's going to be one of the only characters on the show
who doesn't end up having sex.
And I felt like I wanted to barf when I heard that, because
I don't want this doctor to just teach them a bunch of lessons about how lucky they are or something trite like that.
I want her to actually have experiences out of this, too.
So I hope that the writers allow her to make mistakes and have like relationships.
'Cause it is possible for people with autism to be romantically involved with other people, you know.
Just because Temple Grandin doesn't do it doesn't mean that it never happens.
You know, people might look at me and maybe they think I'm attractive, maybe they don't.
It really doesn't matter if you are or not because some people are going to not find you attractive and other people are just going to think, you know, that you are just a god.
But whether you are or not, it's always like really hard to flirt.
I mean...
So I just always... develop like these rules.
Like, okay, um... she touches me on my arm, that's a green light for me to move closer in.
She touches me on my leg, she wants me to kiss her.
Um...
If I don't know, and I want to go for -- and I'm really, really, really, really nervous, and I don't know what to do to initiate a good-night kiss or something like that,
what I'll do is I'll touch her hair and I'll compliment her hair being extraordinarily soft or something.
And if she backs away,
I know that she doesn't want me to kiss her good night, and I don't know why, but at least for me,
I don't know, it's a crutch that I use to hobble into the kiss good night.
Um, but, you know,
I really don't know what I'm doing.
I sometimes think that I'm, you know, almost incompatible because of my Aspies.
And it's funny because people might think,
"Well, gosh, you seem really normal."
Yeah, well, you don't have to live with me.
And it's usually when people only get to really know me that all these behaviors creep out and they get frustrated and...
The only difference now is, having been diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome,
I know better than to try and change myself.
MAN:
I don't get instructions verbally very well, and I would always just kind of look around and try to figure out what's going on in the gym.
And with tag, it's apparent that being "it" is not desirable because the person who's "it"
tries to tag someone else so that they're "it."
I was never tagged, and so I just assumed that I was really great at tag and I was winning.
And no one chased me.
I was just standing in the gym, winning.
[Chuckles]
But it was really boring.
And one day I just left, I just took a walk in the corridors, and somebody went after me and herded me back to the gym and informed me that not being tagged is not actually winning at tag,
that you actually are supposed to be tagged.
And while I don't remember that she used this word specifically, essentially she said, "Well, you're just supposed to get in there and frolic, go frolic, you're a kid."
And so then I was back in the gym, back in the tag game, still standing in the gym but I wasn't winning anymore.
So...
And I wasn't frolicking, either.
[Laughter]
I lack that gene.
So I gave way more thought to the game of tag for the next several years than anyone should.
And I figured out that being "it" is desirable and you pretend that it's not desirable.
But since it really is desirable, you only try to tag people that you like.
And nobody, to my knowledge, disliked me.
But very few people even really knew me, so I wasn't tagged.
So being "it" is desirable and you pretend that it's not.
And then, much later, in college,
I realized that there's only one sense, not five, and the one is touch.
That what we call touch is the least sensitive form of touch.
That when you see, you've got light hitting the backs of your eyes, and when you hear, sound is hitting your eardrums, and when you taste, you've got taste receptors that are engaging actual molecules.
So everything is a form of touch, and so I decided that tag could be way more subtle than it was ever played in grade school.
Like if I say "tag," I just hit your eardrums and you're it.
Or if I write "tag" on a piece of paper and I hold it up and you read it,
I just hit the back of your eyeballs and you're "it."
So that made it more fun in my mind.
And then the last realization I made about tag -- and I think that finally ended the process for me -- is that you don't tag somebody to make them "it,"
you tag somebody to remind them that they are "it."
And everybody in a particular group of people is "it" to each other and reminding each other of that fact is kind of the game.
And you can do that in ways other than just smacking somebody.
I don't know, sometimes I think like, what if this person ruled the world?
Would it be better or would it be worse?
Would it be better than if...
I was in charge of the world?
Or something...
I don't know, if like I were in charge of the world, then there would probably be at least a billion people who wouldn't agree with me on a bunch of stuff.
Um...
I don't know, I just...
I just feel like I think differently than everyone else.
Like...
Like sometimes I take more things into consideration and...
Um...
I'm not sure how to explain it.
But then sometimes when people ask me a question, uh...
I don't really get what they mean until 10 minutes later.
Then I'm like, "Oh, my God, how could I have been so stupid?"
Ooh, look at the water swirling around.
Wow.
On June 6, 2006 -- which is 06-06-06, kind of a cool number -- but I was reading an index for a book and I saw the acronym "PDD," and I didn't know what it was,
so I looked it up online, and it said,
"Pervasive Developmental Disorder,"
and I was getting ready to close the page, because that wasn't that interesting to me, and then I saw a link to "high-functioning autism,"
and it was like a little voice in my brain said,
"Click on that, you're going to find out something interesting."
So I clicked on it, I read about my whole life story.
I printed it out and I took out all the references to higher functioning or autism and I handed it to my husband and I said, "Read this, right now."
And then I went off into the bathroom or something and he was out in the kitchen and I heard him going,
"Oh, my goodness!
What is it?"
[Chuckles]
So I knew that --
And I said, "Is it kind of like me?"
And he said, "Yeah."
And then I said, "I want a percent.
Is it 27% like me?"
"100%."
-i want to ask you something.
BOY:
What?
When you keep looking at the water, does it make you feel really happy?
Or is that just me?
No, that's just you.
[Woman laughs]
It's just me.
Oh, well.
My first reaction to finding out that I was probably autistic was, I want to go tell everybody because now they'll know why
I'm the way I am, and I was really excited about it.
But a few hours later, after I had read so many websites about, you know, it's a devastating and dark disorder,
I thought, maybe I'm not going to tell everybody.
But anyway, I posted a question and I said,
"Do you tell people or do you need to hide it?
Would you just tell your family, your friends?
What do you do?"
And the first person who wrote back said, he did not hide what his neurology was and that he wasn't ashamed of it, and that he let his actions speak for themselves.
And I just took that and I thought -- because I don't usually go around hiding who I am.
I probably would tend more going up to people on the street going, "Hi, I'm Paula.
I'm autistic.
How are you today?"
Not really, 'cause I'm too shy to do that, but it would be more my nature to do something like that.
It finally made sense to a lot of the stuff that I couldn't understand.
So I'm going, okay, now we can... put a name on it or whatever.
Just help figure it out a little bit.
And that was about two years ago, and actually I think things have... kind of taken a turn for the worse in some respects at that point in our lives.
It's, okay, you know something about yourself now, you know.
But where's the accountability for it?
It's like I'm putting up with somebody who just can do and be anything they want, and I have to just deal with it.
It's like me being an alcoholic drinking.
If I was just out getting drunk every night, coming back, you just deal with it, you know, and I don't think that's fair for some reason.
It's becoming to a point in our lives where it's a big confrontation about how we even deal with each other.
MAN:
Everyone has differences.
And it's when they get to be these thresholds that we -- and are syndromes that we've identified and put a label on it.
And for the Asperger's, they're channeling everything through this rational processor versus the emotional one.
Maybe you all know, what do they call the other side of the spectrum?
'Cause it's a bell curve.
And if we're over here, who's over here?
And we all know the hysterical people.
They can't seem to just process this information rationally.
That would be me.
Yes, I know!
[Chuckles]
And your mother.
Good God!
It's like, "God, can't you just look at this rationally?"
And so you can imagine this relationship, your opposites attract?
Yes, here we are, the Asperger going after whatever this hysterical, emotional group is called.
And, I don't know, does DSM-IV have a name for that?
You know what, it's not "hysterical-emotional."
I said, I'm looking for a nicer name.
Whenever you talk women, you're talking touching.
And I don't want to be touched.
And intimate touching more than anything -- no.
No, no, no.
I...
That's...
No, no.
I mean, the most I ever want to do when it comes to touching is hug, that's it.
It's just enough touching for me to imprint the event, truly imprints on my brain.
And if it's a good, if it's a person I really love, the pain of the touching is over... you know, is overshadowed by the fact that I want to have that memory for as long as I can.
Because, you know, it's actually something beautiful to look back on.
That's the only thing that I want, and as for romance, oh, gosh!
Think about it.
Romance is filled with innuendo and hints.
"Oh, Wolf, I really think that those ice-cream cones look delicious!"
You know, and, I mean, now I know because I've got a more sophisticated scripting system.
If you want ice-cream from me, you have to say,
"Wolf, I'd like to have some ice cream."
And that's the other thing.
When I come home, I have to create this --
I call it a pseudotypical.
That is "fake typical."
See, it's not a neurotypical, because trying to be exactly like you, can't do it.
So I create a pseudotypical.
A person who I know, going in, is fake.
So it doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be my best effort.
So the thing is, I generate this pseudotypical all day.
I go to work and I pretend -- I come as close as I can to being Joe Normal.
And working with people and not biting their heads off when they do the stupid things.
So, now I come home.
Now, when I come home, I can drop the pseudotypical act.
And I can let the werewolf out.
That's why I wore this shirt.
I can let him out, and I can be as wild and as crazy and there's nobody in here to offend but me.
But if I had to come home to a wife, you have to still keep that pseudotypical thing up.
And at that point, the only time I would get rest is when I go to sleep, and I couldn't live like that.
Okay, YouTube, are we doing...
BOY:
Tornado animations.
Tornado animations?
BOY:
Yeah, we're going to do some animation demo videos.
BOY:
Bleh!
Now it's like a whole building burned down.
Looks like a big building.
Having a diagnosis was like a really good, positive thing.
And I've made a lot of friends who are kind of more like me and they're kind of like, we're working on our friendships in our own kind of way that aren't like a typical friendship,
which I never could figure out and I was not --
I mean, I've had friends across the years, but mostly I haven't.
And now I probably have more people that I'm kind of close to than I ever have had before.
But I don't know that it helped me in my relationship with you.
I think it actually has gotten worse.
You want me to say why that is?
'Cause Larry spends a whole lot of money and he went into a lot of debt and he talked me into refinancing the house and the debt is like, it won't even get paid off until I'm 67, and that's if I work full-time until I'm 67,
and so I'm like stressed out and either depressed or anxious or both like I've been for every day since April 2006.
It's $120,000.
That's not huge.
For me and the fact that it won't be paid off till I'm 67, it's huge.
And I don't take vacations, I don't eat.
LARRY:
Well, join the real world.
It's only the real world for people who screw up on their finances and get talked into believing that...
LARRY:
And you're not going to let go of that resentment the rest of your life.
It's both a resentment and it's also a reality.
It's a blessing in disguise for you because I think you found a really, really big part of your life that you just needed to find, you know, and that's cool that you found out.
I guess I'm not figuring how I fit in the whole thing.
You know, and that's what I told you, you know.
But, you know, if that doesn't work, then I don't want any more of this, you know.
Well, that's mostly why I just try and go off and have my own life.
LARRY:
Let's do that, then.
-But I'm just living here, so...
LARRY:
So am I.
We can't figure it out by ourselves, I can tell you that.
So at least we had a...
Do a pinkie thing about trying to make it work.
I don't know, I don't like to be touched.
LARRY:
All right, here it is.
Starting right here, we're going to try to get something resolved.
-Don't twerk my pinkie.
-All right.
Okay, that's good.
MAN:
I believe that, uh... oddness results in cultural content.
That when you can channel surf and you hit the Olympics and watch some guy do several flips and twists and turns off of the high-dive and hit the water, and you can go, "Ooh, that was amazing"
and then move on to another channel.
And you cannot really be conscious of the fact that that person's life for years has been nothing but diving.
And...
That's pretty odd, you know, to have your life be absolutely nothing but diving.
But that's how you get that good at diving.
And that, that kind of obsession, compulsion, oddness, intensity, that results in cultural content.
WOLF:
I look at neurotypical life, and I'm sorry, I don't really want to be one of you.
I mean, no disrespect, but I don't want to be neurotypical because I'm not --
I mean, I'm not particularly... impressed that it is a better way of life.
It's a different way of life, and I celebrate the difference and I embrace the difference, the same way I embrace people that are white or I embrace people that are Chinese or that I embrace people that are in any way different.
But I don't want to be neurotypical.
I'm happy being what I am.
And I think a person who's going to come out and try and "cure" me because I make them uncomfortable,
I think they need to deal with themselves.
'Cause I'm not uncomfortable.
[Dog whimpering]
GIRL:
Yaaay!
Yay!
What's that song you know?
I'll sing it 'cause you started clapping your hands.
Oh!
♫If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands♫
♫If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands♫
♫If you're happy and you know it♫
♫And you really wanna show it♫

[Girl singing softly]
WOMAN:♫If you're happy and you know it...♫
Ha ha!
GIRL:♫Happy and you know it, then show it...♫
WOMAN:
Yay!
Arms go like this.
Wait, now more.
Lower -
- No, that's too much.
We've got to get one of those cattle squishing things.
PAULA:
This is easier and it doesn't take up space.
[Laughs]
BOY:
Well, I'm just coming out here to say bye.
[Laughter]
LARRY:
Squish?
PAULA:
Yeah, squish.
You know how, like when you take a deep breath...
BOY:
Pick me up!
PAULA: ...'cause you're like really relaxed?
Yeah!
I'm feeling really relaxed right now.
It works faster than prescription drugs for me.
LARRY:
What were you watching?
BOY:
Um, how to build stuff.
PAULA, CHUCKLING:
Oh, I'm so calm.
Once upon a time, there were four unlikely heroes.
Red Riding Hood, her granny, the not so Big Bad Wolf, and an over-caffeinated squirrel called Twitchy.
Together, they defeated the evil plans of a very bad little bunny, and came to work for me.
My name is Nicky, and I run the Happily Ever After Agency, an organization dedicated to making happy endings for everyone.
As we say in the HEA, "It's not just a fairy tale, it's an adventure."
Recently, Red took a leave of absence to train at a secret location with the legendary Sisters of the Hood.
This left the team in a bit of disarray, just as we were about to meet a terrible threat, not only to the HEA, but to happy endings everywhere.
It started one night when we received an anonymous tip that two children were being held in a gingerbread house by a witch with a wicked appetite.
Alpha Leader, witch sighted in window.
Which window?
- Affirmative.
- What?
Rescue Team Alpha, stand by for go order.
Agent Fuzzy moving into position.
Nick Knack, take point.
Paddy Whack, cover the rear.
Suspect is enchanted and extremely dangerous.
- Roger.
- Who's Roger?
Alpha Leader here, confirmed Mother Goose.
Rescue Team standing by.
Looks like Red's a no-show.
Again.
Wolf, we talked about this.
Red's on assignment.
And I'm supposed to be at the DMV, but I showed up.
Look, dog, I know you miss her.
We all do.
But those poor kids are going to become baked goods any minute now.
I need you to concentrate on what's going on here.
Yo, Froggy, what's the story on Red Riding Rogue?
Wolf, she is training secretly.
- What kind of secret training?
- Not now.
OK, OK.
You wanna reassign Red, it's your agency.
- Thank you.
- So we all agree
- that I don't need any secret training.
- Wolf!
My talent comes naturally.
Wolf!
Get off the channel!
Those kids don't have much time.
Don't sweat it, Granny Dynamite.
With Red gone, I need to step up.
- So I called out the big guns.
- What?
This is not good!
We might have a problem here, sir!
Put it on the screen.
No!
They wouldn't!
Alpha Team, we've got something small and fast, scurrying up the side of the house.
Roger, Goose, I'll get a gander.
On the job.
Love my job.
Good job.
It's not just a job, it's an adventure.
Hey, Granny, how you doing?
Bye-bye!
- What are you two up to?
- You like recipes, don't you?
Try this.
A cup of hot wolf, a pinch of screwy squirrel and a dash of disguise.
Rescue pie.
My own recipe.
- Wolf, no!
- Thank me later!
That's not a rope.
Not rope, not rope.
Not rope, not rope.
Not rope!
Rope!
Twitchy, what do you think you're doing up there?
The wolf's plan.
I'll slip through the chimney.
She'll never see me coming.
- It's a great job...
- What is he saying?
Translate that.
I have an advantageous position from which to breach our suspect's gingerbread home.
Uh-oh.
I think the fan is about to be hit with the doody.
I'm going in!
Right now!
I am going in.
Negative.
Do not proceed.
Do not proceed.
Now, listen to me, Twitchy...
Mammals!
Oh, please!
We did not mean to trespass into your delicious cookie house!
Ja, we were only searching for goodies for this...
Silence!
Building inspector.
You know, it's against housing codes to live in any dessert bigger than a cupcake.
I need to see your permits and a list of ingredients.
That better not be custard.
Don't worry, kids!
I'm here to rescue you!
Yeah, me, I got the good guys!
- They're all hiding outside.
- Little squirrel, I am Hansel.
Ja, and I am Gretel.
You must hurry.
The witch will soon return.
- She'll eat us all for supper!
- She says chicken tastes like children!
Ja!
OK, OK, I'm on the case.
He's in trouble!
Move in!
Move in!
Come on, you goldbricks!
You wanna live forever?
- Get the door!
- Just get more puffs!
I think it's weakening.
Agents, take a bite out of crime.
Wolf, this entire operation is a shambles.
I know, but I can fix it.
- She got the kids!
- You're alive!
Now, we'll never catch up with her.
- Sweet ride!
- Boys?
Sorry, goodies, but this is a dinner flight.
Help us!
She has flavorful marinades!
Oh, no, you didn't!
Come on, Twitch.
- Buckle up, homies.
It's on!
- No, wait!
Don't just...
Get some backup in the air, now!
Whoa!
Ten and two, Granny!
I'm regretting that burrito.
Help us!
She has put us in little cages!
It is dehumanizing!
- We are like delicious veal!
- You'll never save them!
- Tree in the way!
- Oh, put on your man pants, Wolfie.
- Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray...
- Whoo-hoo!
Can we go back for my stomach?
It's pink, shaped like a football.
- Has my lunch in it.
- Oh, knuckle up, dog.
Mother Goose to base.
Mother Goose to base.
We are in pursuit of witch.
Stand by.
- Better catch me, I'm getting peckish.
- That witch is whack.
Wolf, you think you can handle a bike like this?
Sure, I think I could if I had to.
I went through my bad boy phase.
Road a bike, greased my hair back, lived over Richie Cunningham's garage, water-skied over a shark tank.
Those were some happy days.
Great, 'cause she's all yours, dog.
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
- Hi, Granny.
- Hey, young kids.
I've gotcha.
No!
I've got you!
No worries, Twitch.
Dog is your co-pilot.

Mammals.
There they are, there they are!
There they go, you passed them.
You passed them!
Why did you pass them?
Calm down.
You got the metabolic rate of a hummingbird.
I've got me a foolproof Granny rescue plan.
Twitchy, do you think you could handle a bike like this?
No, no, bad idea!
I can't reach the pedals!
Be seeing you, little buddy.
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
OK, I can taste my own butt.
Saw that coming.
Oh, look!
Your doggie's trying to save you!
Don't worry, Granny, I got ya!
- No, Wolf, don't!
It's a trap!
- I got ya, I got ya.
- Oh!
OK, I don't got ya.
- We need help.
Get Red!
- She'll know what to do!
- Hey, I'm handling this rescue!
- Everything's under control!
- You can't do it alone!
Hey!
I'm alive!
- You almost saved her.
- I got served.
This whole thing is my fault.
None of this would have happened if...
- If Red were here?
- Well, she's not here, is she?
Nicky Flippers' little superstar is far, far... far away.
Far, far, far... far away.
Far... far away.
- Yeah, yeah, I get it!
- Just saying it's quite a ways.
Uh...
Hi.
So you think you can deliver that basket of goodies across my bridge, do you?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, no, no!
You did not just say that.
I did not hear that!
There ain't no way my bridge is being crossed by some muffin-delivering, red-hood-wearing, fairy-tale-cliché, little girl.
Get up outta here!
Bring it.
I'm about to get you!
Oh!
Hey!
Oh!
- No, no, no!
- See?
I told you!
I win again.
It's 'cause I'm so evil.
Mm!
I even taste evil.
Ooh!
I taste just like chicken.
Chicken and evil!
I'm gonna do my little evil chicken dance.
Huh?
Hello!
Is the fight over?
Did you mean to jump off the bridge?
Huh?
Bye-bye.
Ooh!
That's cheating!
That is so cheating!
You running 'cause you know you can't beat me!
Your granny never would've run away like a scared little chicken girl!
- What did you just say?
- You heard me.
I said your granny would be ashamed of you, 'cause you running like a teeny, tiny, helpless, little girl!
Oh, muffins.
Oh!
Ow!
- Take that!
And that!
- Was it something I said?
Ooh!
That's my corn!
Aah!
I kinda like that.
Enough!
Check, please.
The test is over.
The delivery is incomplete.
I win again!
I am the greatest!
I'm the prettiest ballerina in the whole fruit cup!
Yes, Senator, that is my monkey.
His name is Rumpelstiltskin, but it's a secret.
Don't tell him I told you.
I'm coming to the light, Mama.
Show me the Seven-Layer Kick.
Show me the Spatula!
Show me the Flying Rolling Pin!
Red, I know you came with much to prove, but your task was to deliver the basket.
You heard what he said about my granny!
Moss used your desire to please Abigail as just a test.
A Sister finds her own path, her true inner power.
Besides, honey, we're starting to run low on combat instructors.
Oh, come on.
Really!
I barely touched him.
Why, fidlee dee, Mr. Butler.
What brings you to Tara?
- I like Tootsie Rolls.
- He'll be fine.
Hm...
Sorry, I should take this.
- Hello?
- Red?
It's Nicky.
Nicky?
What is it?
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
It's about your grandmother.
Why would anyone want to kidnap my granny?
Red, at the end of every Sister's training, she faces the ancient trial by truffle, in which the student attempts to recreate the Sisterhood's most powerful culinary confection.
For over a thousand years that recipe has been our secret, its making understood only by the best of us.
What has that got to do with Granny?
Very few Sisters complete the truffle, one of them was your grandmother, Abigail Puckett.
The power of this goodie is so great, it must be ever kept from those who would misuse it.
Like those wannabes at the Food Network.
Holla!
Rachael Ray's the devil.
This is where you keep all the recipes?
No, just the one.
The Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!
But around the kitchen, honey, we just call it the Super Truffle!
Cool!
What makes it so super?
Anyone who eats it becomes unstoppable, in strength and thought and speed.
- Sounds good.
- Too good!
So... how did you make the recipe invisible?
Oh, muffins.
Battle stations!
Man your posts!
Sound the alarm!
Secure the gates!
Somebody get me my rolling pin!
We must hurry.
Whoever stole the recipe will be trying to complete the truffle.
We must find and stop them before they do.
Before they find the secret ingredient.
- Secret ingredient?
What is it?
- Well, it's...
Oh, no, you don't.
The final ingredient is never written down.
- Or even spoken.
- Then how does anyone know it?
When you're a true Sister of the Hood, you just know.
That must be why they kidnapped Abigail.
I've gotta find her.
Red, the task of saving your granny is yours alone.
But, child, I fear it may be more danger than you are ready for.
It doesn't matter.
She's my granny, I've gotta save her.
You have learned much.
The Sisterhood is in your blood.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
Right?
Red is still finding her true path.
- She is not ready.
- Yeah, I know.
For a complete nut muffin, that witch sure ties a good knot.
Did somebody say "nut muffin"?
Sounds delicious.
My dinner was interrupted, and I could use a little snack.
- Comfypoo, Abigail?
- Have we met before?
Was it the '60s?
The '60s are kind of a blur.
What?
!
Why, no!
You'd remember meeting someone as evil as me!
Why, look at these glowing red eyes and big scary mask!
Your goodie friends won't find you here, Abigail.
So you might as well relax and stay for dinner.
- You want me to make you dinner?
- Oh, how nice of you to offer.
Let me see.
What am I in the mood for?
Day-old sushi?
Dutch balls?
Turducken?
I'm more in the mood for a chocolate truffle!
A truffle?
Sorry, never learned to make that.
Never?
Never studied with the Sisterhood of Kung Fu Bakers?
Never learned the secret ingredient to an ancient recipe so powerful it makes one invincible?
Darn!
I really had a taste for that.
How do you know about that?
That recipe is forbidden.
Forbidden, is it?
Oh.
Well, that's too bad.
Well, then it's a good thing I have it written down.
See?
Do you want it?
Do you?
Take it.
Oh.
Oh, you can't.
You're tied to a chair.
Oh, too bad!
Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's right, Abigail.
I have everything but the secret ingredient,
- and you're going to give it to me.
- What?
You think I'm just gonna bake one up for you?
Not gonna happen.
You won't?
All right.
I guess I'll just have to cook up something else.
Ooh.
Sorry.
I love that show.
- She's getting us ready for the baking!
- I'm too young to be a strudel!
So, Abigail, what's for dinner?
I'll need a titanium mixing bowl.
...search for Granny Puckett, highest priority.
What is the status of Mother Hubbard's cupboard?
Someone update Granny's Facebook profile to "witchnapped."
Butcher and baker cleared.
We're questioning the candlestick maker.
I'm not saying they shouldn't work here, I'm just saying they're delicious.
Ooh!
Wolf, thanks for taking such good care of my granny.
Yeah, my finest hour.
I'm shopping the movie rights.
But maybe if you'd been around to look after the old girl yourself,
- I wouldn't have had to.
- If I...
I was training.
- While you've been playing kung fu...
- You know that thing you do...
Awkward.
Red, it's good to see you.
There's been a rash of robberies.
The stolen items are from that list of Super Truffle ingredients you sent us.
- So the witch has been shopping?
- We think so.
A surveillance camera caught the latest incident.
Blue, pull up the Muffet footage.
Whoa!
Did you see the size of that mushroom?
We're gonna need to hit the streets, find out who's hiring the muscle.
Indeed.
We think many of the suspects are associates of a shady operator known as The Giant.
He's a reputed smuggler, a juggler, a robber, a cobbler, a picker, a grinner, a restaurateur, and blogs about animated films.
- He should get a life.
- Indeed.
He runs the Beanstalk Club in Big City.
I want the two of you to check it out.
- What?
Are you kidding?
- Me and her?
Whoa!
Hop back here a second, Flippers.
You mean the both of us?
Granny never needed a partner, and I don't either.
I guess she's right about that, maybe.
Red, you're not going anywhere without backup.
And you, you need to shuffle your wild-card antics to the bottom of the deck.
No more stunts, no more cheap disguises.
You two are partners.
Get used to it.
All right, road trip!
Hey, I'm driving here!
Big City is home to great shopping, dining, and two professional sports teams:
The Golden Geese of the National Enchantment League and what was formerly the Denver Nuggets.
- What are you doing?
- Reading about the big burg,
- in case we get a chance to sightsee.
- We're not here to sightsee.
- We're here to find Granny.
- Fine.
But you're missing out on a chance to visit the Old Mother Hubbard Museum.
Largest collection of empty cupboards in the world, which is weird.
OK, let's get something straight.
We're doing this operation by the book, exactly the way Granny would, plain and simple.
- I just had a book.
- Wrong book.
- Hey, it was a good book.
- All right, look...
Looky, looky, over here!
Hey, it's Kirk.
He's really hit the big time.
We should catch the show.
No.
We are going to stay focused and follow procedure.
- They won't expect that.
- Look, you two, we are definitely not here to hang around in loud, sleazy nightclubs, listening to cheesy lounge singers.

- So, what's the plan, Hoodie?
- We talk to Jimmy 10-Strings.
He's one of Granny's regular informants.
If The Giant's behind the stolen ingredients, that harp will sing in more ways than one.
- We need to...
- Ply him with my lupine charisma?
- Gotcha.
I'm on it.
- Hold on!
I'll do the talking.
Granny told me how to handle guys like this.
The trick is not...
Huh?
- Wolf?
- Go, Wolfie!
Go, Wolfie!
Aah, stop that!
Will you two focus?
OK, OK!
Just trying to blend in with the crowd.
- Just stay here.
- This will end well.
I'll be at the bar.
Merci beaucoup, and my personal favorite, danke schön.
- Hey, Jimmy 10-Strings.
- Sweetheart, I do autographs
- after the show, OK?
- I work with Granny,
- and I need you to do me a favor.
- For Granny?
Anything!
I hear your boss has his goons stealing truffle ingredients.
What do you know?
What?
!
Well, I never.
I mean, who told you...
OK, listen up.
A couple of days ago, I overheard The Giant talking about a big order for someone called...
Uh-oh.
- I didn't tell her a thing.
- Get your hooves off me.
Tell the boss I told her nothing.
I should sing something nice at her funeral.
- Tell 10-Strings
- Up there.
To limit his singing to exclusively musical vocalizations, or I shall be forced to tune his strings
- until they snap.
Capisce?
- Got it, boss.
You, with the red hanky on her head.
Are you trying to play my harp?
You could end up singing with the angels, playing my harp.
- Tell me about the witch.
- What witch?
Which witch?
- Huh.
Good one, boss.
- Did you just laugh at me?
Do I amuse you?
- Am I some sort of clown to you?
- No, I...
I hate my job.
- Who are you?
- I'm your worst nightmare.
A Sister with a badge.
And I'm onto you.
Excuse me.
Did I just hear your tiny, little voice correctly?
Did you just come into my house, hassle my harp, interrupt my dinner and tell me my hands are dirty?
!
I eat sandwiches bigger than you, little girl!
Did someone say sandwiches?
'Cause I'll take one.
And I'll bet you'll take five.
Hundred, that is!
'Cause you're a big boy.
I said big boy, son.
Who the Mother Goose is this supposed to be?
Phineas Newcastle McGee, wealthy business tycoon.
Didn't we meet at the big convention?
MobCon, the mobsters' convention.
Wasn't that you?
You know, I just got back from ConCon, the big conman convention.
Funniest thing.
I show up, nobody there!
Empty building!
Guess I should've seen that coming.
We are gonna die.
I love this guy!
This guy is hilarious!
You two, have some dinner with me.
Come here.
Hey, 10-Strings, you know what I wanna hear.
You bet, big guy.

- Hey, do you get paid?
- Not really.
No.
- Start singing, 10-Strings.
- Is this your first time doing this?
'Cause Granny just slips me 20 bucks.
I'll show those pipsqueaks who's the big man around here!
Putting fingers on my property!
Like that Jack guy.
I'm still picking pieces of him out of my teeth!
I'll grind up their bones to make my pasta fazool!
Tell us who The Giant's getting ingredients for.
Yeah, well, you know The Giant is not usually very happy about those who spill his personal beans.
Maybe I could tell you something about Goldilocks.
That is not her natural hair color.
- Really?
- I knew it!
- Just tell us who ordered the thefts.
- OK, OK already.
I'll tell ya.
Every day The Giant gets a call for a new ingredient from from the Bunny.
- The Bunny?
- Not the Bunny!
Not the Bunny!
- Yes, the Bunny.
He calls in the orders, and that's all I know.
If you wanna hear me sing anymore, you'll have to catch my show.
Fe-fi-fo-fum!
I gotcha now!
- Jump!
- Are you crazy?
We're a mile up.
- Don't argue!
Just jump!
- OK.
This is not how you treat an entertainer of my caliber.
Hey, Twitchy, you didn't bring a parachute by any chance, did ya?
Uh...
No.
Gum?
No, thanks.
I'm trying to cut down.
Gotcha!
Oh, muffins.
Never trust short people!
♪ I'm visitin' the city, yes I am
♪ Just strolling 'round Big City with no plans
♪ 'Cause things was crazy in the country but here I'm nice and comfy
Boys, I seem to have landed on a singing goat.
♪ And now I'm in a dark tunnel
♪ And I think I smell burritos ♪
I can't believe this all leads to Boingo.
Never trust a bunny.
Never trust a bunny!
- I think that went off pretty smooth.
- What was that disguise supposed to be?
- Fake beards are classic.
- You look like a deranged Santa Claus.
Santa gave me that beard.
Hello, Clarice.
- Who's Clarice?
- She is.
Hi, Clarice!
- Enjoy the book, Boingo.
- We share a love of literature.
So, Red, I see that stray dog is still following you around.
Don't let him mess with your head.
Let me guess.
You're the brains, and you're... not the brains?
Who's up for hasenpfeffer.
We know you've been working with The Giant.
Oh, really?
How?
I don't get out much.
- Talked to any witches lately?
- Which witch?
Oh, you mean the witch that took your granny.
When she said she wanted to take out old beehive,
I said, "Now, there's something we've got in common."
She did mention something about outwitting some incompetent, stupid, meddling, jerkfaced HEA agents!
I assumed she was talking about you two.
- I wasn't there.
- No, of course you weren't.
Relax, Fido.
You've got Little Red Riding Hood to protect you now.
- I do OK on my own.
- Is that before or after
- I bail you out?
- You weren't doing a lot of bailing
- when I saved your cape at the bar!
- I had everything under control.
- Another minute and I would've...
- Have been páté!
- I don't need your help.
- Oh, really?
- Watch me.
- Ow!
No!
Not the ears!
You didn't even say the magic word.
- Abracadabra.
- Ow!
That's not even...
Well, actually, that is the magic word.
I don't know where Granny is.
The witch sends me notes, and I put the word out.
- Tell me where they are.
- Ow.
Ow.
You're still mad about me trying to kill you all those times, aren't you?
- Hey, books!
- Hey, no, wait!
Don't read that!
Nobody reads books anymore.
Movies are always better.
Especially sequels.
How does the witch get messages into your books?
Why don't you ask her?
She was just here.
The cleaning lady!
Come on, hurry!
She can't have gotten far!
Oh, she was right under our noses!
Aah!
I'm blind!
No, wait.
A little help.
See?
I said it before.
Disguises work.
Would you stop it already!
If you hadn't distracted me in there, I would have...
- Oh, so this is my fault, too?
- Yeah, it is.
That's great, coming from someone who just took off to play Crouching Baker.
I stayed to do the job.
It's not like this is easy.
I'm doing my best here.
Yeah, well, your best got my granny and two innocent kids kidnapped!
OK, fine!
You're right!
It did.
This is all my fault.
My screw-ups are putting everyone in danger.
I'll probably get you nabbed next.
Happy?
A little help!
Rolling now!
That's not what I meant.
You've made your point, Red.
This partnership's a disaster.
I better leave before I do any more damage.
I've always been a lone wolf.
Tell Nicky I quit.
Sorry, Red.
He's my ride.
Do I sound weird?
I sound weird to me!
I sound weird to me!
How is the truffle coming, Abigail?
I can't work with such inferior equipment.
This mixing machine is ten years old, and the measuring cups are cracked.
I need exact measurements!
I can't work miracles with this stuff!
You should try, Abigail, or those little bratwursts will be on the menu tonight!
Your Tibetan cocoa sticks.
These did not come easy.
The Happily Ever After Agency is everywhere!
Only three?
I need four.
- Four?
!
- I can't make it without four sticks.
I have lost two Sherpas in those mountains already.
Do you know how much a Sherpa costs?
They've got a union.
I've gotta pay for goats.
I've gotta pay for the little hats.
There's per diem.
You want this done right, or don't you?
You bring me a decent flour sifter and some real measuring cups, then I might be able to remember the final ingredient.
Fine!
But you better get cooking, Abigail.
Four cocoa sticks.
Just take two cocoa sticks and break 'em in half!
Oh, don't you worry.
I'll get cooking all right.
Boo-yah!
Still got it.
Get the remote.
Time for Rachael Ray.
Leave me alone.
I'm trying to fill the awful emptiness that lives deep inside me with food.
Children, I found you.
Granny Puckett!
- How did you get out?
- I've got my ways, little one.
Come on, we gotta get you two out of here.
The exit is there.
We saw the witch go through that way.
Show me.
But we gotta be quiet.
The exit is straight ahead.
Don't be suspicious.
Continue moving.
- What?
What is this?
- It's a big cage, dum-dum.
- Huh?
What's she doing here?
- You tell us.
I thought you said she was locked up tight.
- She was!
She just needed more...
- More tools to do the escaping with?
You mean all this time, you two were never?
In danger?
No!
We're not even kidnapped!
- We're the kidnappers!
- Ja!
You've been hoodwinked!
- Too!
Ja, Hansel!
- Ja, Gretel!
We're evil!
We're...
something else that rhymes with evil!
You two are the nastiest children I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.
Don't blame us.
It is society's fault.
We had the displeasure of being the children of a poor woodcutter.
We never had any sweets for the snacking.
But now we will have the greatest dessert of all time, to make us unstoppable!
Well, this chefjust turned in her apron.
You'll never get the secret ingredient.
Don't worry.
We have ways of making you bake.
Verushka, keep your scary mask on!
You want to look spooky or not?
- And turn your eyes back on.
- Oh.
Oh, right.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Very scary.
Now, can you keep her locked up this time?
- Yes!
- And remember, we are in charge, Verushka.
Verushka?
Verushka Von Vine?
You finally remember me.
How nice!
Perhaps you also remember this.
Is that what this is about?
It all started when we were Sisters together in the Sisterhood.
You were always so good at everything.
I tried so hard to beat you, but you were always better than me.
Then came that terrible day of the ancient recipe ritual, when the...
Why are you telling me this?
I was there.
Abigail!
This is my big, super-evil-villain moment!
- So will you just shut up?
!
- OK, OK.
Now, where was I?
Started at the Sisterhood, always number two...
Did I get to the part about the truffle?
- Yes.
- I couldn't make that stinking truffle!
But you did!
And I knew then that you were the reason I was a big pile of number two!
So I stole the great recipe, and I spent the last 60 years searching for the secret ingredient!
You really practiced this speech?
But then Hansel and Gretel found me.
Together we devised a plan to kidnap you and complete the truffle recipe.
My attempts to find the secret ingredient were all failures!
Sure, I did produce a few other things.
A poison apple, a sleeping spell, a way to turn men into frogs.
She's completely insane.
You should see what she's done to the cat.
Oh, that's disturbing on so many levels.
You don't have to be like this, Verushka.
I'll never play second fiddle to you again, Abigail.
I've been number two long enough.
Once I finally have the Super Truffle,
I will taste the sweet, chocolaty victory of being number one!
OK, all I need to do is find this D.C.T. Place.
How hard could that be?
Muffins!
I give up.
I'll never find it.
Hey!
Hoodie in the hood!
Got a dollar?
What?
Who?
Hey, down here.
It's better to give than to receive.
So give me a dollar and you'll feel better.
- No.
I'm just looking for...
- Looking?
A quest?
I love...
Ooh.
You work out?
You are looking for the big golden...
No, wait.
The magic.
You're looking for the magic...
OK, I got nothing.
What's on your mind?
My granny!
She's out there somewhere, and I'm totally out of clues.
Perhaps she's been turned into stone.
What?
Turned to...
How do you even come up with that?
Who says that?
- You get what you pay for.
- All I've got is this stupid tag.
- "D.C.T." You tried Dental Clown Tech?
- Yes!
I've tried everywhere.
Yeah, yeah, it's tough.
Wait a second.
Wait a second!
- Dark Castle Towers!
- Dark Castle?
My brothers and I used to live there.
Then there was this whole thing with the farmer's wife and a clock.
- Can you show me?
- Sure.
Follow me.
I thought I told you to stay off my corner.
The journey there is long and full of dangers.
Oh, no, there it is.
My bad.
- Nicky, it's Red.
- Red!
- Good to hear from you.
- I need...
That is...
- Is Wolf there?
- No, we haven't heard from him.
Why?
- What's the trouble?
- Dark Castle Towers, that's what.
It's an old hotel on South Castle Street.
I'm sure Granny and the kids are in there.
- But it's really heavily guarded.
- And you need help to get them out?
No, no!
I've totally got it.
No problemo.
- I just thought...
- I'll alert the squad leaders.
We'll have a full rescue team there immediately.
- Give me as many details as you can.
- OK.
Oh, no!
What are we gonna do?
The whole HEA is going to be at our front door, and our back door, and our windows!
We're practically crawling with windows!
I think some of the windows even have little doors...
Stop!
Chill out.
Ja, ja.
Chill a pill and then take one.
We have always known that the Happily Ever After Agency would be a threat.
- Our forces are already in place.
- Lesson four:
Eliminate your obstacles.
Eliminate?
But what do you mean?
Send in the pigs!
Good work, Red.
That's the break we were looking for.
- What?
- Nicky?
Is everything all right?
Uh, I'm not sure.
Stand by.
- Ops, status report.
- Sir, we are being attacked!
Nicky, what is it?
What's going on?
Red, we've got trouble.
Get all the sheep first!
- Take the frog!
- Red, save Granny!
Stop them from getting the Super Truffle!
You're on your own!
Nicky, are you OK?
Hello?
!
Nick!
Filthy swine!
We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Up next, carnivores who abandon their partners when they really need them.
Cowards or complete dirtbags?
Now, that's where I disagree with you, Tony.
Wolves are just plain untrustworthy.
Isn't that right, Mr. Pig?
Coming up next, Shark Week.
Because as bad as sharks are, they're still not wolves.
- He's dead, Jim.
- But how the?
Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a doc...
All right.
Well, I'd say he was abandoned by an unreliable partner, just when he needed one most.
Hey, Twitch.
I know this whole mess with Red is probably bugging you.
You wanna talk about it?
Um...
Hello?
Wolf!
Hey!
Good to see you!
Wait a minute.
OK, guys.
See you later.
Thanks for stopping by.
Come on in!
Nice place you got here.
Smaller.
That's good, saves you money so you can get a good stereo.
I'd buy one, you know, but my trailer's bigger.
You know, Twitchy, I...
Oh, boy.
I've been thinking.
Could you turn the music down for a second?
I been thinking about Granny and Red.
And I was wondering, did I do the right thing?
Wolf, I have been waiting for you to say that!
You gotta get back in the game!
The HEA needs you!
You got mad skills!
Red needs you!
Nah, she doesn't need me.
Doesn't need you?
Doesn't need you?
!
Red is out there looking for her granny all alone, and she needs your help, even if she won't admit it.
You are dropping some hard science on me.
Word.
Hey, Wolf!
It's the Three Little Pigs, man.
- Remember us?
- Yeah!
We're here to huff and puff and blow your house up!
Sooie!
- He went up in smoke.
- Look at the colors.
Too bad for the big barbecued wolf his life didn't have more meaning.
What do you mean by that, pork pie?
It did have meaning.
- Who...
...said that?
- Wait, is it a bad sign
- I used the past tense?
- Help me!
- We blew up the wrong house again.
- His every breath mocks us.
That's not good.
A little faster, Twitchy.
Huh?
- Hey, is it busted?
- No, no, no!
It can't be broken!
- We just used it.
- This is why everybody hires
- the Three Bears.
- No, wait, wait!
This is it.
- See?
- Hey, wait!
Where'd they go?
Look, they're trying to get away.
Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!
Oh, muffins.
Double muffins.
- How did you make them so mad?
- It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.
- One wolf en fuego, coming up.
- Look out!
This little wolfie went to pieces!
- You missed again.
- Will you stop swerving?
It's ruining my aim!
Can't help it.
I can't see the road, man.
That loco lobo is liquidated.
They're gaining on us.
Whoa!
Say hello to my little friend.
Hasta la vista, Wolfie.
♪ Oh, I was traumatized in the city Yes, I was
♪ So I ran far from the city Just because
♪ So I'll be safe and unaffected While I work on convalescing
♪ 'Cause nothing unexpectedly, emotionally crippling
♪ Or intensely physically painful can happen to me here
♪ I say nothing... ♪
- Whoa!
- Sooie!
Oh, no!
No good!
Aah!
Hey.
Do you guys hear something?
Great news!
My doctor says I'm gonna live!
- Uh...
Freeze.
- Power to los puercos.
Oh, yeah.
Muffins.
Oh, no!
Red?
Nicky?
Is anyone here?
Boys, thank goodness you're all right.
- Mr. Flippers!
You OK?
- I've been better.
- But I'm still hopping.
- Wow, Nick, what happened?
They hit this place with everything they had.
We never had a chance.
- What happened to you boys?
- It's was pigs, Mr. Flippers!
It was pigs with knives and guns and rockets...
Running and running!
The special effects were spectacular!
I've never really gotten along with pigs, but we survived, by our wits.
Sooie!
Don't mess with the killer P's!
That handsome wolf sure had it coming.
Let's say we go strap on the feedbag, boys.
- I'm gonna tweet this.
- What's a tweet, man?
Disguises.
They not only work, they save lives.
But this...
One witch couldn't have done all this.
No, she's not working alone.
Every agent we have has been roughed up, kidnapped, scared off or mailed to an uncharted island.
I'm afraid the agency is all but defeated.
What about Red?
Is she OK?
No one's heard from her.
I hate to assume the worst, but...
I never thought I'd say this, Wolf.
I think a wild card is the only thing that can save us now.
You guys didn't really catch me.
I just slipped.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, it still counts, man.
- You bet it does!
Come on, guys, let's take her up to the überjefes and we'll get rewards and promotions and health care and maybe even cookies.
Beards for sale.
Fake beards.
Hey, Porky, how about a demo?
Hey, hey, hey!
We don't like trespassers around here, fuzzy.
But this is a very nice fake beard.
Hey, guys!
You oughta see this!
Surprise, pork belly!
Run for your life, it's a chupacabra!
Ow!
Hey!
Ooh.
Big, tough HEA agent.
OK, McGruff.
I got your happy ending right here!
You swine.
Squeal like a pig!
Squeal like a pig!
Jump back!
It's hammer time!
Who's big and bad now, Wolfie?
Actually, I'm more of a lover than a fighter.
Ow!
Hey, this squirrel thinks I'm nuts, man!
- Thanks.
- You, too.
Ha-ha!
Squirrel power!
I think we've overstayed our welcome.
Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, man.
You don't even really sell beards, do you?
What do you mean you had her, then she got away?
Disguises?
Big fake beards?
Oh, well.
That's very understandable.
I...
I'm not angry.
I...
I promise I am not angry.
What?
Yes, you may have a cookie.
Little Miss Reddy Two-Shoes got away.
That wolf is helping her again.
How's the truffle coming?
- Make the truffle.
- No.
- Make the truffle!
- Uh-uh.
- You better!
- You didn't say "please."
- Please make the truffle.
- Nope.
- You were always like that, Abigail.
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were!
- Was not.
- Were, too.
- Not well.
Well, we better do something quick.
Red and the Wolf will be here any moment.
Ja, maybe that is exactly what we need.
I don't know why we are laughing.
- You came back.
- Well, I just figured, you obviously don't know how to talk your way into anyplace.
Obviously.
- So Granny's up there somewhere?
- Yeah.
- It's locked down pretty tight.
- So how do we play this?
We're gonna need some muscle to get in there.
I think I know where to get it.
Thank you, thank you.
I love you all.
That is nice.
Now I got to go in now.
Bye.
Hey, Kirk.
Oh, my friends, it's so good to see you!
- It has been too long.
- No, it's been about right.
Did you catch the show tonight?
I was on fire!
The Yodelers have been so good to me.
- Dutch balls?
- We need your help.
We need your courage, we need your muscle...
We need my Yodelers.
Huh?
Before they delighted the world with song, the Happy Yodelers were highly trained mercenaries.
Johann, maps and tactical plans.
Helmut, demolitions expert.
Heidi, security systems and technology.
Klaus handles the receipts.
- We got us a rodent problem.
- He's not wearing any pants.
- Anyone here need an exterminator?
- We're professional exterminators.
Yep, they're probably in the walls by now.
That's a Pantless Norwegian Stink Rat.
Norwegian?
We've seen all kinds of pests in this business.
- You know the worst kind?
- No.
- Kidnappers!
- I can't see, I'm blind!
This is just like the '70s.
Take that, schweinehund!
This little piggy is out, and this little piggy is out.
Is anyone else hungry?
Ooh!
Ow!
Broke a nail.
Twitchy!
Great job, little buddy.
Ow!
- Dude!
- Stink Rat?
I can't censor myself when I'm in the moment.
- Heidi's hogging all the pigs.
- Wolf!
Twitchy!
- Here we are.
- Let's go!
- Right behind you.
- Ja, you go and save Granny.
We will take care of all those dastardly fellows.
- Good luck!
- Thanks.
You, too.
Thank goodness and gracious you have come to save us!
- Like angels from heaven!
- Where's the old lady?
In the room at the end of the hallway.
The witch is always shouting at her!
It is so scary here!
If I stay another minute, I may scream!
Scream, I tell you!
Wait.
You two get the kids out of here, I'll find Granny.
- You sure?
- I'd rather know they're safe.
I'll be fine.
We'll rendezvous downstairs.
- Come on, kids.
Let's roll.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Wolf!
I count my lucky stars for you!
I hope you kids learned a valuable lesson.
Never run away from home, never eat a cookie house.
- Never talk to strangers.
- That's right.
Never talk to strangers.
People are never what they seem to be.
Oh, sure, safety first.
Always carry little gas masks, because you never know.
What's that smell?
Perhaps the children are nervous and need to release a little tension.
That's natural.
- Man, that is strong.
- Wow.
That actually smells like gingerbread.
You kids feel dizzy?
My tongue is getting all puffy and I see rainbows.
Is that normal?
Granny?
The final ingredient is never written down.
When you're a true Sister of the Hood, you just know.
Luke, trust the Force.
What?
Oh, sorry about that.
Wrong hero quest.
Oh.
Macadamia nuts.
Now we know!
- Ja, Hansel.
- Ja, Gretel.
We're evil, we're evil.
Verushka!
Be a dear and fetch us a bag of... macadamia nuts.
No!
Granny, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
The Super Truffle will now be complete!
Behold the Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!
Granny, I'm sorry.
I really messed up.
Don't be silly, dear.
I'm proud of you.
You knew what that recipe needed.
Only a true Sister would know that.
No, I mean...
I shouldn't have tried to do everything myself.
Now the HEA is gone, and they've got the truffle, and I didn't even rescue you.
I was just so worried about proving I could live up to your example.
I'm sorry.
I let you down.
Why, because things are a little tough right now?
Gooseberries, child.
I've been in much worse situations than this.
You can still turn this around.
A person can never really fail unless they give up.
You fell for our trickery like a fish falls for water.
What have you done with Wolf and Twitchy?
Hey, Twitchy, look over there.
- Help me get over there.
- Yeah!
OK!
Must... gently... hit... buttons!
- Almost got it.
Come on, little buddy.
- No, no, no!
Muffins.
We can't let them leave with those.
I'm sorry, but we have orders to fill for every villain in the world.
Ja, the brochure went out weeks ago.
The truffle's power is, sadly, temporary.
So they will just want more and more.
- And we will become the filthy rich!
- The filthy rich!
- Not if we stop you first.
- Well, of course not.
That is obvious.
If you were to stop us...
Wait a minute.
You wish!
- One for the road, Brother?
- What a delicious idea.
No!
You can't handle the power!
Uh-oh.
I feel the power!
All powerful!
I have the strength of a thousand small boys!
You'll have to be excusing.
We have a world to dominate.
- Ja, no time for the dilly-dally.
- This isn't over.
Giant superpowered German kids.
Did not see that coming.
- The truffle!
It's finally mine!
- Ja, I don't think so.
Hey!
I'm your partner.
We planned this whole thing together.
Oh, did we?
The way I remember it, Brother, it was you, me and a napkin.
Legal documentation?
Yes.
I don't remember signing anything.
Do you, Brother?
- No, no, no.
I don't.
- It's not legal.
- We did not sign anything.
- Oh, look at the face.
You have outlived your usefulness, old woman.
But do not worry.
We will leave a pet for you to do the playing with.
- What pet?
- You can't do this to me!
Talk to the spider, 'cause the kid ain't listening.
No!
Wait!
Come back!
Spider?
Did he say spider?
Now would be a good time to untie us, Verushka.
I got my own problems, Abigail.
Help!
Let me out of here!
Help!
Red, get behind me.
♪ Schnitzel!
♪
Huh?
Is that... yodeling?
It sure is.
- It's yodel time!
- Kirk!
Nice entrance.
Go, Yodelers!
I will get Red and Granny.
You want a piece of me?
!
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Hold still!
I'll have you free in a moment!
- Wow!
You've gotten better.
- Why, thank you.
- Come on.
We've got work to do.
- Right behind you.
Heidi rides a spider like a Valkyrie!
What were you thinking?
!
Eight legs is so last year!
- Hurry!
Everyone, grab a leg!
- Good idea, honey!
Go, go, Yodelers!
Whoo!
- Hold her!
- Someone get a really big shoe!
It's working!
That's it.
I'm getting out of here.
She's getting tired!
Hurry, comrades!
We have a 10:00 late show!
Just a little more.
Gotcha!
- Thanks, Kirk.
- Any time, Red.
Nice work there, youngsters.
Love the outfits.
Yodelers, to the Yodelmobile!
Them's some jiggy yodelers.
I've gotcha!
I didn't deserve to be saved.
Especially not by you.
I want you to know you were never number two to me.
Those kids could level the whole city.
With the power of the Super Truffle, no one will be able to stop them.
This is all my fault.
If I'd been more like you, they wouldn't have gotten away.
You don't need to be like anyone, Red.
You're the real deal.
A true Sister of the Hood.
- You really think so?
- I know it.
You already have all the power you need.
Go get 'em, honey.
Go, Red.
Go!
Come on, come on!
Verushka?
You can always come back.
No.
It's too late for me.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
What did we miss?
I've gotta get me one of these.
Yes, it suits you.
Let's swing by the hat store and pick out something pointy.
Ooh!
Look at the tiny, little people living their tiny lives.
They have done nothing to deserve our hatred.
Makes our violence that much more senseless.
I know!
I love that about us!
- Holy cheese!
- Oh, look, Sister.
- I almost hit a school bus.
- Double points.
Uh-oh.
Ooh!
I regret nothing!
You cannot do the beating of us.
We are truffle-powered!
Yeah, well, I've got a few surprises of my own.
Aah!
Is this the end of Hansel?
You are really starting to tick me off.
I'm not done yet.
I am indestructible!
Oh, schnitzel.
OK.
Not my best landing.
Yoo-hoo!
Annoying little red person, look in the sky.
You've got to be kidding me.
- That was really fun.
- Ja, real fun!
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
What is tiny, red and smashed all over?
What is tiny, red and smashed all over who?
- I'll tell you in five seconds.
- You won't get away with this.
Oh, really?
And just who's going to stop us?
Anyone see an aircraft carrier around here?
- Wolf, distract them and I'll get Red.
- Hey there, tubby.
Those shorts make your ankles look fat.
- They do not.
I've very shapely ankles.
- Ja!
- Grab her!
- All aboard!
- Thanks!
- Hey, never leave your wingman.
Come back here!
Sorry!
My bad!
- We're clear.
You can stop swerving.
- I'm trying.
This thing isn't easy to steer, you know.
I'm sticking to motorcycles.
That was sweet!
Let's do it again!
Maybe later.
Come on!
- Uh-oh.
- Olly, oily, oxen free!
- One for the truffle.
- Two because we are so very evil.
Three because I also agree we are evil.
- Four to go!
- To go!
Oh, man.
I thought we were goners for sure.
Wolf, calm down.
We're gonna be OK.
We just need to walk towards each other.
But we've gotta time it very carefully.
- Wolf, throw me your beard!
- This is no time for a disguise!
Just do it.
Now.
Wolf, have I ever told you how much I love your disguises?
Ha.
Sorry, my bad.
Listen, I wanna take a moment to apologize for not being there when you needed me.
No, no, no!
It's OK, Wolf!
It's OK!
No, no, no.
Let me do this.
Granny, thanks to my sloppy work, you got kidnapped.
I'm sorry.
OK.
I forgive you.
Twitchy, I've been using your toothpaste.
I haven't bought a tube of toothpaste in probably four years.
Toothpaste?
!
After all we've been through?
!
You have to tell her how you feel right now!
She needs to hear it!
Not now, Twitchy!
Hang on.
Red, I walked away because I thought you didn't want me around.
I'm sorry.
Wolf, I never could have done any of this without you.
I should have listened to you more, Red,
- instead of doing things my way.
- I kind of like your way.
Sometimes, the right disguise can get you out of a tough jam.
So can the right partner.
Now, that's a good recipe.
- Gum?
- Why not?
- I thought you said we'd be OK!
- I exaggerated!
My life just flashed before my eyes.
It's weird, flashback really does add ten pounds.
What stopped us?
Verushka.
Turns out Bitsy here wasn't so bad after all.
Just needed a friend.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
Those kids are destroying the city.
We have to stop them before they eat any more of those truffles.
Wait a minute.
More truffles.
That's a great idea.
♪ Oh, I'm moving off to China Hip, hooray
♪ Yes, I'm heading down to Asia where I'll stay

I have really taken to this giant monster thing.
Ja, we are naturals.
Do you think they compete in giant monstering?
Stop right there.
Drop those truffles and surrender.
Oh, my tummy!
Oh, my tummy!
You cannot dominate us.
A sweet confection has made us unstoppable!
- Run for your lives!
- Hold your ground.
We can't let them get by us.
Next stop, smashy town.
Stop right there.
- Red!
- Get back, Nick.
We'll handle this.
- We?
- Ja, Hansel.
I only see one little girl.
All alone.
She's never alone.
- Thank goodness!
- Last chance, kids.
Drop the truffles and surrender.
Surrender?
We don't do the surrender.
We are unstoppable!
Bring it.
- We're kicking it old-school!
- Alley-oop, Abigail!
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
- Hey!
Stop that!
- You are making us angry!
Hey, tubby!
Over here!
OK, Twitchy, let them have it.
- Stop with the shoving!
- Alley-oop!
- Red, coming at you!
- I got it, Granny!
- Go, Red!
Go!
- You cannot be defeating us!
Go ahead, run away like a little girl!
What did you call me?
No, Red!
Keep going!
- Hm.
- Ja, you just keep the running away.
Like a scared little girl.
Red?
Are you OK, honey?
Granny...
I'm sorry.
We did the tricking of you, you silly little girl.
That's just really great!
Now they can get away.
Or worse, they could figure out that if they eat more truffles, they would become completely unstoppable.
- Really?
- Wolf!
Did I say that out loud?
What have you done?
We'll never stop them now.
- Don't worry, Nicky.
- All part of the plan.
- Plan?
What plan?
- Relax, we got this covered.
Watch and learn.
We are all powerful!
Wait for it.
Brother, what is happening?
See, kids, you shouldn't overdo sweets.
Those Super Truffles are also super high in fat and calories.
I'm stuck.
Oh, schnitzel.
- My word.
- See, Nicky, one truffle makes you super, but a whole batch, and you're as helpless as a beach ball.
Those two won't give us any more trouble.
Does this street make my butt look fat?
You know, a lesser wolf would say they finally got their just desserts.
- But not you.
- No, not me.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to a treadmill.
If you do not have a treadmill, one will be provided for you.
- You have the right to broccoli.
- Not broccoli!
Nice work, agents.
With a little rehabilitation and a lot of exercise, we may still be able to show those kids the way home.
Granny, I'll need you to get me in touch with the Sisters of the Hood.
We've got agents to round up and an agency to rebuild.
- I think we could use their help.
- The Sisters are always ready.
Aren't we, Verushka?
Especially with everything back where it should be.
Calling all agents.
A 714 in progress.
Reports of 10,000 mice chasing a suspect.
See the man with the flute.
What the heck?
It's on the way.
- Ooh!
I'm driving!
- Says who?
- Go get 'em, agents.
- That's my girl.
Hey, on the way, we should stop for some disguises.
Yeah, I know just the place.
So you sticking around a while or going back to finish your training?
- Nah, I'm good here.
- Another happy ending.
- Let's roll, partner.
- Anything you say, partner.
You know, Twitchy, I...
Could you turn the music down for a second?
Uh...
No.
- Ja, Hansel.
- Ja, Gretel.
We're evil, we're...
something else that rhymes with evil.
That was sweet!
Let's do it again!
Maybe later.
Hey, girls.
Let's call it a night.
[Male] Once upon a time, there were four unlikely heroes.
Red Riding Hood, her granny, the not so Big Bad Wolf, and an over-caffeinated squirrel called Twitchy.
Together, they defeated the evil plans of a very bad little bunny, and came to work for me.
My name is Nicky, and I run the Happily Ever After Agency, an organization dedicated to making happy endings for everyone.
As we say in the HEA, "It's not just a fairy tale, it's an adventure."
Recently, Red took a leave of absence to train at a secret location with the legendary Sisters of the Hood.
This left the team in a bit of disarray, just as we were about to meet a terrible threat, not only to the HEA, but to happy endings everywhere.
It started one night when we received an anonymous tip that two children were being held in a gingerbread house by a witch with a wicked appetite.
[Cackling]
[Female over radio] Alpha Leader, witch sighted in window.
[Male over radio] Which window?
- [Female] Affirmative.
- [Male] What?
Rescue Team Alpha, stand by for go order.
[Female 1] Agent Fuzzy moving into position.
[Male] Nick Knack, take point.
[Female 2] Paddy Whack, cover the rear.
[Male] Suspect is enchanted and extremely dangerous.
- [Female 1] Roger.
- [Male] Who's Roger?
[Quietly] Alpha Leader here, confirmed Mother Goose.
Rescue Team standing by.
[Wolf] Looks like Red's a no-show.
Again.
Wolf, we talked about this.
Red's on assignment.
And I'm supposed to be at the DMV, but I showed up.
Look, dog, I know you miss her.
We all do.
But those poor kids are going to become baked goods any minute now.
I need you to concentrate on what's going on here.
Yo, Froggy, what's the story on Red Riding Rogue?
Wolf, she is training secretly.
- [Wolf] What kind of secret training?
- Not now.
OK, OK.
You wanna reassign Red, it's your agency.
- Thank you.
- So we all agree
- that I don't need any secret training.
- Wolf!
- My talent comes naturally.
- [Groans]
[Nicky] Wolf!
Get off the channel!
[Witch cackling]
[Shaker rattling]
[Yelling]
Those kids don't have much time.
Don't sweat it, Granny Dynamite.
With Red gone, I need to step up.
- So I called out the big guns.
- What?
This is not good!
We might have a problem here, sir!
Put it on the screen.
[Rapid beeping]
No!
They wouldn't!
Alpha Team, we've got something small and fast, scurrying up the side of the house.
Roger, Goose, I'll get a gander.
[Speaking rapidly] On the job.
Love my job.
Good job.
It's not just a job, it's an adventure.
Hey, Granny, how you doing?
Bye-bye!
- What are you two up to?
- You like recipes, don't you?
Try this.
A cup of hot wolf, a pinch of screwy squirrel and a dash of disguise.
Rescue pie.
My own recipe.
- Wolf, no!
- Thank me later!
That's not a rope.
Not rope, not rope.
Not rope, not rope.
Not rope!
[Laughs] Rope!
Twitchy, what do you think you're doing up there?
The wolf's plan.
I'll slip through the chimney.
She'll never see me coming.
- [Speaking rapidly] It's a great job...
- What is he saying?
Translate that.
[Computerized male voice] I have an advantageous position from which to breach our suspect's gingerbread home.
Uh-oh.
I think the fan is about to be hit with the doody.
I'm going in!
Right now!
[Computerized voice] I am going in.
Negative.
Do not proceed.
Do not proceed.
- Now, listen to me, Twitchy...
- [radio static hisses]
Mammals!
[Rope zipping]
- [Evil laughter] - [Male, German accent] Oh, please!
We did not mean to trespass into your delicious cookie house!
[Female, German accent] Ja, we were only searching for goodies for this... [witch] Silence!
[Hisses]
[Grunts]
- [Witch breathing heavily] - [Whimpering]
- [Doorbell rings] - [Witch growls]
[Coughs]
Building inspector.
You know, it's against housing codes to live in any dessert bigger than a cupcake.
- [Coughing]
- I need to see your permits and a list of ingredients.
That better not be custard.
Don't worry, kids!
I'm here to rescue you!
Yeah, me, I got the good guys!
- They're all hiding outside.
- Little squirrel, I am Hansel.
Ja, and I am Gretel.
You must hurry.
The witch will soon return.
- [Hansel] She'll eat us all for supper!
- She says chicken tastes like children!
[Both] Ja!
OK, OK, I'm on the case.
- [Growling] - [Twitchy squealing]
He's in trouble!
Move in!
Move in!
Come on, you goldbricks!
You wanna live forever?
- [Puffing] - [Sirens wailing]
- Get the door!
- Just get more puffs!
I think it's weakening.
[Yelling]
Agents, take a bite out of crime.
Wolf, this entire operation is a shambles.
I know, but I can fix it.
[Witch cackling]
- She got the kids!
- You're alive!
- Now, we'll never catch up with her.
- [Engine revving]
- Sweet ride!
- Boys?
[Witch] Sorry, goodies, but this is a dinner flight.
Help us!
She has flavorful marinades!
- Oh, no, you didn't!
- [Revving]
- Come on, Twitch.
- [Squealing]
- [Granny] Buckle up, homies.
It's on!
- No, wait!
Don't just...
Get some backup in the air, now!
[Witch cackling]
Whoa!
Ten and two, Granny!
I'm regretting that burrito.
[Gretel] Help us!
She has put us in little cages!
It is dehumanizing!
- [Hansel] We are like delicious veal!
- You'll never save them!
- Tree in the way!
- Oh, put on your man pants, Wolfie.
- Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray...
- Whoo-hoo!
[Engine revving]
Can we go back for my stomach?
It's pink, shaped like a football.
- Has my lunch in it.
- Oh, knuckle up, dog.
Mother Goose to base.
Mother Goose to base.
We are in pursuit of witch.
Stand by.
- Better catch me, I'm getting peckish.
- That witch is whack.
Wolf, you think you can handle a bike like this?
Sure, I think I could if I had to.
I went through my bad boy phase.
Road a bike, greased my hair back, lived over Richie Cunningham's garage, water-skied over a shark tank.
Those were some happy days.
Great, 'cause she's all yours, dog.
- [Yells]
- Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
- Hi, Granny.
- Hey, young kids.
I've gotcha.
- No!
I've got you!
- [Gasps]
[Witch cackling]
[Grunting]
No worries, Twitch.
Dog is your co-pilot.

Don't lose them.
Now turn right.
Your other right!
- Your other other right!
- [Alarm sounding]
Stay low, stay low!
Mammals.
- [Engine revving] - [Witch cackling]
There they are, there they are!
There they go, you passed them.
You passed them!
Why did you pass them?
Calm down.
You got the metabolic rate of a hummingbird.
I've got me a foolproof Granny rescue plan.
Twitchy, do you think you could handle a bike like this?
No, no, bad idea!
I can't reach the pedals!
Be seeing you, little buddy.
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
[Grunts]
[Yelps]
OK, I can taste my own butt.
Saw that coming. [Screeching]
Oh, look!
Your doggie's trying to save you!
Don't worry, Granny, I got ya!
- No, Wolf, don't!
It's a trap!
- I got ya, I got ya.
- Oh!
OK, I don't got ya.
- We need help.
Get Red!
- She'll know what to do!
- Hey, I'm handling this rescue!
- Everything's under control!
- You can't do it alone!
- Hey!
I'm alive!
- [Wolf grunts]
[Witch cackling]
- You almost saved her.
- I got served.
This whole thing is my fault.
None of this would have happened if...
- If Red were here?
- Well, she's not here, is she?
Nicky Flippers' little superstar is far, far... far away.
Far, far, far... far away.
Far... far away.
- [Twitchy] Yeah, yeah, I get it!
- [Wolf] Just saying it's quite a ways.
- [Rumbling] - [Gasps]
[Growling]
[Growling]
Uh...
Hi.
[Lisping] So you think you can deliver that basket of goodies across my bridge, do you?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, no, no!
You did not just say that.
I did not hear that!
There ain't no way my bridge is being crossed by some muffin-delivering, red-hood-wearing, fairy-tale-cliché, little girl.
- Get up outta here!
- [Grunts]
- Bring it.
- [Laughing]
[Grunts, yelling]
I'm about to get you!
- Oh!
- [Growls]
Hey!
Oh!
- No, no, no!
- [Troll] See?
I told you!
I win again.
It's 'cause I'm so evil.
Mm!
I even taste evil.
Ooh!
I taste just like chicken.
Chicken and evil!
I'm gonna do my little evil chicken dance.
- [Red grunts]
- Huh?
Hello!
Is the fight over?
Did you mean to jump off the bridge?
Huh?
Bye-bye.
Ooh!
That's cheating!
That is so cheating!
You running 'cause you know you can't beat me!
Your granny never would've run away like a scared little chicken girl!
- What did you just say?
- You heard me.
I said your granny would be ashamed of you, 'cause you running like a teeny, tiny, helpless, little girl!
- [Yelling]
- Oh, muffins.
- [Grunting]
- Oh!
Ow!
- Take that!
And that!
- Was it something I said?
Ooh!
That's my corn!
Aah!
[Troll] I kinda like that.
[Woman] Enough!
[Troll] Check, please.
The test is over.
The delivery is incomplete.
I win again!
I am the greatest!
I'm the prettiest ballerina in the whole fruit cup!
Yes, Senator, that is my monkey.
His name is Rumpelstiltskin, but it's a secret.
Don't tell him I told you.
I'm coming to the light, Mama.
[Voices chanting indistinctly, echoing]
Show me the Seven-Layer Kick.
[Grunting]
Show me the Spatula!
[Yelps]
Show me the Flying Rolling Pin!
[Shrieks]
Red, I know you came with much to prove, but your task was to deliver the basket.
You heard what he said about my granny!
Moss used your desire to please Abigail as just a test.
A Sister finds her own path, her true inner power.
Besides, honey, we're starting to run low on combat instructors.
Oh, come on.
Really!
I barely touched him.
Why, fidlee dee, Mr. Butler.
What brings you to Tara?
- I like Tootsie Rolls.
- [Chuckles nervously] He'll be fine.
- ["Kung Fu Fighting" ringtone plays]
- Hm...
Sorry, I should take this.
- Hello?
- Red?
It's Nicky.
Nicky?
What is it?
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
It's about your grandmother.
[Red] Why would anyone want to kidnap my granny?
Red, at the end of every Sister's training, she faces the ancient trial by truffle, in which the student attempts to recreate the Sisterhood's most powerful culinary confection.
For over a thousand years that recipe has been our secret, its making understood only by the best of us.
What has that got to do with Granny?
Very few Sisters complete the truffle, one of them was your grandmother, Abigail Puckett.
[Clanking]
The power of this goodie is so great, it must be ever kept from those who would misuse it.
Like those wannabes at the Food Network.
[Sister] Holla!
Rachael Ray's the devil.
This is where you keep all the recipes?
No, just the one.
The Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!
But around the kitchen, honey, we just call it the Super Truffle!
Cool!
What makes it so super?
Anyone who eats it becomes unstoppable, in strength and thought and speed.
- Sounds good.
- Too good!
So... how did you make the recipe invisible?
- Oh, muffins.
- [Sisters shrieking]
[Sister] Battle stations!
Man your posts!
Sound the alarm!
Secure the gates!
Somebody get me my rolling pin!
[Shrieks]
We must hurry.
Whoever stole the recipe will be trying to complete the truffle.
We must find and stop them before they do.
Before they find the secret ingredient.
- Secret ingredient?
What is it?
- Well, it's...
Oh, no, you don't.
The final ingredient is never written down.
- Or even spoken.
- Then how does anyone know it?
When you're a true Sister of the Hood, you just know.
That must be why they kidnapped Abigail.
I've gotta find her.
Red, the task of saving your granny is yours alone.
But, child, I fear it may be more danger than you are ready for.
It doesn't matter.
She's my granny, I've gotta save her.
You have learned much.
The Sisterhood is in your blood.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
Right?
Red is still finding her true path.
- She is not ready.
- Yeah, I know.
- [Witch cackling] - [Thunder rumbling]
For a complete nut muffin, that witch sure ties a good knot.
- [Door creaking]
- Did somebody say "nut muffin"?
Sounds delicious.
My dinner was interrupted, and I could use a little snack.
- Comfypoo, Abigail?
- Have we met before?
Was it the '60s?
The '60s are kind of a blur.
What?
!
Why, no!
You'd remember meeting someone as evil as me!
Why, look at these glowing red eyes and big scary mask!
Your goodie friends won't find you here, Abigail.
So you might as well relax and stay for dinner.
- You want me to make you dinner?
- Oh, how nice of you to offer.
Let me see.
What am I in the mood for?
Day-old sushi?
Dutch balls?
Turducken?
I'm more in the mood for a chocolate truffle!
A truffle?
Sorry, never learned to make that.
Never?
Never studied with the Sisterhood of Kung Fu Bakers?
Never learned the secret ingredient to an ancient recipe so powerful it makes one invincible?
Darn!
I really had a taste for that.
How do you know about that?
That recipe is forbidden.
[Scoffs] Forbidden, is it?
Oh.
Well, that's too bad.
Well, then it's a good thing I have it written down.
See?
- [Gasps]
- Do you want it?
Do you?
Take it.
Oh.
Oh, you can't.
You're tied to a chair.
Oh, too bad!
Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's right, Abigail.
I have everything but the secret ingredient,
- and you're going to give it to me.
- What?
You think I'm just gonna bake one up for you?
Not gonna happen.
You won't?
All right.
I guess I'll just have to cook up something else.
- ["H.R. Pufnstuff" plays]
- Ooh.
Sorry.
I love that show.
- She's getting us ready for the baking!
- I'm too young to be a strudel!
So, Abigail, what's for dinner?
I'll need a titanium mixing bowl.
- [Thunder crashes] - [Witch cackling]
[Male over radio]... search for Granny Puckett, highest priority.
[Female] What is the status of Mother Hubbard's cupboard?
[Male] Someone update Granny's Facebook profile to "witchnapped."
[Male 2] Butcher and baker cleared.
We're questioning the candlestick maker.
I'm not saying they shouldn't work here, I'm just saying they're delicious.
Ooh!
Wolf, thanks for taking such good care of my granny.
Yeah, my finest hour.
I'm shopping the movie rights.
But maybe if you'd been around to look after the old girl yourself,
- I wouldn't have had to.
- If I...
I was training.
- While you've been playing kung fu...
- You know that thing you do...
- [argument continues]
- Awkward.
Red, it's good to see you.
There's been a rash of robberies.
The stolen items are from that list of Super Truffle ingredients you sent us.
- So the witch has been shopping?
- We think so.
A surveillance camera caught the latest incident.
Blue, pull up the Muffet footage.
- [Spider growls] - [Wolf] Whoa!
Did you see the size of that mushroom?
We're gonna need to hit the streets, find out who's hiring the muscle.
Indeed.
We think many of the suspects are associates of a shady operator known as The Giant.
He's a reputed smuggler, a juggler, a robber, a cobbler, a picker, a grinner, a restaurateur, and blogs about animated films.
- He should get a life.
- Indeed.
He runs the Beanstalk Club in Big City.
I want the two of you to check it out.
- What?
Are you kidding?
- Me and her?
Whoa!
Hop back here a second, Flippers.
You mean the both of us?
Granny never needed a partner, and I don't either.
I guess she's right about that, maybe.
Red, you're not going anywhere without backup.
And you, you need to shuffle your wild-card antics to the bottom of the deck.
No more stunts, no more cheap disguises.
You two are partners.
Get used to it.
All right, road trip!
[♪ Dan Myers: "Big City"]
- [Train whistling] - [Male] Hey, I'm driving here!
[Wolf] Big City is home to great shopping, dining, and two professional sports teams:
The Golden Geese of the National Enchantment League and what was formerly the Denver Nuggets.
- What are you doing?
- Reading about the big burg,
- in case we get a chance to sightsee.
- We're not here to sightsee.
- We're here to find Granny.
- Fine.
But you're missing out on a chance to visit the Old Mother Hubbard Museum.
Largest collection of empty cupboards in the world, which is weird.
- [Tires squealing] - [Crashing]
OK, let's get something straight.
We're doing this operation by the book, exactly the way Granny would, plain and simple.
- I just had a book.
- Wrong book.
- Hey, it was a good book.
- All right, look...
Looky, looky, over here!
Hey, it's Kirk.
He's really hit the big time.
We should catch the show.
No.
We are going to stay focused and follow procedure.
- They won't expect that.
- Look, you two, we are definitely not here to hang around in loud, sleazy nightclubs, listening to cheesy lounge singers.

- So, what's the plan, Hoodie?
- We talk to Jimmy 10-Strings.
He's one of Granny's regular informants.
If The Giant's behind the stolen ingredients, that harp will sing in more ways than one.
- We need to...
- Ply him with my lupine charisma?
- Gotcha.
I'm on it.
- Hold on!
I'll do the talking.
Granny told me how to handle guys like this.
The trick is not...
Huh?
- Wolf?
- Go, Wolfie!
Go, Wolfie!
Aah, stop that!
Will you two focus?
OK, OK!
Just trying to blend in with the crowd.
- Just stay here.
- This will end well.
I'll be at the bar.
Merci beaucoup, and my personal favorite, danke schön.
- Hey, Jimmy 10-Strings.
- Sweetheart, I do autographs
- after the show, OK?
- I work with Granny,
- and I need you to do me a favor.
- For Granny?
Anything!
I hear your boss has his goons stealing truffle ingredients.
What do you know?
What?
!
Well, I never.
I mean, who told you...
OK, listen up.
A couple of days ago, I overheard The Giant talking about a big order for someone called...
Uh-oh.
- I didn't tell her a thing.
- Get your hooves off me.
Tell the boss I told her nothing.
[Sighs]
I should sing something nice at her funeral.
- [Male] Tell 10-Strings
- Up there.
To limit his singing to exclusively musical vocalizations, or I shall be forced to tune his strings
- until they snap.
Capisce?
- Got it, boss.
You, with the red hanky on her head.
Are you trying to play my harp?
You could end up singing with the angels, playing my harp.
- Tell me about the witch.
- What witch?
Which witch?
- Huh.
Good one, boss.
- Did you just laugh at me?
Do I amuse you?
- Am I some sort of clown to you?
- No, I...
I hate my job.
- Who are you?
- I'm your worst nightmare.
A Sister with a badge.
And I'm onto you.
[Crowd gasping]
Excuse me.
Did I just hear your tiny, little voice correctly?
Did you just come into my house, hassle my harp, interrupt my dinner and tell me my hands are dirty?
!
I eat sandwiches bigger than you, little girl!
[Wolf] Did someone say sandwiches?
'Cause I'll take one.
And I'll bet you'll take five.
Hundred, that is!
'Cause you're a big boy.
I said big boy, son.
Who the Mother Goose is this supposed to be?
Phineas Newcastle McGee, wealthy business tycoon.
Didn't we meet at the big convention?
MobCon, the mobsters' convention.
Wasn't that you?
You know, I just got back from ConCon, the big conman convention.
Funniest thing.
I show up, nobody there!
Empty building!
[Wheezing laughter]
Guess I should've seen that coming.
We are gonna die.
[Laughing]
I love this guy!
This guy is hilarious!
You two, have some dinner with me.
Come here.
Hey, 10-Strings, you know what I wanna hear.
You bet, big guy.
Two, three, six.

I don't like most little people.
Hey, you know what?
- I like you.
- Little people.

Sorry.

Yeah, I got my Pilates workout, she's got a paper route.

- Hey!
Those skeevosos are trying to put the bag on my harp!
- Get after them!
- [Growling]
You got the wrong guy.
Frank Jr.'s down the street.
Did anybody notice that the guy I work for is an insane giant?
[Growling]
Put down the harp!
He's under contract!
[Whimpering]
Now you've done it.
He's mad!
We're dead.
- And I didn't even get my encore.
- Time to go!
And I still have 38 payments left on myself.
- Yee-haw!
- What am I paying you pasty mooks for?
Get after them!
- Hey, do you get paid?
- Not really.
No.
[Yelling]
- Start singing, 10-Strings.
- Is this your first time doing this?
'Cause Granny just slips me 20 bucks.
I'll show those pipsqueaks who's the big man around here!
Putting fingers on my property!
Like that Jack guy.
I'm still picking pieces of him out of my teeth!
I'll grind up their bones to make my pasta fazool!
Tell us who The Giant's getting ingredients for.
Yeah, well, you know The Giant is not usually very happy about those who spill his personal beans.
Maybe I could tell you something about Goldilocks.
That is not her natural hair color.
- Really?
- I knew it!
- Just tell us who ordered the thefts.
- OK, OK already.
I'll tell ya.
Every day The Giant gets a call for a new ingredient from from the Bunny.
- The Bunny?
- Not the Bunny!
Not the Bunny!
- [Jimmy] Yes, the Bunny.
He calls in the orders, and that's all I know.
If you wanna hear me sing anymore, you'll have to catch my show.
Fe-fi-fo-fum!
I gotcha now!
- Jump!
- Are you crazy?
We're a mile up.
- Don't argue!
Just jump!
- OK.
This is not how you treat an entertainer of my caliber. [Yelling]
[Growling]
Hey, Twitchy, you didn't bring a parachute by any chance, did ya?
Uh...
No.

No, thanks.
I'm trying to cut down.

- I think that went off pretty smooth.
- What was that disguise supposed to be?
- Fake beards are classic.
- You look like a deranged Santa Claus.
Santa gave me that beard.
[Á la Hannibal Lecter] Hello, Clarice.
- Who's Clarice?
- She is.
Hi, Clarice!
- Enjoy the book, Boingo.
- We share a love of literature.
So, Red, I see that stray dog is still following you around.
- [Growling]
- Don't let him mess with your head.
Let me guess.
You're the brains, and you're... not the brains?
Who's up for hasenpfeffer.
We know you've been working with The Giant.
Oh, really?
How?
I don't get out much.
- Talked to any witches lately?
- Which witch?
[Chuckles]
Oh, you mean the witch that took your granny.
When she said she wanted to take out old beehive,
I said, "Now, there's something we've got in common."
She did mention something about outwitting some incompetent, stupid, meddling, jerkfaced HEA agents!
I assumed she was talking about you two.
- I wasn't there.
- No, of course you weren't.
Relax, Fido.
You've got Little Red Riding Hood to protect you now.
- I do OK on my own.
- Is that before or after
- I bail you out?
- You weren't doing a lot of bailing
- when I saved your cape at the bar!
- [Red] I had everything under control.
- Another minute and I would've...
- [Wolf] Have been páté!
- [Red] I don't need your help.
- [Wolf] Oh, really?
- Watch me.
- Ow!
No!
Not the ears!
You didn't even say the magic word.
- Abracadabra.
- Ow!
That's not even...
Well, actually, that is the magic word.
I don't know where Granny is.
The witch sends me notes, and I put the word out.
- Tell me where they are.
- Ow.
Ow.
You're still mad about me trying to kill you all those times, aren't you?
- Hey, books!
- Hey, no, wait!
Don't read that!
Nobody reads books anymore.
Movies are always better.
Especially sequels.
How does the witch get messages into your books?
Why don't you ask her?
She was just here.
[Gasps] The cleaning lady!
Come on, hurry!
- [Witch cackling]
- She can't have gotten far!
Oh, she was right under our noses!
[Echoing] Aah!
I'm blind!
No, wait.
A little help.
- See?
I said it before.
Disguises work.
- [Growls in frustration]
Would you stop it already!
If you hadn't distracted me in there, I would have...
- Oh, so this is my fault, too?
- Yeah, it is.
That's great, coming from someone who just took off to play Crouching Baker.
I stayed to do the job.
It's not like this is easy.
I'm doing my best here.
Yeah, well, your best got my granny and two innocent kids kidnapped!
OK, fine!
You're right!
It did.
This is all my fault.
My screw-ups are putting everyone in danger.
I'll probably get you nabbed next.
Happy?
[Echoing] A little help!
Rolling now!
That's not what I meant.
You've made your point, Red.
This partnership's a disaster.
I better leave before I do any more damage.
I've always been a lone wolf.
Tell Nicky I quit.
[Echoing] Sorry, Red.
He's my ride.
[Echoing] Do I sound weird?
I sound weird to me!
I sound weird to me!
[Snapping]
How is the truffle coming, Abigail?
I can't work with such inferior equipment.
This mixing machine is ten years old, and the measuring cups are cracked.
I need exact measurements!
I can't work miracles with this stuff!
You should try, Abigail, or those little bratwursts will be on the menu tonight!
Your Tibetan cocoa sticks.
These did not come easy.
The Happily Ever After Agency is everywhere!
Only three?
I need four.
- Four?
!
- I can't make it without four sticks.
I have lost two Sherpas in those mountains already.
Do you know how much a Sherpa costs?
They've got a union.
I've gotta pay for goats.
I've gotta pay for the little hats.
There's per diem.
You want this done right, or don't you?
You bring me a decent flour sifter and some real measuring cups, then I might be able to remember the final ingredient.
Fine!
But you better get cooking, Abigail.
[Muttering] Four cocoa sticks.
Just take two cocoa sticks and break 'em in half!
[Slams door]
Oh, don't you worry.
I'll get cooking all right.
[Chuckling]
Boo-yah!
Still got it.
["Schnitzel" plays over TV]
[Gretel] Get the remote.
Time for Rachael Ray.
[Hansel] Leave me alone.
I'm trying to fill the awful emptiness that lives deep inside me with food.
[Yodeling on TV]
Children, I found you.
[Squealing]
[Both] Granny Puckett!
- How did you get out?
- I've got my ways, little one.
Come on, we gotta get you two out of here.
The exit is there.
We saw the witch go through that way.
Show me.
But we gotta be quiet.
The exit is straight ahead.
Don't be suspicious.
Continue moving.
[Clanging]
- What?
What is this?
- It's a big cage, dum-dum.
- Huh?
What's she doing here?
- [Hansel] You tell us.
I thought you said she was locked up tight.
- She was!
She just needed more...
- More tools to do the escaping with?
You mean all this time, you two were never?
In danger?
No!
We're not even kidnapped!
- We're the kidnappers!
- Ja!
You've been hoodwinked!
- Too!
Ja, Hansel!
- Ja, Gretel!
[Both chanting] We're evil!
We're...
something else that rhymes with evil!
You two are the nastiest children I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.
Don't blame us.
It is society's fault.
We had the displeasure of being the children of a poor woodcutter.
We never had any sweets for the snacking.
But now we will have the greatest dessert of all time, to make us unstoppable!
Well, this chefjust turned in her apron.
You'll never get the secret ingredient.
Don't worry.
We have ways of making you bake.
Verushka, keep your scary mask on!
You want to look spooky or not?
- And turn your eyes back on.
- Oh.
Oh, right.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Very scary.
Now, can you keep her locked up this time?
- Yes!
- And remember, we are in charge, Verushka.
Verushka?
Verushka Von Vine?
You finally remember me.
How nice!
Perhaps you also remember this.
Is that what this is about?
It all started when we were Sisters together in the Sisterhood.
You were always so good at everything.
I tried so hard to beat you, but you were always better than me.
Then came that terrible day of the ancient recipe ritual, when the...
[Granny] Why are you telling me this?
I was there.
[Verushka] Abigail!
This is my big, super-evil-villain moment!
- So will you just shut up?
!
- [Granny] OK, OK.
[Verushka] Now, where was I?
Started at the Sisterhood, always number two...
Did I get to the part about the truffle?
- [Granny sighs] Yes.
- I couldn't make that stinking truffle!
But you did!
And I knew then that you were the reason I was a big pile of number two!
So I stole the great recipe, and I spent the last 60 years searching for the secret ingredient!
[Granny] You really practiced this speech?
[Verushka] But then Hansel and Gretel found me.
Together we devised a plan to kidnap you and complete the truffle recipe.
My attempts to find the secret ingredient were all failures!
Sure, I did produce a few other things.
A poison apple, a sleeping spell, a way to turn men into frogs.
She's completely insane.
You should see what she's done to the cat.
Oh, that's disturbing on so many levels.
You don't have to be like this, Verushka.
I'll never play second fiddle to you again, Abigail.
I've been number two long enough.
Once I finally have the Super Truffle,
I will taste the sweet, chocolaty victory of being number one!
[Cackling]
OK, all I need to do is find this D.C.T. Place.
How hard could that be?
[Sighing] Muffins!

Got a dollar?
What?
Who?
Hey, down here.
It's better to give than to receive.
So give me a dollar and you'll feel better.
- No.
I'm just looking for...
- Looking?
A quest?
I love...
Ooh.
You work out?
You are looking for the big golden...
No, wait.
The magic.
You're looking for the magic...
OK, I got nothing.
What's on your mind?
My granny!
She's out there somewhere, and I'm totally out of clues.
[Sniffing] Perhaps she's been turned into stone.
What?
Turned to...
How do you even come up with that?
Who says that?
- You get what you pay for.
- All I've got is this stupid tag.
- "D.C.T." You tried Dental Clown Tech?
- Yes!
I've tried everywhere.
Yeah, yeah, it's tough.
Wait a second.
Wait a second!
- Dark Castle Towers!
- Dark Castle?
My brothers and I used to live there.
Then there was this whole thing with the farmer's wife and a clock.
- Can you show me?
- Sure.
Follow me. [Grunts]
I thought I told you to stay off my corner.
The journey there is long and full of dangers.
[Mouse] Oh, no, there it is.
My bad.
[Keypad beeping]
- Nicky, it's Red.
- [Nicky] Red!
- Good to hear from you.
- I need...
That is...
- Is Wolf there?
- No, we haven't heard from him.
Why?
- What's the trouble?
- Dark Castle Towers, that's what.
It's an old hotel on South Castle Street.
I'm sure Granny and the kids are in there.
- But it's really heavily guarded.
- And you need help to get them out?
No, no!
I've totally got it.
No problemo.
- I just thought...
- I'll alert the squad leaders.
We'll have a full rescue team there immediately.
- Give me as many details as you can.
- [Sighs] OK.
[Verushka] Oh, no!
What are we gonna do?
The whole HEA is going to be at our front door, and our back door, and our windows!
We're practically crawling with windows!
I think some of the windows even have little doors...
Stop!
Chill out.
Ja, ja.
Chill a pill and then take one.
We have always known that the Happily Ever After Agency would be a threat.
- Our forces are already in place.
- Lesson four:
Eliminate your obstacles.
- Eliminate?
But what do you mean?
- [Feedback whines]
[Echoing] Send in the pigs!
Good work, Red.
That's the break we were looking for.
- What?
- Nicky?
Is everything all right?
Uh, I'm not sure.
Stand by.
- [Nicky] Ops, status report.
- Sir, we are being attacked!
- [Alarm blaring]
- Nicky, what is it?
What's going on?
- Red, we've got trouble.

Wolves are just plain untrustworthy.

They not only work, they save lives.
But this...

No, she's not working alone.
Every agent we have has been roughed up, kidnapped, scared off or mailed to an uncharted island.
I'm afraid the agency is all but defeated.
What about Red?
Is she OK?
No one's heard from her.
I hate to assume the worst, but...
I never thought I'd say this, Wolf.
I think a wild card is the only thing that can save us now.
You guys didn't really catch me.
I just slipped.

Well, it still counts, man.

- Nope.
- You were always like that, Abigail.
- No, I wasn't.
- [Verushka] Yes, you were!
- [Granny] Was not.
- [Verushka] Were, too.
- Not well.
Well, we better do something quick.
Red and the Wolf will be here any moment.
Ja, maybe that is exactly what we need.
[Laughing evilly]
[Chuckling]
[Both laughing evilly]
[Hansel] I don't know why we are laughing.
[Evil laughter resumes]
- You came back.
- Well, I just figured, you obviously don't know how to talk your way into anyplace.
Obviously.
- So Granny's up there somewhere?
- Yeah.
- It's locked down pretty tight.
- So how do we play this?
We're gonna need some muscle to get in there.
- I think I know where to get it.
- [Audience cheering]
Thank you, thank you.
I love you all.
[Yodeling]
That is nice.
Now I got to go in now.
Bye.
[Humming indistinctly]
- [Red] Hey, Kirk.
- [Shrieking, chuckling]
Oh, my friends, it's so good to see you!
- It has been too long.
- No, it's been about right.
Did you catch the show tonight?
I was on fire!
The Yodelers have been so good to me.
- Dutch balls?
- We need your help.
We need your courage, we need your muscle...
We need my Yodelers.
[All] Huh?
[Kirk] Before they delighted the world with song, the Happy Yodelers were highly trained mercenaries.
Johann, maps and tactical plans.
Helmut, demolitions expert.
Heidi, security systems and technology.
Klaus handles the receipts.
[Cash register dings]
[Clears throat]
- [Chuckles] We got us a rodent problem.
- He's not wearing any pants.
- Anyone here need an exterminator?
- We're professional exterminators.
Yep, they're probably in the walls by now.
- That's a Pantless Norwegian Stink Rat.
- [Gasps, sniffing]
Norwegian?
We've seen all kinds of pests in this business.
- You know the worst kind?
- No.
- Kidnappers!
- I can't see, I'm blind!
This is just like the '70s.
[Sings operatic high note]
[♪ Theo Bleckmann: "Kung Fu Fighting"]
[Yelling]
Take that, schweinehund!
This little piggy is out, and this little piggy is out.
Is anyone else hungry?
Ooh!
Ow!
Broke a nail.
Twitchy!
Great job, little buddy.
Ow!
- Dude!
- Stink Rat?
I can't censor myself when I'm in the moment.
[Pigs oinking]
- Heidi's hogging all the pigs.
- Wolf!
Twitchy!
- Here we are.
- Let's go!
- Right behind you.
- Ja, you go and save Granny.
We will take care of all those dastardly fellows.
- Good luck!
- Thanks.
You, too.
[Bell dings]
[Muffled shouting]
Thank goodness and gracious you have come to save us!
- Like angels from heaven!
- Where's the old lady?
In the room at the end of the hallway.
The witch is always shouting at her!
It is so scary here!
If I stay another minute, I may scream!
Scream, I tell you!
Wait.
You two get the kids out of here, I'll find Granny.
- You sure?
- I'd rather know they're safe.
I'll be fine.
We'll rendezvous downstairs.
- Come on, kids.
Let's roll.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Wolf!
- I count my lucky stars for you!
- [Elevator bell dings]
I hope you kids learned a valuable lesson.
Never run away from home, never eat a cookie house.
- Never talk to strangers.
- That's right.
Never talk to strangers.
People are never what they seem to be.
Oh, sure, safety first.
Always carry little gas masks, because you never know.
[Twitchy sniffing] What's that smell?
Perhaps the children are nervous and need to release a little tension.
That's natural.
- Man, that is strong.
- Wow.
[Sniffing] That actually smells like gingerbread.
[Lisping] You kids feel dizzy?
My tongue is getting all puffy and I see rainbows.
Is that normal?
- [Chuckles weakly] - [Body thuds]
[Door creaking]
[Whispers] Granny?
[Sister's voice echoing] The final ingredient is never written down.
When you're a true Sister of the Hood, you just know.
[Male voice echoes] Luke, trust the Force.
What?
[Male] Oh, sorry about that.
Wrong hero quest.
Oh.
Macadamia nuts.
[Verushka cackling maniacally]
Now we know!
- Ja, Hansel.
- Ja, Gretel.
[Both chanting] We're evil, we're evil.
Verushka!
Be a dear and fetch us a bag of... macadamia nuts.
[Cackling]
No!
Granny, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
The Super Truffle will now be complete!
[Cackling]
[Laughing]
Behold the Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!
[Thunder crashing]
Granny, I'm sorry.
I really messed up.
Don't be silly, dear.
I'm proud of you.
You knew what that recipe needed.
Only a true Sister would know that.
No, I mean... [sighs]
I shouldn't have tried to do everything myself.
Now the HEA is gone, and they've got the truffle, and I didn't even rescue you.
I was just so worried about proving I could live up to your example.
I'm sorry.
I let you down.
Why, because things are a little tough right now?
Gooseberries, child.
I've been in much worse situations than this.
You can still turn this around.
A person can never really fail unless they give up.
You fell for our trickery like a fish falls for water.
What have you done with Wolf and Twitchy?
[Cheery elevator music plays]
Hey, Twitchy, look over there.
- Help me get over there.
- Yeah!
OK!
[Both grunting]
- Must... gently... hit... buttons!
- [Twitchy grunting]
- Almost got it.
Come on, little buddy.
- No, no, no!
[Squeaks]
Muffins.
We can't let them leave with those.
I'm sorry, but we have orders to fill for every villain in the world.
Ja, the brochure went out weeks ago.
The truffle's power is, sadly, temporary.
So they will just want more and more.
- And we will become the filthy rich!
- The filthy rich!
- Not if we stop you first.
- Well, of course not.
That is obvious.
If you were to stop us...
Wait a minute.
You wish!
- One for the road, Brother?
- What a delicious idea.
[Both chuckling]
No!
You can't handle the power!
Uh-oh.
I feel the power!
[Laughing maniacally]
All powerful!
I have the strength of a thousand small boys!
You'll have to be excusing.
We have a world to dominate.
- Ja, no time for the dilly-dally.
- This isn't over.
[Laughing]
Giant superpowered German kids.
Did not see that coming.
- The truffle!
It's finally mine!
- Ja, I don't think so.
Hey!
I'm your partner.
We planned this whole thing together.
Oh, did we?
The way I remember it, Brother, it was you, me and a napkin.
Legal documentation?
Yes.
I don't remember signing anything.
Do you, Brother?
- No, no, no.
I don't.
- It's not legal.
- [Gretel] We did not sign anything.
- [Hansel] Oh, look at the face.
You have outlived your usefulness, old woman.
But do not worry.
We will leave a pet for you to do the playing with.
[Gretel cackling]
- What pet?
- You can't do this to me!
Talk to the spider, 'cause the kid ain't listening.
No!
Wait!
Come back!
Spider?
Did he say spider?
[Creature growls]
Now would be a good time to untie us, Verushka.
I got my own problems, Abigail.
[Growling]
[Dings]
[Cheery elevator music playing]
[Grunting]
[Verushka] Help!
Let me out of here!
Help!
Red, get behind me.

I've gotcha!

[Both grunting]
I didn't deserve to be saved.
Especially not by you.
I want you to know you were never number two to me.
[Distant booming]
[Granny] Those kids could level the whole city.
With the power of the Super Truffle, no one will be able to stop them.
This is all my fault.
If I'd been more like you, they wouldn't have gotten away.
You don't need to be like anyone, Red.
You're the real deal.
A true Sister of the Hood.
[Sighing]
- You really think so?
- I know it.
You already have all the power you need.
Go get 'em, honey.
Go, Red.
Go!
Come on, come on!
[Granny] Verushka?
You can always come back.
No.
It's too late for me.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
[Dings]
[Cheery elevator music playing]
What did we miss?
[Granny] I've gotta get me one of these.
[Wolf] Yes, it suits you.
Let's swing by the hat store and pick out something pointy.
[Twitchy cheering]
- [Rumbling] - [Gasps]
[Growling]
Ooh!
Look at the tiny, little people living their tiny lives.
They have done nothing to deserve our hatred.
Makes our violence that much more senseless.
I know!
I love that about us!
- Holy cheese!
- [Hansel] Oh, look, Sister.
- I almost hit a school bus.
- [Gretel] Double points.
Uh-oh.
Ooh!
I regret nothing!
You cannot do the beating of us.
We are truffle-powered!
Yeah, well, I've got a few surprises of my own.
Aah!
Is this the end of Hansel?
[Screaming]
You are really starting to tick me off.
I'm not done yet.
[Cackling] I am indestructible!
Oh, schnitzel.
[Car alarms blaring]
[Grunting]
[Groaning] OK.
Not my best landing.
Yoo-hoo!
Annoying little red person, look in the sky.
You've got to be kidding me.
[Grunts]
- That was really fun.
- Ja, real fun!
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
What is tiny, red and smashed all over?
What is tiny, red and smashed all over who?
- I'll tell you in five seconds.
- You won't get away with this.
Oh, really?
And just who's going to stop us?
[Wolf] Anyone see an aircraft carrier around here?
- Wolf, distract them and I'll get Red.
- [Wolf] Hey there, tubby.
Those shorts make your ankles look fat.
- They do not.
I've very shapely ankles.
- Ja!
- Grab her!
- All aboard!
- Thanks!
- Hey, never leave your wingman.
- Come back here!
- [Grunting]
Sorry!
My bad!
- We're clear.
You can stop swerving.
- I'm trying.
This thing isn't easy to steer, you know.
- [Train whistling] - [Yelling]
I'm sticking to motorcycles.
That was sweet!
Let's do it again!
Maybe later.
Come on!
- [Rumbling] - [Grunting]
- Uh-oh.
- Olly, oily, oxen free!
- One for the truffle.
- Two because we are so very evil.
Three because I also agree we are evil.
- Four to go!
- To go!
[All yelling]
Oh, man.
I thought we were goners for sure.
[Gasping]
Wolf, calm down.
We're gonna be OK.
We just need to walk towards each other.
But we've gotta time it very carefully.
[All yelling]
- Wolf, throw me your beard!
- This is no time for a disguise!
Just do it.
Now.
Wolf, have I ever told you how much I love your disguises?
Ha.
Sorry, my bad.
Listen, I wanna take a moment to apologize for not being there when you needed me.
No, no, no!
It's OK, Wolf!
It's OK!
No, no, no.
Let me do this.
Granny, thanks to my sloppy work, you got kidnapped.
I'm sorry.
OK.
I forgive you.
Twitchy, I've been using your toothpaste.
I haven't bought a tube of toothpaste in probably four years.
Toothpaste?
!
After all we've been through?
!
You have to tell her how you feel right now!
She needs to hear it!
Not now, Twitchy!
Hang on.
Red, I walked away because I thought you didn't want me around.
I'm sorry.
Wolf, I never could have done any of this without you.
I should have listened to you more, Red,
- instead of doing things my way.
- I kind of like your way.
Sometimes, the right disguise can get you out of a tough jam.
So can the right partner.
Now, that's a good recipe.
- Gum?
- Why not?
[All yelling]
- I thought you said we'd be OK!
- I exaggerated!
My life just flashed before my eyes.
It's weird, flashback really does add ten pounds.
What stopped us?
Verushka.
Turns out Bitsy here wasn't so bad after all.
- Just needed a friend.
- [Grunts happily]
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
- Those kids are destroying the city.
- [Distant screaming]
We have to stop them before they eat any more of those truffles.
Wait a minute.
More truffles.
That's a great idea.

Oh, my tummy!
You cannot dominate us.
A sweet confection has made us unstoppable!
- Run for your lives!
- Hold your ground.
We can't let them get by us.
Next stop, smashy town.
[Hansel and Gretel laughing]
[Red] Stop right there.
- Red!
- Get back, Nick.
We'll handle this.
- We?
- Ja, Hansel.
I only see one little girl.
All alone.
[Wolf] She's never alone.
- Thank goodness!
- Last chance, kids.
Drop the truffles and surrender.
Surrender?
We don't do the surrender.
We are unstoppable!
- Bring it.

Over here!
OK, Twitchy, let them have it.

- Stop with the shoving!
- Alley-oop!
- Red, coming at you!

- Go, Red!
Go!
- You cannot be defeating us!
Go ahead, run away like a little girl!
What did you call me?
No, Red!
Keep going!
- [Both] Hm.
- Ja, you just keep the running away.
Like a scared little girl.
[Yelling]
[Grunting]
- Red?
- [Gasps]
Are you OK, honey?
[Whispers] Granny...
I'm sorry.
[Chuckles] We did the tricking of you, you silly little girl.
That's just really great!
Now they can get away.
Or worse, they could figure out that if they eat more truffles, they would become completely unstoppable.
- Really?
- Wolf!
Did I say that out loud?
What have you done?
We'll never stop them now.
- Don't worry, Nicky.
- All part of the plan.
- Plan?
What plan?
- Relax, we got this covered.
Watch and learn.
[Both grunting]
[Yelling]
[Laughing]
We are all powerful!
Wait for it.
Brother, what is happening?
See, kids, you shouldn't overdo sweets.
Those Super Truffles are also super high in fat and calories.
I'm stuck.
[Both] Oh, schnitzel.
- My word.
- See, Nicky, one truffle makes you super, but a whole batch, and you're as helpless as a beach ball.
Those two won't give us any more trouble.
Does this street make my butt look fat?
You know, a lesser wolf would say they finally got their just desserts.
- But not you.
- No, not me.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to a treadmill.
If you do not have a treadmill, one will be provided for you.
- You have the right to broccoli.
- Not broccoli!
Nice work, agents.
With a little rehabilitation and a lot of exercise, we may still be able to show those kids the way home.
Granny, I'll need you to get me in touch with the Sisters of the Hood.
We've got agents to round up and an agency to rebuild.
- I think we could use their help.
- The Sisters are always ready.
Aren't we, Verushka?
Especially with everything back where it should be.
[Female on radio] Calling all agents.
A 714 in progress.
Reports of 10,000 mice chasing a suspect.
See the man with the flute.
What the heck?
It's on the way.
- Ooh!
I'm driving!
- Says who?
- Go get 'em, agents.
- That's my girl.
Hey, on the way, we should stop for some disguises.
Yeah, I know just the place.
So you sticking around a while or going back to finish your training?
- Nah, I'm good here.
- Another happy ending.
- [Wolf] Let's roll, partner.

[Twitchy] That was sweet!
Let's do it again!
[Red] Maybe later.
[♪ CEEJ: "Perfect Two"]
[Twitchy] Hey, girls.
Let's call it a night.
[Male] Once upon a time, there were four unlikely heroes.
Red Riding Hood, her granny, the not so Big Bad Wolf, and an over-caffeinated squirrel called Twitchy.
Together, they defeated the evil plans of a very bad little bunny, and came to work for me.
My name is Nicky, and I run the Happily Ever After Agency, an organization dedicated to making happy endings for everyone.
As we say in the HEA, "It's not just a fairy tale, it's an adventure."
Recently, Red took a leave of absence to train at a secret location with the legendary Sisters of the Hood.
This left the team in a bit of disarray, just as we were about to meet a terrible threat, not only to the HEA, but to happy endings everywhere.
It started one night when we received an anonymous tip that two children were being held in a gingerbread house by a witch with a wicked appetite.
[Cackling]
[Female over radio] Alpha Leader, witch sighted in window.
[Male over radio] Which window?
- [Female] Affirmative.
- [Male] What?
Rescue Team Alpha, stand by for go order.
[Female 1] Agent Fuzzy moving into position.
[Male] Nick Knack, take point.
[Female 2] Paddy Whack, cover the rear.
[Male] Suspect is enchanted and extremely dangerous.
- [Female 1] Roger.
- [Male] Who's Roger?
[Quietly] Alpha Leader here, confirmed Mother Goose.
Rescue Team standing by.
[Wolf] Looks like Red's a no-show.
Again.
Wolf, we talked about this.
Red's on assignment.
And I'm supposed to be at the DMV, but I showed up.
Look, dog, I know you miss her.
We all do.
But those poor kids are going to become baked goods any minute now.
I need you to concentrate on what's going on here.
Yo, Froggy, what's the story on Red Riding Rogue?
Wolf, she is training secretly.
- [Wolf] What kind of secret training?
- Not now.
OK, OK.
You wanna reassign Red, it's your agency.
- Thank you.
- So we all agree
- that I don't need any secret training.
- Wolf!
- My talent comes naturally.
- [Groans]
[Nicky] Wolf!
Get off the channel!
[Witch cackling]
[Shaker rattling]
[Yelling]
Those kids don't have much time.
Don't sweat it, Granny Dynamite.
With Red gone, I need to step up.
- So I called out the big guns.
- What?
This is not good!
We might have a problem here, sir!
Put it on the screen.
[Rapid beeping]
No!
They wouldn't!
Alpha Team, we've got something small and fast, scurrying up the side of the house.
Roger, Goose, I'll get a gander.
[Speaking rapidly] On the job.
Love my job.
Good job.
It's not just a job, it's an adventure.
Hey, Granny, how you doing?
Bye-bye!
- What are you two up to?
- You like recipes, don't you?
Try this.
A cup of hot wolf, a pinch of screwy squirrel and a dash of disguise.
Rescue pie.
My own recipe.
- Wolf, no!
- Thank me later!
That's not a rope.
Not rope, not rope.
Not rope, not rope.
Not rope!
[Laughs] Rope!
Twitchy, what do you think you're doing up there?
The wolf's plan.
I'll slip through the chimney.
She'll never see me coming.
- [Speaking rapidly] It's a great job...
- What is he saying?
Translate that.
[Computerized male voice] I have an advantageous position from which to breach our suspect's gingerbread home.
Uh-oh.
I think the fan is about to be hit with the doody.
I'm going in!
Right now!
[Computerized voice] I am going in.
Negative.
Do not proceed.
Do not proceed.
- Now, listen to me, Twitchy...
- [radio static hisses]
Mammals!
[Rope zipping]
- [Evil laughter] - [Male, German accent] Oh, please!
We did not mean to trespass into your delicious cookie house!
[Female, German accent] Ja, we were only searching for goodies for this... [witch] Silence!

You know, it's against housing codes to live in any dessert bigger than a cupcake.
- [Coughing]
- I need to see your permits and a list of ingredients.
That better not be custard.
Don't worry, kids!
I'm here to rescue you!
Yeah, me, I got the good guys!
- They're all hiding outside.
- Little squirrel, I am Hansel.
Ja, and I am Gretel.
You must hurry.
The witch will soon return.
- [Hansel] She'll eat us all for supper!
- She says chicken tastes like children!
[Both] Ja!
OK, OK, I'm on the case.
- [Growling] - [Twitchy squealing]
He's in trouble!
Move in!
Move in!
Come on, you goldbricks!
You wanna live forever?
- [Puffing] - [Sirens wailing]
- Get the door!
- Just get more puffs!
I think it's weakening.
[Yelling]
Agents, take a bite out of crime.
Wolf, this entire operation is a shambles.
I know, but I can fix it.
[Witch cackling]
- She got the kids!
- You're alive!
- Now, we'll never catch up with her.
- [Engine revving]
- Sweet ride!
- Boys?
[Witch] Sorry, goodies, but this is a dinner flight.
Help us!
She has flavorful marinades!
- Oh, no, you didn't!
- [Revving]
- Come on, Twitch.
- [Squealing]
- [Granny] Buckle up, homies.
It's on!
- No, wait!
Don't just...
Get some backup in the air, now!
[Witch cackling]
Whoa!
Ten and two, Granny!
I'm regretting that burrito.
[Gretel] Help us!
She has put us in little cages!
It is dehumanizing!
- [Hansel] We are like delicious veal!
- You'll never save them!
- Tree in the way!
- Oh, put on your man pants, Wolfie.
- Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray...
- Whoo-hoo!
[Engine revving]
Can we go back for my stomach?
It's pink, shaped like a football.
- Has my lunch in it.
- Oh, knuckle up, dog.
Mother Goose to base.
Mother Goose to base.
We are in pursuit of witch.
Stand by.
- Better catch me, I'm getting peckish.
- That witch is whack.
Wolf, you think you can handle a bike like this?
Sure, I think I could if I had to.
I went through my bad boy phase.
Road a bike, greased my hair back, lived over Richie Cunningham's garage, water-skied over a shark tank.
Those were some happy days.
Great, 'cause she's all yours, dog.
- [Yells]
- Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
- Hi, Granny.
- Hey, young kids.
I've gotcha.
- No!
I've got you!

No worries, Twitch.

Hi.
[Lisping] So you think you can deliver that basket of goodies across my bridge, do you?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, no, no!
You did not just say that.
I did not hear that!
There ain't no way my bridge is being crossed by some muffin-delivering, red-hood-wearing, fairy-tale-cliché, little girl.

It's 'cause I'm so evil.
Mm!

Ooh!
I taste just like chicken.
Chicken and evil!
I'm gonna do my little evil chicken dance.

Hello!
Is the fight over?
Did you mean to jump off the bridge?
Huh?
Bye-bye.
Ooh!
That's cheating!
That is so cheating!

Your granny never would've run away like a scared little chicken girl!

I said your granny would be ashamed of you, 'cause you running like a teeny, tiny, helpless, little girl!

A Sister finds her own path, her true inner power.
Besides, honey, we're starting to run low on combat instructors.

- Hm...
Sorry, I should take this.
- Hello?
- Red?
It's Nicky.
Nicky?
What is it?
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
It's about your grandmother.
[Red] Why would anyone want to kidnap my granny?
Red, at the end of every Sister's training, she faces the ancient trial by truffle, in which the student attempts to recreate the Sisterhood's most powerful culinary confection.
For over a thousand years that recipe has been our secret, its making understood only by the best of us.
What has that got to do with Granny?
Very few Sisters complete the truffle, one of them was your grandmother, Abigail Puckett.
[Clanking]
The power of this goodie is so great, it must be ever kept from those who would misuse it.
Like those wannabes at the Food Network.
[Sister] Holla!
Rachael Ray's the devil.
This is where you keep all the recipes?
No, just the one.
The Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!
But around the kitchen, honey, we just call it the Super Truffle!
Cool!
What makes it so super?
Anyone who eats it becomes unstoppable, in strength and thought and speed.
- Sounds good.
- Too good!
So... how did you make the recipe invisible?
- Oh, muffins.
- [Sisters shrieking]
[Sister] Battle stations!
Man your posts!
Sound the alarm!
Secure the gates!
Somebody get me my rolling pin!
[Shrieks]
We must hurry.
Whoever stole the recipe will be trying to complete the truffle.
We must find and stop them before they do.
Before they find the secret ingredient.
- Secret ingredient?
What is it?
- Well, it's...
Oh, no, you don't.
The final ingredient is never written down.
- Or even spoken.
- Then how does anyone know it?
When you're a true Sister of the Hood, you just know.
That must be why they kidnapped Abigail.
I've gotta find her.
Red, the task of saving your granny is yours alone.
But, child, I fear it may be more danger than you are ready for.
It doesn't matter.
She's my granny, I've gotta save her.
You have learned much.
The Sisterhood is in your blood.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
Right?
Red is still finding her true path.
- She is not ready.
- Yeah, I know.
- [Witch cackling] - [Thunder rumbling]
For a complete nut muffin, that witch sure ties a good knot.
- [Door creaking]
- Did somebody say "nut muffin"?
Sounds delicious.
My dinner was interrupted, and I could use a little snack.
- Comfypoo, Abigail?
- Have we met before?
Was it the '60s?
The '60s are kind of a blur.
What?
!
Why, no!
You'd remember meeting someone as evil as me!
Why, look at these glowing red eyes and big scary mask!
Your goodie friends won't find you here, Abigail.
So you might as well relax and stay for dinner.
- You want me to make you dinner?
- Oh, how nice of you to offer.
Let me see.
What am I in the mood for?
Day-old sushi?
Dutch balls?
Turducken?
I'm more in the mood for a chocolate truffle!
A truffle?
Sorry, never learned to make that.
Never?
Never studied with the Sisterhood of Kung Fu Bakers?
Never learned the secret ingredient to an ancient recipe so powerful it makes one invincible?
Darn!
I really had a taste for that.
How do you know about that?
That recipe is forbidden.
[Scoffs] Forbidden, is it?
Oh.
Well, that's too bad.
Well, then it's a good thing I have it written down.
See?
- [Gasps]
- Do you want it?
Do you?
Take it.
Oh.
Oh, you can't.
You're tied to a chair.
Oh, too bad!
Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's right, Abigail.
I have everything but the secret ingredient,
- and you're going to give it to me.
- What?
You think I'm just gonna bake one up for you?
Not gonna happen.
You won't?
All right.
I guess I'll just have to cook up something else.
- ["H.R. Pufnstuff" plays]
- Ooh.
Sorry.

- She's getting us ready for the baking!

Ooh!
Wolf, thanks for taking such good care of my granny.
Yeah, my finest hour.
I'm shopping the movie rights.
But maybe if you'd been around to look after the old girl yourself,
- I wouldn't have had to.
- If I...
I was training.
- While you've been playing kung fu...
- You know that thing you do...
- [argument continues]
- Awkward.
Red, it's good to see you.
There's been a rash of robberies.
The stolen items are from that list of Super Truffle ingredients you sent us.
- So the witch has been shopping?
- We think so.
A surveillance camera caught the latest incident.
Blue, pull up the Muffet footage.
- [Spider growls] - [Wolf] Whoa!
Did you see the size of that mushroom?
We're gonna need to hit the streets, find out who's hiring the muscle.
Indeed.
We think many of the suspects are associates of a shady operator known as The Giant.
He's a reputed smuggler, a juggler, a robber, a cobbler, a picker, a grinner, a restaurateur, and blogs about animated films.
- He should get a life.
- Indeed.
He runs the Beanstalk Club in Big City.
I want the two of you to check it out.
- What?
Are you kidding?
- Me and her?
Whoa!
Hop back here a second, Flippers.
You mean the both of us?
Granny never needed a partner, and I don't either.
I guess she's right about that, maybe.
Red, you're not going anywhere without backup.
And you, you need to shuffle your wild-card antics to the bottom of the deck.
No more stunts, no more cheap disguises.
You two are partners.
Get used to it.
All right, road trip!

Hey, it's Kirk.

No.

Maybe I could tell you something about Goldilocks.

- OK, OK already.

Oh, you mean the witch that took your granny.
When she said she wanted to take out old beehive,
I said, "Now, there's something we've got in common."
She did mention something about outwitting some incompetent, stupid, meddling, jerkfaced HEA agents!
I assumed she was talking about you two.

- Watch me.
- Ow!
No!
Not the ears!
You didn't even say the magic word.
- Abracadabra.
- Ow!
That's not even...
Well, actually, that is the magic word.
I don't know where Granny is.
The witch sends me notes, and I put the word out.
- Tell me where they are.
- Ow.
Ow.
You're still mad about me trying to kill you all those times, aren't you?
- Hey, books!
- Hey, no, wait!
Don't read that!
Nobody reads books anymore.
Movies are always better.
Especially sequels.
How does the witch get messages into your books?
Why don't you ask her?
She was just here.

Come on, hurry!

I'm doing my best here.
Yeah, well, your best got my granny and two innocent kids kidnapped!
OK, fine!
You're right!
It did.
This is all my fault.
My screw-ups are putting everyone in danger.
I'll probably get you nabbed next.

Rolling now!
That's not what I meant.
You've made your point, Red.
This partnership's a disaster.
I better leave before I do any more damage.
I've always been a lone wolf.

He's my ride.

How is the truffle coming, Abigail?
I can't work with such inferior equipment.
This mixing machine is ten years old, and the measuring cups are cracked.
I need exact measurements!
I can't work miracles with this stuff!
You should try, Abigail, or those little bratwursts will be on the menu tonight!
Your Tibetan cocoa sticks.
These did not come easy.
The Happily Ever After Agency is everywhere!
Only three?
I need four.
- Four?
!
- I can't make it without four sticks.
I have lost two Sherpas in those mountains already.
Do you know how much a Sherpa costs?
They've got a union.
I've gotta pay for goats.
I've gotta pay for the little hats.
There's per diem.
You want this done right, or don't you?
You bring me a decent flour sifter and some real measuring cups, then I might be able to remember the final ingredient.
Fine!
But you better get cooking, Abigail.
[Muttering] Four cocoa sticks.
Just take two cocoa sticks and break 'em in half!
[Slams door]
Oh, don't you worry.
I'll get cooking all right.
[Chuckling]
Boo-yah!
Still got it.

- How did you get out?
- I've got my ways, little one.
Come on, we gotta get you two out of here.
The exit is there.
We saw the witch go through that way.
Show me.
But we gotta be quiet.
The exit is straight ahead.
Don't be suspicious.
Continue moving.
[Clanging]
- What?
What is this?
- It's a big cage, dum-dum.
- Huh?
What's she doing here?
- [Hansel] You tell us.
I thought you said she was locked up tight.
- She was!
She just needed more...
- More tools to do the escaping with?
You mean all this time, you two were never?
In danger?
No!
We're not even kidnapped!
- We're the kidnappers!
- Ja!
You've been hoodwinked!
- Too!
Ja, Hansel!
- Ja, Gretel!

We're...

You two are the nastiest children I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.
Don't blame us.
It is society's fault.

But now we will have the greatest dessert of all time, to make us unstoppable!

You want to look spooky or not?
- And turn your eyes back on.
- Oh.
Oh, right.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Very scary.
Now, can you keep her locked up this time?
- Yes!
- And remember, we are in charge, Verushka.
Verushka?
Verushka Von Vine?
You finally remember me.
How nice!
Perhaps you also remember this.
Is that what this is about?
It all started when we were Sisters together in the Sisterhood.
You were always so good at everything.
I tried so hard to beat you, but you were always better than me.
Then came that terrible day of the ancient recipe ritual, when the...
[Granny] Why are you telling me this?
I was there.
[Verushka] Abigail!
This is my big, super-evil-villain moment!
- So will you just shut up?
!
- [Granny] OK, OK.
[Verushka] Now, where was I?
Started at the Sisterhood, always number two...
Did I get to the part about the truffle?
- [Granny sighs] Yes.
- I couldn't make that stinking truffle!
But you did!
And I knew then that you were the reason I was a big pile of number two!
So I stole the great recipe, and I spent the last 60 years searching for the secret ingredient!
[Granny] You really practiced this speech?
[Verushka] But then Hansel and Gretel found me.
Together we devised a plan to kidnap you and complete the truffle recipe.
My attempts to find the secret ingredient were all failures!
Sure, I did produce a few other things.
A poison apple, a sleeping spell, a way to turn men into frogs.
She's completely insane.
You should see what she's done to the cat.
Oh, that's disturbing on so many levels.
You don't have to be like this, Verushka.
I'll never play second fiddle to you again, Abigail.
I've been number two long enough.
Once I finally have the Super Truffle,
I will taste the sweet, chocolaty victory of being number one!
[Cackling]
OK, all I need to do is find this D.C.T. Place.
How hard could that be?
[Sighing] Muffins!

I'll never find it.

[Male] Hey!
Hoodie in the hood!
Got a dollar?
What?
Who?
Hey, down here.
It's better to give than to receive.
So give me a dollar and you'll feel better.
- No.
I'm just looking for...
- Looking?
A quest?
I love...
Ooh.
You work out?
You are looking for the big golden...
No, wait.
The magic.
You're looking for the magic...
OK, I got nothing.
What's on your mind?
My granny!
She's out there somewhere, and I'm totally out of clues.
[Sniffing] Perhaps she's been turned into stone.
What?
Turned to...
How do you even come up with that?
Who says that?
- You get what you pay for.
- All I've got is this stupid tag.
- "D.C.T." You tried Dental Clown Tech?
- Yes!
I've tried everywhere.
Yeah, yeah, it's tough.
Wait a second.
Wait a second!
- Dark Castle Towers!
- Dark Castle?
My brothers and I used to live there.
Then there was this whole thing with the farmer's wife and a clock.
- Can you show me?
- Sure.
Follow me. [grunts]
I thought I told you to stay off my corner.
The journey there is long and full of dangers.
[Mouse] Oh, no, there it is.
My bad.
[Keypad beeping]
- Nicky, it's Red.
- [Nicky] Red!
- Good to hear from you.
- I need...
That is...
- Is Wolf there?
- No, we haven't heard from him.
Why?
- What's the trouble?
- Dark Castle Towers, that's what.
It's an old hotel on South Castle Street.
I'm sure Granny and the kids are in there.
- But it's really heavily guarded.
- And you need help to get them out?
No, no!
I've totally got it.
No problemo.
- I just thought...
- I'll alert the squad leaders.
We'll have a full rescue team there immediately.
- Give me as many details as you can.
- [Sighs] OK.
[Verushka] Oh, no!
What are we gonna do?
The whole HEA is going to be at our front door, and our back door, and our windows!
We're practically crawling with windows!
I think some of the windows even have little doors...
Stop!
Chill out.
Ja, ja.
Chill a pill and then take one.
We have always known that the Happily Ever After Agency would be a threat.
- Our forces are already in place.
- Lesson four:
Eliminate your obstacles.
- Eliminate?
But what do you mean?
- [Feedback whines]
[Echoing] Send in the pigs!
Good work, Red.
That's the break we were looking for.
- What?
- Nicky?
Is everything all right?
Uh, I'm not sure.
Stand by.
- [Nicky] Ops, status report.
- Sir, we are being attacked!
- [Alarm blaring]
- Nicky, what is it?
What's going on?
- Red, we've got trouble.
- [Banging at door]
Get all the sheep first!
- [Whimpering] Take the frog!
- Red, save Granny!
Stop them from getting the Super Truffle!
You're on your own!
Nicky, are you OK?
Hello?
!
Nick!
- [Nicky] Filthy swine!
- [Tones play]
[Electronic voice] We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed.
[Female on TV] Up next, carnivores who abandon their partners when they really need them.
Cowards or complete dirtbags?
[Male on TV] Now, that's where I disagree with you, Tony.
Wolves are just plain untrustworthy.
Isn't that right, Mr. Pig?
[Pig squeals]
[Male 2 on TV] Coming up next, Shark Week.
Because as bad as sharks are, they're still not wolves.
- [Man 1] He's dead, Jim.
- [Man 2] But how the?
[Man 1] Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a doc...
All right.
Well, I'd say he was abandoned by an unreliable partner, just when he needed one most.
[Soft rock playing nearby]
Hey, Twitch.
I know this whole mess with Red is probably bugging you.
You wanna talk about it?
- Um...
Hello?
- [Music grows louder]
Wolf!
Hey!
Good to see you!
Wait a minute.
OK, guys.
See you later.
Thanks for stopping by.
Come on in!
Nice place you got here.
Smaller.
That's good, saves you money so you can get a good stereo.
I'd buy one, you know, but my trailer's bigger. [sighs]
[♪ Dan Myers: "Little Squirrel (Forage For Your Love)"]
You know, Twitchy, I...
Oh, boy.
I've been thinking.
Could you turn the music down for a second?
- [Music stops]
- I been thinking about Granny and Red.
And I was wondering, did I do the right thing?
Wolf, I have been waiting for you to say that!
You gotta get back in the game!
The HEA needs you!
You got mad skills!
Red needs you!
Nah, she doesn't need me.
Doesn't need you?
Doesn't need you?
!
Red is out there looking for her granny all alone, and she needs your help, even if she won't admit it.
You are dropping some hard science on me.
Word.
[Horn tooting melody]
[Backfires]
Hey, Wolf!
It's the Three Little Pigs, man.
- Remember us?
- Yeah!
We're here to huff and puff and blow your house up!
[Pigs] Sooie!
- [Pig 1] He went up in smoke.
- [Pig 2] Look at the colors.
Too bad for the big barbecued wolf his life didn't have more meaning.
What do you mean by that, pork pie?
It did have meaning.
- Who...
...said that?
- Wait, is it a bad sign
- I used the past tense?
- Help me!
- We blew up the wrong house again.
- His every breath mocks us.
That's not good.
A little faster, Twitchy.
- [Clicking]
- Huh?
- Hey, is it busted?
- No, no, no!
It can't be broken!
- We just used it.
- This is why everybody hires
- the Three Bears.
- No, wait, wait!
This is it.
- See?
- Hey, wait!
Where'd they go?
- [Beeping]
- Look, they're trying to get away.
Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!
[grunting]
- Oh, muffins.
- [Engine starting]
Double muffins.
- How did you make them so mad?
- It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.
- One wolf en fuego, coming up.
- Look out!
- This little wolfie went to pieces!
- [Yelling]
- You missed again.
- Will you stop swerving?
It's ruining my aim!
Can't help it.
I can't see the road, man.
That loco lobo is liquidated.
They're gaining on us.
Whoa!
- Say hello to my little friend.

Is anyone here?
Boys, thank goodness you're all right.
- Mr. Flippers!
You OK?
- I've been better.
- But I'm still hopping.
- Wow, Nick, what happened?
They hit this place with everything they had.
We never had a chance.
- What happened to you boys?
- It's was pigs, Mr. Flippers!
It was pigs with knives and guns and rockets... [mimics gunfire]
[Squealing, mimics fighting noises]
Running and running!
The special effects were spectacular!
I've never really gotten along with pigs, but we survived, by our wits.
[Both yelling]
[Grunting, yelling]
[Both yelling]
[Pigs] Sooie!
Don't mess with the killer P's!
That handsome wolf sure had it coming.
Let's say we go strap on the feedbag, boys.
- I'm gonna tweet this.
- What's a tweet, man?
Disguises.
They not only work, they save lives.
But this...
One witch couldn't have done all this.
No, she's not working alone.
Every agent we have has been roughed up, kidnapped, scared off or mailed to an uncharted island.
I'm afraid the agency is all but defeated.
What about Red?
Is she OK?
No one's heard from her.
I hate to assume the worst, but...
I never thought I'd say this, Wolf.
I think a wild card is the only thing that can save us now.
You guys didn't really catch me.
I just slipped.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, it still counts, man.
- You bet it does!
Come on, guys, let's take her up to the überjefes and we'll get rewards and promotions and health care and maybe even cookies.
Beards for sale.
Fake beards.
Hey, Porky, how about a demo?
Hey, hey, hey!
We don't like trespassers around here, fuzzy.
But this is a very nice fake beard.
Hey, guys!
You oughta see this!

Ow!

- Thanks.
- You, too.
Ha-ha!
- Squirrel power!
- [Alarm ringing]
I think we've overstayed our welcome.
Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, man.
You don't even really sell beards, do you?
What do you mean you had her, then she got away?
Disguises?
Big fake beards?
Oh, well.
That's very understandable.
I...
I'm not angry.
I...
I promise I am not angry.
What?
Yes, you may have a cookie.
Little Miss Reddy Two-Shoes got away.
That wolf is helping her again.
How's the truffle coming?
- Make the truffle.
- No.
- Make the truffle!
- Uh-uh.
- You better!
- You didn't say "please."
[Groaning]
- Please make the truffle.
- Nope.
- You were always like that, Abigail.
- No, I wasn't.
- [Verushka] Yes, you were!
- [Granny] Was not.
- [Verushka] Were, too.
- Not well.
Well, we better do something quick.
Red and the Wolf will be here any moment.
Ja, maybe that is exactly what we need.
[Laughing evilly]
[Chuckling]
[Both laughing evilly]
[Hansel] I don't know why we are laughing.
[Evil laughter resumes]
- You came back.
- Well, I just figured, you obviously don't know how to talk your way into anyplace.
Obviously.
- So Granny's up there somewhere?
- Yeah.
- It's locked down pretty tight.
- So how do we play this?
We're gonna need some muscle to get in there.
- I think I know where to get it.
- [Audience cheering]
Thank you, thank you.
I love you all.

That is nice.
Now I got to go in now.
Bye.

Oh, my friends, it's so good to see you!
- It has been too long.
- No, it's been about right.
Did you catch the show tonight?
I was on fire!
The Yodelers have been so good to me.
- Dutch balls?
- We need your help.
We need your courage, we need your muscle...
We need my Yodelers.
[All] Huh?
[Kirk] Before they delighted the world with song, the Happy Yodelers were highly trained mercenaries.

Helmut, demolitions expert.
Heidi, security systems and technology.

- [Chuckles] We got us a rodent problem.
- He's not wearing any pants.
- Anyone here need an exterminator?
- We're professional exterminators.
Yep, they're probably in the walls by now.
- That's a Pantless Norwegian Stink Rat.

Thank goodness and gracious you have come to save us!
- Like angels from heaven!
- Where's the old lady?
In the room at the end of the hallway.
The witch is always shouting at her!
It is so scary here!
If I stay another minute, I may scream!
Scream, I tell you!
Wait.
You two get the kids out of here, I'll find Granny.
- You sure?
- I'd rather know they're safe.
I'll be fine.
We'll rendezvous downstairs.
- Come on, kids.
Let's roll.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Wolf!
- I count my lucky stars for you!
- [Elevator bell dings]
I hope you kids learned a valuable lesson.
Never run away from home, never eat a cookie house.
- Never talk to strangers.
- That's right.
Never talk to strangers.
People are never what they seem to be.
Oh, sure, safety first.
Always carry little gas masks, because you never know.
[Twitchy sniffing] What's that smell?
Perhaps the children are nervous and need to release a little tension.
That's natural.
- Man, that is strong.
- Wow.
[Sniffing] That actually smells like gingerbread.
[Lisping] You kids feel dizzy?
My tongue is getting all puffy and I see rainbows.
Is that normal?
- [Chuckles weakly] - [Body thuds]
[Door creaking]
[Whispers] Granny?
[Sister's voice echoing] The final ingredient is never written down.
When you're a true Sister of the Hood, you just know.
[Male voice echoes] Luke, trust the Force.
What?
[Male] Oh, sorry about that.
Wrong hero quest.
Oh.
Macadamia nuts.
[Verushka cackling maniacally]
Now we know!
- Ja, Hansel.
- Ja, Gretel.
[Both chanting] We're evil, we're evil.
Verushka!
Be a dear and fetch us a bag of... macadamia nuts.
[Cackling]
No!
Granny, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
The Super Truffle will now be complete!
[Cackling]
[Laughing]
Behold the Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!
[Thunder crashing]
Granny, I'm sorry.
I really messed up.
Don't be silly, dear.
I'm proud of you.
You knew what that recipe needed.
Only a true Sister would know that.
No, I mean... [sighs]
I shouldn't have tried to do everything myself.
Now the HEA is gone, and they've got the truffle, and I didn't even rescue you.
I was just so worried about proving I could live up to your example.
I'm sorry.
I let you down.
Why, because things are a little tough right now?
Gooseberries, child.
I've been in much worse situations than this.
You can still turn this around.
A person can never really fail unless they give up.
You fell for our trickery like a fish falls for water.
What have you done with Wolf and Twitchy?
[Cheery elevator music plays]
Hey, Twitchy, look over there.
- Help me get over there.
- Yeah!
OK!
[Both grunting]
- Must... gently... hit... buttons!
- [Twitchy grunting]
- Almost got it.
Come on, little buddy.
- No, no, no!
[squeaks]
Muffins.
We can't let them leave with those.
I'm sorry, but we have orders to fill for every villain in the world.
Ja, the brochure went out weeks ago.
The truffle's power is, sadly, temporary.
So they will just want more and more.
- And we will become the filthy rich!
- The filthy rich!
- Not if we stop you first.
- Well, of course not.
That is obvious.
If you were to stop us...
Wait a minute.
You wish!
- One for the road, Brother?
- What a delicious idea.
[Both chuckling]
No!
You can't handle the power!
Uh-oh.
I feel the power!
[Laughing maniacally]
All powerful!
I have the strength of a thousand small boys!
You'll have to be excusing.
We have a world to dominate.
- Ja, no time for the dilly-dally.
- This isn't over.
[Laughing]
Giant superpowered German kids.
Did not see that coming.
- The truffle!
It's finally mine!
- Ja, I don't think so.
Hey!
I'm your partner.
We planned this whole thing together.
Oh, did we?
The way I remember it, Brother, it was you, me and a napkin.
Legal documentation?
Yes.
I don't remember signing anything.
Do you, Brother?
- No, no, no.
I don't.
- It's not legal.
- [Gretel] We did not sign anything.
- [Hansel] Oh, look at the face.
You have outlived your usefulness, old woman.
But do not worry.
We will leave a pet for you to do the playing with.
[Gretel cackling]
- What pet?
- You can't do this to me!
Talk to the spider, 'cause the kid ain't listening.
No!
Wait!
Come back!
Spider?
Did he say spider?
[Creature growls]
Now would be a good time to untie us, Verushka.
I got my own problems, Abigail.

With the power of the Super Truffle, no one will be able to stop them.
This is all my fault.
If I'd been more like you, they wouldn't have gotten away.
You don't need to be like anyone, Red.
You're the real deal.

- Thanks!
- Hey, never leave your wingman.
- Come back here!

Sorry!

- We're clear.
You can stop swerving.
- I'm trying.
This thing isn't easy to steer, you know.

That was sweet!
Let's do it again!
Maybe later.
Come on!

- Uh-oh.
- Olly, oily, oxen free!
- One for the truffle.
- Two because we are so very evil.
Three because I also agree we are evil.
- Four to go!
- To go!
[All yelling]
Oh, man.
I thought we were goners for sure.
[Gasping]
Wolf, calm down.
We're gonna be OK.
We just need to walk towards each other.
But we've gotta time it very carefully.
[All yelling]
- Wolf, throw me your beard!
- This is no time for a disguise!
Just do it.
Now.
Wolf, have I ever told you how much I love your disguises?
Ha.
Sorry, my bad.
Listen, I wanna take a moment to apologize for not being there when you needed me.
No, no, no!
It's OK, Wolf!
It's OK!
No, no, no.
Let me do this.
Granny, thanks to my sloppy work, you got kidnapped.
I'm sorry.
OK.
I forgive you.
Twitchy, I've been using your toothpaste.
I haven't bought a tube of toothpaste in probably four years.
Toothpaste?
!
After all we've been through?
!
You have to tell her how you feel right now!
She needs to hear it!
Not now, Twitchy!
Hang on.
Red, I walked away because I thought you didn't want me around.
I'm sorry.
Wolf, I never could have done any of this without you.
I should have listened to you more, Red,
- instead of doing things my way.
- I kind of like your way.
Sometimes, the right disguise can get you out of a tough jam.
So can the right partner.
Now, that's a good recipe.
- Gum?
- Why not?
[All yelling]
- I thought you said we'd be OK!
- I exaggerated!
My life just flashed before my eyes.
It's weird, flashback really does add ten pounds.
What stopped us?
Verushka.
Turns out Bitsy here wasn't so bad after all.
- Just needed a friend.
- [Grunts happily]

- Last chance, kids.
Drop the truffles and surrender.
Surrender?
We don't do the surrender.
We are unstoppable!
- Bring it.
- [Yelling]
[Grunting]
- We're kicking it old-school!
- Alley-oop, Abigail!
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
- Hey!
Stop that!
- You are making us angry!
Hey, tubby!
Over here!
OK, Twitchy, let them have it.
[Rapid squeaking]
- Stop with the shoving!
- Alley-oop!
- Red, coming at you!
- I got it, Granny!
- Go, Red!
Go!
- You cannot be defeating us!
Go ahead, run away like a little girl!
What did you call me?
No, Red!
Keep going!
- [Both] Hm.
- Ja, you just keep the running away.
Like a scared little girl.
[Yelling]
[Grunting]
- Red?
- [Gasps]
Are you OK, honey?
[Whispers] Granny...
I'm sorry.
[Chuckles] We did the tricking of you, you silly little girl.
That's just really great!
Now they can get away.
Or worse, they could figure out that if they eat more truffles, they would become completely unstoppable.
- Really?
- Wolf!
Did I say that out loud?
What have you done?
We'll never stop them now.
- Don't worry, Nicky.
- All part of the plan.
- Plan?
What plan?
- Relax, we got this covered.
Watch and learn.
[Both grunting]
[Yelling]
[Laughing]
We are all powerful!
Wait for it.
Brother, what is happening?
See, kids, you shouldn't overdo sweets.
Those Super Truffles are also super high in fat and calories.
I'm stuck.
[Both] Oh, schnitzel.
- My word.
- See, Nicky, one truffle makes you super, but a whole batch, and you're as helpless as a beach ball.
Those two won't give us any more trouble.
Does this street make my butt look fat?
You know, a lesser wolf would say they finally got their just desserts.
- But not you.
- No, not me.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to a treadmill.
If you do not have a treadmill, one will be provided for you.
- You have the right to broccoli.
- Not broccoli!
Nice work, agents.
With a little rehabilitation and a lot of exercise, we may still be able to show those kids the way home.
Granny, I'll need you to get me in touch with the Sisters of the Hood.
We've got agents to round up and an agency to rebuild.
- I think we could use their help.
- The Sisters are always ready.
Aren't we, Verushka?
Especially with everything back where it should be.
[Female on radio] Calling all agents.
A 714 in progress.
Reports of 10,000 mice chasing a suspect.
See the man with the flute.
What the heck?
It's on the way.
- Ooh!
I'm driving!
- Says who?
- Go get 'em, agents.
- That's my girl.
Hey, on the way, we should stop for some disguises.
Yeah, I know just the place.
So you sticking around a while or going back to finish your training?
- Nah, I'm good here.
- Another happy ending.
- [Wolf] Let's roll, partner.
- [Red] Anything you say, partner.
[Screams]
[♪ Lavay Cole, Andrea Remanda:
"You Know lt"]
[Wolf] You know, Twitchy, I...
Could you turn the music down for a second?
[Twitchy] Uh...
No.
[♪ Hayden Panettiere: "Inseparable"]
- [Gretel] Ja, Hansel.
- [Hansel] Ja, Gretel.
[Both chanting] We're evil, we're...
something else that rhymes with evil.
[♪ Dan Myers: "Little Squirrel (Forage For Your Love)"]
[Twitchy] That was sweet!
Let's do it again!
[Red] Maybe later.
[♪ CEEJ: "Perfect Two"]
[Twitchy] Hey, girls.
Let's call it a night.
[Male] Once upon a time, there were four unlikely heroes.
Red Riding Hood, her granny, the not so Big Bad Wolf, and an over-caffeinated squirrel called Twitchy.
Together, they defeated the evil plans of a very bad little bunny, and came to work for me.
My name is Nicky, and I run the Happily Ever After Agency, an organization dedicated to making happy endings for everyone.
As we say in the HEA, "It's not just a fairy tale, it's an adventure."
Recently, Red took a leave of absence to train at a secret location with the legendary Sisters of the Hood.
This left the team in a bit of disarray, just as we were about to meet a terrible threat, not only to the HEA, but to happy endings everywhere.
It started one night when we received an anonymous tip that two children were being held in a gingerbread house by a witch with a wicked appetite.
[Cackling]
[Female over radio] Alpha Leader, witch sighted in window.
[Male over radio] Which window?
- [Female] Affirmative.
- [Male] What?
Rescue Team Alpha, stand by for go order.
[Female 1] Agent Fuzzy moving into position.
[Male] Nick Knack, take point.
[Female 2] Paddy Whack, cover the rear.
[Male] Suspect is enchanted and extremely dangerous.
- [Female 1] Roger.
- [Male] Who's Roger?
[Quietly] Alpha Leader here, confirmed Mother Goose.
Rescue Team standing by.
[Wolf] Looks like Red's a no-show.
Again.
Wolf, we talked about this.
Red's on assignment.
And I'm supposed to be at the DMV, but I showed up.
Look, dog, I know you miss her.
We all do.
But those poor kids are going to become baked goods any minute now.
I need you to concentrate on what's going on here.
Yo, Froggy, what's the story on Red Riding Rogue?
Wolf, she is training secretly.
- [Wolf] What kind of secret training?
- Not now.
OK, OK.
You wanna reassign Red, it's your agency.
- Thank you.
- So we all agree
- that I don't need any secret training.
- Wolf!
- My talent comes naturally.
- [Groans]
[Nicky] Wolf!
Get off the channel!
[Witch cackling]
[Shaker rattling]
[Yelling]
Those kids don't have much time.
Don't sweat it, Granny Dynamite.
With Red gone, I need to step up.
- So I called out the big guns.
- What?
This is not good!
We might have a problem here, sir!
Put it on the screen.
[Rapid beeping]
No!
They wouldn't!
Alpha Team, we've got something small and fast, scurrying up the side of the house.
Roger, Goose, I'll get a gander.
[Speaking rapidly] On the job.
Love my job.
Good job.
It's not just a job, it's an adventure.
Hey, Granny, how you doing?
Bye-bye!
- What are you two up to?
- You like recipes, don't you?
Try this.
A cup of hot wolf, a pinch of screwy squirrel and a dash of disguise.
Rescue pie.
My own recipe.
- Wolf, no!
- Thank me later!
That's not a rope.
Not rope, not rope.
Not rope, not rope.
Not rope!
[Laughs] Rope!
Twitchy, what do you think you're doing up there?
The wolf's plan.
I'll slip through the chimney.
She'll never see me coming.
- [Speaking rapidly] It's a great job...
- What is he saying?
Translate that.
[Computerized male voice] I have an advantageous position from which to breach our suspect's gingerbread home.
Uh-oh.
I think the fan is about to be hit with the doody.
I'm going in!
Right now!
[Computerized voice] I am going in.
Negative.
Do not proceed.
Do not proceed.
- Now, listen to me, Twitchy...
- [radio static hisses]
Mammals!
[Rope zipping]
- [Evil laughter] - [Male, German accent] Oh, please!
We did not mean to trespass into your delicious cookie house!
[Female, German accent] Ja, we were only searching for goodies for this... [witch] Silence!
[Hisses]
[Grunts]
- [Witch breathing heavily] - [Whimpering]
- [Doorbell rings] - [Witch growls]
[Coughs]
Building inspector.
You know, it's against housing codes to live in any dessert bigger than a cupcake.
- [Coughing]
- I need to see your permits and a list of ingredients.
That better not be custard.
Don't worry, kids!
I'm here to rescue you!
Yeah, me, I got the good guys!
- They're all hiding outside.
- Little squirrel, I am Hansel.
Ja, and I am Gretel.
You must hurry.
The witch will soon return.
- [Hansel] She'll eat us all for supper!
- She says chicken tastes like children!
[Both] Ja!
OK, OK, I'm on the case.
- [Growling] - [Twitchy squealing]
He's in trouble!
Move in!
Move in!
Come on, you goldbricks!
You wanna live forever?
- [Puffing] - [Sirens wailing]
- Get the door!
- Just get more puffs!
I think it's weakening.
[Yelling]
Agents, take a bite out of crime.
Wolf, this entire operation is a shambles.
I know, but I can fix it.
[Witch cackling]
- She got the kids!
- You're alive!
- Now, we'll never catch up with her.
- [Engine revving]
- Sweet ride!
- Boys?
[Witch] Sorry, goodies, but this is a dinner flight.
Help us!
She has flavorful marinades!
- Oh, no, you didn't!
- [Revving]
- Come on, Twitch.
- [Squealing]
- [Granny] Buckle up, homies.
It's on!
- No, wait!
Don't just...
Get some backup in the air, now!
[Witch cackling]
Whoa!
Ten and two, Granny!
I'm regretting that burrito.
[Gretel] Help us!
She has put us in little cages!
It is dehumanizing!
- [Hansel] We are like delicious veal!
- You'll never save them!
- Tree in the way!
- Oh, put on your man pants, Wolfie.
- Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray...
- Whoo-hoo!
[Engine revving]
Can we go back for my stomach?
It's pink, shaped like a football.
- Has my lunch in it.
- Oh, knuckle up, dog.
Mother Goose to base.
Mother Goose to base.
We are in pursuit of witch.
Stand by.
- Better catch me, I'm getting peckish.
- That witch is whack.
Wolf, you think you can handle a bike like this?
Sure, I think I could if I had to.
I went through my bad boy phase.
Road a bike, greased my hair back, lived over Richie Cunningham's garage, water-skied over a shark tank.
Those were some happy days.
Great, 'cause she's all yours, dog.
- [Yells]
- Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
- Hi, Granny.
- Hey, young kids.
I've gotcha.
- No!
I've got you!
- [Gasps]
[Witch cackling]
[Grunting]
No worries, Twitch.
Dog is your co-pilot.

No, no, bad idea!

Be seeing you, little buddy.
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
[grunts]
[Yelps]
OK, I can taste my own butt.
Saw that coming. [screeching]
Oh, look!
Your doggie's trying to save you!
Don't worry, Granny, I got ya!
- No, Wolf, don't!
It's a trap!
- I got ya, I got ya.
- Oh!
OK, I don't got ya.
- We need help.
Get Red!
- She'll know what to do!
- Hey, I'm handling this rescue!
- Everything's under control!
- You can't do it alone!
- Hey!
I'm alive!
- [Wolf grunts]
[Witch cackling]
- You almost saved her.
- I got served.
This whole thing is my fault.
None of this would have happened if...
- If Red were here?
- Well, she's not here, is she?

- [Rumbling] - [Gasps]
[Growling]
[Growling]
Uh...
Hi.
[Lisping] So you think you can deliver that basket of goodies across my bridge, do you?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, no, no!
You did not just say that.
I did not hear that!
There ain't no way my bridge is being crossed by some muffin-delivering, red-hood-wearing, fairy-tale-cliché, little girl.
- Get up outta here!
- [Grunts]
- Bring it.
- [Laughing]
[Grunts, yelling]
I'm about to get you!
- Oh!
- [Growls]
Hey!
Oh!
- No, no, no!
- [Troll] See?
I told you!
I win again.
It's 'cause I'm so evil.
Mm!
I even taste evil.
Ooh!
I taste just like chicken.
Chicken and evil!
I'm gonna do my little evil chicken dance.
- [Red grunts]
- Huh?
Hello!
Is the fight over?
Did you mean to jump off the bridge?
Huh?
Bye-bye.
Ooh!
That's cheating!
That is so cheating!
You running 'cause you know you can't beat me!
Your granny never would've run away like a scared little chicken girl!
- What did you just say?
- You heard me.
I said your granny would be ashamed of you, 'cause you running like a teeny, tiny, helpless, little girl!
- [Yelling]
- Oh, muffins.
- [Grunting]
- Oh!
Ow!
- Take that!
And that!
- Was it something I said?
Ooh!
That's my corn!
Aah!
[Troll] I kinda like that.
[Woman] Enough!
[Troll] Check, please.
The test is over.
The delivery is incomplete.
I win again!
I am the greatest!
I'm the prettiest ballerina in the whole fruit cup!
Yes, Senator, that is my monkey.
His name is Rumpelstiltskin, but it's a secret.
Don't tell him I told you.
I'm coming to the light, Mama.
[Voices chanting indistinctly, echoing]
Show me the Seven-Layer Kick.
[Grunting]
Show me the Spatula!
[Yelps]
Show me the Flying Rolling Pin!
[Shrieks]
Red, I know you came with much to prove, but your task was to deliver the basket.
You heard what he said about my granny!
Moss used your desire to please Abigail as just a test.
A Sister finds her own path, her true inner power.
Besides, honey, we're starting to run low on combat instructors.
Oh, come on.
Really!
I barely touched him.
Why, fidlee dee, Mr. Butler.
What brings you to Tara?
- I like Tootsie Rolls.
- [Chuckles nervously] He'll be fine.
- ["Kung Fu Fighting" ringtone plays]
- Hm...
Sorry, I should take this.
- Hello?
- Red?
It's Nicky.
Nicky?
What is it?
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
It's about your grandmother.
[Red] Why would anyone want to kidnap my granny?
Red, at the end of every Sister's training, she faces the ancient trial by truffle, in which the student attempts to recreate the Sisterhood's most powerful culinary confection.
For over a thousand years that recipe has been our secret, its making understood only by the best of us.
What has that got to do with Granny?
Very few Sisters complete the truffle, one of them was your grandmother, Abigail Puckett.
[Clanking]
The power of this goodie is so great, it must be ever kept from those who would misuse it.
Like those wannabes at the Food Network.
[Sister] Holla!
Rachael Ray's the devil.
This is where you keep all the recipes?
No, just the one.
The Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!
But around the kitchen, honey, we just call it the Super Truffle!
Cool!
What makes it so super?
Anyone who eats it becomes unstoppable, in strength and thought and speed.
- Sounds good.
- Too good!
So... how did you make the recipe invisible?
- Oh, muffins.
- [Sisters shrieking]
[Sister] Battle stations!
Man your posts!
Sound the alarm!
Secure the gates!
Somebody get me my rolling pin!
[Shrieks]
We must hurry.
Whoever stole the recipe will be trying to complete the truffle.
We must find and stop them before they do.
Before they find the secret ingredient.
- Secret ingredient?
What is it?
- Well, it's...
Oh, no, you don't.
The final ingredient is never written down.
- Or even spoken.
- Then how does anyone know it?
When you're a true Sister of the Hood, you just know.
That must be why they kidnapped Abigail.
I've gotta find her.
Red, the task of saving your granny is yours alone.
But, child, I fear it may be more danger than you are ready for.
It doesn't matter.
She's my granny, I've gotta save her.
You have learned much.
The Sisterhood is in your blood.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
Right?
Red is still finding her true path.
- She is not ready.
- Yeah, I know.
- [Witch cackling] - [Thunder rumbling]
For a complete nut muffin, that witch sure ties a good knot.
- [Door creaking]
- Did somebody say "nut muffin"?
Sounds delicious.
My dinner was interrupted, and I could use a little snack.
- Comfypoo, Abigail?
- Have we met before?
Was it the '60s?
The '60s are kind of a blur.
What?
!
Why, no!
You'd remember meeting someone as evil as me!
Why, look at these glowing red eyes and big scary mask!
Your goodie friends won't find you here, Abigail.
So you might as well relax and stay for dinner.
- You want me to make you dinner?
- Oh, how nice of you to offer.
Let me see.
What am I in the mood for?
Day-old sushi?
Dutch balls?
Turducken?
I'm more in the mood for a chocolate truffle!
A truffle?
Sorry, never learned to make that.
Never?
Never studied with the Sisterhood of Kung Fu Bakers?
Never learned the secret ingredient to an ancient recipe so powerful it makes one invincible?
Darn!
I really had a taste for that.
How do you know about that?
That recipe is forbidden.
[Scoffs] Forbidden, is it?
Oh.
Well, that's too bad.
Well, then it's a good thing I have it written down.
See?
- [Gasps]
- Do you want it?
Do you?
Take it.
Oh.
Oh, you can't.
You're tied to a chair.
Oh, too bad!
Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's right, Abigail.
I have everything but the secret ingredient,
- and you're going to give it to me.
- What?
You think I'm just gonna bake one up for you?
Not gonna happen.
You won't?
All right.
I guess I'll just have to cook up something else.
- ["H.R. Pufnstuff" plays]
- Ooh.
Sorry.
I love that show.
- She's getting us ready for the baking!
- I'm too young to be a strudel!
So, Abigail, what's for dinner?
I'll need a titanium mixing bowl.
- [Thunder crashes] - [Witch cackling]
[Male over radio]... search for Granny Puckett, highest priority.
[Female] What is the status of Mother Hubbard's cupboard?
[Male] Someone update Granny's Facebook profile to "witchnapped."
[Male 2] Butcher and baker cleared.
We're questioning the candlestick maker.
I'm not saying they shouldn't work here, I'm just saying they're delicious.
Ooh!
Wolf, thanks for taking such good care of my granny.
Yeah, my finest hour.
I'm shopping the movie rights.
But maybe if you'd been around to look after the old girl yourself,
- I wouldn't have had to.
- If I...
I was training.
- While you've been playing kung fu...
- You know that thing you do...
- [argument continues]
- Awkward.
Red, it's good to see you.
There's been a rash of robberies.
The stolen items are from that list of Super Truffle ingredients you sent us.
- So the witch has been shopping?
- We think so.
A surveillance camera caught the latest incident.
Blue, pull up the Muffet footage.
- [Spider growls] - [Wolf] Whoa!
Did you see the size of that mushroom?
We're gonna need to hit the streets, find out who's hiring the muscle.
Indeed.
We think many of the suspects are associates of a shady operator known as The Giant.
He's a reputed smuggler, a juggler, a robber, a cobbler, a picker, a grinner, a restaurateur, and blogs about animated films.
- He should get a life.
- Indeed.
He runs the Beanstalk Club in Big City.
I want the two of you to check it out.
- What?
Are you kidding?
- Me and her?
Whoa!
Hop back here a second, Flippers.
You mean the both of us?
Granny never needed a partner, and I don't either.
I guess she's right about that, maybe.
Red, you're not going anywhere without backup.
And you, you need to shuffle your wild-card antics to the bottom of the deck.
No more stunts, no more cheap disguises.
You two are partners.
Get used to it.
All right, road trip!
[♪ Dan Myers: "Big City"]
- [Train whistling] - [Male] Hey, I'm driving here!
[Wolf] Big City is home to great shopping, dining, and two professional sports teams:
The Golden Geese of the National Enchantment League and what was formerly the Denver Nuggets.
- What are you doing?
- Reading about the big burg,
- in case we get a chance to sightsee.
- We're not here to sightsee.
- We're here to find Granny.
- Fine.
But you're missing out on a chance to visit the Old Mother Hubbard Museum.
Largest collection of empty cupboards in the world, which is weird.
- [Tires squealing] - [Crashing]
OK, let's get something straight.
We're doing this operation by the book, exactly the way Granny would, plain and simple.
- I just had a book.
- Wrong book.
- Hey, it was a good book.
- All right, look...
Looky, looky, over here!
Hey, it's Kirk.
He's really hit the big time.
We should catch the show.
No.
We are going to stay focused and follow procedure.
- They won't expect that.
- Look, you two, we are definitely not here to hang around in loud, sleazy nightclubs, listening to cheesy lounge singers.

- So, what's the plan, Hoodie?
- We talk to Jimmy 10-Strings.
He's one of Granny's regular informants.
If The Giant's behind the stolen ingredients, that harp will sing in more ways than one.
- We need to...
- Ply him with my lupine charisma?
- Gotcha.
I'm on it.
- Hold on!
I'll do the talking.
Granny told me how to handle guys like this.
The trick is not...
Huh?
- Wolf?
- Go, Wolfie!
Go, Wolfie!
Aah, stop that!
Will you two focus?
OK, OK!
Just trying to blend in with the crowd.
- Just stay here.
- This will end well.
I'll be at the bar.
Merci beaucoup, and my personal favorite, danke schön.
- Hey, Jimmy 10-Strings.
- Sweetheart, I do autographs
- after the show, OK?
- I work with Granny,
- and I need you to do me a favor.
- For Granny?
Anything!
I hear your boss has his goons stealing truffle ingredients.
What do you know?
What?
!
Well, I never.
I mean, who told you...
OK, listen up.
A couple of days ago, I overheard The Giant talking about a big order for someone called...
Uh-oh.
- I didn't tell her a thing.
- Get your hooves off me.
Tell the boss I told her nothing.
[Sighs]
I should sing something nice at her funeral.
- [Male] Tell 10-Strings
- Up there.
To limit his singing to exclusively musical vocalizations, or I shall be forced to tune his strings
- until they snap.
Capisce?
- Got it, boss.
You, with the red hanky on her head.
Are you trying to play my harp?
You could end up singing with the angels, playing my harp.
- Tell me about the witch.
- What witch?
Which witch?
- Huh.
Good one, boss.
- Did you just laugh at me?
Do I amuse you?
- Am I some sort of clown to you?
- No, I...
I hate my job.
- Who are you?
- I'm your worst nightmare.
A Sister with a badge.
And I'm onto you.
[Crowd gasping]
Excuse me.
Did I just hear your tiny, little voice correctly?
Did you just come into my house, hassle my harp, interrupt my dinner and tell me my hands are dirty?
!
I eat sandwiches bigger than you, little girl!
[Wolf] Did someone say sandwiches?
'Cause I'll take one.
And I'll bet you'll take five.
Hundred, that is!
'Cause you're a big boy.
I said big boy, son.
Who the Mother Goose is this supposed to be?
Phineas Newcastle McGee, wealthy business tycoon.
Didn't we meet at the big convention?

Wasn't that you?
You know, I just got back from ConCon, the big conman convention.
Funniest thing.

I'm not a dancer, I'm a singer.
Put me back!
What's the matter with you?
This kind of thing never happened to Dean!
- Well, this has been fun.
- Really, big, smelly, giant fun.
Hey, where you going?
Come on, come on!
The night's still young, right?
Sorry.
Love to stay, can't.
Gotta go.
Early start tomorrow.
Yeah, I got my Pilates workout, she's got a paper route.
- This is not how you steal a show!
- Hey!
Those skeevosos are trying to put the bag on my harp!
- Get after them!
- [Growling]
You got the wrong guy.
Frank Jr.'s down the street.
Did anybody notice that the guy I work for is an insane giant?
[Growling]
Put down the harp!
He's under contract!
[Whimpering]
Now you've done it.
He's mad!
We're dead.
- And I didn't even get my encore.
- Time to go!
And I still have 38 payments left on myself.
- Yee-haw!
- What am I paying you pasty mooks for?
Get after them!
- Hey, do you get paid?
- Not really.
No.
[Yelling]
- Start singing, 10-Strings.
- Is this your first time doing this?
'Cause Granny just slips me 20 bucks.
I'll show those pipsqueaks who's the big man around here!
Putting fingers on my property!
Like that Jack guy.
I'm still picking pieces of him out of my teeth!
I'll grind up their bones to make my pasta fazool!
Tell us who The Giant's getting ingredients for.
Yeah, well, you know The Giant is not usually very happy about those who spill his personal beans.
Maybe I could tell you something about Goldilocks.
That is not her natural hair color.
- Really?
- I knew it!
- Just tell us who ordered the thefts.
- OK, OK already.
I'll tell ya.
Every day The Giant gets a call for a new ingredient from from the Bunny.
- The Bunny?
- Not the Bunny!
Not the Bunny!
- [Jimmy] Yes, the Bunny.
He calls in the orders, and that's all I know.
If you wanna hear me sing anymore, you'll have to catch my show.
Fe-fi-fo-fum!
I gotcha now!
- Jump!
- Are you crazy?
We're a mile up.
- Don't argue!
Just jump!
- OK.
This is not how you treat an entertainer of my caliber. [yelling]
[Growling]
Hey, Twitchy, you didn't bring a parachute by any chance, did ya?
Uh...
No.
Gum?
No, thanks.
I'm trying to cut down.

Gotcha!
Oh, muffins.

- I think that went off pretty smooth.
- What was that disguise supposed to be?
- Fake beards are classic.
- You look like a deranged Santa Claus.
Santa gave me that beard.
[Á la Hannibal Lecter] Hello, Clarice.
- Who's Clarice?
- She is.
Hi, Clarice!
- Enjoy the book, Boingo.
- We share a love of literature.
So, Red, I see that stray dog is still following you around.
- [Growling]
- Don't let him mess with your head.
Let me guess.
You're the brains, and you're... not the brains?
Who's up for hasenpfeffer.
We know you've been working with The Giant.
Oh, really?
How?
I don't get out much.
- Talked to any witches lately?
- Which witch?
[chuckles]
Oh, you mean the witch that took your granny.
When she said she wanted to take out old beehive,
I said, "Now, there's something we've got in common."
She did mention something about outwitting some incompetent, stupid, meddling, jerkfaced HEA agents!
I assumed she was talking about you two.
- I wasn't there.
- No, of course you weren't.
Relax, Fido.
You've got Little Red Riding Hood to protect you now.
- I do OK on my own.
- Is that before or after
- I bail you out?
- You weren't doing a lot of bailing
- when I saved your cape at the bar!
- [Red] I had everything under control.
- Another minute and I would've...
- [Wolf] Have been páté!
- [Red] I don't need your help.
- [Wolf] Oh, really?
- Watch me.
- Ow!
No!
Not the ears!
You didn't even say the magic word.
- Abracadabra.
- Ow!
That's not even...
Well, actually, that is the magic word.
I don't know where Granny is.
The witch sends me notes, and I put the word out.
- Tell me where they are.
- Ow.
Ow.
You're still mad about me trying to kill you all those times, aren't you?
- Hey, books!
- Hey, no, wait!
Don't read that!
Nobody reads books anymore.
Movies are always better.
Especially sequels.
How does the witch get messages into your books?
Why don't you ask her?
She was just here.
[Gasps] The cleaning lady!
Come on, hurry!
- [Witch cackling]
- She can't have gotten far!
Oh, she was right under our noses!
[Echoing] Aah!
I'm blind!
No, wait.
A little help.
- See?
I said it before.
Disguises work.
- [Growls in frustration]
Would you stop it already!
If you hadn't distracted me in there, I would have...
- Oh, so this is my fault, too?
- Yeah, it is.
That's great, coming from someone who just took off to play Crouching Baker.
I stayed to do the job.
It's not like this is easy.
I'm doing my best here.
Yeah, well, your best got my granny and two innocent kids kidnapped!
OK, fine!
You're right!
It did.
This is all my fault.
My screw-ups are putting everyone in danger.
I'll probably get you nabbed next.
Happy?
[Echoing] A little help!
Rolling now!
That's not what I meant.
You've made your point, Red.
This partnership's a disaster.
I better leave before I do any more damage.
I've always been a lone wolf.
Tell Nicky I quit.
[Echoing] Sorry, Red.
He's my ride.
[Echoing] Do I sound weird?
I sound weird to me!
I sound weird to me!
[Snapping]
How is the truffle coming, Abigail?
I can't work with such inferior equipment.
This mixing machine is ten years old, and the measuring cups are cracked.
I need exact measurements!
I can't work miracles with this stuff!
You should try, Abigail, or those little bratwursts will be on the menu tonight!
Your Tibetan cocoa sticks.
These did not come easy.
The Happily Ever After Agency is everywhere!
Only three?
I need four.
- Four?
!
- I can't make it without four sticks.
I have lost two Sherpas in those mountains already.
Do you know how much a Sherpa costs?
They've got a union.
I've gotta pay for goats.
I've gotta pay for the little hats.
There's per diem.
You want this done right, or don't you?
You bring me a decent flour sifter and some real measuring cups, then I might be able to remember the final ingredient.
Fine!
But you better get cooking, Abigail.
[Muttering] Four cocoa sticks.
Just take two cocoa sticks and break 'em in half!
[Slams door]
Oh, don't you worry.
I'll get cooking all right.
[Chuckling]
Boo-yah!
Still got it.
["Schnitzel" plays over TV]
[Gretel] Get the remote.
Time for Rachael Ray.
[Hansel] Leave me alone.
I'm trying to fill the awful emptiness that lives deep inside me with food.
[Yodeling on TV]
Children, I found you.
[Squealing]
[Both] Granny Puckett!
- How did you get out?
- I've got my ways, little one.
Come on, we gotta get you two out of here.
The exit is there.
We saw the witch go through that way.
Show me.
But we gotta be quiet.
The exit is straight ahead.
Don't be suspicious.
Continue moving.
[Clanging]
- What?
What is this?
- It's a big cage, dum-dum.
- Huh?
What's she doing here?
- [Hansel] You tell us.
I thought you said she was locked up tight.
- She was!
She just needed more...
- More tools to do the escaping with?
You mean all this time, you two were never?
In danger?
No!
We're not even kidnapped!
- We're the kidnappers!
- Ja!
You've been hoodwinked!
- Too!
Ja, Hansel!
- Ja, Gretel!
[Both chanting] We're evil!
We're...
something else that rhymes with evil!
You two are the nastiest children I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.
Don't blame us.
It is society's fault.
We had the displeasure of being the children of a poor woodcutter.
We never had any sweets for the snacking.
But now we will have the greatest dessert of all time, to make us unstoppable!
Well, this chefjust turned in her apron.
You'll never get the secret ingredient.
Don't worry.
We have ways of making you bake.
Verushka, keep your scary mask on!
You want to look spooky or not?
- And turn your eyes back on.
- Oh.
Oh, right.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Very scary.
Now, can you keep her locked up this time?
- Yes!
- And remember, we are in charge, Verushka.
Verushka?
Verushka Von Vine?
You finally remember me.
How nice!
Perhaps you also remember this.
Is that what this is about?
It all started when we were Sisters together in the Sisterhood.
You were always so good at everything.
I tried so hard to beat you, but you were always better than me.
Then came that terrible day of the ancient recipe ritual, when the...
[Granny] Why are you telling me this?
I was there.
[Verushka] Abigail!
This is my big, super-evil-villain moment!
- So will you just shut up?
!
- [Granny] OK, OK.
[Verushka] Now, where was I?
Started at the Sisterhood, always number two...
Did I get to the part about the truffle?
- [Granny sighs] Yes.
- I couldn't make that stinking truffle!
But you did!
And I knew then that you were the reason I was a big pile of number two!
So I stole the great recipe, and I spent the last 60 years searching for the secret ingredient!
[Granny] You really practiced this speech?
[Verushka] But then Hansel and Gretel found me.
Together we devised a plan to kidnap you and complete the truffle recipe.
My attempts to find the secret ingredient were all failures!
Sure, I did produce a few other things.
A poison apple, a sleeping spell, a way to turn men into frogs.
She's completely insane.
You should see what she's done to the cat.
Oh, that's disturbing on so many levels.
You don't have to be like this, Verushka.
I'll never play second fiddle to you again, Abigail.
I've been number two long enough.
Once I finally have the Super Truffle,
I will taste the sweet, chocolaty victory of being number one!
[Cackling]
OK, all I need to do is find this D.C.T. Place.
How hard could that be?
[Sighing] Muffins!

Got a dollar?
What?
Who?
Hey, down here.
It's better to give than to receive.
So give me a dollar and you'll feel better.
- No.
I'm just looking for...
- Looking?
A quest?
I love...
Ooh.
You work out?
You are looking for the big golden...
No, wait.
The magic.
You're looking for the magic...
OK, I got nothing.
What's on your mind?
My granny!
She's out there somewhere, and I'm totally out of clues.
[Sniffing] Perhaps she's been turned into stone.
What?
Turned to...
How do you even come up with that?
Who says that?
- You get what you pay for.
- All I've got is this stupid tag.
- "D.C.T." You tried Dental Clown Tech?
- Yes!
I've tried everywhere.
Yeah, yeah, it's tough.
Wait a second.
Wait a second!
- Dark Castle Towers!
- Dark Castle?
My brothers and I used to live there.
Then there was this whole thing with the farmer's wife and a clock.
- Can you show me?
- Sure.
Follow me. [grunts]
I thought I told you to stay off my corner.
The journey there is long and full of dangers.
[Mouse] Oh, no, there it is.
My bad.
[Keypad beeping]
- Nicky, it's Red.
- [Nicky] Red!
- Good to hear from you.
- I need...
That is...
- Is Wolf there?
- No, we haven't heard from him.
Why?
- What's the trouble?
- Dark Castle Towers, that's what.
It's an old hotel on South Castle Street.
I'm sure Granny and the kids are in there.
- But it's really heavily guarded.
- And you need help to get them out?
No, no!
I've totally got it.
No problemo.
- I just thought...
- I'll alert the squad leaders.
We'll have a full rescue team there immediately.
- Give me as many details as you can.
- [Sighs] OK.
[Verushka] Oh, no!
What are we gonna do?
The whole HEA is going to be at our front door, and our back door, and our windows!
We're practically crawling with windows!
I think some of the windows even have little doors...
Stop!
Chill out.
Ja, ja.
Chill a pill and then take one.
We have always known that the Happily Ever After Agency would be a threat.
- Our forces are already in place.
- Lesson four:
Eliminate your obstacles.
- Eliminate?
But what do you mean?
- [Feedback whines]
[Echoing] Send in the pigs!
Good work, Red.
That's the break we were looking for.
- What?
- Nicky?
Is everything all right?
Uh, I'm not sure.
Stand by.
- [Nicky] Ops, status report.
- Sir, we are being attacked!
- [Alarm blaring]
- Nicky, what is it?
What's going on?
- Red, we've got trouble.

OK, guys.
See you later.

And I was wondering, did I do the right thing?
Wolf, I have been waiting for you to say that!

You got mad skills!
Red needs you!
Nah, she doesn't need me.

It's the Three Little Pigs, man.
- Remember us?
- Yeah!

What do you mean by that, pork pie?
It did have meaning.
- Who...

We never had a chance.
- What happened to you boys?

It was pigs with knives and guns and rockets... [mimics gunfire]

Disguises.
They not only work, they save lives.
But this...

No, she's not working alone.
Every agent we have has been roughed up, kidnapped, scared off or mailed to an uncharted island.
I'm afraid the agency is all but defeated.
What about Red?
Is she OK?
No one's heard from her.
I hate to assume the worst, but...
I never thought I'd say this, Wolf.
I think a wild card is the only thing that can save us now.
You guys didn't really catch me.
I just slipped.

Oh, sure, safety first.
Always carry little gas masks, because you never know.

Perhaps the children are nervous and need to release a little tension.
That's natural.

[Cackling]
[Laughing]
Behold the Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!
[Thunder crashing]
Granny, I'm sorry.
I really messed up.
Don't be silly, dear.
I'm proud of you.
You knew what that recipe needed.
Only a true Sister would know that.
No, I mean... [sighs]
I shouldn't have tried to do everything myself.
Now the HEA is gone, and they've got the truffle, and I didn't even rescue you.
I was just so worried about proving I could live up to your example.
I'm sorry.
I let you down.
Why, because things are a little tough right now?
Gooseberries, child.
I've been in much worse situations than this.
You can still turn this around.
A person can never really fail unless they give up.
You fell for our trickery like a fish falls for water.
What have you done with Wolf and Twitchy?
[Cheery elevator music plays]
Hey, Twitchy, look over there.
- Help me get over there.
- Yeah!
OK!
[Both grunting]
- Must... gently... hit... buttons!
- [Twitchy grunting]
- Almost got it.
Come on, little buddy.
- No, no, no!
[squeaks]
Muffins.
We can't let them leave with those.
I'm sorry, but we have orders to fill for every villain in the world.
Ja, the brochure went out weeks ago.
The truffle's power is, sadly, temporary.
So they will just want more and more.
- And we will become the filthy rich!
- The filthy rich!
- Not if we stop you first.
- Well, of course not.
That is obvious.
If you were to stop us...
Wait a minute.
You wish!
- One for the road, Brother?
- What a delicious idea.
[Both chuckling]
No!
You can't handle the power!
Uh-oh.
I feel the power!
[Laughing maniacally]
All powerful!
I have the strength of a thousand small boys!
You'll have to be excusing.
We have a world to dominate.
- Ja, no time for the dilly-dally.
- This isn't over.
[Laughing]
Giant superpowered German kids.
Did not see that coming.
- The truffle!
It's finally mine!
- Ja, I don't think so.
Hey!
I'm your partner.
We planned this whole thing together.
Oh, did we?
The way I remember it, Brother, it was you, me and a napkin.
Legal documentation?
Yes.
I don't remember signing anything.
Do you, Brother?
- No, no, no.
I don't.
- It's not legal.
- [Gretel] We did not sign anything.
- [Hansel] Oh, look at the face.
You have outlived your usefulness, old woman.
But do not worry.
We will leave a pet for you to do the playing with.
[Gretel cackling]
- What pet?
- You can't do this to me!
Talk to the spider, 'cause the kid ain't listening.
No!
Wait!
Come back!
Spider?
Did he say spider?
[Creature growls]
Now would be a good time to untie us, Verushka.
I got my own problems, Abigail.
[Growling]
[Dings]
[Cheery elevator music playing]
[Grunting]
[Verushka] Help!
Let me out of here!
Help!
Red, get behind me.
[Growling]
[Kirk yodeling] ♪ Schnitzel!

Huh?
[Yodeling continues]
Is that... yodeling?
[Both] It sure is.
[Yodeling together]
- It's yodel time!
- Kirk!
Nice entrance.
[Growling]
Go, Yodelers!
I will get Red and Granny.
- [Squealing]
- You want a piece of me?
!
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Hold still!
I'll have you free in a moment!
- Wow!
You've gotten better.
- Why, thank you.
- Come on.
We've got work to do.
- Right behind you.
Heidi rides a spider like a Valkyrie!
[Dings]
[Cheery elevator music playing]
What were you thinking?
!
Eight legs is so last year!
[Shrieking]
- Hurry!
Everyone, grab a leg!
- Good idea, honey!
Go, go, Yodelers!
[laughing]
Whoo!
- [Red] Hold her!
- Someone get a really big shoe!
It's working!
That's it.
I'm getting out of here.
She's getting tired!
Hurry, comrades!
We have a 10:00 late show!
Just a little more.
Gotcha!
[Growling]
- Thanks, Kirk.
- Any time, Red.
Nice work there, youngsters.
Love the outfits.
Yodelers, to the Yodelmobile!
- [All yodeling] - [Granny chuckling]
Them's some jiggy yodelers.
[Grunting]
[Screaming]
I've gotcha!
[Grunting]
[Both grunting]
I didn't deserve to be saved.
Especially not by you.
I want you to know you were never number two to me.
[Distant booming]
[Granny] Those kids could level the whole city.
With the power of the Super Truffle, no one will be able to stop them.
This is all my fault.
If I'd been more like you, they wouldn't have gotten away.
You don't need to be like anyone, Red.
You're the real deal.
A true Sister of the Hood.
[Sighing]
- You really think so?
- I know it.
You already have all the power you need.
Go get 'em, honey.
Go, Red.
Go!
Come on, come on!
[Granny] Verushka?
You can always come back.
No.
It's too late for me.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
[Dings]
[Cheery elevator music playing]
What did we miss?
[Granny] I've gotta get me one of these.
[Wolf] Yes, it suits you.
Let's swing by the hat store and pick out something pointy.
[Twitchy cheering]
- [Rumbling] - [Gasps]
[Growling]
Ooh!
Look at the tiny, little people living their tiny lives.
They have done nothing to deserve our hatred.
Makes our violence that much more senseless.
I know!
I love that about us!
- Holy cheese!
- [Hansel] Oh, look, Sister.
- I almost hit a school bus.
- [Gretel] Double points.
Uh-oh.
Ooh!
I regret nothing!
You cannot do the beating of us.
We are truffle-powered!
Yeah, well, I've got a few surprises of my own.
Aah!
Is this the end of Hansel?
[Screaming]
You are really starting to tick me off.
I'm not done yet.
[Cackling] I am indestructible!
Oh, schnitzel.
[Car alarms blaring]
[Grunting]
[Groaning] OK.
Not my best landing.
Yoo-hoo!
Annoying little red person, look in the sky.
You've got to be kidding me.
[Grunts]
- That was really fun.
- Ja, real fun!
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
What is tiny, red and smashed all over?
What is tiny, red and smashed all over who?
- I'll tell you in five seconds.
- You won't get away with this.
Oh, really?
And just who's going to stop us?
[Wolf] Anyone see an aircraft carrier around here?
- Wolf, distract them and I'll get Red.
- [Wolf] Hey there, tubby.
Those shorts make your ankles look fat.
- They do not.
I've very shapely ankles.
- Ja!
- Grab her!
- All aboard!
- Thanks!
- Hey, never leave your wingman.
- Come back here!
- [Grunting]
Sorry!
My bad!
- We're clear.
You can stop swerving.
- I'm trying.
This thing isn't easy to steer, you know.
- [Train whistling] - [Yelling]
I'm sticking to motorcycles.
That was sweet!
Let's do it again!
Maybe later.
Come on!
- [Rumbling] - [Grunting]
- Uh-oh.
- Olly, oily, oxen free!
- One for the truffle.
- Two because we are so very evil.
Three because I also agree we are evil.
- Four to go!
- To go!
[All yelling]
Oh, man.
I thought we were goners for sure.
[Gasping]
Wolf, calm down.
We're gonna be OK.
We just need to walk towards each other.
But we've gotta time it very carefully.
[All yelling]
- Wolf, throw me your beard!
- This is no time for a disguise!
Just do it.
Now.
Wolf, have I ever told you how much I love your disguises?
Ha.
Sorry, my bad.
Listen, I wanna take a moment to apologize for not being there when you needed me.
No, no, no!
It's OK, Wolf!
It's OK!
No, no, no.
Let me do this.
Granny, thanks to my sloppy work, you got kidnapped.
I'm sorry.
OK.
I forgive you.
Twitchy, I've been using your toothpaste.
I haven't bought a tube of toothpaste in probably four years.
Toothpaste?
!
After all we've been through?
!
You have to tell her how you feel right now!
She needs to hear it!
Not now, Twitchy!
Hang on.
Red, I walked away because I thought you didn't want me around.
I'm sorry.
Wolf, I never could have done any of this without you.
I should have listened to you more, Red,
- instead of doing things my way.
- I kind of like your way.
Sometimes, the right disguise can get you out of a tough jam.
So can the right partner.
Now, that's a good recipe.
- Gum?
- Why not?
[All yelling]
- I thought you said we'd be OK!
- I exaggerated!
My life just flashed before my eyes.
It's weird, flashback really does add ten pounds.
What stopped us?
Verushka.
Turns out Bitsy here wasn't so bad after all.
- Just needed a friend.
- [Grunts happily]
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
- Those kids are destroying the city.
- [Distant screaming]
We have to stop them before they eat any more of those truffles.
Wait a minute.
More truffles.
That's a great idea.

Ja, we are naturals.
Do you think they compete in giant monstering?
[Echoing] Stop right there.
Drop those truffles and surrender.

[Hansel] Oh, my tummy!
Oh, my tummy!
You cannot dominate us.
A sweet confection has made us unstoppable!
- Run for your lives!
- Hold your ground.
We can't let them get by us.
Next stop, smashy town.
[Hansel and Gretel laughing]
[Red] Stop right there.
- Red!
- Get back, Nick.
We'll handle this.
- We?
- Ja, Hansel.
I only see one little girl.
All alone.
[Wolf] She's never alone.
- Thank goodness!
- Last chance, kids.
Drop the truffles and surrender.
Surrender?
We don't do the surrender.
We are unstoppable!
- Bring it.
- [Yelling]
[Grunting]
- We're kicking it old-school!
- Alley-oop, Abigail!
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!

Stop that!

Over here!
OK, Twitchy, let them have it.
[Rapid squeaking]
- Stop with the shoving!
- Alley-oop!
- Red, coming at you!
- I got it, Granny!
- Go, Red!
Go!
- You cannot be defeating us!
Go ahead, run away like a little girl!
What did you call me?
No, Red!
Keep going!
- [Both] Hm.
- Ja, you just keep the running away.
Like a scared little girl.
[Yelling]
[Grunting]
- Red?
- [Gasps]
Are you OK, honey?
[Whispers] Granny...
I'm sorry.
[Chuckles] We did the tricking of you, you silly little girl.
That's just really great!
Now they can get away.
Or worse, they could figure out that if they eat more truffles, they would become completely unstoppable.
- Really?
- Wolf!
Did I say that out loud?
What have you done?
We'll never stop them now.
- Don't worry, Nicky.
- All part of the plan.
- Plan?
What plan?
- Relax, we got this covered.
Watch and learn.
[Both grunting]
[Yelling]
[Laughing]
We are all powerful!
Wait for it.
Brother, what is happening?
See, kids, you shouldn't overdo sweets.
Those Super Truffles are also super high in fat and calories.
I'm stuck.
[Both] Oh, schnitzel.
- My word.
- See, Nicky, one truffle makes you super, but a whole batch, and you're as helpless as a beach ball.
Those two won't give us any more trouble.
Does this street make my butt look fat?
You know, a lesser wolf would say they finally got their just desserts.
- But not you.
- No, not me.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to a treadmill.

- You have the right to broccoli.
- Not broccoli!
Nice work, agents.
With a little rehabilitation and a lot of exercise, we may still be able to show those kids the way home.
Granny, I'll need you to get me in touch with the Sisters of the Hood.
We've got agents to round up and an agency to rebuild.
- I think we could use their help.
- The Sisters are always ready.
Aren't we, Verushka?
Especially with everything back where it should be.
[Female on radio] Calling all agents.
A 714 in progress.
Reports of 10,000 mice chasing a suspect.
See the man with the flute.
What the heck?
It's on the way.
- Ooh!
I'm driving!
- Says who?
- Go get 'em, agents.
- That's my girl.
Hey, on the way, we should stop for some disguises.
Yeah, I know just the place.
So you sticking around a while or going back to finish your training?
- Nah, I'm good here.
- Another happy ending.
- [Wolf] Let's roll, partner.
- [Red] Anything you say, partner.

[♪ Dan Myers: "Little Squirrel (Forage For Your Love)"]
[Twitchy] That was sweet!
Let's do it again!
[Red] Maybe later.
[♪ CEEJ: "Perfect Two"]
[Twitchy] Hey, girls.
Let's call it a night.
Once upon a time, there were four unlikely heroes.
Red Riding Hood, her granny, the not so Big Bad Wolf and an over-caffeinated squirrel called Twitchy.
Together, they defeated the evil plans of a very bad little bunny, and came to work for me.
My name is Nicky, and I run the Happily Ever After Agency, an organization dedicated to making happy endings for everyone.
As we say in the HEA, "It's not just a fairy tale, it's an adventure."
Recently, Red took a leave of absence to train at a secret location with the legendary Sisters of the Hood.
This left the team in a bit of disarray, just as we were about to meet a terrible threat, not only to the HEA, but to happy endings everywhere.
It started one night when we received an anonymous tip that two children were being held in a gingerbread house by a witch with a wicked appetite.
Alpha Leaden witch sighted in window.
Which window?
- Affirmative.
- What?
Rescue Team Alpha, stand by for go order.
Agent Fuzzy moving into position.
Nick Knack, take point.
Paddy Whack, cover the rear.
Suspect is enchanted and extremely dangerous.
- Roger.
- Who's Roger?
Alpha Leader here, confirmed Mother Goose.
Rescue Team standing by.
Looks like Red's a no-show.
Again.
Wolf, we talked about this.
Red's on assignment.
And I'm supposed to be at the DMV, but I showed up.
Look, dog, I know you miss her.
We all do.
But those poor kids are going to become baked goods any minute now.
I need you to concentrate on what's going on here.
Yo, Froggy, what's the story on Red Riding Rogue?
Wolf, she is training secretly.
- What kind of secret training?
- Not now.
OK, OK.
You wanna reassign Red, it's your agency.
- Thank you.
- So we all agree
- that I don't need any secret training.
- Wolf!
My talent comes naturally.
Wolf' Get off the channel!
Those kids don't have much time.
Don't sweat it, Granny Dynamite.
With Red gone, I need to step up.
- So I called out the big guns.
- What?
This is not good!
We might have a problem here, sir!
Put it on the screen.
No!
They wouldn't!
Alpha Team, we've got something small and fast, scurrying up the side of the house.
Roger, Goose, I'll get a gander.
On the job.
Love my job.
Good job.
It's not just a job, it's an adventure.
Hey, Granny, how you doing?
Bye-bye!
- What are you two up to?
- You like recipes, don't you?
Try this.
A cup of hot wolf, a pinch of screwy squirrel and a dash of disguise.
Rescue pie.
My own recipe.
- Wolf, no!
- Thank me later!
That's not a rope.
Not rope, not rope.
Not rope, not rope.
Not rope!
Rope!
Twitchy, what do you think you're doing up there?
The wolf's plan.
I'll slip through the chimney.
She'll never see me coming.
- It's a great job...
- What is he saying?
Translate that.
I have an advantageous position from which to breach our suspect's gingerbread home.
Uh-oh.
I think the fan is about to be hit with the doody.
I'm going in!
Right now!
I am going in.
Negative.
Do not proceed.
Do not proceed.
Now, listen to me, Twitchy...
Mammals!
Oh, please!
We did not mean to trespass into your delicious cookie house!
Ja, we were only searching for goodies for this...
Silence!
Building inspector.
You know, it's against housing codes to live in any dessert bigger than a cupcake.
I need to see your permits and a list of ingredients.
That better not be custard.
Don't worry, kids!
I'm here to rescue you!
Yeah, me, I got the good guys!
- They're all hiding outside.
- Little squirrel, I am Hansel.
Ja, and I am Gretel.
You must hurry.
The witch will soon return.
- She'll eat us all for supper!
- She says chicken tastes like children!
Ja!
OK, OK, I'm on the case.
He's in trouble!
Move in!
Move in!
Come on, you goldbricks!
You wanna live forever?
- Get the door!
- Just get more puffs!
I think it's weakening.
Agents, take a bite out of crime.
Wolf, this entire operation is a shambles.
I know, but I can fix it.
- She got the kids!
- You're alive!
Now, we'll never catch up with her.
- Sweet ride!
- Boys?
Sorry, goodies, but this is a dinner flight.
Help us!
She has flavorful marinades!
Oh, no, you didn't!
Come on, Twitch.
- Buckle up, homies. it's on!
- No, wait!
Don't just...
Get some backup in the air, now!
Whoa!
Ten and two, Granny!
I'm regretting that burrito.
Help us!
She has put us in little cages!
It is dehumanizing!
- We are like delicious veal!
- You'll never save them!
- Tree in the way!
- Oh, put on your man pants, Wolfie.
- Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray...
- Whoo-hoo!
Can we go back for my stomach?
it's pink, shaped like a football.
- Has my lunch in it.
- Oh, knuckle up, dog.
Mother Goose to base.
Mother Goose to base.
We are in pursuit of witch.
Stand by.
- Better catch me, I'm getting peckish.
- That witch is whack.
Wolf, you think you can handle a bike like this?
Sure, I think I could if I had to.
I went through my bad boy phase.
Road a bike, greased my hair back, lived over Richie Cunningham's garage, water-skied over a shark tank.
Those were some happy days.
Great, 'cause she's all yours, dog.
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
- Hi, Granny.
- Hey, young kids.
I've gotcha.
No!
I've got you!
No worries, Twitch.
Dog is your co-pilot.
Well, I'm a singing goat by the name of Japeth
J* I've got singing' talent I've yet to tapeth
J' Till one day I walked in the path of a motorcycle
J' Got knocked off a cliff into quite a pickle
- I'm uninsured!
- J' And onto a branch
J' And a pointy rock
J' And an angry rock climber
Aah!
Why?

J' And a beaver
J' And another beaver J*
You have the right to a fairy godmother.
If you do not have a fairy godmother, one will be provided for you.
Whoa!
You have the right to get some flying lessons.
Don't lose them.
Now turn right.
Your other right!
Your other other right!
Stay low, stay low!
Mammals.
There they are, there they are!
There they go, you passed them.
You passed them!
Why did you pass them?
Calm down.
You got the metabolic rate of a hummingbird.
I've got me a foolproof Granny rescue plan.
Twitchy, do you think you could handle a bike like this?
No, no, bad idea!
I can't reach the pedals!
Be seeing you, little buddy.
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
OK, I can taste my own butt.
Saw that coming.
Oh, look!
Your doggie's trying to save you!
Don't worry, Granny, I got ya!
- No, Wolf, don't!
it's a trap!
- I got ya, I got ya.
- Oh!
OK, I don't got ya.
- We need help.
Get Red!
- She'll know what to do!
- Hey, I'm handling this rescue!
- Everything's under control!
- You can't do it alone!
Hey!
I'm alive!
- You almost saved her.
- I got served.
This whole thing is my fault.
None of this would have happened if...
- If Red were here?
- Well, she's not here, is she?
Nicky Flippers' little superstar is far, far... far away.
Far, far, far... far away.
Far... far away.
- Yeah, yeah, I get it!
- Just saying it's quite a ways.
Uh...
Hi.
So you think you can deliver that basket of goodies across my bridge, do you?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, no, no!
You did not just say that.
I did not hear that!
There ain't no way my bridge is being crossed by some muffin-delivering, red-hood-wearing, fairy-tale-cliché, little girl.
Get up outta here!
Bring it.
I'm about to get you!
Oh!
Hey!
Oh!
- No, no, no!
- See?
I told you!
I win again.
It's 'cause I'm so evil.
Mm!
I even taste evil.
Ooh!
I taste just like chicken.
Chicken and evil!
I'm gonna do my little evil chicken dance.
Huh?
Hello!
Is the fight over?
Did you mean to jump off the bridge?
Huh?
Bye-bye.
Ooh!
That's cheating!
That is so cheating!
You running 'cause you know you can't beat me!
Your granny never would've run away like a scared little chicken girl!
- What did you just say?
- You heard me.
I said your granny would be ashamed of you, 'cause you running like a teeny, tiny, helpless, little girl!
Oh, muffins.
Oh!
Ow!
- Take that!
And that!
- Was it something I said?
Ooh!
That's my corn!
Aah!
I kinda like that.
Enough!
Check, please.
The test is over.
The delivery is incomplete.
I win again!
I am the greatest!
I'm the prettiest ballerina in the whole fruit cup!
Yes, Senator, that is my monkey.
His name is Rumpelstiltskin, but it's a secret.
Don't tell him I told you.
I'm coming to the light, Mama.
Show me the Seven-Layer Kick.
Show me the Spatula!
Show me the Flying Rolling Pin!
Red, I know you came with much to prove, but your task was to deliver the basket.
You heard what he said about my granny!
Moss used your desire to please Abigail as just a test.
A Sister finds her own path, her true inner power.
Besides, honey, we're starting to run low on combat instructors.
Oh, come on.
Really!
I barely touched him.
Why, fidlee dee, Mr. Butler.
What brings you to Tara?
- I like Tootsie Rolls.
- He'll be fine.
Hm...
Sorry, I should take this.
- Hello?
- Red?
it's Nicky.
Nicky?
What is it?
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
it's about your grandmother.
Why would anyone want to kidnap my granny?
Red, at the end of every Sister's training, she faces the ancient trial by truffle, in which the student attempts to recreate the Sisterhood's most powerful culinary confection.
For over a thousand years that recipe has been our secret, its making understood only by the best of us.
What has that got to do with Granny?
Very few Sisters complete the truffle, one of them was your grandmother, Abigail Puckett.
The power of this goodie is so great, it must be ever kept from those who would misuse it.
Like those wannabes at the Food Network.
Holla!
Rachael Ray's the devil.
This is where you keep all the recipes?
No, just the one.
The Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!
But around the kitchen, honey, we just call it the Super Truffle!
Cool!
What makes it so super?
Anyone who eats it becomes unstoppable, in strength and thought and speed.
- Sounds good.
- Too good!
So... how did you make the recipe invisible?
Oh, muffins.
Battle stations!
Man your posts!
Sound the alarm!
Secure the gates!
Somebody get me my rolling pin!
We must hurry.
Whoever stole the recipe will be trying to complete the truffle.
We must find and stop them before they do.
Before they find the secret ingredient.
- Secret ingredient?
What is it?
- Well, it's...
Oh, no, you don't.
The final ingredient is never written down.
- Or even spoken.
- Then how does anyone know it?
When you're a true Sister of the Hood, you just know.
That must be why they kidnapped Abigail.
I've gotta find her.
Red, the task of saving your granny is yours alone.
But, child, I fear it may be more danger than you are ready for.
It doesn't matter.
She's my granny, I've gotta save her.
You have learned much.
The Sisterhood is in your blood.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
Right?
Red is still finding her true path.
- She is not ready.
- Yeah, I know.
For a complete nut muffin, that witch sure ties a good knot.
Did somebody say "nut muffin"?
Sounds delicious.
My dinner was interrupted, and I could use a little snack.
- Comfypoo, Abigail?
- Have we met before?
Was it the '60s?
The '60s are kind of a blur.
What?
!
Why, no!
You'd remember meeting someone as evil as me!
Why, look at these glowing red eyes and big scary mask!
Your goodie friends won't find you here, Abigail.
So you might as well relax and stay for dinner.
- You want me to make you dinner?
- Oh, how nice of you to offer.
Let me see.
What am I in the mood for?
Day-old sushi?
Dutch balls?
Turducken?
I'm more in the mood for a chocolate truffle!
A truffle?
Sorry, never learned to make that.
Never?
Never studied with the Sisterhood of Kung Fu Bakers?
Never learned the secret ingredient to an ancient recipe so powerful it makes one invincible?
Darn!
I really had a taste for that.
How do you know about that?
That recipe is forbidden.
Forbidden, is it?
Oh.
Well, that's too bad.
Well, then it's a good thing I have it written down.
See?
Do you want it?
Do you?
Take it.
Oh.
Oh, you can't.
You're tied to a chair.
Oh, too bad!
Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's right, Abigail.
I have everything but the secret ingredient,
- and you're going to give it to me.
- What?
You think I'm just gonna bake one up for you?
Not gonna happen.
You won't?
All right.
I guess I'll just have to cook up something else.
Ooh.
Sorry.
I love that show.
- She's getting us ready for the baking!
- I'm too young to be a strudel!
So, Abigail, what's for dinner?
I'll need a titanium mixing bowl.
...search for Granny Puckett, highest priority.
What is the status of Mother Hubbard's cupboard?
Someone update Granny's Facebook profile to "witchnapped. "
Butcher and baker cleared.
We 're questioning the candlestick maker
I'm not saying they shouldn't work here, I'm just saying they're delicious.
Ooh!
Wolf, thanks for taking such good care of my granny.
Yeah, my finest hour.
I'm shopping the movie rights.
But maybe if you'd been around to look after the old girl yourself,
- I wouldn't have had to.
- If I...
I was training.
- While you've been playing kung fu...
- You know that thing you do...
Awkward.
Red, it's good to see you.
There's been a rash of robberies.
The stolen items are from that list of Super Truffle ingredients you sent us.
- So the witch has been shopping?
- We think so.
A surveillance camera caught the latest incident.
Blue, pull up the Muffet footage.
Whoa!
Did you see the size of that mushroom?
We're gonna need to hit the streets, find out who's hiring the muscle.
Indeed.
We think many of the suspects are associates of a shady operator known as The Giant.
He's a reputed smuggler, a juggler, a robber, a cobbler, a picker, a grinner, a restaurateur, and blogs about animated films.
- He should get a life.
- Indeed.
He runs the Beanstalk Club in Big City.
I want the two of you to check it out.
- What?
Are you kidding?
- Me and her?
Whoa!
Hop back here a second, Flippers.
You mean the both of us?
Granny never needed a partner, and I don't either.
I guess she's right about that, maybe.
Red, you're not going anywhere without backup.
And you, you need to shuffle your wild-card antics to the bottom of the deck.
No more stunts, no more cheap disguises.
You two are partners.
Get used to it.
All right, road trip!
"Big City"]
Hey, I'm driving here!
Big City is home to great shopping, dining, and two professional sports teams:
the Golden Geese of the National Enchantment League and what was formerly the Denver Nuggets.
- What are you doing?
- Reading about the big burg,
- in case we get a chance to sightsee.
- We're not here to sightsee.
- We're here to find Granny.
- Fine.
But you're missing out on a chance to visit the Old Mother Hubbard Museum.
Largest collection of empty cupboards in the world, which is weird.
OK, let's get something straight.
We're doing this operation by the book, exactly the way Granny would, plain and simple.
- I just had a book.
- Wrong book.
- Hey, it was a good book.
- All right, look...
Looky, looky, over here!
Hey, it's Kirk.
He's really hit the big time.
We should catch the show.
No.
We are going to stay focused and follow procedure.
- They won't expect that.
- Look, you two, we are definitely not here to hang around in loud, sleazy nightclubs, listening to cheesy lounge singers.
J* Hey, Ali Baba and a carpet ride
J' I'm Jack and the magic beans
J* I'm like Hansel and Gretel in a candy house when you blow a kiss at me
J' Every day's a mystery and my wildest dreams come true
J* Living in this fairy tale with you J*
Great place.
Love the fixtures.
- So, what's the plan, Hoodie?
- We talk to Jimmy 10-Strings.
He's one of Granny's regular informants.
If The Giant's behind the stolen ingredients, that harp will sing in more ways than one.
- We need to...
- Ply him with my lupine charisma?
- Gotcha.
I'm on it.
- Hold on!
I'll do the talking.
Granny told me how to handle guys like this.
The trick is not...
Huh?
- Wolf?
- Go, Wolfie!
Go, Wolfie!
Aah, stop that!
Will you two focus?
OK, OK!
Just trying to blend in with the crowd.
- Just stay here.
- This will end well.
I'll be at the bar.
Merci beaucoup, and my personal favorite, danke schön.
- Hey, Jimmy 10-Strings.
- Sweetheart, I do autographs
- after the show, OK?
- I work with Granny,
- and I need you to do me a favor.
- For Granny?
Anything!
I hear your boss has his goons stealing truffle ingredients.
What do you know?
What?
!
Well, I never.
I mean, who told you...
OK, listen up.
A couple of days ago, I overheard The Giant talking about a big order for someone called...
Uh-oh.
- I didn't tell her a thing.
- Get your hooves off me.
Tell the boss I told her nothing.
I should sing something nice at her funeral.
- Tell 10-Strings
- Up there.
To limit his singing to exclusively musical vocalizations, or I shall be forced to tune his strings
- until they snap.
Capisce?
- Got it, boss.
You, with the red hanky on her head.
Are you trying to play my harp?
You could end up singing with the angels, playing my harp.
- Tell me about the witch.
- What witch?
Which witch?
- Huh.
Good one, boss.
- Did you just laugh at me?
Do I amuse you?
- Am I some sort of clown to you?
- No, I...
I hate my job.
- Who are you?
- I'm your worst nightmare.
A Sister with a badge.
And I'm onto you.
Excuse me.
Did I just hear your tiny, little voice correctly?
Did you just come into my house, hassle my harp, interrupt my dinner and tell me my hands are dirty?
!
I eat sandwiches bigger than you, little girl!
Did someone say sandwiches?
'Cause I'll take one.
And I'll bet you'll take five.
Hundred, that is!
'Cause you're a big boy.
I said big boy, son.
Who the Mother Goose is this supposed to be?
Phineas Newcastle McGee, wealthy business tycoon.
Didn't we meet at the big convention?
MobCon, the mobsters' convention.
Wasn't that you?
You know, I just got back from ConCon, the big conman convention.
Funniest thing.
I show up, nobody there!
Empty building!
Guess I should've seen that coming.
We are gonna die.
I love this guy!
This guy is hilarious!
You two, have some dinner with me.
Come here.
Hey, 10-Strings, you know what I wanna hear.
You bet, big guy.
Two, three, six.
J' Shorty, Shorty You best stay in the crib tonight
- J' Shorty, Shorty
- J' Yeah
J* When the big man be hatin' Don't be hesitatin'
- J' Shorty best be out of sight
- We don't have time for this.
- Don't worry, I got the big gun here.
- What?
- Twitchy?
Uh-oh.
- Distract The Giant.
I'll get the harp.
I don't like most little people.
Hey, you know what?
- I like you.
- Little people.
Can't trust 'em.
Hey, everybody's little to me.
Right?
- Am I right?
- Yeah.
- Oh, Stanley.
- Please, Blanche.
Not while I'm eating.
Jill, sweetheart!
Go fetch us another pail of water.
Sorry!
Sorry.
Excuse me, coming through.
Hey, that was good!
There is no proof that I ever ate anybody!
J' Shorty, get to steppin' Your mama told you right
J* Don't be coming 'round the club tonight J'
That's you, baby!
I'm not a dancer, I'm a singer.
Put me back!
What's the matter with you?
This kind of thing never happened to Dean!
- Well, this has been fun.
- Really, big, smelly, giant fun.
Hey, where you going?
Come on, come on!
The night's still young, right?
Sorry.
Love to stay, can't.
Gotta go.
Early start tomorrow.
Yeah, I got my Pilates workout, she's got a paper route.
- This is not how you steal a show!
- Hey!
Those skeevosos are trying to put the bag on my harp!
Get after them!
You got the wrong guy.
Frank Jr.'s down the street.
Did anybody notice that the guy I work for is an insane giant?
Put down the harp!
He's under contract!
Now you've done it.
He's mad!
We're dead.
- And I didn't even get my encore.
- Time to go!
And I still have 38 payments left on myself.
- Yee-haw!
- What am I paying you pasty mocks for?
Get after them!
- Hey, do you get paid?
- Not really.
No.
- Start singing, 10-Strings.
- Is this your first time doing this?
'Cause Granny just slips me 20 bucks.
I'll show those pipsqueaks who's the big man around here!
Putting fingers on my property!
Like that Jack guy.
I'm still picking pieces of him out of my teeth!
I'll grind up their bones to make my pasta fazool!
Tell us who The Giant's getting ingredients for.
Yeah, well, you know The Giant is not usually very happy about those who spill his personal beans.
Maybe I could tell you something about Goldilocks.
That is not her natural hair color.
- Really?
- I knew it!
- Just tell us who ordered the thefts.
- OK, OK already.
I'll tell ya.
Every day The Giant gets a call for a new ingredient from...
- ...from the Bunny.
- The Bunny?
- Not the Bunny!
Not the Bunny!
- Yes, the Bunny.
He calls in the orders, and that's all I know.
If you wanna hear me sing anymore, you'll have to catch my show.
Fe-fi-fo-fum!
I gotcha now!
- Jump!
- Are you crazy?
We're a mile up.
- Don't argue!
Just jump!
- OK.
This is not how you treat an entertainer of my caliber.
Hey, Twitchy, you didn't bring a parachute by any chance, did ya?
Uh...
No.
Gum?
No, thanks.
I'm trying to cut down.
Gotcha!
Oh, muffins.
Never trust short people!
J' I'm visitin' the city, yes I am
J' Just strolling 'round Big City with no plans
J* 'Cause things was crazy in the country but here I'm nice and comfy
Boys, I seem to have landed on a singing goat.
J' And now I'm in a dark tunnel
J' And I think I smell burritos I
I can't believe this all leads to Boingo.
Never trust a bunny.
Never trust a bunny!
- I think that went off pretty smooth.
- What was that disguise supposed to be?
- Fake beards are classic.
- You look like a deranged Santa Claus.
Santa gave me that beard.
Hello, Clarice.
- Who's Clarice?
- She is.
Hi, Clarice!
- Enjoy the book, Boingo.
- We share a love of literature.
So, Red, I see that stray dog is still following you around.
Don't let him mess with your head.
Let me guess.
You're the brains, and you're... not the brains?
Who's up for hasenpfeffer.
We know you've been working with The Giant.
Oh, really?
How?
I don't get out much.
- Talked to any witches lately?
- Which witch?
Oh, you mean the witch that took your granny.
When she said she wanted to take out old beehive,
I said, "Now, there's something we've got in common."
She did mention something about outwitting some incompetent, stupid, meddling, jerkfaced HEA agents!
I assumed she was talking about you two.
- I wasn't there.
- No, of course you weren't.
Relax, Fido.
You've got Little Red Riding Hood to protect you now.
-I do OK on my own.
- Is that before or after
- I bail you out?
- You weren't doing a lot of bailing
- when I saved your cape at the bar!
- I had everything under control.
- Another minute and I would've...
- Have been pâté!
- I don't need your help.
- Oh, really?
- Watch me.
- Ow!
No!
Not the ears!
You didn't even say the magic word.
- Abracadabra.
- Ow!
That's not even...
Well, actually, that is the magic word.
I don't know where Granny is.
The witch sends me notes, and I put the word out.
- Tell me where they are.
- Ow.
Ow.
You're still mad about me trying to kill you all those times, aren't you?
- Hey, books!
- Hey, no, wait!
Don't read that!
Nobody reads books anymore.
Movies are always better.
Especially sequels.
How does the witch get messages into your books?
Why don't you ask her?
She was just here.
The cleaning lady!
Come on, hurry!
She can't have gotten far!
Oh, she was right under our noses!
Aah!
I'm blind!
No, wait.
A little help.
See?
I said it before.
Disguises work.
Would you stop it already!
If you hadn't distracted me in there, I would have...
- Oh, so this is my fault, too?
- Yeah, it is.
That's great, coming from someone who just took off to play Crouching Baker.
I stayed to do the job.
It's not like this is easy.
I'm doing my best here.
Yeah, well, your best got my granny and two innocent kids kidnapped!
OK, fine!
You're right!
It did.
This is all my fault.
My screw-ups are putting everyone in danger.
I'll probably get you nabbed next.
Happy?
A little help!
Rolling now!
That's not what I meant.
You've made your point, Red.
This partnership's a disaster.
I better leave before I do any more damage.
I've always been a lone wolf.
Tell Nicky I quit.
Sorry, Red.
He's my ride.
Do I sound weird?
I sound weird to me!
I sound weird to me!
How is the truffle coming, Abigail?
I can't work with such inferior equipment.
This mixing machine is ten years old, and the measuring cups are cracked.
I need exact measurements!
I can't work miracles with this stuff!
You should try, Abigail, or those little bratwursts will be on the menu tonight!
Your Tibetan cocoa sticks.
These did not come easy.
The Happily Ever After Agency is everywhere!
Only three?
I need four.
- Four?
!
- I can't make it without four sticks.
I have lost two Sherpas in those mountains already.
Do you know how much a Sherpa costs?
They've got a union.
I've gotta pay for goats.
I've gotta pay for the little hats.
There's per diem.
You want this done right, or don't you?
You bring me a decent flour sifter and some real measuring cups, then I might be able to remember the final ingredient.
Fine!
But you better get cooking, Abigail.
Four cocoa sticks.
Just take two cocoa sticks and break 'em in half!
Oh, don't you worry.
I'll get cooking all right.
Boo-yah!
Still got it.
Get the remote.
Time for Rachael Ray.
Leave me alone.
I'm trying to fill the awful emptiness that lives deep inside me with food.
Children, I found you.
Granny Puckett!
- How did you get out?
- I've got my ways, little one.
Come on, we gotta get you two out of here.
The exit is there.
We saw the witch go through that way.
Show me.
But we gotta be quiet.
The exit is straight ahead.
Don't be suspicious.
Continue moving.
- What?
What is this?
- It's a big cage, dum-dum-dum.
- Huh?
What's she doing here?
- You tell us.
I thought you said she was locked up tight.
- She was!
She just needed more...
- More tools to do the escaping with?
You mean all this time, you two were never...?
In danger?
No!
We're not even kidnapped!
- We're the kidnappers!
- Ja!
You've been hoodwinked!
- Too!
Ja, Hansel!
- Ja, Gretel!
We're evil!
We're...
something else that rhymes with evil!
You two are the nastiest children I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.
Don't blame us.
It is society's fault.
We had the displeasure of being the children of a poor woodcutter.
We never had any sweets for the snacking.
But now we will have the greatest dessert of all time, to make us unstoppable!
Well, this chef just turned in her apron.
You'll never get the secret ingredient.
Don't worry.
We have ways of making you bake.
Verushka, keep your scary mask on!
You want to look spooky or not?
- And turn your eyes back on.
- Oh.
Oh, right.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Very scary.
Now, can you keep her locked up this time?
- Yes!
- And remember, we are in charge, Verushka.
Verushka?
Verushka Von Vine?
You finally remember me.
How nice!
Perhaps you also remember this.
Is that what this is about?
It all started when we were Sisters together in the Sisterhood.
You were always so good at everything.
I tried so hard to beat you, but you were always better than me.
Then came that terrible day of the ancient recipe ritual, when the...
Why are you telling me this?
I was there.
Abigail!
This is my big, super-evil-villain moment!
- So will you just shut up ?
!
- OK, OK.
Now, where was I?
Started at the Sisterhood, always number two...
Did I get to the part about the truffle?
- Yes.
- I couldn't make that stinking truffle!
But you did!
And I knew then that you were the reason I was a big pile of number two!
So I stole the great recipe, and I spent the last 60 years searching for the secret ingredient!
You really practiced this speech?
But then Hansel and Gretel found me.
Together we devised a plan to kidnap you and complete the truffle recipe.
My attempts to find the secret ingredient were all failures!
Sure, I did produce a few other things.
A poison apple, a sleeping spell, a way to turn men into frogs.
She's completely insane.
You should see what she's done to the cat.
Oh, that's disturbing on so many levels.
You don't have to be like this, Verushka.
I'll never play second fiddle to you again, Abigail.
I've been number two long enough.
Once I finally have the Super Truffle,
I will taste the sweet, chocolaty victory of being number one!
OK, all I need to do is find this D.C.T. place.
How hard could that be?
Muffins!
"l Can Do It Alone"]
I give up.
I'll never find it.
Hey!
Hoodie in the hood!
Got a dollar?
What?
Who?
Hey, down here.
It's better to give than to receive.
So give me a dollar and you'll feel better.
- No.
I'm just looking for...
- Looking?
A quest?
I love...
Ooh.
You work out?
You are looking for the big golden...
No, wait.
The magic.
You're looking for the magic...
OK, I got nothing.
What's on your mind?
My granny!
She's out there somewhere, and I'm totally out of clues.
Perhaps she's been turned into stone.
What?
Turned to...
How do you even come up with that?
Who says that?
- You get what you pay for.
- All I've got is this stupid tag.
- "D.C.T." You tried Dental Clown Tech?
- Yes!
I've tried everywhere.
Yeah, yeah, it's tough.
Wait a second.
Wait a second!
- Dark Castle Towers!
- Dark Castle?
My brothers and I used to live there.
Then there was this whole thing with the farmer's wife and a clock.
- Can you show me?
- Sure.
Follow me.
I thought I told you to stay off my corner.
The journey there is long and full of dangers.
Oh, no, there it is.
My bad.
- Nicky, it's Red.
- Red!
- Good to hear from you.
- I need...
That is...
- Is Wolf there?
- No, we haven't heard from him.
Why?
- What's the trouble?
- Dark Castle Towers, that's what.
It's an old hotel on South Castle Street.
I'm sure Granny and the kids are in there.
- But it's really heavily guarded.
- And you need help to get them out?
No, no!
I've totally got it.
No problemo.
- I just thought...
- I'll alert the squad leaders.
We'll have a full rescue team there immediately.
- Give me as many details as you can.
- OK.
Oh, no!
What are we gonna do?
The whole HEA is going to be at our front door, and our back door, and our windows!
We're practically crawling with windows!
I think some of the windows even have little doors...
Stop!
Chill out.
Ja, ja.
Chill a pill and then take one.
We have always known that the Happily Ever After Agency would be a threat.
- Our forces are already in place.
- Lesson four:
Eliminate your obstacles.
Eliminate?
But what do you mean?
Send in the pigs!
Good work, Red.
That's the break we were looking for.
- What?
- Nicky?
Is everything all right?
Uh, I'm not sure.
Stand by.
- Ops, status report.
- Sir, we are being attacked!
Nicky, what is it?
What's going on?
Red, we've got trouble.
Get all the sheep first!
- Take the frog!
- Red, save Granny!
Stop them from getting the Super Truffle!
You're on your own!
Nicky, are you OK?
Hello?
!
Nick!
Filthy swine!
We 're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Up next, carnivores who abandon their partners when they really need them.
Cowards or complete dirtbags?
Now, that's where /disagree with you, Tony.
Wolves are just plain untrustworthy.
Isn't that right, Mr. Pig?
Coming up next, Shark Week.
Because as bad as sharks are, they're still not wolves.
- He's dead, Jim.
- But how the... ?
Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a doc...
All right.
Well, I'd say he was abandoned by an unreliable partner just when he needed one most.
Hey, Twitch.
I know this whole mess with Red is probably bugging you.
You wanna talk about it?
Um...
Hello?
Wolf!
Hey!
Good to see you!
Wait a minute.
OK, guys.
See you later.
Thanks for stopping by.
Come on in!
Nice place you got here.
Smaller.
That's good, saves you money so you can get a good stereo.
I'd buy one, you know, but my trailer's bigger.
"Little Squirrel 'Y
You know, Twitchy, I...
Oh, boy.
I've been thinking.
Could you turn the music down for a second?
I been thinking about Granny and Red.
And I was wondering, did I do the right thing?
Wolf, I have been waiting for you to say that!
You gotta get back in the game!
The HEA needs you!
You got mad skills!
Red needs you!
Nah, she doesn't need me.
Doesn't need you?
Doesn't need you?
!
Red is out there looking for her granny all alone, and she needs your help, even if she won't admit it.
You are dropping some hard science on me.
Word.
Hey, Wolf!
It's the Three Little Pigs, man.
- Remember us?
- Yeah!
We're here to huff and puff and blow your house up!
Sooie!
- He went up in smoke.
- Look at the colors.
Too bad for the big barbecued wolf his life didn't have more meaning.
What do you mean by that, pork pie?
It did have meaning.
- Who...
- ...said...
- ...that?
- Wait, is it a bad sign
- I used the past tense?
- Help me!
- We blew up the wrong house again.
- His every breath mocks us.
That's not good.
A little faster, Twitchy.
Huh?
- Hey, is it busted?
- No, no, no!
It can't be broken!
- We just used it.
- This is why everybody hires
-the Three Bears.
- No, wait, wait!
This is it.
- See?
- Hey, wait!
Where'd they go?
Look, they're trying to get away.
Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!
Oh, muffins.
Double muffins.
- How did you make them so mad?
- It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.
- One wolf en fuego, coming up.
- Look out!
This little wolfie went to pieces!
- You missed again.
- Will you stop swerving?
It's ruining my aim!
Can't help it.
I can't see the road, man.
That loco lobo is liquidated.
They're gaining on us.
Whoa!
Say hello to my little friend.
Hasta la vista, Wolfie.
J* Oh, I was traumatized in the city Yes, I was
J' So I ran far from the city Just because
J* So I 'll be safe and unaffected While I work on convalescing
J* 'Cause nothing unexpectedly, emotionally crippling
J' Or intensely physically painful can happen to me here
J' I say nothing...
J'
- Whoa!
- Sooie!
Oh, no!
No good!
Aah!
Hey.
Do you guys hear something?
Great news!
My doctor says I'm gonna live!
- Uh...
Freeze.
- Power to los puercos.
Oh, yeah.
Muffins.
Oh, no!
Red?
Nicky?
Is anyone here?
Boys, thank goodness you're all right.
- Mr. Flippers!
You OK?
- I've been better.
- But I'm still hopping.
- Wow, Nick, what happened?
They hit this place with everything they had.
We never had a chance.
- What happened to you boys?
- It's was pigs, Mr. Flippers!
It was pigs with knives and guns and rockets...
Running and running!
The special effects were spectacular!
I've never really gotten along with pigs, but we survived, by our wits.
Sooie!
Don't mess with the killer P's!
That handsome wolf sure had it coming.
Let's say we go strap on the feedbag, boys.
- I'm gonna tweet this.
- What's a tweet, man?
Disguises.
They not only work, they save lives.
But this...
One witch couldn't have done all this.
No, she's not working alone.
Every agent we have has been roughed up, kidnapped, scared off or mailed to an uncharted island.
I'm afraid the agency is all but defeated.
What about Red?
Is she OK?
No one's heard from her.
I hate to assume the worst, but...
I never thought I'd say this, Wolf.
I think a wild card is the only thing that can save us now.
You guys didn't really catch me.
I just slipped.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, it still counts, man.
- You bet it does!
Come on, guys, let's take her up to the über jefes and we'll get rewards and promotions and health care and maybe even cookies.
Beards for sale.
Fake beards.
Hey, Porky, how about a demo?
Hey, hey, hey!
We don't like trespassers around here, fuzzy.
But this is a very nice fake beard.
Hey, guys!
You oughta see this!
Surprise, pork belly!
Run for your life, it's a chupacabra!
OW!
Hey!
Ooh.
Big, tough HEA agent.
OK, McGruff.
I got your happy ending right here!
You swine.
Squeal like a pig!
Squeal like a pig!
Jump back!
It's hammer time!
Who's big and bad now, Wolfie?
Actually, I'm more of a lover than a fighter.
Ow!
Hey, this squirrel thinks I'm nuts, man!
- Thanks.
- You, too.
Ha-ha!
Squirrel power!
I think we've overstayed our welcome.
Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, man.
You don't even really sell beards, do you?
What do you mean you had her, then she got away?
Disguises?
Big fake beards?
Oh, well.
That's very understandable.
I...
I'm not angry.
I...
I promise I am not angry.
What?
Yes, you may have a cookie.
Little Miss Reddy Two-Shoes got away.
That wolf is helping her again.
How's the truffle coming?
- Make the truffle.
- No.
- Make the truffle!
- Uh-uh.
- You better!
- You didn't say "please."
- Please make the truffle.
- Nope.
- You were always like that, Abigail.
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were!
- Was not.
- Were, too.
- Not well.
Well, we better do something quick.
Red and the Wolf will be here any moment.
Ja, maybe that is exactly what we need.
I don't know why we are laughing.
- You came back.
- Well, I just figured, you obviously don't know how to talk your way into anyplace.
Obviously.
- So Granny's up there somewhere?
- Yeah.
- It's locked down pretty tight.
- So how do we play this?
We're gonna need some muscle to get in there.
I think I know where to get it.
Thank you, thank you.
I love you all.
That is nice.
Now I got to go in now.
Bye.
Hey, Kirk.
Oh, my friends, it's so good to see you!
- It has been too long.
- No, it's been about right.
Did you catch the show tonight?
I was on fire!
The Yodelers have been so good to me.
- Dutch balls?
- We need your help.
We need your courage, we need your muscle...
We need my Yodelers.
Huh?
Before they delighted the world with song, the Happy Yodelers were highly trained mercenaries.
Johann, maps and tactical plans.
Helmut, demolitions expert.
Heidi, security systems and technology.
Klaus handles the receipts.
- We got us a rodent problem.
- He's not wearing any pants.
- Anyone here need an exterminator?
- We're professional exterminators.
Yep, they're probably in the walls by now.
That's a Pantless Norwegian Stink Rat.
Norwegian?
We've seen all kinds of pests in this business.
- You know the worst kind?
- No.
- Kidnappers!
- I can't see, I'm blind!
This is just like the '70s.
"Kung Fu Fighting"]
Take that, schweinehund!
This little piggy is out, and this little piggy is out.
Is anyone else hungry?
Ooh!
Ow!
Broke a nail.
Twitchy!
Great job, little buddy.
Ow!
- Dude!
- Stink Rat?
I can't censor myself when I'm in the moment.
- Heidi's hogging all the pigs.
- Wolf!
Twitchy!
- Here we are.
- Let's go!
- Right behind you.
- Ja, you go and save Granny.
We will take care of all those dastardly fellows.
- Good luck!
- Thanks.
You, too.
Thank goodness and gracious you have come to save us!
- Like angels from heaven!
- Where's the old lady?
In the room at the end of the hallway.
The witch is always shouting at her!
It is so scary here!
If I stay another minute, I may scream!
Scream, I tell you!
Wait.
You two get the kids out of here, I'll find Granny.
- You sure?
- I'd rather know they're safe.
I'll be fine.
We'll rendezvous downstairs.
- Come on, kids.
Let's roll.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Wolf!
I count my lucky stars for you!
I hope you kids learned a valuable lesson.
Never run away from home, never eat a cookie house.
- Never talk to strangers.
- That's right.
Never talk to strangers.
People are never what they seem to be.
Ch, sure, safety first.
Always carry little gas masks, because you never know.
What's that smell?
Perhaps the children are nervous and need to release a little tension.
That's natural.
- Man, that is strong.
- Wow.
That actually smells like gingerbread.
You kids feel dizzy?
My tongue is getting all puffy and I see rainbows. ls that normal?
Granny?
The final ingredient is never written down.
When you're a true Sister of the Hood, you just know.
Luke, trust the Force.
What?
Oh, sorry about that.
Wrong hero quest.
Oh.
Macadamia nuts.
Now we know!
- Ja, Hansel.
- Ja, Gretel.
We're evil, We're evil.
Verushka!
Be a dear and fetch us a bag of... macadamia nuts.
No!
Granny, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
The Super Truffle will now be complete!
Behold the Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!
Granny, I'm sorry.
I really messed up.
Don't be silly, dear.
I'm proud of you.
You knew what that recipe needed.
Only a true Sister would know that.
No, I mean...
I shouldn't have tried to do everything myself.
Now the HEA is gone, and they've got the truffle, and I didn't even rescue you.
I was just so worried about proving I could live up to your example.
I'm sorry.
I let you down.
Why, because things are a little tough right now?
Gooseberries, child.
I've been in much worse situations than this.
You can still turn this around.
A person can never really fail unless they give up.
You fell for our trickery like a fish falls for water.
What have you done with Wolf and Twitchy?
Hey, Twitchy, look over there.
- Help me get over there.
- Yeah!
OK!
Must... gently... hit... buttons!
- Almost got it.
Come on, little buddy.
- No, no, no!
Muffins.
We can't let them leave with those.
I'm sorry, but we have orders to fill for every villain in the world.
Ja, the brochure went out weeks ago.
The truffle's power is, sadly, temporary.
So they will just want more and more.
- And we will become the filthy rich!
- The filthy rich!
- Not if we stop you first.
- Well, of course not.
That is obvious.
If you were to stop us...
Wait a minute.
You wish!
- One for the road, Brother?
- What a delicious idea.
No!
You can't handle the power!
Uh-oh.
I feel the power!
All powerful!
I have the strength of a thousand small boys!
You'll have to be excusing.
We have a world to dominate.
- Ja, no time for the dilly-dally.
- This isn't over.
Giant superpowered German kids.
Did not see that coming.
- The truffle!
It's finally mine!
- Ja, I don't think so.
Hey!
I'm your partner.
We planned this whole thing together.
Oh, did we?
The way I remember it, Brother, it was you, me and a napkin.
Legal documentation?
Yes.
I don't remember signing anything.
Do you, Brother?
- No, no, no.
I don't.
- it's not legal.
- We did not sign anything.
- Oh, look at the face.
You have outlived your usefulness, old woman.
But do not worry.
We will leave a pet for you to do the playing with.
- What pet?
- You can't do this to me!
Talk to the spider, 'cause the kid ain't listening.
No!
Wait!
Come back!
Spider?
Did he say spider?
Now would be a good time to untie us, Verushka.
I got my own problems, Abigail.
Help!
Let me out of here!
Help!
Red, get behind me.
J' Schnitzel!
J'
Huh?
Is that... yodeling?
It sure is.
- It's yodel time!
- Kirk!
Nice entrance.
Go, Yodelers!
I will get Red and Granny.
You want a piece of me?
!
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Hold still!
I'll have you free in a moment!
- Wow!
You've gotten better.
- Why, thank you.
- Come on.
We've got work to do.
- Right behind you.
Heidi rides a spider like a Valkyrie!
What were you thinking?
!
Eight legs is so last year!
- Hurry!
Everyone, grab a leg!
- Good idea, honey!
Go, go, Yodelers!
Whoo!
- Hold her!
- Someone get a really big shoe!
It's working!
That's it.
I'm getting out of here.
She's getting tired!
Hurry, comrades!
We have a 10:00 late show!
Just a little more.
Gotcha!
- Thanks, Kirk.
- Any time, Red.
Nice work there, youngsters.
Love the outfits.
Yodelers, to the Yodelmobile!
Them's some jiggy yodelers.
I've gotcha!
I didn't deserve to be saved.
Especially not by you.
I want you to know you were never number two to me.
Those kids could level the whole city.
With the power of the Super Truffle, no one will be able to stop them.
This is all my fault.
If I'd been more like you, they wouldn't have gotten away.
You don't need to be like anyone, Red.
You're the real deal.
A true Sister of the Hood.
- You really think so?
- I know it.
You already have all the power you need.
Go get 'em, honey.
Go, Red.
Go!
Come on, come on!
Verushka?
You can always come back.
No. it's too late for me.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
What did we miss?
I've gotta get me one of these.
Yes, it suits you.
Let's swing by the hat store and pick out something pointy.
Ooh!
Look at the tiny, little people living their tiny lives.
They have done nothing to deserve our hatred.
Makes our violence that much more senseless.
I know!
I love that about us!
- Holy cheese!
- Oh, look, Sister.
- I almost hit a school bus.
- Double points.
Uh-Oh.
Ooh!
I regret nothing!
You cannot do the beating of us.
We are truffle-powered!
Yeah, well, I've got a few surprises of my own.
Aah!
Is this the end of Hansel?
You are really starting to tick me off.
I'm not done yet.
I am indestructible!
Oh, schnitzel.
OK.
Not my best landing.
Yoo-hoo!
Annoying little red person, look in the sky.
You've got to be kidding me.
- That was really fun.
- Ja, real fun!
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
What is tiny, red and smashed all over?
What is tiny, red and smashed all over who?
- I'll tell you in five seconds.
- You won't get away with this.
Oh, really?
And just who's going to stop us?
Anyone see an aircraft carrier around here?
- Wolf, distract them and I'll get Red.
- Hey there, tubby.
Those shorts make your ankles look fat.
- They do not.
I've very shapely ankles.
- Ja!
- Grab her!
- All aboard!
- Thanks!
- Hey, never leave your wingman.
Come back here!
Sorry!
My bad!
- We're clear.
You can stop swerving.
- I'm trying.
This thing isn't easy to steer, you know.
I'm sticking to motorcycles.
That was sweet!
Let's do it again!
Maybe later.
Come on!
- Uh-oh.
- Olly, oily, oxen free!
- One for the truffle.
- Two because we are so very evil.
Three because I also agree we are evil.
- Four to go!
- To go!
Oh, man.
I thought we were goners for sure.
Wolf, calm down.
We're gonna be OK.
We just need to walk towards each other.
But we've gotta time it very carefully.
- Wolf, throw me your beard!
- This is no time for a disguise!
Just do it.
Now.
Wolf, have I ever told you how much I love your disguises?
Ha.
Sorry, my bad.
Listen, I wanna take a moment to apologize for not being there when you needed me.
No, no, no!
it's OK, Wolf!
it's OK!
No, no, no.
Let me do this.
Granny, thanks to my sloppy work, you got kidnapped.
I'm sorry.
OK.
I forgive you.
Twitchy, I've been using your toothpaste.
I haven't bought a tube of toothpaste in probably four years.
Toothpaste?
!
After all we've been through?
!
You have to tell her how you feel right now!
She needs to hear it!
Not now, Twitchy!
Hang on.
Red, I walked away because I thought you didn't want me around.
I'm sorry.
Wolf, I never could have done any of this without you.
I should have listened to you more, Red,
- instead of doing things my way.
- I kind of like your way.
Sometimes, the right disguise can get you out of a tough jam.
So can the right partner.
Now, that's a good recipe.
- Gum?
- Why not?
- I thought you said we'd be OK!
- I exaggerated!
My life just flashed before my eyes.
It's weird, flashback really does add ten pounds.
What stopped us?
Verushka.
Turns out Bitsy here wasn't so bad after all.
Just needed a friend.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
Those kids are destroying the city.
We have to stop them before they eat any more of those truffles.
Wait a minute.
More truffles.
That's a great idea.
J' Oh, I'm moving off to China Hip, hooray
J* Yes, I'm heading down to Asia where I'll stay
J' 'Cause life here is a burden with the crushing' and the hurtin'
J* So I'm going to the airport where...
I...
J*
I'm alive?
I'm alive!
Yee-haw!
J' Oh, I used to think my life was rotten Now hard times they fall, forgotten
J* Look at me, can't you see This lucky goat's okeydoke!
J'
I have really taken to this giant monster thing.
Ja, we are naturals.
Do you think they compete in giant monstering?
Stop right there.
Drop those truffles and surrender.
Oh, my tummy!
Oh, my tummy!
You cannot dominate us.
A sweet confection has made us unstoppable!
- Run for your lives!
- Hold your ground.
We can't let them get by us.
Next stop, smashy town.
Stop right there.
- Red!
- Get back, Nick.
We'll handle this.
- We?
- Ja, Hansel.
I only see one little girl.
All alone.
She's never alone.
- Thank goodness!
- Last chance, kids.
Drop the truffles and surrender.
Surrender?
We don't do the surrender.
We are unstoppable!
Bring it.
- We're kicking it old-school!
- Alley-oop, Abigail!
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
- Hey!
Stop that!
- You are making us angry!
Hey, tubby!
Over here!
OK, Twitchy, let them have it.
- Stop with the shoving!
- Alley-oop!
- Red, coming at you!
- I got it, Granny!
- Go, Red!
Go!
- You cannot be defeating us!
Go ahead, run away like a little girl!
What did you call me?
No, Red!
Keep going!
- Hm.
- Ja, you just keep the running away.
Like a scared little girl.
Red?
Are you OK, honey?
Granny...
I'm sorry.
We did the tricking of you, you silly little girl.
That's just really great!
Now they can get away.
Or worse, they could figure out that if they eat more truffles, they would become completely unstoppable.
- Really?
- Wolf!
Did I say that out loud?
What have you done?
We'll never stop them now.
- Don't worry, Nicky.
- All part of the plan.
- Plan?
What plan?
- Relax, we got this covered.
Watch and learn.
We are all powerful!
Wait for it.
Brother, what is happening?
See, kids, you shouldn't overdo sweets.
Those Super Truffles are also super high in fat and calories.
I'm stuck.
Oh, schnitzel.
- My word.
- See, Nicky, one truffle makes you super, but a whole batch, and you're as helpless as a beach ball.
Those two won't give us any more trouble.
Does this street make my butt look fat?
You know, a lesser wolf would say they finally got their just desserts.
- But not you.
- No, not me.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to a treadmill.
If you do not have a treadmill, one will be provided for you.
- You have the right to broccoli.
- Not broccoli!
Nice work, agents.
With a little rehabilitation and a lot of exercise, we may still be able to show those kids the way home.
Granny, I'll need you to get me in touch with the Sisters of the Hood.
We've got agents to round up and an agency to rebuild.
- I think we could use their help.
- The Sisters are always ready.
Aren't we, Verushka?
Especially with everything back where it should be.
Calling all agents.
A 714 in progress.
Reports of 10,000 mice chasing a suspect.
See the man with the flute.
What the heck?
it's on the way.
- Ooh!
I'm driving!
- Says who?
- Go get 'em, agents.
- That's my girl.
Hey, on the way, we should stop for some disguises.
Yeah, I know just the place.
So you sticking around a while or going back to finish your training?
- Nah, I'm good here.
- Another happy ending.
- Let's roll, partner.
- Anything you say, partner.
"You Know it"]
You know, Twitchy, I...
Could you turn the music down for a second?
Uh...
No.
"Inseparable"]
- Ja, Hansel.
- Ja, Gretel.
We're evil, We're...
something else that rhymes with evil.
"Little Squirrel "]
That was sweet!
Let's do it again!
Maybe later.
"Perfect Two"]
Hey, girls.
Let's call it a night.
HOODWINKED TOO!
HOOD VS.
EVIL
Once upon a time, there were four unlikely heroes.
Red Riding Hood, her granny, the not so Big Bad Wolf, and an over-caffeinated squirrel called Twitchy.
Together, they defeated the evil plans of a vey bad little bunny, and came to work for me.
My name is Nicky, and I run the Happily Ever After Agency, an organization dedicated to making happy endings for everyone.
As we say in the HEA, "It's not just a fairy tale, it's an adventure."
Recently, Red took a leave of absence to train at a secret location
Paddy Whack, cover the rear.
This left the team in a bit of disarray, just as we were about to meet a terrible threat, not only to the HEA, but to happy endings everywhere.
It started one night when we received an anonymous tip that two children were being held in a gingerbread house by a witch with a wicked appetite.
Alpha Leader, witch sighted in window.
Which window?
- Affirmative.
- What?
Rescue Team Alpha, stand by for go order.
Agent Fuzzy moving into position.
Nick Knack, take point.
Paddy Whack, cover the rear.
Suspect is enchanted and extremely dangerous.
- Roger.
- Who's Roger?
Alpha Leader here, confirmed Mother Goose.
Rescue Team standing by.
Looks like Red's a no-show.
Again.
Wolf, we talked about this.
Red's on assignment.
And I'm supposed to be at the DMV, but I showed up.
Look, dog, I know you miss her.
We all do.
But those poor kids are going to become baked goods any minute now.
I need you to concentrate on what's going on here.
Yo, Froggy, what's the story on Red Riding Rogue?
Wolf, she is training secretly.
- What kind of secret training?
- Not now.
OK, OK.
You wanna reassign Red, it's your agency.
- Thank you.
- So we all agree
- that I don't need any secret training.
- Wolf!
My talent comes naturally.
Wolf!
Get off the channel!
Those kids don't have much time.
Don't sweat it, Granny Dynamite.
With Red gone, I need to step up.
- So I called out the big guns.
- What?
This is not good!
We might have a problem here, sir!
Put it on the screen.
No!
They wouldn't!
Alpha Team, we've got something small and fast, scurrying up the side of the house.
Roger, Goose, I'll get a gander.
On the job.
Love my job.
Good job.
It's not just a job, it's an adventure.
Hey, Granny, how you doing?
Bye-bye!
- What are you two up to?
- You like recipes, don't you?
Try this.
A cup of hot wolf, a pinch of screwy squirrel and a dash of disguise.
Rescue pie.
My own recipe.
- Wolf, no!
- Thank me later!
That's not a rope.
Not rope, not rope.
Not rope, not rope.
Not rope!
Rope!
Twitchy, what do you think you're doing up there?
The wolf's plan.
I'll slip through the chimney.
She'll never see me coming.
- It's a great job...
- What is he saying?
Translate that.
I have an advantageous position from which to breach our suspect's gingerbread home.
Uh-oh.
I think the fan is about to be hit with the doody.
I'm going in!
Right now!
I am going in.
Negative.
Do not proceed.
Do not proceed.
Now, listen to me, Twitchy...
Mammals!
Oh, please!
We did not mean to trespass into your delicious cookie house!
Ja, we were only searching for goodies for this...
Silence!
Building inspector.
You know, it's against housing codes to live in any dessert bigger than a cupcake.
I need to see your permits and a list of ingredients.
That better not be custard.
Don't worry, kids!
I'm here to rescue you!
Yeah, me, I got the good guys!
- They're all hiding outside.
- Little squirrel, I am Hansel.
Ja, and I am Gretel.
You must hurry.
The witch will soon return.
She'll eat us all for supper!
She says chicken tastes like children!
Ja!
OK, OK, I'm on the case.
He's in trouble!
Move in!
Move in!
Come on, you goldbricks!
You wanna live forever?
- Get the door!
- Just get more puffs!
I think it's weakening.
Agents, take a bite out of crime.
Wolf, this entire operation is a shambles.
I know, but I can fix it.
- She got the kids!
- You're alive!
Now, we'll never catch up with her.
- Sweet ride!
- Boys?
Sorry, goodies, but this is a dinner flight.
Help us!
She has flavorful marinades!
Oh, no, you didn't!
Come on, Twitch.
- Buckle up, homies.
It's on!
- No, wait!
Don't just...
Get some backup in the air, now!
Whoa!
Ten and two, Granny!
I'm regretting that burrito.
Help us!
She has put us in little cages!
It is dehumanizing!
- We are like delicious veal!
- You'll never save them!
- Tree in the way!
- Oh, put on your man pants, Wolfie.
- Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray...
- Whoo-hoo!
Can we go back for my stomach?
It's pink, shaped like a football.
- Has my lunch in it.
- Oh, knuckle up, dog.
Mother Goose to base.
Mother Goose to base.
We are in pursuit of witch.
Stand by.
- Better catch me, I'm getting peckish.
- That witch is whack.
Wolf, you think you can handle a bike like this?
Sure, I think I could if I had to.
I went through my bad boy phase.
Road a bike, greased my hair back, lived over Richie Cunningham's garage, water-skied over a shark tank.
Those were some happy days.
Great, 'cause she's all yours, dog.
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
- Hi, Granny.
- Hey, young kids.
I've gotcha.
No!
I've got you!
No worries, Twitch.
Dog is your co-pilot.

You have the right to a fairy godmother.

Whoa!
You have the right to get some flying lessons.
Don't lose them.
Now turn right.
Your other right!
Your other other right!
Stay low, stay low!
Mammals.
There they are, there they are!
There they go, you passed them.
You passed them!
Why did you pass them?
Calm down.
You got the metabolic rate of a hummingbird.
I've got me a foolproof Granny rescue plan.
Twitchy, do you think you could handle a bike like this?
No, no, bad idea!
I can't reach the pedals!
Be seeing you, little buddy.
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
OK, I can taste my own butt.
Saw that coming.
Oh, look!
Your doggie's trying to save you!
Don't worry, Granny, I got ya!
- No, Wolf, don't!
It's a trap!
- I got ya, I got ya.
- Oh!
OK, I don't got ya.
- We need help.
Get Red!
- She'll know what to do!
- Hey, I'm handling this rescue!
- Everything's under control!
- You can't do it alone!
Hey!
I'm alive!
- You almost saved her.
- I got served.
This whole thing is my fault.
None of this would have happened if...
- If Red were here?
- Well, she's not here, is she?
Nicky Flippers' little superstar is far, far... far away.
Far, far, far... far away.
Far... far away.
- Yeah, yeah, I get it!
- Just saying it's quite a ways.
Uh...
Hi.
So you think you can deliver that basket of goodies across my bridge, do you?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, no, no!
You did not just say that.
I did not hear that!
There ain't no way my bridge is being crossed by some muffin-delivering, red-hood-wearing, fairy-tale-cliché, little girl.
Get up outta here!
Bring it.
I'm about to get you!
Oh!
Hey!
Oh!
- No, no, no!
- See?
I told you!
I win again.
It's 'cause I'm so evil.
Mm!
I even taste evil.
Ooh!
I taste just like chicken.
Chicken and evil!
I'm gonna do my little evil chicken dance.
Huh?
Hello!
Is the fight over?
Did you mean to jump off the bridge?
Huh?
Bye-bye.
Ooh!
That's cheating!
That is so cheating!
You running 'cause you know you can't beat me!
Your granny never would've run away like a scared little chicken girl!
- What did you just say?
- You heard me.
I said your granny would be ashamed of you, 'cause you running like a teeny, tiny, helpless, little girl!
Oh, muffins.
Oh!
Ow!
- Take that!
And that!
- Was it something I said?
Ooh!
That's my corn!
Aah!
I kinda like that.
Enough!
Check, please.
The test is over.
The delivery is incomplete.
I win again!
I am the greatest!
I'm the prettiest ballerina in the whole fruit cup!
Yes, Senator, that is my monkey.
His name is Rumpelstiltskin, but it's a secret.
Don't tell him I told you.
I'm coming to the light, Mama.
Show me the Seven-Layer Kick.
Show me the Spatula!
Red, I know you came with much to prove, but your task was to deliver the basket.
You heard what he said about my granny!
Moss used your desire to please Abigail as just a test.
A Sister finds her own path, her true inner power.
Besides, honey, we're starting to run low on combat instructors.
Oh, come on.
Really!
I barely touched him.
Why, fidlee dee, Mr. Butler.
What brings you to Tara?
- I like Tootsie Rolls.
- He'll be fine.
Hm...
Sorry, I should take this.
- Hello?
- Red?
It's Nicky.
Nicky?
What is it?
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
It's about your grandmother.
Why would anyone want to kidnap my granny?
Red, at the end of every Sister's training, she faces the ancient trial by truffle, in which the student attempts to recreate the Sisterhood's most powerful culinary confection.
For over a thousand years that recipe has been our secret, its making understood only by the best of us.
What has that got to do with Granny?
Very few Sisters complete the truffle, one of them was your grandmother, Abigail Puckett.
The power of this goodie is so great, it must be ever kept from those who would misuse it.
Like those wannabes at the Food Network.
Holla!
Rachael Ray's the devil.
This is where you keep all the recipes?
No, just the one.
The Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!
But around the kitchen, honey, we just call it the Super Truffle!
Cool!
What makes it so super?
Anyone who eats it becomes unstoppable, in strength and thought and speed.
- Sounds good.
- Too good!
So... how did you make the recipe invisible?
Oh, muffins.
Battle stations!
Man your posts!
Sound the alarm!
Secure the gates!
Somebody get me my rolling pin!
We must hurry.
Whoever stole the recipe will be trying to complete the truffle.
We must find and stop them before they do.
Before they find the secret ingredient.
- Secret ingredient?
What is it?
- Well, it's...
Oh, no, you don't.
The final ingredient is never written down.
- Or even spoken.
- Then how does anyone know it?
When you're a true Sister of the Hood, you just know.
That must be why they kidnapped Abigail.
I've gotta find her.
Red, the task of saving your granny is yours alone.
But, child, I fear it may be more danger than you are ready for.
It doesn't matter.
She's my granny, I've gotta save her.
You have learned much.
The Sisterhood is in your blood.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
Right?
Red is still finding her true path.
- She is not ready.
- Yeah, I know.
For a complete nut muffin, that witch sure ties a good knot.
Did somebody say "nut muffin"?
Sounds delicious.
My dinner was interrupted, and I could use a little snack.
- Comfypoo, Abigail?
- Have we met before?
Was it the '60s?
The '60s are kind of a blur.
What?
!
Why, no!
You'd remember meeting someone as evil as me!
Why, look at these glowing red eyes and big scary mask!
Your goodie friends won't find you here, Abigail.
So you might as well relax and stay for dinner.
- You want me to make you dinner?
- Oh, how nice of you to offer.
Let me see.
What am I in the mood for?
Day-old sushi?
Dutch balls?
Turducken?
I'm more in the mood for a chocolate truffle!
A truffle?
Sorry, never learned to make that.
Never?
Never studied with the Sisterhood of Kung Fu Bakers?
Never learned the secret ingredient to an ancient recipe so powerful it makes one invincible?
Darn!
I really had a taste for that.
How do you know about that?
That recipe is forbidden.
Forbidden, is it?
Oh.
Well, that's too bad.
Well, then it's a good thing I have it written down.
See?
Do you want it?
Do you?
Take it.
Oh.
Oh, you can't.
You're tied to a chair.
Oh, too bad!
Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
That's right, Abigail.
I have everything but the secret ingredient,
- and you're going to give it to me.
- What?
You think I'm just gonna bake one up for you?
Not gonna happen.
You won't?
All right.
I guess I'll just have to cook up something else.
Ooh.
Sorry.
I love that show.
- She's getting us ready for the baking!
- I'm too young to be a strudel!
So, Abigail, what's for dinner?
I'll need a titanium mixing bowl.
...search for Granny Puckett, highest priority.
What is the status of Mother Hubbard's cupboard?
Someone update Granny's Facebook profile to "witchnapped."
Butcher and baker cleared.
We're questioning the candlestick maker.
I'm not saying they shouldn't work here, I'm just saying they're delicious.
Ooh!
Wolf, thanks for taking such good care of my granny.
Yeah, my finest hour.
I'm shopping the movie rights.
But maybe if you'd been around to look after the old girl yourself,
- I wouldn't have had to.
- If I...
I was training.
- While you've been playing kung fu...
- You know that thing you do...
Awkward.
Red, it's good to see you.
There's been a rash of robberies.
The stolen items are from that list of Super Truffle ingredients you sent us.
- So the witch has been shopping?
- We think so.
A surveillance camera caught the latest incident.
Blue, pull up the Muffet footage.
Whoa!
Did you see the size of that mushroom?
We're gonna need to hit the streets, find out who's hiring the muscle.
Indeed.
We think many of the suspects are associates of a shady operator known as The Giant.
He's a reputed smuggler, a juggler, a robber, a cobbler, a picker, a grinner, a restaurateur, and blogs about animated films.
- He should get a life.
- Indeed.
He runs the Beanstalk Club in Big City.
I want the two of you to check it out.
- What?
Are you kidding?
- Me and her?
Whoa!
Hop back here a second, Flippers.
You mean the both of us?
Granny never needed a partner, and I don't either.
I guess she's right about that, maybe.
Red, you're not going anywhere without backup.
And you, you need to shuffle your wild-card antics to the bottom of the deck.
No more stunts, no more cheap disguises.
You two are partners.
Get used to it.
All right, road trip!
Hey, I'm driving here!
Big City is home to great shopping, dining, and two professional sports teams:
the Golden Geese of the National Enchantment League and what was formerly the Denver Nuggets.
- What are you doing?
- Reading about the big burg,
- in case we get a chance to sightsee.
- We're not here to sightsee.
- We're here to find Granny.
- Fine.
But you're missing out on a chance to visit the Old Mother Hubbard Museum.
Largest collection of empty cupboards in the world, which is weird.
OK, let's get something straight.
We're doing this operation by the book.
exactly the way Granny would, plain and simple.
- I just had a book.
- Wrong book.
- Hey, it was a good book.
- All right, look...
Looky, looky, over here!
Hey, it's Kirk.
He's really hit the big time.
We should catch the show.
No.
We are going to stay focused and follow procedure.
- They won't expect that.
- Look, you two, we are definitely not here to hang around in loud, sleazy nightclubs, listening to cheesy lounge singers.

- So, what's the plan, Hoodie?
- We talk to Jimmy 10-Strings.
He's one of Granny's regular informants.
If The Giant's behind the stolen ingredients, that harp will sing in more ways than one.
- We need to...
- Ply him with my lupine charisma?
- Gotcha.
I'm on it.
- Hold on!
I'll do the talking.
Granny told me how to handle guys like this.
The trick is not...
Huh?
- Wolf?
- Go, Wolfie!
Go, Wolfie!
Aah, stop that!
Will you two focus?
OK, OK!
Just trying to blend in with the crowd.
- Just stay here.
- This will end well.
I'll be at the bar.
Merci beaucoup, and my personal favorite, danke schön.
- Hey, Jimmy 10-Strings.
- Sweetheart, I do autographs
- after the show, OK?
- I work with Granny,
- and I need you to do me a favor.
- For Granny?
Anything!
I hear your boss has his goons stealing turffle ingredients.
What do you know?
What?
!
Well, I never.
I mean, who told you...
OK, listen up.
A couple of days ago, I overheard The Giant talking about a big order for someone called...
Uh-oh.
- I didn't tell her a thing.
- Get your hooves off me.
Tell the boss I told her nothing.
I should sing something nice at her funeral.
- Tell 10-Strings
- Up there.
to limit his singing to exclusively musical vocalizations, or I shall be forced to tune his strings
- until they snap.
Capisce?
- Got it, boss.
You, with the red hanky on her head.
Are you trying to play my harp?
You could end up singing with the angels, playing my harp.
- Tell me about the witch.
- What witch?
Which witch?
- Huh.
Good one, boss.
- Did you just laugh at me?
Do I amuse you?
- Am I some sort of clown to you?
- No, I...
I hate my job.
- Who are you?
- I'm your worst nightmare.
A Sister with a badge.
And I'm onto you.
Excuse me.
Did I just hear your tiny, little voice correctly?
Did you just come into my house, hassle my harp, interrupt my dinner and tell me my hands are dirty?
!
I eat sandwiches bigger than you, little girl!
Did someone say sandwiches?
'Cause I'll take one.
And I'll bet you'll take five.
Hundred, that is!
'Cause you're a big boy.
I said big boy, son.
Who the Mother Goose is this supposed to be?
Phineas Newcastle McGee, wealthy business tycoon.
Didn't we meet at the big convention?
MobCon, the mobsters' convention.
Wasn't that you?
the big conman convention.
Funniest thing.
I show up, nobody there!
Empty building!
Guess I should've seen that coming.
We are gonna die.
I love this guy!
This guy is hilarious!
You two, have some dinner with me.
Come here.
Hey, 10-Strings, you know what I wanna hear.
You bet, big guy.
Two, three, six.

Uh-oh.
- Distract The Giant.
I'll get the harp.
I don't like most little people.
Hey, you know what?
- I like you.
- Little people.
Can't trust 'em.
Hey, everybody's little to me.
Right?
- Am I right?
- Yeah.
- Oh, Stanley.
- Please, Blanche.
Not while I'm eating.
Jill, sweetheart!
Go fetch us another pail of water.
Sorry!
Sorry.
Excuse me, coming through.

There is no proof that I ever ate anybody!

Hey, where you going?
Come on, come on!
The night's still young, right?
Sorry.
Love to stay, can't.
Gotta go.
Early start tomorrow.
Yeah, I got my Pilates workout, she's got a paper route.
- This is not how you steal a show!
- Hey!
Those skeevosos are trying to put the bag on my harp!
Get after them!
You got the wrong guy.
Frank Jr.'s down the street.
Did anybody notice that the guy I work for is an insane giant?
Put down the harp!
He's under contract!
Now you've done it.
He's mad!
We're dead.
- And I didn't even get my encore.
- Time to go!
And I still have 38 payments left on myself.
- Yee-haw!
- What am I paying you pasty mooks for?
Get after them!
- Hey, do you get paid?
- Not really.
No.
- Start singing, 10-Strings.
- Is this your first time doing this?
'Cause Granny just slips me 20 bucks.
I'll show those pipsqueaks who's the big man around here!
Putting fingers on my property!
Like that Jack guy.
I'm still picking pieces of him out of my teeth!
I'll grind up their bones to make my pasta fazool!
Tell us who The Giant's getting ingredients for.
Yeah, well, you know The Giant is not usually very happy about those who spill his personal beans.
Maybe I could tell you something about Goldilocks.
That is not her natural hair color.
- Really?
- I knew it!
- Just tell us who ordered the thefts.
- OK, OK already.
I'll tell ya.
Every day The Giant gets a call for a new ingredient from...
- ...from the Bunny.
- The Bunny?
- Not the Bunny!
Not the Bunny!
- Yes, the Bunny.
He calls in the orders, and that's all I know.
If you wanna hear me sing anymore, you'll have to catch my show.
Fe-fi-fo-fum!
I gotcha now!
- Jump!
- Are you crazy?
We're a mile up.
- Don't argue!
Just jump!
- OK.
This is not how you treat an entertainer of my caliber.
Hey, Twitchy, you didn't bring a parachute by any chance, did ya?
Uh...
No.
Gum?
No, thanks.
I'm trying to cut down.
Gotcha!

- I think that went off pretty smooth.
- What was that disguise supposed to be?
- Fake beards are classic.
- You look like a deranged Santa Claus.
Santa gave me that beard.
Hello, Clarice.
- Who's Clarice?
- She is.
Hi, Clarice!
- Enjoy the book, Boingo.
- We share a love of literature.
So, Red, I see that stray dog is still following you around.
Don't let him mess with your head.
Let me guess.
You're the brains, and you're... not the brains?
Who's up for hasenpfeffer.
We know you've been working with The Giant.
Oh, really?
How?
I don't get out much.
- Talked to any witches lately?
- Which witch?
Oh, you mean the witch that took your granny.
When she said she wanted to take out old beehive,
I said, "Now, there's something we've got in common."
She did mention something about outwitting some incompetent, stupid, meddling, jerkfaced HEA agents!
I assumed she was talking about you two.
- I wasn't there.
- No, of course you weren't.
Relax, Fido.
You've got Little Red Riding Hood to protect you now.
- I do OK on my own.
- Is that before or after
- I bail you out?
- You weren't doing a lot of bailing
- when I saved your cape at the bar!
- I had everything under control.
- Another minute and I would've...
- Have been pâté!
- I don't need your help.
- Oh, really?
- Watch me.
- Ow!
No!
Not the ears!
You didn't even say the magic word.
- Abracadabra.
- Ow!
That's not even...
Well, actually, that is the magic word.
I don't know where Granny is.
The witch sends me notes, and I put the word out.
- Tell me where they are.
- Ow.
Ow.
You're still mad about me trying to kill you all those times, aren't you?
- Hey, books!
- Hey, no, wait!
Don't read that!
Nobody reads books anymore.
Movies are always better.
Especially sequels.
How does the witch get messages into your books?
Why don't you ask her?
She was just here.
The cleaning lady!
Come on, hurry!
She can't have gotten far!
Oh, she was right under our noses!
Aah!
I'm blind!
No, wait.
A little help.
See?
I said it before.
Disguises work.
Would you stop it already!
If you hadn't distracted me in there, I would have...
- Oh, so this is my fault, too?
- Yeah, it is.
That's great, coming from someone who just took off to play Crouching Baker.
I stayed to do the job.
It's not like this is easy.
I'm doing my best here.
Yeah, well, your best got my granny and two innocent kids kidnapped!
OK, fine!
You're right!
It did.
This is all my fault.
My screw-ups are putting everyone in danger.
I'll probably get you nabbed next.
Happy?
A little help!
Rolling now!
That's not what I meant.
You've made your point, Red.
This partnership's a disaster.
I better leave before I do any more damage.
I've always been a lone wolf.
Tell Nicky I quit.
Sorry, Red.
He's my ride.
Do I sound weird?
I sound weird to me!
I sound weird to me!
How is the truffle coming, Abigail?
I can't work with such inferior equipment.
This mixing machine is ten years old, and the measuring cups are cracked.
I need exact measurements!
I can't work miracles with this stuff!
You should try, Abigail, or those little bratwursts will be on the menu tonight!
Your Tibetan cocoa sticks.
These did not come easy.
The Happily Ever After Agency is everywhere!
Only three?
I need four.
- Four?
!
- I can't make it without four sticks.
I have lost two Sherpas in those mountains already.
Do you know how much a Sherpa costs?
They've got a union.
I've gotta pay for goats.
I've gotta pay for the little hats.
There's per diem.
You want this done right, or don't you?
You bring me a decent flour sifter and some real measuring cups, then I might be able to remember the final ingredient.
Fine!
But you better get cooking, Abigail.
Four cocoa sticks.
Just take two cocoa sticks and break 'em in half!
Oh, don't you worry.
I'll get cooking all right.
Boo-yah!
Still got it.
Get the remote.
Time for Rachael Ray.
Leave me alone.
I'm trying to fill the awful emptiness that lives deep inside me with food.
Children, I found you.
Granny Puckett!
- How did you get out?
- I've got my ways, little one.
Come on, we gotta get you two out of here.
The exit is there.
We saw the witch go through that way.
Show me.
But we gotta be quiet.
The exit is straight ahead.
Don't be suspicious.
Continue moving.
- What?
What is this?
- It's a big cage, dum-dum.
- Huh?
What's she doing here?
- You tell us.
I thought you said she was locked up tight.
- She was!
She just needed more...
- More tools to do the escaping with?
You mean all this time, you two were never...?
In danger?
No!
We're not even kidnapped!
- We're the kidnappers!
- Ja!
You've been hoodwinked!
- Too!
Ja, Hansel!
- Ja, Gretel!
We're evil!
We're...
something else that rhymes with evil!
You two are the nastiest children I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.
Don't blame us.
It is society's fault.
We had the displeasure of being the children of a poor woodcutter.
We never had any sweets for the snacking.
But now we will have the greatest dessert of all time, to make us unstoppable!
Well, this chef just turned in her apron.
You'll never get the secret ingredient.
Don't worry.
We have ways of making you bake.
Verushka, keep your scary mask on!
You want to look spooky or not?
- And turn your eyes back on.
- Oh.
Oh, right.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Very scary.
Now, can you keep her locked up this time?
- Yes!
- And remember, we are in charge, Verushka.
Verushka?
Verushka Von Vine?
You finally remember me.
How nice!
Perhaps you also remember this.
Is that what this is about?
It all started when we were Sisters together in the Sisterhood.
You were always so good at everything.
I tried so hard to beat you, but you were always better than me.
Then came that terrible day of the ancient recipe ritual, when the...
Why are you telling me this?
I was there.
Abigail!
This is my big, super-evil-villain moment!
- So will you just shut up?
!
- OK, OK.
Now, where was I?
Started at the Sisterhood, always number two...
Did I get to the part about the truffle?
- Yes.
- I couldn't make that stinking truffle!
But you did!
And I knew then that you were the reason I was a big pile of number two!
So I stole the great recipe, and I spent the last 60 years searching for the secret ingredient!
You really practiced this speech?
But then Hansel and Gretel found me.
Together we devised a plan to kidnap you and complete the truffle recipe.
My attempts to find the secret ingredient were all failures!
Sure, I did produce a few other things.
A poison apple, a sleeping spell, a way to turn men into frogs.
She's completely insane.
You should see what she's done to the cat.
Oh, that's disturbing on so many levels.
You don't have to be like this, Verushka.
I'll never play second fiddle to you again, Abigail.
I've been number two long enough.
Once I finally have the Super Truffle,
I will taste the sweet, chocolaty victory of being number one!
OK, all I need to do is find this D.C.T. place.
How hard could that be?
Muffins!
I give up.
I'll never find it.
Hey!
Hoodie in the hood!
Got a dollar?
What?
Who?
Hey, down here.
It's better to give than to receive.
So give me a dollar and you'll feel better.
- No.
I'm just looking for...
- Looking?
A quest?
I love...
Ooh.
You work out?
You are looking for the big golden...
No, wait.
The magic.
You're looking for the magic...
OK, I got nothing.
What's on your mind?
My granny!
She's out there somewhere, and I'm totally out of clues.
Perhaps she's been turned into stone.
What?
Turned to...
How do you even come up with that?
Who says that?
- You get what you pay for.
- All I've got is this stupid tag.
- "D.C.T." You tried Dental Clown Tech?
- Yes!
I've tried everywhere.
Yeah, yeah, it's tough.
Wait a second.
Wait a second!
- Dark Castle Towers!
- Dark Castle?
My brothers and I used to live there.
Then there was this whole thing with the farmer's wife and a clock.
- Can you show me?
- Sure.
Follow me.
I thought I told you to stay off my corner.
The journey there is long and full of dangers.
Oh, no, there it is.
My bad.
- Nicky, it's Red.
- Red!
- Good to hear from you.
- I need...
That is...
- Is Wolf there?
- No, we haven't heard from him.
Why?
- What's the trouble?
- Dark Castle Towers, that's what.
It's an old hotel on South Castle Street.
I'm sure Granny and the kids are in there.
- But it's really heavily guarded.
- And you need help to get them out?
No, no!
I've totally got it.
No problemo.
- I just thought...
- I'll alert the squad leaders.
We'll have a full rescue team there immediately.
- Give me as many details as you can.
- OK.
Oh, no!
What are we gonna do?
The whole HEA is going to be at our front door, and our back door, and our windows!
We're practically crawling with windows!
I think some of the windows even have little doors...
Stop!
Chill out.
Ja, ja.
Chill a pill and then take one.
We have always known that the Happily Ever After Agency would be a threat.
- Our forces are already in place.
- Lesson four:
Eliminate your obstacles.
Eliminate?
But what do you mean?
Send in the pigs!
Good work, Red.
That's the break we were looking for.
- What?
- Nicky?
Is everything all right?
Uh, I'm not sure.
Stand by.
- Ops, status report.
- Sir, we are being attacked!
Nicky, what is it?
What's going on?
Red, we've got trouble.
Get all the sheep first!
- Take the frog!
- Red, save Granny!
Stop them from getting the Super Truffle!
You're on your own!
Nicky, are you OK?
Hello?
!
Nick!
Filthy swine!
We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed.
Up next, carnivores who abandon their partners when they really need them.
Cowards or complete dirtbags?
Now, that's where I disagree with you, Tony.
Wolves are just plain untrustworthy.
Isn't that right, Mr. Pig?
Coming up next, Shark Week.
Because as bad as sharks are, they're still not wolves.
- He's dead, Jim.
- But how the...?
Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a doc...
All right.
Well, I'd say he was abandoned by an unreliable partner, just when he needed one most.
Hey, Twitch.
I know this whole mess with Red is probably bugging you.
You wanna talk about it?
Um...
Hello?
Wolf!
Hey!
Good to see you!
Wait a minute.
OK, guys.
See you later.
Thanks for stopping by.
Come on in!
Nice place you got here.
Smaller.
That's good, saves you money so you can get a good stereo.
I'd buy one, you know, but my trailer's bigger.
You know, Twitchy, I...
Oh, boy.
I've been thinking.
Could you turn the music down for a second?
I been thinking about Granny and Red.
And I was wondering, did I do the right thing?
Wolf, I have been waiting for you to say that!
You gotta get back in the game!
The HEA needs you!
You got mad skills!
Red needs you!
Nah, she doesn't need me.
Doesn't need you?
Doesn't need you?
!
Red is out there looking for her granny all alone, and she needs your help, even if she won't admit it.
You are dropping some hard science on me.
Word.
Hey, Wolf!
It's the Three Little Pigs, man.
- Remember us?
- Yeah!
We're here to huff and puff and blow your house up!
Sooie!
- He went up in smoke.
- Look at the colors.
Too bad for the big barbecued wolf his life didn't have more meaning.
What do you mean by that, pork pie?
It did have meaning.
- Who...
- ...said...
- ...that?
- Wait, is it a bad sign
- I used the past tense?
- Help me!
- We blew up the wrong house again.
- His every breath mocks us.
That's not good.
A little faster, Twitchy.
Huh?
- Hey, is it busted?
- No, no, no!
It can't be broken!
- We just used it.
- This is why everybody hires
- the Three Bears.
- No, wait, wait!
This is it.
- See?
- Hey, wait!
Where'd they go?
Look, they're trying to get away.
Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!
Oh, muffins.
Double muffins.
- How did you make them so mad?
- It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.
- One wolf en fuego, coming up.
- Look out!
This little wolfie went to pieces!
- You missed again.
- Will you stop swerving?
It's ruining my aim!
Can't help it.
I can't see the road, man.
That loco lobo is liquidated.
They're gaining on us.
Whoa!
Say hello to my little friend.
Hasta la vista, Wolfie.
♪ Oh, I was traumatized in the city Yes, I was
♪ So I ran far from the city Just because
♪ So I'll be safe and unaffected While I work on convalescing
♪ 'Cause nothing unexpectedly, emotionally crippling
♪ Or intensely physically painful can happen to me here
♪ I say nothing... ♪
- Whoa!
- Sooie!
Oh, no!
No good!
Aah!
Hey.
Do you guys hear something?
Great news!
My doctor says I'm gonna live!
- Uh...
Freeze.
- Power to los puercos.
Oh, yeah.
Muffins.
Oh, no!
Red?
Nicky?
Is anyone here?
Boys, thank goodness you're all right.
- Mr. Flippers!
You OK?
- I've been better.
- But I'm still hopping.
- Wow, Nick, what happened?
They hit this place with everything they had.
We never had a chance.
- What happened to you boys?
- It's was pigs, Mr. Flippers!
It was pigs with knives and guns and rockets...
Running and running!
The special effects were spectacular!
I've never really gotten along with pigs, bit we survived, by our wits.
Sooie!
Don't mess with the killer P's!
That handsome wolf sure had it coming.
Let's say we go strap on the feedbag, boys.
- I'm gonna tweet this.
- What's a tweet, man?
Disguises.
They not only work, they save lives.
But this...
One witch couldn't have done all this.
No, she's not working alone.
Every agent we have has been roughed up, kidnapped, scared off or mailed to an uncharted island.
I'm afraid the agency is all but defeated.
What about Red?
Is she OK?
No one's heard from her.
I hate to assume the worst, but...
I never thought I'd say this, Wolf.
I think a wild card is the only thing that can save us now.
You guys didn't really catch me.
I just slipped.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, it still counts, man.
- You bet it does!
Come on, guys, let's take her up to the über jefes and we'll get rewards and promotions and health care and maybe even cookies.
Beards for sale.
Fake beards.
Hey, Porky, how about a demo?
Hey, hey, hey!
We don't like trespassers around here, fuzzy.
But this is a very nice fake beard.
Hey, guys!
You oughta see this!
Surprise, pork belly!
Run for your life, it's a chupacabra!
Ow!
Hey!
Ooh.
Big, tough HEA agent.
OK, McGruff.
I got your happy ending right here!
You swine.
Squeal like a pig!
Squeal like a pig!
Jump back!
It's hammer time!
Who's big and bad now, Wolfie?
Actually, I'm more of a lover than a fighter.
Ow!
Hey, this squirrel thinks I'm nuts, man!
- Thanks.
- You, too.
Ha-ha!
Squirrel power!
I think we've overstayed our welcome.
Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
Hey, man.
You don't even really sell beards, do you?
What do you mean you had her, then she got away?
Disguises?
Big fake beards?
Oh, well.
That's very understandable.
I...
I'm not angry, I...
I promise I am not angry.
What?
Yes, you may have a cookie.
Little Miss Reddy Two-Shones got away.
That wolf is helping her again.
How's the truffle coming?
- Make the truffle.
- No.
- Make the truffle!
- Uh-uh.
- You better!
- You didn't say "please."
- Please make the truffle.
- Nope.
- You were always like that, Abigail.
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were!
- Was not.
- Were, too.
- Not well.
Well, we better do something quick.
Red and the Wolf will be here any moment.
Ja, maybe that is exactly what we need.
I don't know why we are laughing.
- You came back.
- Well, I just figured, you obviously don't know how to talk your way into anyplace.
Obviously.
- So Granny's up there somewhere?
- Yeah.
- It's locked down pretty tight.
- So how do we play this?
We're gonna need some muscle to get in there.
I think I know where to get it.
Thank you, thank you.
I love you all.
That is nice.
Now I got to go in now.
Bye.
Hey, Kirk.
Oh, my friends, it's so good to see you!
- It has been too long.
- No, it's been about right.
Did you catch the show tonight?
I was on fire!
The Yodelers have been so good to me.
- Dutch balls?
- We need your help.
We need your courage, we need your muscle...
We need my Yodelers.
Huh?
Before they delighted the world with song, the Happy Yodelers were highly trained mercenaries.
Johann, maps and tactical plans.
Helmut, demolitions expert.
Heidi, security systems and technology.
Klaus handles the receipts.
- We got us a rodent problem.
- He's not wearing any pants.
- Anyone here need an exterminator?
- We're professional exterminators.
Yep, they're probably in the walls by now.
That's a Pantless Norwegian Stink Rat.
Norwegian?
We've seen all kinds of pests in this business.
- You know the worst kind?
- No.
- Kidnappers!
- I can't see, I'm blind!
This is just like the '70s.
Take that, schweinehund!
This little piggy is out, and this little piggy is out.
Is anyone else hungry?
Ooh!
Ow!
Broke a nail.
Twitchy!
Great job, little buddy.
Ow!
- Dude!
- Stink Rat?
I can't censor myself when I'm in the moment.
- Heidi's hogging all the pigs.
- Wolf!
Twitchy!
- Here we are.
- Let's go!
- Right behind you.
- Ja, you go and save Granny.
We will take care of all those dastardly fellows.
- Good luck!
- Thanks.
You, too.
Thank goodness and gracious you have come to save us!
- Like angels from heaven!
- Where's the old lady?
In the room at the end of the hallway.
The witch is always shouting at her!
It is so scary here!
If I stay another minute, I may scream!
Scream, I tell you!
Wait.
You two get the kids out of here, I'll find Granny.
- You sure?
- I'd rather know they're safe.
I'll be fine.
We'll rendezvous downstairs.
- Come on, kids.
Let's roll.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Wolf!
I count my lucky stars for you!
I hope you kids learned a valuable lesson.
Never run away from home, never eat a cookie house.
- Never talk to strangers.
- That's right.
Never talk to strangers.
People are never what they seem to be.
Oh, sure, safety first.
Always carry little gas masks, because you never know.
What's that smell?
Perhaps the children are nervous and need to release a little tension.
That's natural.
- Man, that is strong.
- Wow.
That actually smells like gingerbread.
You kids feel dizzy?
My tongue is getting all puffy and I see rainbows.
Is that normal?
Granny?
The final ingredient is never written down.
When you're a true Sister of the Hood, you just know.
Luke, trust the Force.
What?
Oh, sorry about that.
Wrong hero quest.
Oh.
Macadamia nuts.
Now we know!
- Ja, Hansel.
- Ja, Gretel.
We're evil, we're evil.
Verushka!
Be a dear and fetch us a bag of... macadamia nuts.
No!
Granny, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
The Super Truffle will now be complete!
Behold the Norwegian Black Forest Feather Cake Truffle Divine!
Granny, I'm sorry.
I really messed up.
Don't be silly, dear.
I'm proud of you.
You knew what that recipe needed.
Only a true Sister would know that.
No, I mean...
I shouldn't have tried to do everything myself.
Now the HEA is gone, and they've got the truffle, and I didn't even rescue you.
I was just so worried about proving I could live up to your example.
I'm sorry.
I let you down.
Why, because things are a little tough right now?
Gooseberries, child.
I've been in much worse situations than this.
You can still turn this around.
A person can never really fail unless they give up.
You fell for our trickery like a fish falls for water.
What have you done with Wolf and Twitchy?
Hey, Twitchy, look over there.
- Help me get over there.
- Yeah!
OK!
Must... gently... hit... buttons!
- Almost got it.
Come on, little buddy.
- No, no, no!
Muffins.
We can't let them leave with those.
I'm sorry, but we have orders to fill for every villain in the world.
Ja, the brochure went out weeks ago.
The truffle's power is, sadly, temporary.
So they will just want more and more.
- And we will become the filthy rich!
- The filthy rich!
- Not if we stop you first.
- Well, of course not.
That is obvious.
If you were to stop us...
Wait a minute.
You wish!
- One for the road, Brother?
- What a delicious idea.
No!
You can't handle the power!
Uh-oh.
I feel the power!
All powerful!
I have the strength of a thousand small boys!
You'll have to be excusing.
We have a world to dominate.
- Ja, no time for the dilly-dally.
- This isn't over.
Giant superpowered German kids.
Did not see that coming.
- The truffle!
It's finally mine!
- Ja, I don't think so.
Hey!
I'm your partner.
We planned this whole thing together.
Oh, did we?
The way I remember it, Brother, it was you, me and a napkin.
Legal documentation?
Yes.
I don't remember signing anything.
Do you, Brother?
- No, no, no.
I don't.
- It's not legal.
- We did not sign anything.
- Oh, look at the face.
You have outlived your usefulness, old woman.
But do not worry.
We will leave a pet for you to do the playing with.
- What pet?
- You can't do this to me!
Talk to the spider, 'cause the kid ain't listening.
No!
Wait!
Come back!
Spider?
Did he say spider?
Now would be a good time to untie us, Verushka.
I got my own problems, Abigail.
Help!
Let me out of here!
Help!
Red, get behind me.
♪ Schnitzel!
♪
Huh?
Is that... yodeling?
It sure is.
- It's yodel time!
- Kirk!
Nice entrance.
Go, Yodelers!
I will get Red and Granny.
You want a piece of me?
!
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Hold still!
I'll have you free in a moment!
- Wow!
You've gotten better.
- Why, thank you.
- Come on.
We've got work to do.
- Right behind you.
Heidi rides a spider like a Valkyrie!
What were you thinking?
!
Eight legs is so last year!
- Hurry!
Everyone, grab a leg!
- Good idea, honey!
Go, go, Yodelers!
Whoo!
- Hold her!
- Someone get a really big shoe!
It's working!
That's it.
I'm getting out of here.
She's getting tired!
Hurry, comrades!
We have a 10:00 late show!
Just a little more.
Gotcha!
- Thanks, Kirk.
- Any time, Red.
Nice work there, youngsters.
Love the outfits.
Yodelers, to the Yodelmobile!
Them's some jiggy yodelers.
I've gotcha!
I didn't deserve to be saved.
Especially not by you.
I want you to know you were never number two to me.
Those kids could level the whole city.
With the power of the Super Truffle, no one will be able to stop them.
This is all my fault.
If I'd been more like you, they wouldn't have gotten away.
You don't need to be like anyone, Red.
You're the real deal.
A true Sister of the Hood.
- You really think so?
- I know it.
You already have all the power you need.
Go get 'em, honey.
Go, Red.
Go!
Come on, come on!
Verushka?
You can always come back.
No.
It's too late for me.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
What did we miss?
I've gotta get me one of these.
Yes, it suits you.
Let's swing by the hat store and pick out something pointy.
Ooh!
Look at the tiny, little people living their tiny lives.
They have done nothing to deserve our hatred.
Makes our violence that much more senseless.
I know!
I love that about us!
- Holy cheese!
- Oh, look, Sister.
- I almost hit a school bus.
- Double points.
Uh-oh.
Ooh!
I regret nothing!
You cannot do the beating of us.
We are truffle-powered!
Yeah, well, I've got a few surprises of my own.
Aah!
Is this the end of Hansel?
You are really starting to tick me off.
I'm not done yet.
I am indestructible!
Oh, schnitzel.
OK.
Not my best landing.
Yoo-hoo!
Annoying little red person, look in the sky.
You've got to be kidding me.
- That was really fun.
- Ja, real fun!
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
What is tiny, red and smashed all over?
What is tiny, red and smashed all over who?
- I'll tell you in five seconds.
- You won't get away with this.
Oh, really?
And just who's going to stop us?
Anyone see an aircraft carrier around here?
- Wolf, distract them and I'll get Red.
- Hey there, tubby.
Those shorts make your ankles look fat.
- They do not.
I've very shapely ankles.
- Ja!
- Grab her!
- All aboard!
- Thanks!
- Hey, never leave your wingman.
Come back here!
Sorry!
My bad!
- We're clear.
You can stop swerving.
- I'm trying.
This thing isn't easy to steer, you know.
I'm sticking to motorcycles.
That was sweet!
Let's do it again!
Maybe later.
Come on!
- Uh-oh.
- Olly, oily, oxen free!
- One for the truffle.
- Two because we are so very evil.
Three because I also agree we are evil.
- Four to go!
- To go!
Oh, man.
I thought we were goners for sure.
Wolf, calm down.
We're gonna be OK.
We just need to walk towards each other.
But we've gotta time it very carefully.
- Wolf, throw me your beard!
- This is no time for a disguise!
Just do it.
Now.
Wolf, have I ever told you how much I love your disguises?
Ha.
Sorry, my bad.
Listen, I wanna take a moment to apologize for not being there when you needed me.
No, no, no!
It's OK, Wolf!
It's OK!
No, no, no.
Let me do this.
Granny, thanks to my sloppy work, you got kidnapped.
I'm sorry.
OK.
I forgive you.
Twitchy, I've been using your toothpaste.
I haven't bought a tube of toothpaste in probably four years.
Toothpaste?
!
After all we've been through?
!
You have to tell her how you feel right now!
She needs to hear it!
Not now, Twitchy!
Hang on.
Red, I walked away because I thought you didn't want me around.
I'm sorry.
Wolf, I never could have done any of this without you.
I should have listened to you more, Red,
- instead of doing things my way.
- I kind of like your way.
Sometimes, the right disguise can get you out of a tough jam.
So can the right partner.
Now, that's a good recipe.
- Gum?
- Why not?
- I thought you said we'd be OK!
- I exaggerated!
My life just flashed before my eyes.
It's weird, flashback really does add ten pounds.
What stopped us?
Verushka.
Turns out Bitsy here wasn't so bad after all.
Just needed a friend.
Once a Sister, always a Sister.
Those kids are destroying the city.
We have to stop them before they eat any more of those truffles.
Wait a minute.
More truffles.
That's a great idea.
♪ Oh, I'm moving off to China Hip, hooray
♪ Yes, I'm heading down to Asia where I'll stay
♪ 'Cause life here is a burden with the crushing' and the hurtin'
♪ So I'm going to the airport where...
I... ♪
I'm alive?
I'm alive!
Yee-haw!
♪ Oh, I used to think my life was rotten Now hard times they fall, forgotten
♪ Look at me, can't you see This lucky goat's okeydoke!
♪
I have really taken to this giant monster thing.
Ja, we are naturals.
Do you think they compete in giant monstering?
Stop right there.
Drop those truffles and surrender.
Oh, my tummy!
Oh, my tummy!
You cannot dominate us.
A sweet confection has made us unstoppable!
- Run for your lives!
- Hold your ground.
We can't let them get by us.
Next stop, smashy town.
Stop right there.
- Red!
- Get back, Nick.
We'll handle this.
- We?
- Ja, Hansel.
I only see one little girl.
All alone.
She's never alone.
- Thank goodness!
- Last chance, kids.
Drop the truffles and surrender.
Surrender?
We don't do the surrender.
We are unstoppable!
Bring it.
- We're kicking it old-school!
- Alley-oop, Abigail!
Yippie-yi-ki-yay!
- Hey!
Stop that!
- You are making us angry!
Hey, tubby!
Over here!
OK, Twitchy, let them have it.
- Stop with the shoving!
- Alley-oop!
- Red, coming at you!
- I got it, Granny!
- Go, Red!
Go!
- You cannot be defeating us!
Go ahead, run away like a little girl!
What did you call me?
No, Red!
Keep going!
- Hm.
- Ja, you just keep the running away.
Like a scared little girl.
Red?
Are you OK, honey?
Granny...
I'm sorry.
We did the tricking of you, you silly little girl.
That's just really great!
Now they can get away.
Or worse, they could figure out that if they eat more truffles, they would become completely unstoppable.
- Really?
- Wolf!
Did I say that out loud?
What have you done?
We'll never stop them now.
- Don't worry, Nicky.
- All part of the plan.
- Plan?
What plan?
- Relax, we got this covered.
Watch and learn.
We are all powerful!
Wait for it.
Brother, what is happening?
See, kids, you shouldn't overdo sweets.
Those Super Truffles are also super high in fat and calories.
I'm stuck.
Oh, schnitzel.
- My word.
- See, Nicky, one truffle makes you super, but a whole batch, and you're as helpless as a beach ball.
Those two won't give us any more trouble.
Does this street make my butt look fat?
You know, a lesser wolf would say they finally got their just desserts.
- But not you.
- No, not me.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to a treadmill.
If you do not have a treadmill, one will be provided for you.
- You have the right to broccoli.
- Not broccoli!
Nice work, agents.
With a little rehabilitation and a lot of exercise, we may still be able to show those kids the way home.
Granny, I'll need you to get me in touch with the Sisters of the Hood.
We've got agents to round up and an agency to rebuild.
- I think we could use their help.
- The Sisters are always ready.
Aren't we, Verushka?
Especially with everything back where it should be.
Calling all agents.
A 714 in progress.
Reports of 10,000 mice chasing a suspect.
See the man with the flute.
What the heck?
It's on the way.
- Ooh!
I'm driving!
- Says who?
- Go get 'em, agents.
- That's my girl.
Hey, on the way, we should stop for some disguises.
Yeah, I know just the place.
So you sticking around a while or going back to finish your training?
- Nah, I'm good here.
- Another happy ending.
- Let's roll, partner.
- Anything you say, partner.
Subrip: easytobeaman
You know, Twitchy, I...
Could you turn the music down for a second?
Uh...
No.
- Ja, Hansel.
- Ja, Gretel.
We're evil, we're...
something else that rhymes with evil.
That was sweet!
Let's do it again!
Maybe later.
Hey, girls.
Let's call it a night.
Hey, Dempsy!
Charlie?
What's going on, man?
It's a holiday called Holi.
Holi?
Yeah, some demon king wanted his son to take over the demon family business.
I don't know.
Bottom line is, it's a big celebration.
Everybody pelts each other with color so we all look the same in a big show of brotherhood.
Take that, brother!
Yeah.
Brotherhood.
Charlie, he's going right for her.
I'm on it.
Thank you, thank you.
You need to be careful with these guys.
Sometimes they just, you know...
Yeah, I thought those were a little perky for a woman your age.
You better run.
Run.
Am I having some kind of allergic reaction to this paint or is it really hot in here?
No, it's hot.
The air conditioning died.
Gupta, that is disgusting.
What?
People can still drink them.
I'm putting them between my undershirt and my overshirt.
Oh.
Uh-oh.
I wouldn't drink that one if I were you.
That's a me soda.
Well, how is it you're not sweating?
Sweat is essentially urine of the pores.
I choose to hold it in.
Sir, if you are not too lethargic on the heat, you might remember I told you I'm leaving early tonight to surprise Vimi with her favorite flowers, and then we are going to a restaurant so fancy,
the waiters don't have second jobs.
And then when the band plays our favorite song...
You're gonna get on your knees and propose!
Who told you?
Mmm-mmm.
Rajiv, that's pretty much a textbook proposal, man.
No.
The flowers, the band, down on one knee...
That's vintage Rajiv.
Look, if you wanna surprise her, it should be personal, from the heart.
Todd, the computers are frozen.
There was an hourglass, but now there's a frowny face.
Is a frowny face worse than an hourglass?
Who knows.
But there's no logic, man.
It's like your game, rock, paper, scissors, where paper miraculously defeats rock.
No, Manmeet, paper covers rock.
It's like a...
You know what, I'm not having this conversation again.
I'm gonna have to call tech support.
Okay.
I mean, if you had a choice between paper or rocks, who ever heard of an angry mob wielding paper?
Unless the paper was on fire.
Yeah, even then, just hit them with rocks.
The sun is going down.
We take a walk on the beach,
I pretend to notice a bottle washed ashore.
And the note inside says, "Will you marry me?"
We meet for champagne...
The ring is in the glass.
I buy her her favorite...
Chocolates with the ring inside.
Damn it.
Thank you for calling technical support.
How may I help you today?
Ugh, finally.
Yeah, our computers froze.
No problem, sir.
We can take care of that.
Now, my name is Kamran.
May I ask who I'm speaking with today?
Todd.
Todd.
Okay.
So, we're gonna try what's called a hard reset.
Now, you wanna hold down control...
Uh, Kamran, where are you guys located?
We are in Huntsville, Alabama.
Really?
So, I'm not calling India.
Nope, we're in Huntsville, right down the road from NASA flight center.
Tell you what, there goes a rocket right now.
I'm Todd.
So, what do you got?
Hourglass or frowny face?
Thank you for making a house call.
Well, it will be easier than holding your hand as you stumble through it on the phone.
Gupta, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm making half-pants.
That's very creative.
Thank you.
Are you sure it's safe for him to have scissors?
Hey, don't make fun of Gupta.
We make fun of Gupta.
There, you're all set.
Wait, wait, what was wrong with my computer?
In case it happens again.
Let's just say that the little elves that live inside your computer got so tired and had to lay down.
Do you talk to all your customers like that?
No, just you guys.
Come on, let's get back up to the air conditioning now.
Wait a second.
Wait, you guys have air conditioning?
We're on the same system.
How come ours doesn't work?
I don't know.
It's, uh, as if someone realized that we're the ones doing the important work.
All right, we do important work, okay?
And I don't need this kind of attitude coming in here when all I want is just...
Is he doing something behind me?
Sweat sleeves!
You sweat, and then you wipe!
I have to be honest.
We heard about this guy before we came in here, and he's delivered.
Thank you.
You hear that?
People are talking.
Man, it's so nice and cool in here.
Hi.
Uh, we need to see the manager.
Mr. Patel.
- Oh, wow.
It looks like the Apple Store.
Well, minus the ethnic diversity.
Oh, look at the mints!
It's not the crappy red and white ones.
Todd, they're green and chocolaty.
Seema, Seema, Seema, you're breaking my balls.
You're getting a good deal here.
Now, sign the bloody contract.
Gentlemen, welcome to Globocon.
How can I help you?
Hi!
Yeah, I'm Todd Dempsy.
I'm the manager down at Mid America Novelties.
This is my employee, Manmeet.
Hello.
Sanjeev Patel.
Pleasure.
Uh, I have a complaint about your employee.
Chai?
No, thank you.
I'll take his.
This guy right here, he fixed my computer, but he had a lot of attitude.
Kamran.
Apologize.
I'm sorry.
There you go.
Wait, but he just rolled his eyes at me.
Yeah, that's a sign of respect in our culture.
Now that we're through here...
Uh, well...
Done.
Actually the main reason I'm here is the air conditioning.
Now, we're on the same system, and you guys are taking all the cold air.
Uh, but if you turn up your thermostat just a little bit, we could share the air until the heat wave's over.
Sounds fair, right?
It does.
But I'm not gonna do it.
Uh-huh.
Okay, yeah.
'Cause you think your work is more important than ours?
It's Tommy, right?
Todd.
Oh, because you look like a Tommy.
Here's the deal.
Multibillion dollar corporations call us for help.
Hospitals call us when their systems go down.
We save lives.
What do you do?
We sell novelties, which means we bring smiles to the world.
And when a teacher sits on a whoopee cushion and a kid laughs, we're there.
When grandma screams because there's a fly in her ice cube, we're there.
And when a condom glows in the dark as a man and woman make love, we're there.
Well, we're not there.
That would be a bit creepy.
So, where do we fall on this whole, uh, air conditioning thing?
Not gonna happen.
All right.
Well, we will see about that, Dick.
Oh, I'm sorry, it was Dick, right?
Sanjeev.
Oh, really?
Because you look like a dick.
Hmm, that's very mature of you.
Well, at least I don't walk around with my fly wide open.
Hmm?
He made you look.
You can't top that.
Well, you're in Charlie's hands now.
I'll just override the system, reroute some of that cool air into your ducts.
How do you know about all this stuff?
Oh, my dad was a master electrician.
I thought he worked for the telephone company.
My mom went through boyfriends pretty fast.
It was easier if I called 'em all dad.
Oh!
Your mom ever date a locksmith?
Yeah, but he went back to prison before he could teach me anything.
That was one lock he couldn't pick.
Hey, guys.
Shh!
I got the kit.
Thanks, man.
What's that?
Amateur gynecologist kit.
It comes with a head lamp, rubber gloves and a map.
G marks the spot.
Isn't treasure usually marked with an X?
X is for a treasure that actually exists.
Now, pay attention.
All right, this duct is the junction for your call center and Globocon.
If you jam this vent open, you'll get all the air and they'll get nothing.
What?
We need you to go into the ducts.
Why do I have to do it?
Well, you got the courage and the bravery...
It's 'cause you're built like a straw.
Go!
So, did you decide how you're going to propose to Vimi?
I did.
She will be most surprised.
Really?
Is that a box inside a box inside another box, and inside the last little box is a ring?
Oh, no.
If you figured it out,
Vimi will get it in a heartbeat.
She's coming this afternoon.
I'm running out of time.
So, just propose another day.
Holi is her favorite holiday.
We made all these plans.
If I cancel on her now, she'll be crushed.
And she won't see the proposal coming.
Thank you, Asha.
Okay.
Any time.
And it just got weird.
All right, now, you should be able to take a right.
I'm not taking a right, Todd.
It's the fastest way.
Something in that vent is looking right back at me.
Rajiv, hi!
Are you ready?
No, tonight is off.
Why, is everything okay?
Just not feeling it.
But you said you had a whole night planned for us.
You know how much Holi means to me.
I do, but I think I would rather work.
You'd rather work than be with me?
Vimi, Vimi, Vimi.
They're both work.
One just puts money in my hand, and one takes it away.
I don't think I want to see you tonight.
Or any time in the near future.
What did you do?
Now she will never see my proposal coming.
Picture this.
Vimi is getting dressed when she hears a sitar and singer performing a song we heard on our first date right outside her window.
She glances out to see me in my finest suit, riding up to her door on a majestic white horse.
It will be a moment she will never forget.
Now, that is a proposal.
You just never give up, do you?
All right, you're almost there.
Should see a vent on your left, and then you're gonna come up to a 6-inch drop-off.
Sorry, a 6-foot drop-off.
Okay, you should be right by an air deflector.
Yeah, I see it.
Now, wedge it open so we get all the cold air.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Suck it, Globocon, suck it!
I underestimated you, Tommy.
Nice move with the AC.
Ah, who's sweating through their underwear now?
Ha.
Look, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
If you agree to share the AC,
I'll have Kamran double your Internet speed right now.
Sure.
You got yourself a deal.
Oh, and one more thing...
You have to admit that every single one of my employees is just as good as yours.
I would admit that, except my workers have incredible skills.
Kamran here can bring down an entire computer network in 20 seconds.
All done.
Oh, 18 seconds.
Why does my screen have a picture of a bomb with a burning fuse on it?
It's on mine too.
This is my favorite part.
Go elf yourself.
I'm sorry, but that's fantastic.
Hey!
This isn't over.
Oh, no, Todd, it isn't.
I can see daylight.
Ah.
What took you so long?
Oh, I just met some rats.
We had some great wine, cheese, time just got away.
I was lost in the vents!
What do you think, Todd?
You know, I'm sorry.
We've been dealing with these computers, okay?
They put some kind of virus here and now they're all frozen.
Okay, so, what are we going to do?
Just give up.
I come from a long line of surrenderers.
When the going gets tough, the Guptas have been gone for hours.
No.
Yes, gone.
Pff.
If we blink on the computers before they blink on the AC, they'll own us.
What you need is some intel.
You need to know their next move before they make it.
Actually, it'd be better if you know their next move before they do, or even better, if you enter their dreams and give them the idea.
You know, like in the movie Insertion.
You mean Inception?
No, the DVD I bought on the street was called Insertion.
It was filthy, but the plot was much easier to follow.
I got a better idea.
I'll send a spy into their office to see how close they are to breaking.
Madhuri would be perfect.
Why Madhuri?
She blends right in.
No one ever notices her.
Madhuri!
I'm right here.
This is too hot, Sanjeev.
I mean, this is ridiculous.
You can handle it.
Mind over matter.
But it's like an oven in here, yeah?
Focus.
Today's too important.
And Rishi has a gambling problem, and Prakash adds Scotch to his chai, and Gopal is cheating on his wife.
The pig!
Gopal is the pig, not his wife.
Although, judging from the picture, she does stretch a sari to its limits.
Is there any sign of them giving in?
No.
Their only concern is this important client that's coming tonight.
They need to make a good impression so that they can land this account.
That's it.
That's how we get them.
Guys, the Globocon people think we're a bunch of idiots.
I'm tired of being treated like that.
How about you?
Yeah.
You ready to do something about it?
Yeah.
You ready to get some revenge?
Ah!
'Cause I have a plan.
Let's do this!
Wait!
No, Pinky, I haven't...
I haven't said what the plan is yet.
Oh!
We'll just wait until she gets back.
I certainly hope no one hits me with color.
You have gotten your jollies.
Now be gone, urchins, or I'll bake you into a pie!
Precisely why I waited to change into my nice suit.
This isn't my first Holi.
So, got the air back on, huh?
Yes.
Look, this whole thing got a little out of hand.
All right, and I know you got a big client coming in, and you're a little uptight, but there's an easy compromise.
So, I'm gonna give you one more chance to do the right thing.
I have the air conditioning and working computers.
I don't need to do anything.
Now, why don't you go down to your sauna?
When I feel like it, I'll turn your computers back on and you can resume selling your jars of farts.
Well, if that's the way it is.
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just one more thing.
Are any of your employees pregnant or have a heart condition?
No.
Let's do this!
Hey, Sanjeev.
I think your clients are here.
What is the plan?
Where were you?
I took the stairs.
Mr. Gidwani?
Finally!
Where is the singer?
Well, colored powder got in her throat, and her vocal chords got paralyzed.
She may never sing again.
Why does everything happen to me?
Wait, where is the horse?
Judging by what you're stepping in,
I believe it was here at one point.
No!
Stop!
You already got me!
I'm the same man!
Whoa, stop it!
Stop!
Rajiv?
What are you doing?
Why are you in your underpants?
Oh, I was just in the neighborhood.
Ai.
Don't you have bedtimes or pockets to pick?
What's going on?
I wanted to surprise you.
I am supposed to be in my suit and on a white horse.
Please, pretend this night never happened, and I will surprise you some other time.
You deserve a special proposal.
Rajiv, you're half-naked, covered in colored powder, standing in my front yard.
This will be a great story for our kids.
Kids?
Is that a yes?
Yes?
Yes to what?
You haven't asked me anything yet.
Love, love will keep us together
Think of me babe whenever
Some sweet talking girl comes along
Singing her song
Don't mess around You just got to be strong
Just stop
Because I really love you
Stop
I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together
Yes, I will marry you.
What are you doing up here?
I was trying to get out, and I got lost.
What are you doing up here?
Well, I heard a noise, and I came up to see what it was.
Oh.
You are so cute.
Oh.
Hey, Dempsey!
Charlie?
What's...
what's going on, man?
It's a holiday called "Holi."
Holi?
Yeah, some demon king wanted his son to take over the demon family business.
I don't know.
Bottom line is it's a big celebration.
Everybody pelts each other with color so we all look the same in a big show of brotherhood.
Take that, brother!
Yeah, brotherhood.
Charlie, he's going right for her.
I'm on it.
Thank you, thank you.
Hey, I mean, you gotta be careful with these guys.
Sometimes they just, you know...
Yeah, I thought those were a little perky for a woman your age.
You better run.
Run!
Okay, thank you very much, please.
Goodbye.
Am I having some kind of allergic reaction to this paint, or is it really hot in here?
No, it's hot.
The air conditioning died.
Gupta, that is disgusting.
What?
People can still drink them.
I'm putting them between my undershirt and my overshirt.
Oh.
Uh-oh.
I wouldn't drink that one if I were you.
That's a me soda.
Well, how is it you're not sweating?
Sweat is essentially urine of the pores.
I choose to hold it in.
Sir, if you are not too lethargic on the heat, you might remember I told you I'm leaving early tonight to surprise Vimi with her favorite flowers, and then we are going to a restaurant so fancy
the waiters don't have second jobs.
And then when the band plays our favorite song... you're gonna get on your knees and propose!
- Who told you?
- Mm-mm.
Rajiv, that's pretty much a textbook proposal, man.
No.
The flowers, the band, down on one knee...
That's vintage rajiv.
Look, if you wanna surprise her, it should be personal, from the heart.
Todd, the computers are frozen.
There was an hourglass, but now there's a frowny face.
Is a frowny face worse than an hourglass?
Who knows.
But there's no logic, man.
It's like your game "rock, paper, scissors,"
where paper miraculously defeats rock.
No, Manmeet, paper covers rock.
It's like a...
You know what, I'm not having this conversation again.
I'm gonna have to call tech support.
Okay.
I mean, if you had a choice between paper or rocks, who ever heard of an angry mob wielding paper?
Unless the paper was on fire.
Yeah, even then, just hit them with rocks.
The sun is going down.
We take a walk on the beach,
I pretend to notice a bottle washed ashore.
And the note inside says, "will you marry me?"
- We meet for champagne...
- The ring is in the glass.
I buy her her favorite... chocolates with the ring inside.
Dammit.
Thank you for calling technical support.
How may I help you today?
Ugh, finally.
Yeah, our computers froze.
No problem, sir.
We can take care of that.
Now, my name is Cameron.
May I ask who I'm speaking with today?
- Todd.
- Todd.
Okay.
So, we're gonna try what's called a hard reset.
Now, you wanna hold down "control"... uh, Cameron, where are you guys located?
Uh, we are in huntsville, Alabama.
Really?
So, I'm not calling India.
Nope, we're in huntsville, right down the road from NASA flight center.
Tell you what, there goes a rocket right now.
I'm Todd.
So, what do you got?
Hourglass or frowny face?
Thank you for making a house call.
Well, it will be easier than holding your hand as you stumble through it on the phone.
Gupta, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm making half-pants.
- That's very creative.
- Thank you.
Are you sure it's safe for him to have scissors?
Hey, don't make fun of gupta.
We make fun of gupta.
There, you're all set.
Wait, wait, what was wrong with my computer?
In case it happens again.
Let's just say that the little elves that live inside your computer got so tired and had to lay down.
Do you talk to all your customers like that?
No, just you guys.
Come on, let's get back up to the air conditioning now.
Wait a second.
Wait, you guys have air conditioning?
We're on the same system.
How come ours doesn't work?
I don't know.
It's, uh, as if someone realized that we're the ones doing the important work.
All right, we do important work, okay?
And I don't need this kind of attitude coming in here when all I want is just...
Is he doing something behind me?
Sweat sleeves!
You sweat, and then you wipe!
I have to be honest.
We heard about this guy before we came in here, and he's delivered.
Thank you.
You hear that?
People are talking.
Man, it's so nice and cool in here.
Hi.
Uh, we need to see the manager.
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, my God.
It's like the apple store.
Well, minus the ethnic diversity.
Oh, look at the mints!
It's not the crappy red-and-white ones.
Todd, they're green and chocolatey.
Seema, Seema, Seema, you're breaking my balls.
You're getting a good deal here.
Now, sign the bloody contract.
Gentlemen, welcome to Globocon.
How can I help you?
Uh, hi.
Yeah, I'm Todd dempsey.
I'm the manager down at mid America novelties.
This is my employee Manmeet.
- Hello.
- Sanjeev Patel.
Pleasure.
Uh, I have a complaint about your employee.
- Chai?
- No, thank you.
I'll take his.
This guy right here, he fixed my computer, but he had a lot of attitude.
Cameron.
Apologize.
- I'm sorry.
- There you go.
Wait, but he just rolled his eyes at me.
Yeah, that's a sign of respect in our culture.
Now that we're through here...
- Uh, well...
- Done.
Actually... actually the main reason I'm here is the air conditioning.
Now, we're on the same system, and you guys are taking all the cold air.
Uh, but if you turn up your thermostat just a little bit, we could share the air until the heat wave's over.
Sounds fair, right?
It does, but I'm not gonna do it.
Uh-huh.
Okay, yeah.
'Cause you think your work is more important than ours?
- It's Tommy, right?
- Todd.
Oh, because you look like a Tommy.
Here's the deal.
Multibillion-dollar corporations call us for help.
Hospitals call us when their systems go down.
We save lives.
What do you do?
We sell novelties, which means we bring smiles to the world.
And when a teacher sits on a whoopee cushion and a kid laughs, we're there.
When grandma screams because there's a fly in her ice cube, we're there.
And when a condom glows in the dark as a man and woman make love, we're there.
Well, we're not there.
That would be a bit creepy.
So, where did we fall on this whole, uh, air conditioning thing?
- Not gonna happen.
- All right.
Well, we will see about that, dick.
Oh, I'm sorry, it was dick, right?
- Sanjeev.
- Oh, really?
You look like a dick.
Hmm, that's very mature of you.
Well, at least I don't walk around with my fly wide open.
- Hmm?
- Mm...

It's an amateur gynecologist kit.

"G" marks the spot.

"X" is for a treasure that actually exists.

It will be a moment she will never forget.
Now, that is a proposal.
You just never give up, do you?
All right, you're almost there.
You should see a vent on your left, and then you're gonna come up to a six-inch drop-off.
Sorry, a six-foot drop-off.
Okay, you should be right by an air deflector.
Yeah, I see it.
Now, wedge it open so we get all the cold air.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Suck it, Globocon, suck it!
Oh, yeah!
I underestimated you, Tommy.
Nice move with the a/c.
Ah, who's sweating through their underwear now?
Look, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
If you agree to share the a/c,
I'll have Cameron double your Internet speed right now.
Sure.
You got yourself a deal.
Oh, and one more thing... you have to admit that every single one of my employees is just as good as yours.

Is that a "yes"?
"Yes, yes" to what?
You haven't asked me anything yet.
Yes, I will marry you.
What are you doing up here?
I was...
I was trying to get out, and I...
I got lost.
What are you doing up here?
Well, I heard a noise, and I came up to see what it was.
- Oh.
- You are so cute.
Oh.
In theory Tudzharov is behind Z.W.U. and S.U.N.N.Y.
The annual income from illegal business exceeds 100 million.
You can't get Jarro without my help.
- I'll get him before you say "yes".
Don't say you're involved with her.
- She found out I'm a cop.
Jarro will have dinner with Zhelev.
I can record their conversation.
- You?
No way!
Give me one successful operation against Tudzharov and you'll be a TV star.
- You'll have it.
What's that?
- There's a recording device in this.
How's the cigarette business?
- You ask too much.
Why is that?
You are embarrassing me with these in front of those simpletons.
You are promoted!
You'll be chief of "Analyses and Information".
So you arranged it.
Why are you taking everything personally?
With you it's always personal.
BULGARIAN NATIONAL TELEVISION
CAMERA Production Company
Are they ready?
- Any moment now.
It's extra quality.
PRESENT
That's the way to gain foreign markets.
Dutch colleagues will get nervous.
- It's calculated risk.
What else?
IVAILO ZAHARIEV
When our customs officer is on shift the goods will go to Serbia.
I'm not asking about this.
IRENA MILYANKOVA
ZAHARI BAHAROV
VLADIMIR PENEV
The parcel.
I keep it where you told me.
Do we know the sender?
- We'll as soon as she's conscious.
MIHAIL BILALOV
Be careful, no damage.
ALEXANDER SANO
DEYAN DONKOV
What's this?
Advance payment for the new position.
- It seems heavy.
KIRIL EFREMOV

Are you stoned?
It can be heard all over.
Sunny went to record Jarro's meeting with Zhelev and disappeared.
And so you do cannonry?
You shouldn't involve with her.
What if she tells about you?
I'd be in the morgue now.
- There's little chance she's alive.
You want me to leave?
Are you mad?
!
I'm transferred to another department.
What do you mean?
- It's an order from above.
So you ditch me?
-I'll introduce you to my successor.
What does this mean?
- He'll help you about Sunny.
Great!
- Get a grip!
And collect your shells.
I'm not dealing with you all my life.
Bye.
We haven't spoken since that dumb incident.
It was more than dumb.
- Rather a mental experience.
I'd put it in my new song.
These songs are too similar.
I'm sick of them.
Nah, baby, don't be like that.
It's time for you to grow up.
This weed will stunt you.
What if I smoke only on weekends?
I lied to my folks many times but your messes are endless.
It's just bad luck.
- Hi, Milen!
Is the live show on Friday?
- Yes.
See you Friday then.
- Bye, babes.
See?
One arrest makes you a famous rapper.
And you girlfriend pays.
- Look...
Your Dad will never like me.
What mattered was that I should like you.
So you made a mistake.
It should be corrected then.
I need you on shift Friday!
You cannot check in a hospital!
Is the substitute customs officer your man?
If you fail me now, I'll put on a doctor's uniform and cure you my way, you, fucking customs man!
Martin!
Do you want to make bucks?
- Go ahead.
Could you take this shit through the Serbian border?
I don't have a license for a van.
- You'll drive the pilot car.
What are we transporting.
- Just pass beyond the border.
Our customs officer has acute appendicitis.
Another one will replace him.
I need you to control things.
What do I have to do.
- To call me if there's a problem.
You are not into details.
- Please, Martin.
Tomorrow we load the van.
You'll wait for it at the border.
Then you pass it together.
That's all.
What's in the van?
- What!
Cooled country ducks.
Addie, why are you ignoring me?
Are you talking to me or to my ass?
- Is your ass more talkative?
You and it go together, don't you?
- No.
We separate for the summer vacation.
You are in Sozopol, your ass is in Albena.
How long since your Alex... well left us?
Are you into widows now?
- I just thought you might be lonely.
No one to change a bulb for you.
Are you from the electrical company?
- Hair, what's up?
If I ever get married I hope I die after my wife.
I don't want to see from above how she fucks other men.
How are you?
- I'm fine.
Addie, thanks for the coffee.
Have you been a pilot for the Hook?
If you are driving to Letnitza put on rubber boots.
A lot of horseshit there.
- He told me to wait at the border.
Great.
You'll spare yourself the hill to the factory and the shit.
What's wrong?
Tabasco widow!
Fine!
You have mail
Uncle
White van Ford Transit will transport amphetamines through Kalotina.
The drugs will be loaded from a factory in Letnitza village.
Forget it, I' not going.
- Why should it be me?
Tudzharov said it to you.
- He was looking at you.
No, at you.
- Definitely at you.
Why are you so unhappy?
- You don't need to know.
Tell me.
- Money must be taken to Sunny's mom.
And there are no volunteers?
- He looked at you.
No, at you.
- Draw lots.
Include me too.
The short stick is a looser.
This is my lucky hand.
Come on, be brave.
Congratulations, Martin.
You're a courier today.
Here's the address.
Good luck.
- I fucked myself.
You know...
Jarro was really looking at me.
Joanna Veleva?
- Yes, can I help you?
Mr. Tudzharov sent me.
This is for you.
Mr. Tudzharov?
- Yes, he asked me to bring it.
Best regards from Sunny.
- Strange.
What is?
- I couldn't get her on the phone.
I assumed she and Peter left abroad.
If I see her, I'll tell her to call.
- By all means, please.
You are a beautiful woman.
Why aren't you married?
I'm waiting for you.
- No, seriously.
Normal men bore me.
Besides...
Let me tell you as a lawyer.
Better to be owner than co-owner.
You don't know how right you are.
I want to sell the dance hall.
- Bambi's hall?
Is there another one?
- You surprise me.
Weren't you two going to be married?
- Let's not talk about her any more.
What happened?
You don't even say her name.
I meant to include the hall in the prenuptial contract.
Enough with this hall.
Sell it.
You'll need these documents.
We can hardly get good price.
- Let's give it away.
It's not easy with the twins.
We cannot separate them.
Please finish peeling the potatoes.
Right.
Right.
Yes, all right.
Tomorrow?
Yes, all right.
Jarro and Sunny's love summer
That's what I'm saying.
Did you know about that?
- I have to go.
I banned the dances.
And she appears in a magazine.
Instead of lingering in malls...
- She'll be working there tomorrow.
The owner of the hall is Jarro's girlfriend.
I didn't know?
- You should as her mother.
You don't see us, so I was silent.
- You can't do this!
I forbade and you permitted it.
Sorry for taking care of my girl, Boss!
I asked her not to tell you.
I gave up Milen but I'll not give up dancing!
The great pedagogue!
See what happens now?
It's fixed with the customs.
We are loading tomorrow.
Martin will be an escort.
- What about you?
It's my son's birthday.
- What's the problem.
His 5th birthday.
That's why I have no kids, Rossen.
Hi.
- Why aren't you in the hall?
Have you see Sunny?
- She's on shopping in Milano.
She'll buy new dancing shoes for you.
Be off now.
Enjoy your evening.
- Villie, shall we dance?
Don't worry about tomorrow.
It will be fine.
Buy a present to the boy from me.
Thanks, bro.
What's going on with Sunny?
I asked you a question.
- Are you fuckig with me, asshole?
If I did, you'd feel it.
- What if I tell Jarro about your game with her?
- There is no game.
I love seeing you writhe.
Pity it's all over.
The whores paid their due.
- Zip your pants.
It's compliment on the house.
- They are nice in these brothels.
Next time we'll send Martin.
He seems tense.
There's a new blond girl.
Miladinov, you know Vassil Nikolov.
He'll replace Popov.
Congratulations.
- Loyal and efficient.
Here's the former chief and future top analyst.
Hi.
- I heard you're promoted.
We'll miss you.
- Vassil is good to work with too.
He's from Popov's school.
- I need a signature.
Have you got a minute?
- Since it's so urgent...
I have proofs of a workshop for amphetamines in a village near Sofia.
It produces huge amounts.
Let me guess.
Jarro's place.
Days before your transfer?
- A becoming farewell.
I'd prefer fireworks.
You owe me that at least.
- You are a funny man.
Why?
- Who do you still prove to?
The ministry praised you already.
- Jarro's case remains open.
Vassil will finish it.
He'll manage, you'll see.
Good work, thank you guys.
Take him away.
I want samples of this.
Hold it, police!
Hands in the air!
Don't move!
Check the van!
Clear!
Here are the samples from the van.
- Let me see.
A month ago we got signal from the Netherlands about an identical amphetamine.
- That's great.
A present from our team.
- A really good present!
Everything leads to Tudzharov.
All I need is a cooperating witness.
I'll be remembered for that.
I'll ask again.
Who sponsors your lab?
I take off your glasses so they're not broken when I hit you.
Hey, junior assistant...
- Assistant Professor.
Delev.
Ah, Assistant professor.
Professor Delev, which is better?
To fuck students or to be fucked in jail?
Kirov, bring me a cup of coffee.
For the Assistant Professor too, right?
Are you playing the smarter cop?
Not in comparison to you.
Internet is full of your articles.
Your colleagues at the University have respect for you... so far.
Are you surprised?
- No.
Since the rector and the students don't know about your hobby.
I'm a man of science.
Science develops with experiments.
You cannot blame me for anything.
Blame you?
I'll compliment you.
You are an artist in drug business.
Your art is sold in the Netherlands.
I'm not talking.
- You don't have to.
We caught the van driver before the border.
Now you are here too.
- Not for long.
I don't know.
Your boss would be quite nervous.
- I want a lawyer.
Knowing who you work for, you rather need a guard.
You think you're smarter than me.
- No.
In prison smart and stupid people do the same time.
Okay then.
I've had contact with only one man.
Hi, my boy!
Wait, my love, I'll take a picture of the cake.
Lachi?
Look here.
Happy birthday, my dear son!
You are the light in our life.
You are our happiness.
Me and your mom love you a lot.
Shall we open the present?
- Yes.
Come on, son.
Let's see what's in here.
The guests probably.
Let me see.
Who's here?
- The guests!
Yeah, the guests!
Lie down on the floor!
- Who are you, fucks?

On your knees!
- I'll smash you!
I'll crush you down!
In front of my kid!
Fucking clowns!
Entering with masks in my home!
I'll burn you to ashes!
Hook, let the boys do their job.
Inspector Popov, Organized Crime.
You're arrested for drug trafficking.
Gun!
Beware!
It's a toy!
It's a toy!
Go ahead!
Son, look at them!
They are from the party!
This was my surprise for you!
Ivo, the van's not here?
What do we do?
They hit 'the duck'.
And the lab.
What's the loss?
- 120 kilos of amphetamines.
We had to export 300 this month.
- Why weren't we warned?
You gave advance payment to Vassil.
The worst is they busted the Hook and the Chemist.
Hook is reliable.
- I know.
And the Chemist?
He only knows Rossen, nobody else.
- Ah, this Popov!
He's getting on my nerves.
- Say the word and he'll enjoy flowers from the roots above.
And make him a hero?
No way.
- What then?
Find out from Vassil why he hadn't known about the operation.
Now!
You were our colleague once, Rossen.
You know our ways.
I'm not talking without a lawyer.
What if your lawyer is away?
Do you believe Tudzharov will save you?
Hook...
If you're wise, you can return to your family very quickly.
Don't you worry about my family.
Take care of yours.
Your wife was rather upset.
Don't worry about her, she'll hang on.
NEVENA
Will she hang on for 10 years?
- As many as it takes.
Call me when the lawyer of this creep arrives.
Okay.
This came for you.
No name of sender.
Too light for a bonus.
- Maybe it's in bills of 100.
I'm leaving you.
I didn't tell you about the op to keep you safe from Slavov.
How long have we worked together?
We are friends, partners in Tudzharov's case.
I know you'd have helped but in case of failure I'd have dragged you down.
And Slavov signed for the op without anybody knowing.
If he says nothing, then it's okay.
Are you satisfied?
It was rather risky but it was worth it.
I can't get it.
You're always a step ahead of us.
Always.
What do you think?
We have our man, planted in Tudzharov's group.
Our man inside?
- I've told this to no one.
You really don't trust me.
When two people know, everyone knows.
I just wanted to keep alive our undercover agent.
Good for him!
Shake his hand for me.
Tomorrow you can do it personally.
It's high time for you two to meet.
Well?
- Well?
What's the occasion.
- I hate dining alone.
Did it happen often with Sunny?
- Boyana, let's not spoil it, okay?
Sorry.
Actually I'm like you.
I like it calm now.
At home, a glass of wine, nice music, pleasant company.
Are there many pleasant companions?
- What do you imply?
You dine occasionally with public prosecutors.
If the Hook is charged, see to it that it's not too grave.
I'll see what I can do.
Do you meet here your man?
- No, we change locations.
Is he always so late?
- No.
Usually I'm late.
Not a good start.
I hope nothing happened to him.
His file is in the system.
Top secret.
In the system?
Isn't it risky?
Do you want me to keep it under my mattress?
It should be secure.
- I've taken care of that.
Remember the password.
- I'll write it down.
No, it should be in your head.
You'll be working together, you must know everything.
The password is...
Wait.
Jarro's man is standing by you
What's going on?
The meeting was cancelled.
- So we waited for nothing?
We'll do it some other time.
All right.
Tell me the password.
Popov, are you okay?
Wait...
It's my heart.
I must go home.
Popov, shall I drive you home?
- No, thanks.
See you at the office.
Maybe we should call a doctor?

He's been my partner for 10 years.

Nothing.
I was just going to tell him the password for your file.
So he muddled your head.
And you criticize me about Sunny!
He framed another colleague.
That's why Internal Affairs didn't get him.
It doesn't make me comfortable.
This is the second time.

Betrayal from trusted people.
I received this today.
- Is that what you do at the office?
One of the men on this photo made those.
Which one exactly?
- This one.
Only he's been dead for a long time now.
Tudzharov, Stolarov, Mironov and me.
We worked at Criminal Police.
We were very close.
We hardly ever separated.
We covered for each other, trusted each other.
We were a team in everything.
We were nicknamed "the 4-head serpent".
We had a case with a gangster group, trading in fuel during the embargo for Yugoslavia.
Racketeering, insurance, smuggling.
They were too blatant.
They kept their money in sacks.
It was mostly Tudzharov's case.
We found out from him.
Nobody believed in banks then.
Tudzharov proposed we hit the gangsters in action.
To take their money.
Clever.
- Nobody agreed.
Jarro felt he had no partners.
He turned it all to a joke.
Was there an operation?
- Yes.
But I was late.
When I arrived, my friends were burning in the police car.
There was nothing in the caravan.
I think Jarro killed them because of the money.
I found his lighter by the car.
I could never prove it.
But you knew it was him.
A lighter means nothing in court.
A couple of months later Tudzharov left the department.
I think this money was the start of his empire.
You must disappear before it's too late.
Don't tell me you're giving up now.
Not me, you are giving it up.
- Let me be the judge of that.
It's a bit complicated.
I erased your file.
What did you do?
- After the incident with Vassil.
You're alone now.
There are no proofs that you are a cop.
How could you do that?
This is personal between me and Tudzharov.
It was a mistake.
I'm sorry.
I'm not interested any more.
It's a battle between me and Jarro.
I'll not involve you any more.
Go away.
I can't forget her.
How can I leave her here?
Forget her.
- If we don't catch Jarro,
I'll never know where she is.
- You have no cover in the police.
I never had any.
Martin, don't play with fire!
This came last night.
- A letter.
Who from?
- I don't know.
It's just your name.
It's clean.
I checked it.
Why didn't you bring it earlier?
- I had tasks all day.
I only knew one man who made those.
But he turned to ashes long ago.
Mr. Mironov, we arrived.
How was the flight?
Fine for one who's a dead man.
I came back from hell.

Okay, so we can't talk about the top moments of "Teen Wolf"
without talking about this one.
- ♪ - _

Stydia is so sweet.
I think I wanna add them to my morning coffee.
The Stiles and Lydia kiss/reunion moment was one of the biggest payoffs of one of the longest running threads in the show.
This was a big fight in the writers' room between people who wanted Stiles and Lydia to get... get together and people who didn't.
And then it's just I watch those moments, those scenes where they're perfect together.
It really satisfied six years of waiting for like, "Yes, please just be together.
You belong together."
(PANTING)
I didn't say it back.
You don't have to.

Mwah.
Mwah!
You don't even have to be a fan of "Teen Wolf"
to recognize how powerful this scene is.
I loved that Jeff said it has to be organic and that it's just not gonna be one season they're all of a sudden dating.
Everything changed in that moment.
Yeah, that's a great moment.
She's got those lips.
Yeah.
She pulls away and it's just the look in her face is so sweet and... oh, I love it.
Love it.
Yeah, I think it's great.
I love those guys.
I miss them.
- Aw...
- Shut up.
- ♪ _
- _ - (MAN) When Stiles was a little kid... he couldn't say his first name.
Not sure why.
It pretty much rolls off the tongue.
But, uh, the closest he could get was "mischief."
One of "Teen Wolf's" longest-running mysteries is not a supernatural questions, it's not about monsters or lower mythology;
it's what is Stiles' first name?
We've been waiting for it, we've been wanting it, and now that we have it, we can't pronounce it.
(CHUCKLING)
Uh... isn't it Midavich Stilinski?
Can you say the name?
Mieczyslaw.
Mieczyslaw, that is beautiful!
Mieczyslaw.
I will praise Jeff Davis forever that it was something difficult.
I still can't remember how to spell it.
I don't think I could spell it right now.
No.
I had to write it down.
Did Scott know what his name was?
- Yes.
- Do you think he did?
Okay.
Stilinski revealing his name in that moment among all those people felt perfect.
I have a son.
His name is Mieczyslaw Stilinski, but we call him Stiles.
I remember.
Towards the end of "Teen Wolf"
there were a lot of revisions for the scripts, each episode.
Linden walks in and in rehearsal...
I thought Linden was just pulling a prank and in fact that was actually Stiles' name.
We thought it would be some like funny payoff to find some wacky name but instead it was the most like heartbreaking and heart-wrenching reveal and is one of the most creative and moving things that "Teen Wolf" ever did.
♪
(HOLLAND) What I love about "Teen Wolf" the most is when not just a person watches the show for fun but it's actually affected their life.
The fan art is especially meaningful to me.
I wanted to be a comic book artist when I was a kid, and to see that people are inspired by the show, uh, to make their own artwork, it's just incredible.
I put my art online and someone from MTV decided to reach out, and it's opened my world in so many ways.
I can't thank "Teen Wolf" enough for giving me that opportunity to really see how my art impacts people.
I won their walk-on role contest and then to say that my first professional acting job was my favorite show... that... that's amazing.
We ended up making a rap video that MTV saw and we eventually became known as The Wolf Pack Girls.
We literally have no idea where in life we would both be right now if it wasn't for "Teen Wolf."
I've had kids come up to me as well and say that the way that teens are portrayed and the way that, uh, gay kids are portrayed on the show have changed things for them.
That's powerful.
- ♪ _
_
I can't.
I can't take your pain.
It's because it doesn't hurt.
Allison dying in Scott's arms was one of the biggest moments in "Teen Wolf."
Because the show started with Scott and Allison.
That was their first love.
It was the first like real relationship that we got to see develop on the show.
We got to ride that wave as if we were Scott's best friend.
And the fans are still grieving about it and we're still grieving about it.
I can't watch the scene.
- I have trouble watching...
- Do you really?
It's like watching one of my children die.
It's okay.
Allison... (WHIMPERING)
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's perfect.
I'm in the arms of my first love.
The first person I've ever loved.
The person I'll always love.
In the same way that Scott became his own anchor,
Allison became her own heroine.
She wasn't just a love interest; she was a hero.
And I think this moment was raising the stakes for the show.
It brought in themes and ideas and... and, uh, that we hadn't tried before.
Real tragedy and real loss.
And it was something that Scott had never gone through.
This was really, really big for Scott and it kind of changed the way that I played him throughout the rest of the series.
♪
The person that's least likely to text back is probably Khylin Rhambo.
It's not that they are never gonna text back but sometimes it might take a few days, and that's Holland.
That answer's easy, it's Hoechlin.
He doesn't text.
Tyler Hoechlin, 100% every time.
He's impossible to get a hold of.
I don't know if he's... like he has some app on his phone that just texts don't come through.
Pick up, brother, I'm here, I love you.
Call me.
It was so hard to pick just ten moments, so here's a bonus.
Yes!

(SCREAMING)
Watching the premiere of "Teen Wolf,"
I was such a huge fan of like the movie "Teen Wolf"
as a kid growing up and so I was like, "All right, how are they going to do this?"
But then I realized like watching it,
I was like this is actually like terrifying.
This is where the teen becomes the wolf.
This is the scene that really pulls you into the show.
It set like the danger level very high from the very beginning.
♪
It's a huge moment in "Teen Wolf" history that needs to be part of this top ten.
- ♪ - _
I think by far the...
the biggest fan response, um, and... and for me personally... whenever... whenever somebody asks me what's the most pivotal, crazy, most powerful, impactful moment on the show, it's the "Scott, you're my brother" moment
where Stiles saves my life... or Scott's life.
It felt a little like your life, didn't it?
It did, yeah.
I think it speaks to how close you and Dylan are.
(STILES) Scott, just listen to me, okay?
You're not no one.
Okay, you're someone, you're...
Scott, you're my best friend... okay, and I need you.
Scott, you're my brother.
All right, so... so if you're gonna do this, then...
I think you're just gonna have to take me with you.
Oh my God.
"You're my brother."
That was what like forged them into more than just a pack, you know, it's...
- Strengthen their bond.
- Yeah.
I mean, so much of the show is Scott saving Stiles, and in this scene we see Stiles saves Scott.
One of the most powerful things to me about that scene is the words he speaks, uh, "If you die, you're gonna take me with you."
Uh, in a dark time of my own life, someone spoke those exact words to me.
I think that will always go down as one of the best moments in "Teen Wolf" history.
So good, so sweet.
I'm...
I'm chocking back tears.
(CHUCKLING) Should I let them fly?
I can't, no.
Don't wanna mess up my makeup.
You have no makeup on.
You're right, I don't.

You guys have singlehandedly made "Teen Wolf."
We love you, thank you for sticking around.
I know it's been a crazy, insane, heartbreaking ride.
I hope you guys enjoy the final episodes of "Teen Wolf."
I'm choking back tears.
This was a big fight in the writers' room.
It set like the danger level very high.
Please kill her.
It's one of my favorite moments in "Teen Wolf,"
and the fans are still grieving about it and we're still grieving about it.
So just put your werewolf claws away and... and chill out.
Can I stop screaming?
It's hard to believe we've made 100 episodes of "Teen Wolf."
So to celebrate, we will be looking back at the top-ten moments of the entire series.

- Divine move.
Divine move?
You think you have any moves at all?
You can kill the Oni, but me?
Me?
I'm a thousand years old!
You can't kill me!
Ooh!
Ooh, Dylan O'Brien!
"I'm a thousand years old.
You can't kill me!"
Oh, watching that, I fell in love with Dylan right there.
The way that he said it, his face.
Oh, he was so damn hot!
I was like, "Okay."
"You can't kill me" was more than just a, you know,
"You can't kill me because I'm this powerful
Nogitsune but I'm inhabiting your best friend."
I think out of any villain on the show,
Void Stiles has been...
has been my favorite.
One thing about comedic actors... and Dylan O'Brien is a great comedian... they all have a little bit of darkness in them, and once you tap into that darkness, you can exploit it.
That was the only time I've ever really... gone into myself and be like,
"Wow, this is the epitome of acting."
'Cause like Dylan and I couldn't be closer, we couldn't be more friendly.
We couldn't have been different.
Our dynamic as Void Stiles and Scott to Dylan and Tyler.
Loved it.
I think it definitely was one of those moments on set where you knew it was gonna have a lasting impression.
It really makes you appreciate the talent that is in this show.
I wanna eat a big bowl of Dylan O'Brien-Os.
_
_
- It's something as a fan...
- It's cool!
... you really wanted to see.
You wanted to see someone fully shapeshift and I was glad it was Derek.
- You've always wanted to see that?
- Yeah.
Give me a sec.
Something tells me this is gonna be same... yup, about the same.
Oh, we finally get to see him in his wolf form and kill Kate.
Please kill her.
You're... you were dead.
No.
I was evolving.
In our mythology, developed the idea that, uh, that was the highest state of power that a werewolf could achieve, becoming a full wolf.
What about True Alpha?
- That was... that's pretty high too.
- Okay.
Well, it's interesting to think that might be an ability that only a born werewolf can have.
So would Scott ever develop it?
We'll have to wait and see.
What do you think?
Maybe Scott, instead of turning into a full wolf, maybe he just turns into a bigger Scott.
Like a...
like a Hulk.
He's just this really big Scott.
Well, this is unexpected.
The show brings people together, and whenever we go to Comic-Con, we're one of the biggest entities there strictly because of the fans.
The energy in the room at a "Teen Wolf" convention is hyped.
Everybody there has one thing in common and it's that we all love this show so much.
I started a "Teen Wolf" convention called Howler Con and now we're going on four years.
It really makes you feel like you are part of a family.
Like we are a wolf pack.
I think MTV really created the space to have that kind of relationship with the fans, that they feel like they're a part of making "Teen Wolf."
I'm so glad this moment made it in the top ten.
I love it.
I love it!
- _
- You find an anchor, right?
- _
- Find your anchor.
My anchor was Allison.
I don't have Allison anymore.
Then be your own anchor.
I feel like that's one of those lessons that you can get from a show that you don't think that you can get.
It really demonstrated how Melissa has always pushed him to be the best Scott that he could be.
He could not be the leader of this pack if he didn't have Melissa as a leader to show him first.
Sweetheart, let me tell you something no teenager ever believes.
You fall in love more than once.
It'll happen again.
I promise.
And until then... be your own anchor.
That line... that whole scene kind of changed my life.
I was able to hear "be your own anchor"
and breathe and get through whatever I was trying to get through.
That scene came out of my life, actually.
When I was going through a breakup and was really depressed about it, my own mother said, "You love more than once in your life."
And that stayed with me.
Just to know that you...
you are all you need is a very like powerful statement for... for "Teen Wolf" to be making.
It is one of Melissa's first big like awesome moments.
I wanted really to show great relationships between parents and kids, and to show them be heroes in their own right.
And it really is one of the most touching mother-son relationships in... in TV.
_
- _
- Peter!
- Malia.
- What?
The only way we were able to break through the Hunt is with an emotional connection.
Dang.
Wish I could help.
I love the scenes in the train station.
I think it's just such an epic set and I loved that Malia and Peter have this beautiful family moment in that set because it was... just made it that much more iconic.
In a TV show like ours, to... which moves very fast through plot, we have the capacity to take a villain like that and sort of humanize him.
Uh, to an extent.
And that's why we decided to give him a daughter.
Malia.
And I love seeing their relationship together.
Say it like you mean it.
Dad.
Please wake up.
Dad.
Malia saying "Dad" to Peter is kind of like saying "I love you,"
where you can't... you can't go back.
It's said.
It's an important moment in "Teen Wolf" too because it shows something that we've always tried to communicate, which is heroism doesn't necessarily need to come from brute strength.
It can come from emotional connection, and I love that about it.
And that's so cool because all Peter is
- is brute strength, you know?
- Mm-hmm.
It shows that he, you know, he's got a heart
- somewhere in there...
- Yeah.
... beneath the... the pecks.
Who would be crowned best dancer?
Probably Dylan O'Brien.
Dylan and Posey would be the... the king and the king of the dance floor.
I've seen Shelley put it down a few times.
She does this thing where she kind of is able to move her body and kind of sexily look over her shoulder.
Who's the best dancer on "Teen Wolf"?
That would be me.
And my best move, uh...
You can't choose just one.
Fandom of the Year goes to...
"Teen Wolf"!
Thank you, thank you.
You guys drive our show.
You make it worthwhile.
We just love you guys.
And so this means the world to us.
I think the unique thing about "Teen Wolf"
and the cast with their fans is that they're so involved.
It's really important to us... to see... see that interaction and have that with them.
I think that they just feel that real, sincere, genuine love for them.
I've gotten to travel the world and meet "Teen Wolf" fans and hearing their stories.
I know that will always reign supreme in how much I feel like I know all of them.
I think that's really what's made it so special to me is the sense of community.
Everyone who is a fan of "Teen Wolf"
is... is a pack.
100 episodes is extraordinary to me.
And it's all do to the fans.
So this next moment is one of my absolute favorites.
- ♪ _
Lydia!
- No!
- Don't!
_
Lydia discovering that she's a Banshee was a pivotal moment for her character.
It seems like as soon as you know Lydia Martin, there's another side of her that we didn't know was there.
Unbelievable.
You have no idea what you are, do you?
The wailing woman.
A Banshee, right before my eyes.
Lydia finding out she was a Banshee meant that the show had... a clairvoyant, basically, that could predict death more than just a sniff.
It's more like a curse.
You need someone to discover the dead bodies.
This gave us a great excuse to have it always be her.
It made Lydia part of the pack, you know?
We all... we all had this thing in common with each other.
This just adds more diversity and coolness to the pack as a whole.
Just seeing her scream for the first time, you're like, "Oh my God."
Like it was just haunting.
I would say I always had a bit of a, I guess, louder scream, and I actually slightly ripped my vocal cords, uh, while screaming for the first two or three years.
Who doesn't want a raspy voice, though?
Yeah, sexy.
_
_
This moment of Scott becoming a true Alpha and breaking through the Mountain Ash is so important because most Alphas have to actually kill another Alpha in order to become an Alpha.
That's when we came up with this idea that by being a really good person, by sheer force of will, he could make his eyes go from yellow to red.
It was like, you know, when like Luke Skywalker gets his lightsaber, or when Captain America gets his shield, you know?
It's like now Scott has his eyes.
I think in that moment Scott really changed and like metaphorically becoming a man.
I'm an Alpha now.
Now it's Scott McCall and Scott McCall's pack and we're ready to roll with him.
It's one of my favorite moments in "Teen Wolf."
Me too.
Who is most likely to steal something from set?
We have a couple kleptos.
Uh, Ryan Kelley.
I feel like Ryan Kelley would be someone who would steal something on set, and I really have nothing to back that up.
I took the name plate, I took my shirt, um, and I'm gonna have it all framed in nice things, and I may have taken some other things but I can't tell you about that.
Me.
I am most likely to steal everything.
I've stolen everything already.
I know I've stolen a couple of things.
Um, actually, from this locker room.
A lot of socks.
Oh my God.
I don't ever leave socks.
I have so many socks now.
Thanks, MTV.

Ma'am, all we want is just a quick signature and then we're outta here,
I promise.
Well, I'm gonna tell ya the truth, the mayor happens to have a draining cyst on his check and it's really kind of ugly and he doesn't wanna be seen that way.
You know what?
I don't care about a draining cyst.
Everyone has stuff like that.
He's a vain man.
Okay, I feel like if he knew we were here he would just run out and say, "hey, Fred.
"Hey, Carrie."
Yes?
By the wharf.
The wharf?
Nothing.
Well *** It.
Got some...
l-lot of drama going on, huh?
There's a lot going on.
There's a lot-lot-lot going on.
You can just him know that we're here, please.
Gosh, she's so amped up.
She's running full speed.
You know, why don't we just go in there?
I don't know what she's doing.
Okay, let's go.
Mr. mayor?
How are you?
Could you just sign our books real quick?
Oh, sure,
I'll sign your book.
Just, uh...
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
What are, what are you doing?
What's going on?
The mayor is missing.
Well, when's the last time you saw him?
Two days ago.
We gotta go find him.
Yeah, let's go.
Hi.
Hi, can we help you?
I'm Beth.
Hi.
The house sitter.
Oh, right, okay.
We're gonna shut this and open the front door, okay?
Just to let you in 'cause you can't fit through here.
Thank you for house sitting for us.
Yeah.
We really appreciate it.
Wow, this is really nice.
It is.
It is... yes.
This is... this is our kitchen.
This is like a living being.
I mean the whole house, you gotta treat it with love and affection and attention.
So when is, um, trash day?
Oh, we don't observe trash day.
Oh, okay.
What do you want me to do with the garbage?
Just photograph the bags of trash and send it to us and we'll judge from there.
Uh, okay.
Okay.
I just wanna show you what it's like when you sleep.
I often, uh,
I'll do this expression...
And then waking up
I try to do a...
What time is it?
I'll just lay down.
See these books?
Yeah.
Don't ever open them.
Okay.
They're not for reading.
Cool.
And those pears... this is not a lie, they're 700 years old.
Should I get the mail?
I don't think
I've ever received mail here.
This is the light.
Oh, is there like a weird thing about it?
Just-just watch when I do it, okay?
You don't have to talk through it.
Just watch me.
The tendency here is because I'm nearsighted,
I get in really close.
And, as soon as she calls my name you can hit your head on here.
Yeah.
From the alarm of hearing your name.
Bryce!
Then there's that.
I was hit and was disoriented and my eyes went here and it scratched my corneas.
My God!
And as I came... put my hand up to sort of stop some of the scratching going further,
I had lost my balance and hit my temples on here.
And you got a lot of smashing of the temples as you're trying to regain your balance.
So you got your jaw hitting it and you're trying to call for help and your teeth are hitting the edge of the counter.
That bouncing is what can knock you out to the point where you can't get the same cup that you'd get usually.
See what I'm saying?
Honestly, I'm not gonna go crazy on the counter or anything.
I mean I'll just like, do one of, one of these.
Otherwise, like I said, you know...
Yeah.
Okay.
That's the last room.
This is the end of the tour.
Okay, cool.
Oh.
So you're clear on everything we told you with the house?
Yep.
You good?
Yeah.
We're entrusting our house with you, Beth.
The minute you leave my boyfriend's not gonna come over.
We're not gonna make out on the couch or anything.
Why did you bring it up?
That was weird.
I was kidding.
We will be back in two hours.
Did you just say two hours?
Sorry?
Did you say two hours?
Yes.
You're coming back here in two hours?
Yeah.
Bryce.
See ya then.
Okaz...
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, how are you?
Good, how are you guys?
Actually, we are looking for somebody.
We're looking specifically for the mayor of Portland.
And we were wondering if you could trace him using satellite technology to pinpoint his exact location.
Like, maybe he's got his phone on him and you can track it on a map.
I-I think that exists.
Are you on his family plan?
We're not.
Oh, well, then we can only help you track if he is on the family plan.
Oh, really?
Yeah, legally, we're not allowed to do it.
Damn it.
Damn it... all right.
Do you guys wanna sign up for a family plan?
Yes.
Sure... his family plan?
We can do that?
No, you start a family plan and you just ad him to it and then I can help you locate him using the find my phone feature.
That's great.
Yes, we would like to do that.
It's standard on all our plans.
Well, we're not like kicking out someone in his family to do that, right?
Just a new plan.
It starts over.
This is a fresh start.
Actually, the program is called "fresh start."
Yeah, why would you be concerned about kicking someone out in his family?
That's not what this is about.
Um, the basic plan we have for the family is, uh, the family talk plan.
It's called "all talk."
You get 400 anytime minutes which you can use anytime.
There's another one called
"even more family."
And that is 400 anytime minutes unlimited nights and weekends.
That sounds great.
We'll do that.
There's more options.
Can I... there's, uh,
"even mo family unlimited"
which is unlimited minutes and texting plus web.
Okay, so, one doesn't have texting...
The other doesn't have web.
We'll just get one that has everything.
Okay, well then you want
"the simply everything" plan.
Okay.
Great.
Um, there's also
"simply everything plus."
Which is what?
Simply everything plus texting.
What we want is your most standard, basic, family plan with a satellite locator.
"This changes everything"
plan is what you want then.
Yes, that'd be great.
We would like to sign up for that plan.
We are ready to do that.
Awesome, all right.
Let me run through a couple for plans we have.
We have the "strive plan,
"the go getter plan,
"the free and clear plan."
Didn't we already sign up for a plan?
Why is this a new plan?
Time is of the essence.
This is the mayor of Portland.
He could be lying in a ditch somewhere.
He might have been kidnapped.
Right on...
Um, do you guys want the data pro or the data plus.
What do most people get?
It's about 50-50 split on that one.
What's the last one you did?
The last transaction.
Did they do plus or data pro?
Actually, that information is confidential...
But I have their phone number so I'm gonna call 'em right now.
No, I don't care.
The pro.
Pro... we want pro.
Great news!
You can add another line for $5 a month.
Yes.
You guys wanna add another line for $5?
I would love that... yes.
Great, so you guys are all set.
That is the plan, simply every thing, every thing, uh, shared anytime minutes plus roll over.
Okay, now we pick your besties list which is five people which you can call even if they're outside your network.
I don't know.
No, it's you, me, and the mayor.
You get five.
We'll pick the other two later.
We'll do it online.
I didn't get your names yet.
What are your names?
Fred and Carrie.
All right, so I'll put him on your list, too?
What's your name again?
I'm sorry.
Fred.
So now we just have to chose the phone.
Our most popular models right now are the vitrio charismo.
That's the one we want.
Epiphany, torque, dazzle, create... it's the first one you said.
I actually want the torque.
Good choice.
Carrie?
All right.
Now our most popular colors for those are bubble gum, metallic bubble gum.
Great.
Metallic pumpkin.
And pumpkin.
What's the difference?
Carrie... this is an emergency.
Any color is fine.
Two pumpkin phones.
One vitrio one torque.
Thank you.
Great, okay.
So you're all set.
You're all signed up.
Now there is a nominal fee if you wanna keep your current phone number.
Yeah, I thought that was a free service.
After you pay for it, it is free, so...
Okay.
It's just a one time fee that you pay annually.
It's not a one time fee but... it is one time in that you only pay one time a year.
Great.
That's not one time.
I know, let's just...
All right great, you guys are ready to pick out your sunglasses.
What sunglasses?
We do have a promotion right now where you get a pair of free wild side sunglasses.
They help you bring out your wild side.
No, we'll pass, thank you.
Let's just get the "bitch" one.
You want the pink one that says "bitch" on it.
Okay...
You don't have to say it.
All right, great.
Thank you.
So what'd you guys come in for again?
We wanna find our bestie, our friend on the map.
The mayor.
Right, the mayor.
Let me type in the mayor's number.
Wow... so cool.
Oh, my God... there he is.
He's in northwest.
Got it.
You know how to get there?
Yes.
Okay... thank you.
Sir, thanks.
Thank you.
Hey, sunflowers.

Wait, there he is.
Oh, Mr. mayor.

Oh, sorry, sir.
Oh, here.
Mr. mayor?
Carrie.
Sorry, ma'am.
Must have left already or something.
Yeah.
Uh, can I get a milkshake, please?
Fred.
No way.
That's the mayor.
He's playing bass.
He's in a reggae band.
I feel a little weird saying this, but I like this.
I-I love this.
And he's not like, trying to, like overshadow the rest of the band.
He's like laying it down.
No, he's laying back.
Like a good bass player kinda lays back a little bit.
Except for like minute man and those bands where like they play high on the neck.
You sound good.
We've been looking for you.
We like how you play.
Uh, how's that milkshake coming, friend?
Not too cold on that, right?
Where's the stage?

Wow, that's so... like, he couldn't stop gushing about you.

This meeting is huge!
Okay, wait, but how do I get up there?

Hey, Happy Birthday.

Hey, you wanna break?
Kraggen!

You made it.
I did.
It took a while, huh?
Having too much fun?
Come on, this way.
Julia.
What?
I just wanted to tell you that I did what you said.
Sorry?
I stayed cool.
Like you wrote on the card.
Oh, right... okay, yeah.
You came up with that.
Simple and so meaningful.
It's like remaining cool.
You're really good.
She's creative.
I know, I can tell.
Stay cool.
Yeah, you, too.
You already are.
Okay.
I'll stay cool, too.
Good luck with that.
She ribbing me, by the way.
That's how we kid with each other.
Uh, you're gonna need these.
What for?
You'll see.
Kraggen, what's happening?
It's gonna be okay.
Okay, so let's start the meeting.
Julia, do you have any ideas right off the bat?
I wanna thank you for coming today...
On this cloudy,
Portland afternoon.
It's, um, been a difficult time for my family and for me.
First and foremost, wanna say, yes, I was playing bass in a dubbed reggae band called "king Desmond
"and the accelerators."
A reggae band?
Yes.
Floyd, Gerald,
Brian, Willy.
Reggae, that's a dirty secret in some ways... and he just he went ahead and just came right out.
Yeah.
What part do you play,
Mr. mayor?
Do you play an instrument?
Are you a singer?
What do you do?
I sit in a as a bass player.
What kind of bass do you have?
I had a rickenbacker 4003 that was just killer.
Uh, but right now, no, I'm playing a classic Fender precision.
Those have a great low end.
Unbelievable.
Who are your influences?
Jeez, I mean Augustus Pablo for me is like, he's king, you know.
Wow, he's into some root stuff, huh?
I can't believe his wife is so supportive.
Excuse me, Mr. mayor, would you say this is dance hall or real roots reggae.
This is real roots reggae.
We don't mess around.
Cool.
Once you go dub, you never go back.
You know what I'm saying?
Sir, with all due respect, would you consider yourself a skippa or rude boy?
Well, you know, if you can open up your heart and you can feel the sun and you can feel the music all is good and all is forgiven.
I'm sorry wh-what?
It's a new lyric that I've been working on with the band and I've... uh, and it's, um...
It's, uh.
That's me.
Sorry about that.
We'll wait.
Yes?
Great news right now.
No, I-I'm fine with my wireless plan.
It-it-it's Johnny from wireless toyz.
Why is he calling right now?
My besties?
Oh, she's right here.
Oh, the besties plan... yeah.
Hey.
No, I'm fine with my besties list.
Yeah, I wanna keep it the same.
He got rid of the glasses.
Everyone was calling him
"bitch."
Don't call again.
Bye.
Sorry.
Okay.
On you go.
Two of the... my favorite people over there.
Uh, anyway, where was I?
But if you do leave the country you will have to sign up for our geo plan.
Can we do that online afterwards?
Well, if you do change your mind later then you have to sign a new two year contract.
So six months from now you decide...
Oh, I wanna also get the geo plan 'cause I'm going to...
Let's say luxemburg, or something, then, it would be another two years from that, that you would have the plan.
We just want any plan that is above the nothing plan.
There is no nothing plan.
Nothing plan is what you guys had when you were outside.
Okay, you know what she means.
- Megan is running late.
- Okay.

Well-well-well-well...

Okay, now we pick your besties list which is five people which you can call even if they're outside your network.
I don't know.
No, it's you, me, and the mayor.
You get five.
We'll pick the other two later.
We'll do it online.
I didn't get your names yet.
What are your names?
Fred and Carrie.
All right, so I'll put him on your list, too?
What's your name again?
I'm sorry.
Fred.
So now we just have to chose the phone.
Our most popular models right now are the vitrio charismo.
That's the one we want.
Epiphany, torque, dazzle, create... it's the first one you said.
I actually want the torque.
Good choice.
Carrie?
All right.
Now our most popular colors for those are bubble gum, metallic bubble gum.
Great.
Metallic pumpkin.
And pumpkin.
What's the difference?
Carrie... this is an emergency.
Any color is fine.
Two pumpkin phones.
One vitrio one torque.
Thank you.
Great, okay.
So you're all set.
You're all signed up.
Now there is a nominal fee if you wanna keep your current phone number.
Yeah, I thought that was a free service.
After you pay for it, it is free, so...
Okay.
It's just a one time fee that you pay annually.
It's not a one time fee but... it is one time in that you only pay one time a year.
Great.
That's not one time.
I know, let's just...
All right great, you guys are ready to pick out your sunglasses.
What sunglasses?
We do have a promotion right now where you get a pair of free wild side sunglasses.
They help you bring out your wild side.
No, we'll pass, thank you.
Let's just get the "bitch" one.
You want the pink one that says "bitch" on it.
Okay...
You don't have to say it.
All right, great.
Thank you.
So what'd you guys come in for again?
We wanna find our bestie, our friend on the map.
The mayor.
Right, the mayor.
Let me type in the mayor's number.
Wow... so cool.
Oh, my God... there he is.
He's in northwest.
Got it.
You know how to get there?
Yes.
Okay... thank you.
Sir, thanks.
Thank you.
Hey, sunflowers.
It's my birthday.
Hello, tree.
Hi, street lamp.
How you doing?
Puppy... woof-woof!
It's my birthday!
I made a home-made quesadilla.
We are so lucky to live here.
Where the
Is everyone?
Hey, lady, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out!
Move, move, move, move, move-move-move!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
Yay.
God, that took us forever!
What is this place?
Wait, there he is.
Oh, Mr. mayor.
Hi.
Mr. mayor.
Everyone's looking for you.
The whole city.
Fred.
That's not the mayor.
Take the glasses off, bitch.
Oh, sorry, sir.
Oh, here.
Mr. mayor?
Carrie.
Sorry, ma'am.
Must have left already or something.
Yeah.
Uh, can I get a milkshake, please?
Fred.
No way.
That's the mayor.
He's playing bass.
He's in a reggae band.
I feel a little weird saying this, but I like this.
I-I love this.
And he's not like, trying to, like overshadow the rest of the band.
He's like laying it down.
No, he's laying back.
Like a good bass player kinda lays back a little bit.
Except for like minute man and those bands where like they play high on the neck.
You sound good.
We've been looking for you.
We like how you play.
Uh, how's that milkshake coming, friend?
Not too cold on that, right?
Where's the stage?
Julia.
Oh, hi, Mr. kraggen.
Uh, just call me kraggen.
Welcome.
Okay, kraggen.
Are you excited for your first day?
I am.
You ready to make some ads and commercials?
Yeah.
Yeah, we are, to.
I was telling my colleague about you and literally without skipping a beat he was like, through the roof, flipping out.
Wow, that's so... like, he couldn't stop gushing about you.
Hey, um, we've got a meeting in like five minutes.
This meeting is huge!
Okay, wait, but how do I get up there?
Kraggen?
Whoa!
Hey, nice catch.
We're ordering disks for the whole office.
What's your size?
What size of disk?
Wait, what?
Julia... here.
Oh, hey!
Did you get turned around?
Yeah.
You need a GPS?
Uh, the meeting's like in five minutes in the basket.
Wait, what?
In the basket.
Oh, I don't know what size I am for that.
In here.
What?
Let's go.
I mean, what are we doing?
Sign this here.
Surprise!
Oh, my gosh.
I guess this is for you.
Happy Birthday.
Thank you.
That means so much to me.
Hey, Happy Birthday.
I gotta go.
Thank you so much.
Who was that?
Ow, geez... what the?
Hey, we're mood showering.
We hit you with the ball and you tell us the first thing that comes to mind about sportswear.
Ow!
Julia...
Julia.
Hey, kraggen.
Our meeting's starting soon.
Come on up.
Okay... yeah.
Take the elevator.
Just come meet me.
Hey, I'm doing a video for my blog.
What's your favorite burger?
Hey, how's it going?
Is it okay if I take your photograph?
Julia, you better get up here... come on.
Kraggen, I'm trying.
Uh, wait, uh, kraggen.
Kraggen.
Kraggen?
Julia.
Kraggen.
Hey.
Come play air guitar with us.
It's all good.
It's Tucker's birthday, the party's about to start.
Happy Birthday.
Kraggen!
Julia.
Where's the basket?
Hey, you wanna break?
Kraggen!
Just...
I'll meet you over here.
You made it.
I did.
It took a while, huh?
Having too much fun?
Come on, this way.
Julia.
What?
I just wanted to tell you that I did what you said.
Sorry?
I stayed cool.
Like you wrote on the card.
Oh, right... okay, yeah.
You came up with that.
Simple and so meaningful.
It's like remaining cool.
You're really good.
She's creative.
I know, I can tell.
Stay cool.
Yeah, you, too.
You already are.
Okay.
I'll stay cool, too.
Good luck with that.
She ribbing me, by the way.
That's how we kid with each other.
Uh, you're gonna need these.
What for?
You'll see.
Kraggen, what's happening?
It's gonna be okay.
Okay, so let's start the meeting.
Julia, do you have any ideas right off the bat?
I wanna thank you for coming today...
On this cloudy,
Portland afternoon.
It's, um, been a difficult time for my family and for me.
First and foremost, wanna say, yes, I was playing bass in a dubbed reggae band called "king Desmond
"and the accelerators."
A reggae band?
Yes.
Floyd, Gerald,
Brian, Willy.
Reggae, that's a dirty secret in some ways... and he just he went ahead and just came right out.
Yeah.
What part do you play,
Mr. mayor?
Do you play an instrument?
Are you a singer?
What do you do?
I sit in a as a bass player.
What kind of bass do you have?
I had a rickenbacker 4003 that was just killer.
Uh, but right now, no, I'm playing a classic Fender precision.
Those have a great low end.
Unbelievable.
Who are your influences?
Jeez, I mean Augustus Pablo for me is like, he's king, you know.
Wow, he's into some root stuff, huh?
I can't believe his wife is so supportive.
Excuse me, Mr. mayor, would you say this is dance hall or real roots reggae.
This is real roots reggae.
We don't mess around.
Cool.
Once you go dub, you never go back.
You know what I'm saying?
Sir, with all due respect, would you consider yourself a skippa or rude boy?
Well, you know, if you can open up your heart and you can feel the sun and you can feel the music all is good and all is forgiven.
I'm sorry wh-what?
It's a new lyric that I've been working on with the band and I've... uh, and it's, um...
It's, uh.
That's me.
Sorry about that.
We'll wait.
Yes?
Great news right now.
No, I-I'm fine with my wireless plan.
It-it-it's Johnny from wireless toyz.
Why is he calling right now?
My besties?
Oh, she's right here.
Oh, the besties plan... yeah.
Hey.
No, I'm fine with my besties list.
Yeah, I wanna keep it the same.
He got rid of the glasses.
Everyone was calling him
"bitch."
Don't call again.
Bye.
Sorry.
Okay.
On you go.
Two of the... my favorite people over there.
Uh, anyway, where was I?
But if you do leave the country you will have to sign up for our geo plan.
Can we do that online afterwards?
Well, if you do change your mind later then you have to sign a new two year contract.
So six months from now you decide...
Oh, I wanna also get the geo plan 'cause I'm going to...
Let's say luxemburg, or something, then, it would be another two years from that, that you would have the plan.
We just want any plan that is above the nothing plan.
There is no nothing plan.
Nothing plan is what you guys had when you were outside.
Okay, you know what she means.
Thundercats
- S01E06 Jurney to the Tower of Omens
Original air date August 26, 2011
Jaga's clues have gotten us this far.
Now its up to Lion-O to get us the rest of the way.
Sword of Omens, give me Sight Beyond Sight.
Ok.
Let's try this again.
Sword of Omens, give me Sight Beyond Sight.
[groans] Come on.
Work!
Are you telling me our only chance of finding the Book of Omens
Is if his sword gives him directions?
It's about as hopeless as it sounds.
Lion-O can get us there.
He just needs to believe in himself.
It might help if you believed in him, too.
Sword of Omens, give me Sight Beyond Sight.
It's nothing but a rock in your incapable hands.
But the stone, your so-called Eye of Thundera,
Will be mine again.
I've wrenched it from a far more powerful grip than yours.
[beeping]
The ground forces have nearly reached the cannon, lord Mumm-Ra.
Destroy anything that keeps you from the Warstone, captain Tygus.
[weapon whirring]
Aah!
[grunts]
Aah!
[whirs] [groaning and rumbling]
We've procured the Warstone, my lord.
At long last, it's mine...
And it shall be mine again.
[steam hisses]
[whirs] [clanks]
This is dumb.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Sometimes, when you look too hard,
You miss what's right in front of you.
Tell me about it.
If you can master Sight Beyond Sight,
It will show you what your eyes can't see.
But your mind has to be open.
Now, try again,
And this time, relax.
Relax.
Ahh.
Got it.
Whatcha doin'?
Ooh, I know what they were doing.
[imitates kissing]
No, we were just trying to get...
My sword to work.
Why is this Book so hard to find, anyway?
Did they forget where they put it?
In a way, yes.
You see, the Book of Omens wasn't lost.
Rather, it was hidden
With the intention that it would never be found.
Legend says the Book of Omens held both clues to our past
And keys to our future.
Because some believed it could be even more valuable
Than the Sword of Omens,
The other animals would stop at nothing to get it.
The King knew it contained too much power
To allow it to fall into the wrong hands.
[hissing] [roars]
So he had the clerics hide it far beyond the kingdom walls,
Far beyond anywhere the cats had ever been.
To keep it safe, they built a temple,
One made with magic.
The Tower of Omens was inaccessible to anyone but themselves
And protected by ancient enchantments.
They then sealed themselves into the temple forever.
Its location would be a secret they took to their graves.
That's why Grune and I knew we'd probably never find it.
So we have to just get lucky and hope we stumble onto it?
[grunting]
Meow.
Maybe we just did.
How did we not see that?
I guess sometimes, when you look too hard,
You miss what's right in front of you.
Nice work, Snarf.
[yowls and grunts]
- Unh!
[grunts]
Meow... [both shudder]
[grunts] think they left the key behind?
Actually, they left a few.
[tinkling]
We'll just have to try them all.
This could take forever.
[clicks] [creaking and clacking]
I don't think we have forever.
[both gasp] - [screams] [panting] [all scream]
[all grunting]
Whiskers.
[all grunting]
Find the key!
Leave this to the masters.
Hurry!
There's hundreds to pick from.
[groaning]
Why waste time picking out a key...
When you could just pick the lock?
[clicks] [grunts]
[Snarf grunts] [both grunting]
The Book could be just beyond that wall.
[meows]
[gasps]
Legends said the ancients rigged
A series of obstacles near the temple
Meant to keep outsiders away.
Then this whole place is a death trap.
Got to move fast.
[grunts]
[bangs] [rumbling]
Nice work.
You've been leading us in circles.
Nonsense.
Mumm-Ra's spell is too powerful for an old wizard like me to fight.
I can't help but light the way.
[chuckles] [hisses] [rumbling]
[engine whirring]
Careful, general.
That lantern is as fragile
As its withered and duplicitous navigator.
He doesn't know the way to the temple, master.
He's toying with us.
No.
His mouth lies,
But his soul reveals the truth.
The Book's location has been passed down
Through the head clerics for generations.
He knows.
He simply requires more motivation.
Force me all you want,
But Lion-O will have that Book
Long before you reach the temple.
[groaning]
You and your army will remain here.
Your ineptitude has cost me enough already.
Look!
Treasure!
We're rich!
Wait!
[roars]
[groans]
- You OK, Panthro?
I never told you guys--
But I can't swim.
Looks like an exit up there.
We'll wait for the water to rise and float up to it.
[grunting]
I can't open it from this side.
I ain't going to make it, kid.
[grunting] [gasping]
Panthro's gone.
[all grunting]
[grunts] [panting] [all grunting]
Hang on!
[all talk at once] Panthro!
You're alive!
Guess not being able to swim has its advantages.
Who wants to bet that leads to the temple?
[meows]
There's nothing here!
All those traps just to protect... more jungle?
Maybe no one can find this temple because it doesn't exist!
Or maybe, it just takes more than getting past physical traps to find it.
Believe in yourself.
I do.
Sword of Omens, give me Sight Beyond Sight.
There's a switch.
[grunts] I can't reach it.
Allow me.
[rumbling] [meows]
Lion-O:
The Tower of Omens.
Panthro:
I can't believe I finally found it.
I guess all it took was the right partners.
The Book must be up there.
You did it, Lion-O.
Indeed, he did.
And it will be the last thing he ever does.
I led him right to you.
I'm sorry.
Jaga...
You're alive.
[chuckles] Hardly.
He's nothing but a vapor in a jar,
And I have little use for him now.
No!
[grunts] [growls] aah!
[screams and grunts] [groans]
- Cheetara!
We have to get to the Book.
Go.
Mumm-Ra's mine.
[growls] [both grunting]
This bag of bones is no match for Panthro.
Don't be deceived by appearances.
My true form is far more powerful.
Ancient spirits of evil,
Transform this decayed form into Mumm-Ra,
The Ever-Living!
[growling] [whimpers]
[roars] [groans]
[both grunt and scream]
[grunts]
[grunting]
Aah!
[grunts] [grunts]
Aah!
[both grunting]
Won't shake me that easily.
[grunts]
Unh!
[screams] [grunts] [grunting] [meows]
Mumm-Ra.
[wings flap]
- Aah!
The Book of Omens and its power belong to me!
Thundercats, ho!
[meows]
Close that mouth.
You're drooling.
[both grunting]
Huh?
[both grunt]
Aah!
Oh!
Unh!
[gasps] I've got you!
[screams] [groaning]
[laughs] you are much like your father.
What do you know of my father?
Only that I killed him.
[growls] [screaming]
The boy is not ready yet.
He cannot win this alone.
[groans]
The light!
[screams]
[caws]
The Book will be mine!
[cawing] [groans]
Huh?
Jaga.
He sacrificed himself for you, for all of us.
Look.
[meows]
[rumbles] [clanking] [meows]
At long last, we have all the answers.
Well, what does it say?
It says...
Nothing.
It's blank.
[meows]

Force me all you want, but Lion-O will have that Book long before you reach the temple.
You and your army will remain here.
Your ineptitude has cost me enough already.
Look!
Treasure!
We're rich!
Wait!
You OK, Panthro?
I never told you guys...
But I can't swim.
Looks like an exit up there.
We'll wait for the water to rise and float up to it.
I can't open it from this side.
I ain't going to make it, kid.
Panthro's gone.
Hang on!
Panthro!
You're alive!
Guess not being able to swim has its advantages.
Who wants to bet that leads to the temple?
There's nothing here!
All those traps just to protect... more jungle?
Maybe no one can find this temple because it doesn't exist!
Or maybe, it just takes more than getting past physical traps to find it.
Believe in yourself.
I do.
Sword of Omens, give me Sight Beyond Sight.
There's a switch.
I can't reach it.
Allow me.
Lion-O:
The Tower of Omens.
Panthro:
I can't believe I finally found it.
I guess all it took was the right partners.
The Book must be up there.
You did it, Lion-O.
Indeed, he did.
And it will be the last thing he ever does.
I led him right to you.
I'm sorry.
Jaga...
You're alive.
Hardly.
He's nothing but a vapor in a jar, and I have little use for him now.
No!
Cheetara!
We have to get to the Book.
Go.
Mumm-Ra's mine.
This bag of bones is no match for Panthro.
Don't be deceived by appearances.
My true form is far more powerful.
Ancient spirits of evil, transform this decayed form into Mumm-Ra, the Ever-Living!
Won't shake me that easily.
Mumm-Ra.
The Book of Omens and its power belong to me!
ThunderCats, Ho!
Close that mouth.
You're drooling.
I've got you!
You are much like your father.
What do you know of my father?
Only that I killed him.
The boy is not ready yet.
He cannot win this alone.
The light!
The Book will be mine!
Huh?
Jaga.
He sacrificed himself for you, for all of us.
Look.
At long last, we have all the answers.
Well, what does it say?
It says...
Nothing.
It's blank.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Here's to you from all of us...
Happy birthday to you.
—Can I blow?
—Of course, darling.
Careful; you've got a stain.
Happy birthday, my love.
Jaime...
Jaime, we were thinking... with the wife you've got, you hardly need any presents...
So, uh, we didn't bring any.
That's not true.
I've got one!
What's that, honey?
I wrote this for Daddy.
Really?
Well, go ahead and read it.
If we may have your silence, everyone, Lucia is going to read something.
If I may?
"My daddy is the greatest daddy in the world."
Elephants On A Spiderweb
"My daddy is the greatest daddy in the world because he always has time to play with me."
"On the weekends, Mommy, Daddy, and me play Twister, Charades, or Hide Seek."
...eleven, twelve thirteen, fourteen and fifteen.
"I always hide with him because he knows how to hide very well."
"I don't know how he does it, but he never gets caught."
Wow, it's hot enough to suffocate you in here.
Talk to your daughter; she refuses to get out of the tub.
Sit up, baby.
Let me comb your hair.
—Hey, Mommy, look at my hands!
—Honey, please, you'll get water all over everything!
See?
Check out my hands, Dad!
You've got the hands of an old crone.
And your hands are going to be like that forever unless you quit fidgeting and let me finish.
"Sometimes, when Mommy isn't home, Daddy lets me stay in the bath as long as I want,"
"and he scrubs my body all clean so he can have the prettiest daughter in the world."
"But I don't just want to be pretty.
When I grow up, I want to be smart too."
"Smart like Daddy, because he knows lots of stuff."
Come on, Lucia.
We have to go.
Just a little longer...
Please!
I said now, Lucia.
We're parked a long way out.
Come on, honey.
You'll wear yourself out.
All right, but can I have a drink of water?
I'll get you some water.
—Are you all right, darling?
—I ran over a pebble.
—Are you all right?
—Yeah.
Right.
Come on, I'll help you up.
"He knows the kind of stuff doctors know, so if I hurt myself, he knows how to take care of me."
Does it hurt here?
No.
Here?
No.
And here?
What happened?
Nothing too bad.
She took a spill.
"Daddy always takes care of me, and with him, I feel safe because I know nothing too bad is going to happen."
"At school, all my friends are girls.
The boys are stupid and all they want to do is play soccer,"
"but that doesn't matter to me, because Daddy is like my best friend."
Hello, Lucia.
Hello.
Aren't you supposed to be asleep?
I'm waiting for Mommy to tell me good night.
Mommy's going to be back late tonight.
What game are you playing?
The Family.
Would you like to play a different game with me?
Like what?
A really fun game but you can't tell anyone about it, not even Mommy, all right?
Why not?
Because if you tell anyone, we can't play it again.
If you tell, I'll get really, really angry and we won't be friends anymore.
You swear you won't tell anyone?
I swear.
Well, then...
"He's my best friend because secretly, I tell him things and he tells me things."
"Then we never say anything about them because friends always keep secrets."
"Because he does all that for me, and because he's my daddy, I draw pictures for him."
Hello.
I'm home.
How's it going?
Just fine.
I'm drawing a picture for Daddy.
That's nice, honey.
—Hello.
—Hello.
What's cooking?
Pasta.
Lucia wanted to have some; isn't that right, darling?
Yeah.
—Will it take very long?
—No.
—Mommy, is this how "greatest" is spelled?
—Let me see.
Could you pass me the mixer?
You could at least say thanks, couldn't you?
Thanks.
Jaime, why do you act like that?
Like what?
Like I'm always in your way.
Daddy, you want to see my drawing?
I finished it.
Not now, Lucia.
I'm busy.
You're ignoring me too?
Look, Dad:
I'm done.
I told you, kid, I'm busy.
Here, kiddo, help me with this.
What, is Lucia the only one here at home?
Aw, crap!
I'm sorry, sweetie.
"Daddy says my drawings are very pretty, and he hangs them up at his office so he can look at them every day."
"He thinks of me all the time because he loves me more than anyone else and would never want anything bad to happen to me."
"That's why he's the best daddy in the world."
You.
Corner of Dock Street and Third Avenue.
- You come for the wedding?
- Clearly.
You shouldn't have.
And by that.
I mean, you shouldn't have.
You are getting married?
How far along are you?
Ha!
My groom has dreamy eyes and speaks fancy words, with lots of syllables.
My groom is a cap'n.
Men all over the world speak his name...
- Perhaps you've heard of my fiancé?
- Jack Sparrow.
That scoundrel!
Thinks he can marry the both of us!
Auction Take a Wench for a Bride
It's the happiest day in a girl's life.
My lords!
My lords!
Lads, chaps, masters, esquires and gentlemen of fortune!
I present to you such loveliness as to make you weep.
Such grace as will strike you sober!
- Each wench...
- certified virginal.
Pure as snowflakes they are.
Least-wise in spirit, if not flesh.
- How dare you!
- Where is Jack?
Now, first item up for bid, 20 pieces of silver.
Do I hear 20?
- Five!
I bid five!
- I'm not...
Five?
Five?
I say that.
Five.
I have five.
Five...
Do I hear ten?
These are treasures beyond measure.
- Twenty for the redhead.
- Do I hear 30?
Seeking 30.
- Thirty!
Thirty!
Do I hear 40?
- Aye!
Forty for the redhead!
- Step aside, jolie fille.
- We want the redhead!
It's advertising, is it then?
Fine.
Ten for the one with the flaxen hair!
Ooh, flaxen!
- Fifty for the redhead!
- Fifty!
Fifty, do I hear 60?
- Sixty!
- Fifteen for the fla...
Uh, for the not-redheaded.
- I have been egregiously underbid upon!
- Seventy for the redhead!
You're not believing the trickery in those locks, are ya?
- There's no trickery here!
- Oh, then it must be elsewhere, is that it?
Pony up for this one, you'll be scraping a barnacle from the hull for a week!
- Hussy!
- Priss!
Jezebel!
Wildcats!
I bid 200 for the pair!
- Two-twenty-five!
- Offering them as a lot!
Two-fifty!
Three hundred!
Three-fifty!
- We bid 400!
- We?
- We formed a corporation.
- Five hundred!
- Five-fifty!
- Six hundred!
- Six-seventeen.
- And a goat!
Nigel, you love that goat.
- You love that goat.
- And a goat!
Seven hundred and two goats!
Seven hundred and two goats it is!
- Seven hundred?
- We're rich.
We have goats.
I...
I am rich.
I have goats.
I regret to inform you that, as facilitator of this transaction, I take in form of commission a fair percentage.
- How much?
- One hundred percent.
- You can't do that!
- As owner of the property disposed, in fact I can.
- No one owns me.
- We're not property.
Are they for sale or not?
Wait!
Lower your cannons!
I traded for them fair and square, meaning I can do as I like, including resell at profit.
It says so right over here in the hallowed pirate Code!
Aye, the Code be the law as always.
And woe to anyone who shows it any disrespect.
So...for the sake of argument... this stocking I was wearing...
Hold on.
- ...you own this?
- Absolutely.
- And if I sing a sing, you own that, too?
- Undoubtedly.
Fine.
Then own this.
You're gonna pay for that!
No!
Wait!
Sold to the man with the goat!
I only borrowed the goat!
Buyer's remorse!
They're still yours!
No!
Don't you see?
This is all the doing of one man!
Jack Sparrow!
Where?
!
I don't believe it.
He shot the Code.
Captain Teague'll have his head.
Get him outta here!
Be not deterred, gentlemen.
I have a fresh consignment of fine Peruvian llamas due in a fortnight.
(Some guy):
Gently, gently...
- Gently, gently...
- Lock up the Code!
Strike the wenches!
And if any of ye ever speak a word of this...
I'll have your tongue.
- Aye, sir.
Mum's the word.
- Mum's the word.
Next time I see him, I'll be re-acquainting Jack Sparrow with the palm of my hand.
So will I. Not that I didn't trust Jack, but in case he got cold feet,
I thought, perhaps, taking these out of his boat might slow him down a bit.

Gina, you have done it again.
- And that's just the East Coast.
- Mm.
Michael Holt invents a new instrument, everyone wants to get their hands on it.
Hmm, bet you say that to all your neurosurgeons.
Only the one who keeps me in Armani.
You going to fly home to DC tonight?
I'll be back in two months.
You have time for dinner?
Already made a reservation at Per Se.
Swing by and get you at 8:00?
See you then.
Shall I cancel your lunch?
Hate to spoil your appetite for tonight.
Not possible.
This will.
The Clinica called three times.
Said you're late for your shift.
Tell them I'm on my way.
Hold on, Romeo.
You have a last-minute consult in Exam Two.
- Rachel Lewis.
- New patient?
You treated her mother Eileen for a slipped disc three years ago.
She sent you Yankee tickets to thank you.
Yes.
Sat front row behind first base.
I caught a pop fly.
Oh, yeah.
Of course you did.
What's up with her daughter?
She passed out right in the middle of her bridesmaids' brunch.
It was terrifying.
Mom, it wasn't that big a deal.
I'm getting married Sunday.
Take a deep breath.
(Inhales, then exhales)
She's a little wound up.
Rachel is trying to play this down for you, but when she stood up to give a toast.... she crashed to the floor.
I was just a little dizzy, that's all.
She has also had a headache for three days straight.
But it's gone today.
I'm fine.
This headache...
where was the pain?
Everywhere.
Felt like my head was being crushed in a vise.
Any double vision or nausea?
No.
Any weakness in the limbs
- or numbness?
- Nothing.
See, Mom, it's not a brain tumor.
It could be any number of conditions that could be causing these symptoms, starting with the stress of your wedding.
So will you... still run some tests?
Yeah, let's do an MRI, Ugh.
some labs and, uh, try to take a breath, relax.
Your wedding should be fun.
Mine was.
Tavo, will you give Mrs. Pence one of our starter diabetes kits and extra syringes till she has time to get to the pharmacy?
Will do.
Kate:
Where's Holt?
We got more than a dozen patients waiting here.
Autumn, any word from Dr. Holt?
- I've called him three times.
- Try again.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
That's quite a shiner.
How come you don't have any lollipops?
Uh... here.
These are better.
Raisins?
They're good for you.
Raisins suck.
(Chuckling):
Okay.
Can I help you?
Hi.
I teach first grade down the block, and I was just wondering if I could see somebody real quick.
- What's the problem?
- I don't know.
I just feel cruddy.
Well, you're in luck.
We treat "cruddy" here.
Just fill this out, and we'll be with you as soon as we can.
MRI's clear, labs are normal, and EKG looks good.
Then why did she faint?
What about the headaches?
Uh, fainting's probably from just not getting enough to eat.
Headache is probably just tension.
Let me give you a prescription for Naproxen to get you through your honeymoon.
Now, get out of here and go get married.
Mom?
Eileen, you all right?
I'm fine.
Whew!
I guess all this is harder on me than I thought.
Seeing your father with his child bride... (Gasping)
Rita, get me a nurse!
I can't catch my breath.
What's wrong with her?
Her pulse is thready and her heart's racing.
What do you need?
Get me a crash cart!
Grab a pillow.
Hang on, Eileen.

A Gifted Man:
Season 01 Episode 09 In Case of Abnormal Rhythm Original Air Date:
December 2, 2011
- Is it a heart attack?
- No.
Her heart rate's up to 180.
It's what we call atrial fibrillation.
What on Earth is that?
It's when your heart beats abnormally.
The electrical impulses at the top of your heart are out of sync with the ones at the bottom.
That sounds serious.
It can be.
We need to admit you to Manhattan Memorial right away to start you on a blood thinner.
I can't go to the hospital.
We have her dress fitting this afternoon.
You need an echocardiogram first to make sure there's no underlying cardiac damage
- causing the arrhythmia.
- So she could've had it
- for a while without knowing?
- Possibly.
A-fib is more common the older you get.
What causes it?
Heart disease, stress, even alcohol.
Well, we know it's not alcohol.
My mom's been sober for 15 years.
Right, Mom?
Eileen?
Have you had a drink today?
Um, I may have had a few sips of a mimosa at brunch.
You what?
They gave me one with champagne by accident.
It's no big deal.
Have you had anything else to drink in the past few days?
Mom, please tell him no.
It's been going on for a couple of weeks.
It started with a glass of port before bed, and... it just got worse.
Well, that certainly could cause the A-fib.
Drinking after so many years of being sober can bring on an attack.
How could you?
You sat on that bench in Central Park when I was 13 and promised me you'd never touch another drop of alcohol.
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.
Can you take this thing out of me, please?
Eileen, you're in no shape to...
Please!
I've screwed up.
I need to talk to my daughter.
You walk out of here right now and you could die.
Honestly, I'm feeling much better.
The fluttering is gone.
Check my heart.
- Well?
- Yes, your heart rate's fine.
But A-fib can come and go.
This puts you at risk for a heart attack or a stroke.
You need to be in a hospital on a Heparin drip to thin your blood.
I'm leaving.
And you can't stop me.
You're right, Eileen.
I can't tie you down, hold you here.
If you want to do something that stupid, there's nothing I can do about it.
Isn't there anything you could give me, please?
I just want to see my daughter in her dress.
Yeah, I could give you a shot of Enoxaparin.
It's not my first choice 'cause it doesn't work as fast as Heparin, but if you insist on leaving, that's... the best I can do.
I insist.
(Sighs)
So, as soon as you've talked to Rachel, you're going directly to Dr. Eastman.
He's a cardiologist at Manhattan Memorial right next door.
I've called him and he is expecting you.
You have my word.
Thank you, Dr. Holt.
You're welcome.
You have a wonderful boss.
Let me guess, someone's leaving against medical advice.
From now on, all family members stay in the reception area.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
We're a little understaffed today.
One of our docs is in Philly playing with his band, and the other one is... well, don't get me started on him.
Yeah, what about him?
Other than having an ego the size of Wyoming?
He's, uh, an hour and a half late.
Anyway, what's going on with you?
You don't look so hot.
I have a sore throat, maybe a fever.
I thought it was allergies, but my principal made me come in.
Yeah, you do feel a little warm.
Anything else going on?
No.
I'm sure I just picked up something from my kids.
My school is one great big petri dish.
Well, it's probably a viral pharyngitis.
But I'd like to do a rapid strep test just to be sure.
How long will that take?
Just a few minutes.
All right, open up and say aah.
Aah.
There we go, all done.
Those for your students?
Yeah, we're having a fall festival in class tomorrow.
You have school on Saturday?
Tomorrow's Tuesday.
No, tomorrow is Saturday.
Today is Friday.
Oh, you're right.
What am I thinking?
All right, I am going to run this test, and I'll be right back.
Would you mind calling my boyfriend, Hank?
I've been trying him all morning, but he's not at work.
Maybe there's something wrong with my phone.
Sure.
Can you write down his number for me.
That's strange.
I can't remember the number.
Well, well, well.
Dr. Punctuality.
- Nice to see you too, Sunshine.
- Hold on.
Dr. Sykora wants all her employees to clock in now.
Her employees?
She wants to keep track of how many hours everyone's working.
Really?
(Metallic humming)
ANTON:
All right, now all together, let's breathe in forgiveness.
Deep breath.
And on the exhale, let's focus that breath and let's send love to yourself and to someone you care about.
Brother Mike.
Come on in, join us.
Surely you must have some forgiveness work to do.
Surely you must be joking.
Oh, Dr. Holt, fashionably late for work?
Even though you only work here ten hours a week.
I had a patient in rapid A-fib.
So what's the deal with Anton's little séance across the hall?
You know, I brought him in to do carpentry.
It's part of our new meditation program.
We're also going to offer nutritional classes, yoga.
No leeches?
I hear they're making a comeback.
Oh, taking a stand against wellness.
I practice evidence-based medicine.
Then you must've read the randomized trial on the effects of Tai Chi on fibromyalgia in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Well, the study wasn't double-blind.
A dozen things could account for the correlation.
Just because we don't know the exact mechanism, doesn't mean there isn't one.
Or is that too much uncertainty for you?
So your social worker says I'm on the clock.
Got a patient for me, boss?
I've got a lady with the flu, a kid with pinkeye, but, uh, first I'd like you to take a look at a school teacher.
Julia.
Chief complaint, sore throat, temp of 101.
Here strep test just came back negative.
Sounds like viral pharyngitis.
What's the big deal?
She's confused.
Did you talk to my boyfriend?
Our social worker is trying to reach him.
Julia, this is Dr. Holt.
I'd like him to examine you.
Dr. Wyoming.
Excuse me?
It's nothing.
Hi.
Does that bother you?
Yes.
Hurts.
Look up at the ceiling.
I can't.
It's okay.
(Knocking)
Excuse me, folks.
I got through to your boyfriend's office, but they said he's out today on a rock climbing trip.
Oh, that's right, he was going to the Catskills.
Or maybe it was Bear Mountain.
I'm not sure.
Confusion, fever, photophobia, neck rigidity.
It's meningitis.
Or encephalitis.
Either way, she's going to need a spinal tap.
I'll have Rita send someone over to pick up the spinal fluid and run it back to my office.
Autumn, we should start an isolation protocol in case it is meningitis.
I'll call her school and tell them they may have been exposed, too.
- Anyone else need to be notified?
- Department of Health.
We may need prophylactic antibiotics for everyone at school or here who's come in contact with Julia.
We got to get her out of there!
So what does it feel like to be a second grader?
It's cool.
Julia, you shouldn't be out here.
Oh, Miss G's not bothering us.
She used to teach my son last year.
Why did I come out here?
Come on, Julia.
(Coughs)
What's happening to me?
Let's just get you back to your room.
I need my boyfriend.
I need to call Hank.
I can't remember why I'm here. (Coughs)
Until we know what's wrong with Julia, nobody comes in, nobody leaves.
KATE:
Excuse me.
Listen, everyone.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I know that you have all been here for, like, two hours, but we just can't let anyone leave until we get the results of the meningitis test.
That really sucks.
Hey, deep breaths, friend.
Keep it cool.
Come here.
Kate, I made calls to Catskill Park, Bear Mountain,
Adirondack Park, and all of them said there's no way we can track down Julia's boyfriend.
Call the state police.
Tell them he may have been exposed to meningitis and we need to pick him up before he infects others.
How's Julia?
Still altered.
Otherwise no change.
Does she remember where Hank was rock climbing?
Yeah, Connecticut, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Maine.
(Cell phone buzzing) That narrows it down.
It's Rita.
Any news?
Good news.
Julia's spinal tap is negative for meningitis and encephalitis.
Really?
Okay, read me the results.
Two white cells, four red cells.
Gram stain negative.
You read both pages?
After six years with you, Michael, and 20 as an RN,
I think I know how to read a lab report.
Okay.
Excuse me.
I'm Rachel Lewis.
I was here earlier today with my mother, Eileen.
Oh, yes, she left to go find you.
She found me.
She came to my dress fitting and we had a big fight.
I said a bunch of things I didn't mean, and now she's not picking up her cell.
Did she say she was going anywhere else?
Dr. Holt made her promise to go see Dr. Eastman, a cardiologist next door.
Thank you.
Come back for meditation next week.
Bye, Mrs. Lopez.
Bye, sweetheart.
You're welcome.
Thank you all so much.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you for your patience.
Have a nice weekend, guys.
Thank you.
So, we've ruled out infectious meningitis and encephalitis.
What else is causing Julia's altered mental state?
Maybe we should get Anton and meditate on it.
Don't quit neurology for stand-up just yet.
Have you found Hank yet?
Not yet.
Is there anyone else that we can call?
A friend, family member?
No, just Hank.
What are you scratching?
I don't know.
(Sighs)
You mind if I take a look?
Oh.
Those scabs look infected.
How long have you had them?
A little while.
I got some bug bites.
Julia, have you ever been camping with Hank?
Just once.
A few weeks ago.
Maybe a month ago.
I'm not sure.
Did you sleep in a tent?
No, under the stars.
We saw a meteor shower.
It was beautiful.
There were a lot of bugs.
Yeah, I bet.
We'll be right back.
Those bugs could have infected her with any number of vector-borne illnesses.
We should test her for Lyme disease.
And West Nile.
She scratched herself so much, it's hard to even tell what bit her.
Could be an animal bite.
I know what you're thinking, Michael.
Hello?
Do me a favor and call my assistant.
Tell her to run a new infectious panel on Julia's cerebral spinal fluid.
Lyme disease, West Nile, and throw in rabies, too.
Rabies?
They were sleeping outside the tent.
She could've been bitten by a bat.
If Julia has rabies and she's already symptomatic...
- Then she's going to die.
- Just call Rita.
You know, you don't need to tell me what I'm thinking.
Alaska, that boy who lived above Jiggy's auto shop, bitten by the rabid dog.
I know.
There was nothing you could do for him, and that tore you up.
I am not ready to plan her funeral yet.
Michael, if it comes to that, please don't let her die alone.
When the car hit me and the driver just drove off, the kids whose ball I chased, they were too scared to come over.
And I just laid there alone and died.
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
We are trying to find her boyfriend, okay?
(Phone buzzing)
Rita, you can't have the test results back.
Kate just called you.
It's Eileen Lewis.
She and her daughter had another big fight, then Eileen went to an AA meeting, and her right side went limp.
Someone from the meeting just brought her in.
She's got a blood clot in her brain.
The Enoxaparin didn't work fast enough.
Do you want an MRI?
Yeah, and prep her for surgery and call Victor Lantz.
I'm on my way.
Look, I gotta...
Where are you going?
I got an emergency back at my office.
Right now this is your office.
I can't do anything for Julia until I know what we're treating.
I'll call you as soon as I get her test results.
MICHAEL:
Where's the clot?
Middle cerebral artery.
I hear you treated with Enoxaparin.
That's why we can't use TPA to bust the clot.
She'll bleed out.
My daughter?
Rachel's on her way.
Rita called her.
I have to see her.
You have to get into surgery now.
Wait.
I ruined everything.
I just want to tell her I'm sorry.
Eileen, you don't have time.
I have to get that clot out or you could die.
Now get her in there now.
All right, Victor, how's Eileen's heart rate?
It's fine, but she's still in A-fib.
All right, I'm nearing the occlusion.
Once the catheter's in place, I'll Roto-Rooter the clot and have her dancing at her daughter's wedding.
Where's my mother?
!
In surgery.
(Gasps)
She had a stroke.
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!
Dr. Holt is removing the clot.
He's done hundreds of these procedures.
Why don't you have a seat and try to relax?
Come on, Eileen, let me in there.
You find the little bastard?
Hit it.
(Device humming)
Ah...
Got him in my sights.
And now the main event.
Ready for the penumbra.
I love my job.
Shouldn't he be done by now?
Oh, the procedure takes time.
As soon as Dr. Holt is finished, he'll let us know.
Chocolate?
I find it's a trusted friend in times like these.
Thanks.
I'm threading the wire through the middle cerebral artery.
All right, I'm at the clot.
Start the aspiration.
(Device humming)
Engaging the penumbra separator.
I'm breaking the clot into little pieces.
Then I'll suck 'em out.
I think I got it.
Let's give her another dose of contrast.
Let's see how good I am.
Hey, blood flow has been restored.
And that is a beautiful thing.
I'll start to wake her up.
(Device beeping rapidly)
Victor, talk to me.
BP's dropping, heart rate's rising.
Did you tear the vessel?
No.
I need more contrast!
Must be in the brain stem.
She must've thrown a second clot.
Give me back the guide wire.
(Beeping continues) Come on, let's go.
Are you at the second clot yet?
No, I'm just ready to image the posterior circulation now.
BP's still dropping.
I'll start pressors to get her pressure up.
There it is.
Second clot's in her basilar artery.
She's stroking out her brain stem.
That's why her BP's falling.
We are in big trouble.
- Not once I get the sucker.
- Hurry up.
Her fluids are running wide open.
Hanging norepinephrine.
I know the waiting's tough.
You know what I did when my mom showed up at my fitting?
I told her not to come to dinner tonight, that a drunk didn't deserve to meet my fiancé's parents.
What kind of a daughter says that?
One who's pushed too far on the wrong day.
Now she's in there alone.
That may be the last thing I ever say to her.
When your mother had her disk operated on a few years ago,
I got to know her pretty well.
You know what she talked about?
You.
I heard all about the clerkship you had that summer, how hard it was to get, how well you did in law school... and how much she liked your boyfriend.
My fiancé Brad.
She told me how proud she was that you managed to avoid all the stupid mistakes she made in life.
That she wasn't gonna take credit for how well you turned out, but that sometimes, when you weren't aware of it, she'd look at you and... you just took her breath away.
Oh...
BP's 63/40 and still dropping.
Penumbra again.
(Device beeping rapidly)
She's bradying down.
She's gonna code.
I'm getting close.
(Steady tone) LANTZ:
I lost her pulse.
Start compressions!
Push an amp of epi.
Still flatlining.
Give her atropine!
Come on, you little son of a bitch.
Still no rhythm.
I'm there, but I can't engage the clot.
Come on.
Come on.
LANTZ Still no heartbeat!
40 units of vasopressin.
Got it!
Removing the clot...
(Alarms cease)
Okay, brain stem has good flow again.
Pulse is back.
It's weak, but it's back.
Start her on a Heparin drip, no bolus, titrate up the norepinephrine.
Nice work.
Dr. Holt!
Rachel, your mom did great.
(Sobbing) What?
Sulla, take Ms. Lewis to her mother's room.
Mother.
Michael...
She's gonna be okay.
Eileen is, but Julia.
It's rabies?
Oh, I'm sorry, Michael.
Shall I call Dr. Sykora and let her know?
Just tell her I'm on my way.
Is that what they're wearing to Per Se days or are we skipping dinner altogether?
Gina, I can't do tonight.
Next time, I promise, as soon as you get back.
But...
Julia has rabies?
Her test was positive.
So we can treat her symptoms, but...
She's not gonna make it.
She may only have a couple hours.
Excuse me.
I think my girlfriend's here.
- Someone called me.
- You're Hank.
Yeah, I'm Dr. Sykora.
This is Dr. Holt.
Hi.
Where is she?
I'll take you back.
She's right here.
You coming?
In a minute.
I'm gonna make a call.
Hank.
Jules, honey, are you okay?
- I didn't know where you were.
- I know.
We were about to get up to Bear Mountain, and I just had the feeling something was wrong.
And when we got back into cell range, I had 15 missed messages.
Thank you for finding him.
Honey, look at you.
You can't kiss her.
Why, what's the matter?
One of my messages said it might meningitis.
Is that what she has?
We thought so at first, but...
But what?
Unfortunately, Julia has tested positive for the rabies virus.
Rabies?
How?
We think she might have been bitten by a bat when you went camping last month.
- A bat?
- You're joking, right?
I don't know how much you know about rabies...
Well, she has to get shots in the stomach, right?
Only if exposure is suspected before the patient becomes symptomatic.
We're gonna have to get you started on prophylactic shots right away.
Okay, what about Julia?
Once the patient becomes symptomatic, the chances of survival are extremely small.
Are you saying I'm gonna die?
I'm sorry, Julia.
No, this isn't happening.
What, you-you can't, you can't treat her?
I mean, they treat AIDS, they treat cancer!
We can make sure she doesn't suffer.
You're gonna have to do better than that!
Hank, it's not her fault.
No, baby, it's my fault.
Look, I made you go camping.
You didn't want to go.
You did it for me.
Hank, I'm scared.
I don't want to die...
Honey, honey.
Dr. Sykora, can I talk to you for a moment?
So, I just got off the phone with a virologist who says there's an experimental protocol for treating rabies.
- And?
- It was first used on a 15-year-old girl in Wisconsin who was already symptomatic and she survived.
And it's worked five other times since.
Okay.
And how many times has it failed?
If you've got another option, I'm all ears.
MICHAEL:
You understand, this procedure is experimental.
There are no guarantees.
- Then we won't do it.
- Hank, we don't have a choice.
What do you have to do?
Essentially, we put you into a coma to protect your brain and let the rabies run its course.
Julia, you have to decide now.
Victor, it's Michael.
Yeah, I'm coming in with a rabies patient.
Yes, rabies.
We have to put her into a coma as fast as we can.
I'll tell you when I get there.
- Ambulance is on its way.
- Okay.
Julia, are you allergic to any medications?
Any prior difficulty with general anesthesia?
- No.
KATE:
- What about a health care proxy?
Do you have someone to make medical decisions for you if you can't?
It's usually a family member or spouse.
Hank's the only one.
But we're not married.
Jules, let's get married.
Hank...
I knew you were the one for me the first moment I saw you.
Standing in Trader Joe's, with your little canvas bag.
But I'm sick.
I don't care, okay?
I love you.
Please, Julia, will you marry me?
Yes.
But stand up.
You're embarrassing me.
Wish you could make it official down at City Hall, guys, but we got to move.
Right.
Come on.
I can help you.
Not now, Anton.
No, no, I'm talking about marrying them.
What, are you eavesdropping?
The walls here are paper thin.
I thought you'd want to know, I'm a legally ordained minister.
Of course you are.
I got my license on the Internet.
Married a couple of friends of mine in a yurt upstate.
I'm your guy.
We don't have time.
I can marry them on the way over.
I mean, three minutes max.
Michael, don't make her face this alone.
All right, get in.
- Are you serious?
- Just get in!
Hey, Doc, nobody rides in the back but you and the girl.
Not the hippie guy and not the boyfriend.
It's not her boyfriend, it's her husband.
At least he will be in three minutes.
Let's go.
Wait, wait.
Take this.
(Siren wailing)
Anton, let's go.
You ready?
Julia.
(Sighs)
Tonight we go to that place of eternity.
This is the wedding night.
A never ending union of lover and beloved.
We whisper gentle secrets to each other.
And the child of the universe takes its first breath.
Without love, all worship is a burden.
All dancing is a chore.
All music is mere noise.
Do you, Hank, take this woman, Julia, from this day forward to have and to hold, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, to love and to cherish as long as you both may live?
I do.
Do you, Julia, take this man, Hank, from this day forward for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, to love and to cherish as long as you both may live?
- I do.
- By the powers vested in me by the State of New York, I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
(Siren wailing)
You can kiss her, friend.
On the cheek.
(Alarm beeping)
- Give me some room.
- What are you doing?
Starting dopamine to get her pressure up.
- How much longer?
- Five minutes.
(Steady flatline tone)
She's lost her pulse.
Need some help back here.
Stay with us, Jules.
Bag her.
HANK:
Come on, baby.
Push an amp of epi.
PARAMEDIC:
If you're going to be here, start bagging.
Jules...
Got a rhythm.
Damn it, it's a V tach.
Clear.
Jules, I love you, baby.
Please don't leave me.
- I love you.
- Damn it, lost her pulse.
Bag her.
Push another amp of epi.
(Steady flatline tone)
Come on...
Honey.
Honey.
(Monitor tone fades, Michael breathes hard)
(Siren wailing)
(Sighs)
Time of death, 9:12 p.m.
(Sobs)
(Hank weeping)
Bye, Julia.
My beautiful wife.
Her needs a moment with his wife.

Michael.
Welcome back.
I should've never have left.
Rachel?
She's out getting a cup of coffee.
Rita's gonna get her to tell her you're awake.
I had the strangest sensation in there... like I was leaving my body.
And I saw that bright light, like a tunnel.
But then I heard Rachel's voice calling me back.
(Chuckles)
And then I woke up in the recovery room.
Well, you didn't have a heartbeat for almost a minute in there.
It's what we call a "near death experience."
I know how it sounds.
Believe me, I'm not big in all that afterlife stuff either.
But it felt so real.
It can be explained medically.
Are you sure?
Like all paranormal experiences can.
- Go on.
I can't wait to hear.
- Anoxia;
lack of blood flow to the brain, causes hallucinations.
Does that apply to me?
Even extreme physical trauma can cause the body to go into REM sleep, which triggers increased brain activity.
But you're not sleeping, Michael.
Even the tunnel phenomenon can be explained by the way the retina reacts to oxygen deprivation.
Or maybe she and her daughter still have unfinished business.
Dr. Holt?
Let's just be happy you're here now.
Mom?
Rachel!
Mom.
Come here, sweetheart.
I was so worried.
It's fine.
Anna?
A Gifted Man:
Season 01 Episode 09 In Case of Abnormal Rhythm Original Air Date:
December 2, 2011
600 lumbar stitch drivers.
Gina, you have done it again.
- And that's just the East Coast.
- Mm.
Michael Holt invents a new instrument, everyone wants to get their hands on it.
Hmm, bet you say that to all your neurosurgeons.
Only the one who keeps me in Armani.
You going to fly home to DC tonight?
I'll be back in two months.
You have time for dinner?
Already made a reservation at Per Se.
Swing by and get you at 8:00?
See you then.
Shall I cancel your lunch?
Hate to spoil your appetite for tonight.
Not possible.
This will.
The Clinica called three times.
Said you're late for your shift.
Tell them I'm on my way.
Hold on, Romeo.
You have a last-minute consult in Exam Two.
- Rachel Lewis.
- New patient?
You treated her mother Eileen for a slipped disc three years ago.
She sent you Yankee tickets to thank you.
Yes.
Sat front row behind first base.
I caught a pop fly.
Oh, yeah.
Of course you did.
What's up with her daughter?
She passed out right in the middle of her bridesmaids' brunch.
It was terrifying.
Mom, it wasn't that big a deal.
I'm getting married Sunday.
Take a deep breath.
She's a little wound up.
Rachel is trying to play this down for you, but when she stood up to give a toast.... she crashed to the floor.
I was just a little dizzy, that's all.
She has also had a headache for three days straight.
But it's gone today.
I'm fine.
This headache...
where was the pain?
Everywhere.
Felt like my head was being crushed in a vise.
Any double vision or nausea?
No.
Any weakness in the limbs
- or numbness?
- Nothing.
See, Mom, it's not a brain tumor.
It could be any number of conditions that could be causing these symptoms, starting with the stress of your wedding.
So will you... still run some tests?
Yeah, let's do an MRI, Ugh.
some labs and, uh, try to take a breath, relax.
Your wedding should be fun.
Mine was.
Tavo, will you give Mrs. Pence one of our starter diabetes kits and extra syringes till she has time to get to the pharmacy?
Will do.
Where's Holt?
We got more than a dozen patients waiting here.
Autumn, any word from Dr. Holt?
- I've called him three times.
- Try again.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
That's quite a shiner.
How come you don't have any lollipops?
Uh... here.
These are better.
Raisins?
They're good for you.
Raisins suck.
Okay.
Can I help you?
Hi.
I teach first grade down the block, and I was just wondering if I could see somebody real quick.
- What's the problem?
- I don't know.
I just feel cruddy.
Well, you're in luck.
We treat "cruddy" here.
Just fill this out, and we'll be with you as soon as we can.
MRI's clear, labs are normal, and EKG looks good.
Then why did she faint?
What about the headaches?
Uh, fainting's probably from just not getting enough to eat.
Headache is probably just tension.
Let me give you a prescription for Naproxen to get you through your honeymoon.
Now, get out of here and go get married.
Mom?
Eileen, you all right?
I'm fine.
Whew!
I guess all this is harder on me than I thought.
Seeing your father with his child bride...
Rita, get me a nurse!
I can't catch my breath.
What's wrong with her?
Her pulse is thready and her heart's racing.
What do you need?
Get me a crash cart!
Grab a pillow.
Hang on, Eileen.
Season 01 Episode 09 In Case of Abnormal Rhythm December 2, 2011
- Is it a heart attack?
- No.
Her heart rate's up to 180.
It's what we call atrial fibrillation.
What on Earth is that?
It's when your heart beats abnormally.
The electrical impulses at the top of your heart are out of sync with the ones at the bottom.
That sounds serious.
It can be.
We need to admit you to Manhattan Memorial right away to start you on a blood thinner.
I can't go to the hospital.
We have her dress fitting this afternoon.
You need an echocardiogram first to make sure there's no underlying cardiac damage
- causing the arrhythmia.
- So she could've had it
- for a while without knowing?
- Possibly.
A-fib is more common the older you get.
What causes it?
Heart disease, stress, even alcohol.
Well, we know it's not alcohol.
My mom's been sober for 15 years.
Right, Mom?
Eileen?
Have you had a drink today?
Um, I may have had a few sips of a mimosa at brunch.
You what?
They gave me one with champagne by accident.
It's no big deal.
Have you had anything else to drink in the past few days?
Mom, please tell him no.
It's been going on for a couple of weeks.
It started with a glass of port before bed, and... it just got worse.
Well, that certainly could cause the A-fib.
Drinking after so many years of being sober can bring on an attack.
How could you?
You sat on that bench in Central Park when I was 13 and promised me you'd never touch another drop of alcohol.
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.
Can you take this thing out of me, please?
Eileen, you're in no shape to...
Please!
I've screwed up.
I need to talk to my daughter.
You walk out of here right now and you could die.
Honestly, I'm feeling much better.
The fluttering is gone.
Check my heart.
- Well?
- Yes, your heart rate's fine.
But A-fib can come and go.
This puts you at risk for a heart attack or a stroke.
You need to be in a hospital on a Heparin drip to thin your blood.
I'm leaving.
And you can't stop me.
You're right, Eileen.
I can't tie you down, hold you here.
If you want to do something that stupid, there's nothing I can do about it.
Isn't there anything you could give me, please?
I just want to see my daughter in her dress.
Yeah, I could give you a shot of Enoxaparin.
It's not my first choice 'cause it doesn't work as fast as Heparin, but if you insist on leaving, that's... the best I can do.
I insist.
So, as soon as you've talked to Rachel, you're going directly to Dr. Eastman.
He's a cardiologist at Manhattan Memorial right next door.
I've called him and he is expecting you.
You have my word.
Thank you, Dr. Holt.
You're welcome.
You have a wonderful boss.
Let me guess, someone's leaving against medical advice.
From now on, all family members stay in the reception area.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
We're a little understaffed today.
One of our docs is in Philly playing with his band, and the other one is... well, don't get me started on him.
Yeah, what about him?
Other than having an ego the size of Wyoming?
He's, uh, an hour and a half late.
Anyway, what's going on with you?
You don't look so hot.
I have a sore throat, maybe a fever.
I thought it was allergies, but my principal made me come in.
Yeah, you do feel a little warm.
Anything else going on?
No.
I'm sure I just picked up something from my kids.
My school is one great big petri dish.
Well, it's probably a viral pharyngitis.
But I'd like to do a rapid strep test just to be sure.
How long will that take?
Just a few minutes.
All right, open up and say aah.
Aah.
There we go, all done.
Those for your students?
Yeah, we're having a fall festival in class tomorrow.
You have school on Saturday?
Tomorrow's Tuesday.
No, tomorrow is Saturday.
Today is Friday.
Oh, you're right.
What am I thinking?
All right, I am going to run this test, and I'll be right back.
Would you mind calling my boyfriend, Hank?
I've been trying him all morning, but he's not at work.
Maybe there's something wrong with my phone.
Sure.
Can you write down his number for me.
That's strange.
I can't remember the number.
Well, well, well.
Dr. Punctuality.
- Nice to see you too, Sunshine.
- Hold on.
Dr. Sykora wants all her employees to clock in now.
Her employees?
She wants to keep track of how many hours everyone's working.
Really?
All right, now all together, let's breathe in forgiveness.
Deep breath.
And on the exhale, let's focus that breath and let's send love to yourself and to someone you care about.
Brother Mike.
Come on in, join us.
Surely you must have some forgiveness work to do.
Surely you must be joking.
Oh, Dr. Holt, fashionably late for work?
Even though you only work here ten hours a week.
I had a patient in rapid A-fib.
So what's the deal with Anton's little séance across the hall?
You know, I brought him in to do carpentry.
It's part of our new meditation program.
We're also going to offer nutritional classes, yoga.
No leeches?
I hear they're making a comeback.
Oh, taking a stand against wellness.
I practice evidence-based medicine.
Then you must've read the randomized trial on the effects of Tai Chi on fibromyalgia in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Well, the study wasn't double-blind.
A dozen things could account for the correlation.
Just because we don't know the exact mechanism, doesn't mean there isn't one.
Or is that too much uncertainty for you?
So your social worker says I'm on the clock.
Got a patient for me, boss?
I've got a lady with the flu, a kid with pinkeye, but, uh, first I'd like you to take a look at a school teacher.
Julia.
Chief complaint, sore throat, temp of 101.
Here strep test just came back negative.
Sounds like viral pharyngitis.
What's the big deal?
She's confused.
Did you talk to my boyfriend?
Our social worker is trying to reach him.
Julia, this is Dr. Holt.
I'd like him to examine you.
Dr. Wyoming.
Excuse me?
It's nothing.
Hi.
Does that bother you?
Yes.
Hurts.
Look up at the ceiling.
I can't.
It's okay.
Excuse me, folks.
I got through to your boyfriend's office, but they said he's out today on a rock climbing trip.
Oh, that's right, he was going to the Catskills.
Or maybe it was Bear Mountain.
I'm not sure.
Confusion, fever, photophobia, neck rigidity.
It's meningitis.
Or encephalitis.
Either way, she's going to need a spinal tap.
I'll have Rita send someone over to pick up the spinal fluid and run it back to my office.
Autumn, we should start an isolation protocol in case it is meningitis.
I'll call her school and tell them they may have been exposed, too.
- Anyone else need to be notified?
- Department of Health.
We may need prophylactic antibiotics for everyone at school or here who's come in contact with Julia.
We got to get her out of there!
So what does it feel like to be a second grader?
It's cool.
Julia, you shouldn't be out here.
Oh, Miss G's not bothering us.
She used to teach my son last year.
Why did I come out here?
Come on, Julia.
What's happening to me?
Let's just get you back to your room.
I need my boyfriend.
I need to call Hank.
I can't remember why I'm here.
Until we know what's wrong with Julia, nobody comes in, nobody leaves.
Excuse me.
Listen, everyone.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I know that you have all been here for, like, two hours, but we just can't let anyone leave until we get the results of the meningitis test.
That really sucks.
Hey, deep breaths, friend.
Keep it cool.
Come here.
Kate, I made calls to Catskill Park, Bear Mountain,
Adirondack Park, and all of them said there's no way we can track down Julia's boyfriend.
Call the state police.
Tell them he may have been exposed to meningitis and we need to pick him up before he infects others.
How's Julia?
Still altered.
Otherwise no change.
Does she remember where Hank was rock climbing?
Yeah, Connecticut, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Maine.
That narrows it down.
It's Rita.
Any news?
Good news.
Julia's spinal tap is negative for meningitis and encephalitis.
Really?
Okay, read me the results.
Two white cells, four red cells.
Gram stain negative.
You read both pages?
After six years with you, Michael, and 20 as an RN,
I think I know how to read a lab report.
Okay.
Excuse me.
I'm Rachel Lewis.
I was here earlier today with my mother, Eileen.
Oh, yes, she left to go find you.
She found me.
She came to my dress fitting and we had a big fight.
I said a bunch of things I didn't mean, and now she's not picking up her cell.
Did she say she was going anywhere else?
Dr. Holt made her promise to go see Dr. Eastman, a cardiologist next door.
Thank you.
Come back for meditation next week.
Bye, Mrs. Lopez.
Bye, sweetheart.
You're welcome.
Thank you all so much.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you for your patience.
Have a nice weekend, guys.
Thank you.
So, we've ruled out infectious meningitis and encephalitis.
What else is causing Julia's altered mental state?
Maybe we should get Anton and meditate on it.
Don't quit neurology for stand-up just yet.
Have you found Hank yet?
Not yet.
Is there anyone else that we can call?
A friend, family member?
No, just Hank.
What are you scratching?
I don't know.
You mind if I take a look?
Oh.
Those scabs look infected.
How long have you had them?
A little while.
I got some bug bites.
Julia, have you ever been camping with Hank?
Just once.
A few weeks ago.
Maybe a month ago.
I'm not sure.
Did you sleep in a tent?
No, under the stars.
We saw a meteor shower.
It was beautiful.
There were a lot of bugs.
Yeah, I bet.
We'll be right back.
Those bugs could have infected her with any number of vector-borne illnesses.
We should test her for Lyme disease.
And West Nile.
She scratched herself so much, it's hard to even tell what bit her.
Could be an animal bite.
I know what you're thinking, Michael.
Hello?
Do me a favor and call my assistant.
Tell her to run a new infectious panel on Julia's cerebral spinal fluid.
Lyme disease, West Nile, and throw in rabies, too.
Rabies?
They were sleeping outside the tent.
She could've been bitten by a bat.
If Julia has rabies and she's already symptomatic...
- Then she's going to die.
- Just call Rita.
You know, you don't need to tell me what I'm thinking.
Alaska, that boy who lived above Jiggy's auto shop, bitten by the rabid dog.
I know.
There was nothing you could do for him, and that tore you up.
I am not ready to plan her funeral yet.
Michael, if it comes to that, please don't let her die alone.
When the car hit me and the driver just drove off, the kids whose ball I chased, they were too scared to come over.
And I just laid there alone and died.
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
We are trying to find her boyfriend, okay?
Rita, you can't have the test results back.
Kate just called you.
It's Eileen Lewis.
She and her daughter had another big fight, then Eileen went to an AA meeting, and her right side went limp.
Someone from the meeting just brought her in.
She's got a blood clot in her brain.
The Enoxaparin didn't work fast enough.
Do you want an MRI?
Yeah, and prep her for surgery and call Victor Lantz.
I'm on my way.
Look, I gotta...
Where are you going?
I got an emergency back at my office.
Right now this is your office.
I can't do anything for Julia until I know what we're treating.
I'll call you as soon as I get her test results.
Where's the clot?
Middle cerebral artery.
I hear you treated with Enoxaparin.
That's why we can't use TPA to bust the clot.
She'll bleed out.
My daughter?
Rachel's on her way.
Rita called her.
I have to see her.
You have to get into surgery now.
Wait.
I ruined everything.
I just want to tell her I'm sorry.
Eileen, you don't have time.
I have to get that clot out or you could die.
Now get her in there now.
All right, Victor, how's Eileen's heart rate?
It's fine, but she's still in A-fib.
All right, I'm nearing the occlusion.
Once the catheter's in place, I'll Roto-Rooter the clot and have her dancing at her daughter's wedding.
Where's my mother?
!
In surgery.
She had a stroke.
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!
Dr. Holt is removing the clot.
He's done hundreds of these procedures.
Why don't you have a seat and try to relax?
Come on, Eileen, let me in there.
You find the little bastard?
Hit it.
Ah...
Got him in my sights.
And now the main event.
Ready for the penumbra.
I love my job.
Shouldn't he be done by now?
Oh, the procedure takes time.
As soon as Dr. Holt is finished, he'll let us know.
Chocolate?
I find it's a trusted friend in times like these.
Thanks.
I'm threading the wire through the middle cerebral artery.
All right, I'm at the clot.
Start the aspiration.
Engaging the penumbra separator.
I'm breaking the clot into little pieces.
Then I'll suck 'em out.
I think I got it.
Let's give her another dose of contrast.
Let's see how good I am.
Hey, blood flow has been restored.
And that is a beautiful thing.
I'll start to wake her up.
Victor, talk to me.
BP's dropping, heart rate's rising.
Did you tear the vessel?
No.
I need more contrast!
Must be in the brain stem.
She must've thrown a second clot.
Give me back the guide wire.
Come on, let's go.
Are you at the second clot yet?
No, I'm just ready to image the posterior circulation now.
BP's still dropping.
I'll start pressors to get her pressure up.
There it is.
Second clot's in her basilar artery.
She's stroking out her brain stem.
That's why her BP's falling.
We are in big trouble.
- Not once I get the sucker.
- Hurry up.
Her fluids are running wide open.
Hanging norepinephrine.
I know the waiting's tough.
You know what I did when my mom showed up at my fitting?
I told her not to come to dinner tonight, that a drunk didn't deserve to meet my fiancé's parents.
What kind of a daughter says that?
One who's pushed too far on the wrong day.
Now she's in there alone.
That may be the last thing I ever say to her.
When your mother had her disk operated on a few years ago,
I got to know her pretty well.
You know what she talked about?
You.
I heard all about the clerkship you had that summer, how hard it was to get, how well you did in law school... and how much she liked your boyfriend.
My fiancé Brad.
She told me how proud she was that you managed to avoid all the stupid mistakes she made in life.
That she wasn't gonna take credit for how well you turned out, but that sometimes, when you weren't aware of it, she'd look at you and... you just took her breath away.
Oh...
BP's 63/40 and still dropping.
Penumbra again.
She's bradying down.
She's gonna code.
I'm getting close.
I lost her pulse.
Start compressions!
Push an amp of epi.
Still flatlining.
Give her atropine!
Come on, you little son of a bitch.
Still no rhythm.
I'm there, but I can't engage the clot.
Come on.
Come on.
LANTZ Still no heartbeat!
40 units of vasopressin.
Got it!
Removing the clot...
Okay, brain stem has good flow again.
Pulse is back.
It's weak, but it's back.
Start her on a Heparin drip, no bolus, titrate up the norepinephrine.
Nice work.
Dr. Holt!
Rachel, your mom did great.
What?
Sulla, take Ms. Lewis to her mother's room.
Mother.
Michael...
She's gonna be okay.
Eileen is, but Julia.
It's rabies?
Oh, I'm sorry, Michael.
Shall I call Dr. Sykora and let her know?
Just tell her I'm on my way.
Is that what they're wearing to Per Se days or are we skipping dinner altogether?
Gina, I can't do tonight.
Next time, I promise, as soon as you get back.
But...
Julia has rabies?
Her test was positive.
So we can treat her symptoms, but...
She's not gonna make it.
She may only have a couple hours.
Excuse me.
I think my girlfriend's here.
- Someone called me.
- You're Hank.
Yeah, I'm Dr. Sykora.
This is Dr. Holt.
Hi.
Where is she?
I'll take you back.
She's right here.
You coming?
In a minute.
I'm gonna make a call.
Hank.
Jules, honey, are you okay?
- I didn't know where you were.
- I know.
We were about to get up to Bear Mountain, and I just had the feeling something was wrong.
And when we got back into cell range, I had 15 missed messages.
Thank you for finding him.
Honey, look at you.
You can't kiss her.
Why, what's the matter?
One of my messages said it might meningitis.
Is that what she has?
We thought so at first, but...
But what?
Unfortunately, Julia has tested positive for the rabies virus.
Rabies?
How?
We think she might have been bitten by a bat when you went camping last month.
- A bat?
- You're joking, right?
I don't know how much you know about rabies...
Well, she has to get shots in the stomach, right?
Only if exposure is suspected before the patient becomes symptomatic.
We're gonna have to get you started on prophylactic shots right away.
Okay, what about Julia?
Once the patient becomes symptomatic, the chances of survival are extremely small.
Are you saying I'm gonna die?
I'm sorry, Julia.
No, this isn't happening.
What, you-you can't, you can't treat her?
I mean, they treat AIDS, they treat cancer!
We can make sure she doesn't suffer.
You're gonna have to do better than that!
Hank, it's not her fault.
No, baby, it's my fault.
Look, I made you go camping.
You didn't want to go.
You did it for me.
Hank, I'm scared.
I don't want to die...
Honey, honey.
Dr. Sykora, can I talk to you for a moment?
So, I just got off the phone with a virologist who says there's an experimental protocol for treating rabies.
- And?
- It was first used on a 15-year-old girl in Wisconsin who was already symptomatic and she survived.
And it's worked five other times since.
Okay.
And how many times has it failed?
If you've got another option, I'm all ears.
You understand, this procedure is experimental.
There are no guarantees.
- Then we won't do it.
- Hank, we don't have a choice.
What do you have to do?
Essentially, we put you into a coma to protect your brain and let the rabies run its course.
Julia, you have to decide now.
Victor, it's Michael.
Yeah, I'm coming in with a rabies patient.
Yes, rabies.
We have to put her into a coma as fast as we can.
I'll tell you when I get there.
- Ambulance is on its way.
- Okay.
Julia, are you allergic to any medications?
Any prior difficulty with general anesthesia?
- No.
- What about a health care proxy?
Do you have someone to make medical decisions for you if you can't?
It's usually a family member or spouse.
Hank's the only one.
But we're not married.
Jules, let's get married.
Hank...
I knew you were the one for me the first moment I saw you.
Standing in Trader Joe's, with your little canvas bag.
But I'm sick.
I don't care, okay?
I love you.
Please, Julia, will you marry me?
Yes.
But stand up.
You're embarrassing me.
Wish you could make it official down at City Hall, guys, but we got to move.
Right.
Come on.
I can help you.
Not now, Anton.
No, no, I'm talking about marrying them.
What, are you eavesdropping?
The walls here are paper thin.
I thought you'd want to know, I'm a legally ordained minister.
Of course you are.
I got my license on the Internet.
Married a couple of friends of mine in a yurt upstate.
I'm your guy.
We don't have time.
I can marry them on the way over.
I mean, three minutes max.
Michael, don't make her face this alone.
All right, get in.
- Are you serious?
- Just get in!
Hey, Doc, nobody rides in the back but you and the girl.
Not the hippie guy and not the boyfriend.
It's not her boyfriend, it's her husband.
At least he will be in three minutes.
Let's go.
Wait, wait.
Take this.
Anton, let's go.
You ready?
Julia.
Tonight we go to that place of eternity.
This is the wedding night.
A never ending union of lover and beloved.
We whisper gentle secrets to each other.
And the child of the universe takes its first breath.
Without love, all worship is a burden.
All dancing is a chore.
All music is mere noise.
Do you, Hank, take this woman, Julia, from this day forward to have and to hold, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, to love and to cherish as long as you both may live?
I do.
Do you, Julia, take this man, Hank, from this day forward for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, to love and to cherish as long as you both may live?
- I do.
- By the powers vested in me by the State of New York, I now pronounce you... husband and wife.
You can kiss her, friend.
On the cheek.
- Give me some room.
- What are you doing?
Starting dopamine to get her pressure up.
- How much longer?
- Five minutes.
She's lost her pulse.
Need some help back here.
Stay with us, Jules.
Bag her.
Come on, baby.
Push an amp of epi.
If you're going to be here, start bagging.
Jules...
Got a rhythm.
Damn it, it's a V tach.
Clear.
Jules, I love you, baby.
Please don't leave me.
- I love you.
- Damn it, lost her pulse.
Bag her.
Push another amp of epi.
Come on...
Honey.
Honey.
Time of death, 9:12 p.m.
Bye, Julia.
My beautiful wife.

Michael.
Welcome back.
I should've never have left.
Rachel?
She's out getting a cup of coffee.
Rita's gonna get her to tell her you're awake.
I had the strangest sensation in there... like I was leaving my body.
And I saw that bright light, like a tunnel.
But then I heard Rachel's voice calling me back.
And then I woke up in the recovery room.
Well, you didn't have a heartbeat for almost a minute in there.
It's what we call a "near death experience."
I know how it sounds.
Believe me, I'm not big in all that afterlife stuff either.
But it felt so real.
It can be explained medically.
Are you sure?
Like all paranormal experiences can.
- Go on.
I can't wait to hear.
- Anoxia;
lack of blood flow to the brain, causes hallucinations.
Does that apply to me?
Even extreme physical trauma can cause the body to go into REM sleep, which triggers increased brain activity.
But you're not sleeping, Michael.
Even the tunnel phenomenon can be explained by the way the retina reacts to oxygen deprivation.
Or maybe she and her daughter still have unfinished business.
Dr. Holt?
Let's just be happy you're here now.
Mom?
Rachel!
Mom.
Come here, sweetheart.
I was so worried.
It's fine.
Anna?
Season 01 Episode 09 In Case of Abnormal Rhythm December 2, 2011
I'm not that girl from Jersey.
I'm giving you trust that you wouldn't bring back a girl or, like, hurt me.
Ron and Sam are back together.
This is the first time
I've seen you smile in a long time.
- With Sam, I feel like this time is gonna be different.
No fighting this time, so...
- Oh, dear.
And let games begin.
- It'd be better if I was there.
- Yeah, it'd be way better if you were here.
- Ron has been calling this girl Hannah.
I don't know if Sam knows about this other chick, but she will flip out.
- I didn't want to say anything, 'cause he was drunk, but Ronnie was so funny last night.
He's like, "I got, like, five girls coming to the house right now."
- I'm gonna flip the [Bleep] Out on this kid.
Wake the [Bleep] Up.
You're [Bleep] Telling my girlfriend, like, I have girls on the way, if I want to.
- What are you talking- - get the [Bleep] Up, bro.
- What are you talking about?
- Always talking [Bleep], bro, behind my back when it comes to Sam.
Take your [Bleep].
Get the [Bleep] Out, bro.
- Ron.
Hey, Ron, I don't get involved in- stop, Ron!
[Get crazy by lmfao]
DJ Pauly Delvecchio!
- I'm going to Jersey shore, bitch!
- All right, we got a situation.
- I'm the sweetest bitch you'll ever meet.
[Laughing]
- After I have sex with a guy, I will rip their heads off.
Go, Vinny!
Go, Vinny!
Do you like the boobs?
- I don't get involved- I don't get involved in-
Ron, I don't get involved in your relationship, Ron.
I don't get involved in your relationship.
- Yo, I don't get [Bleep] Involved in your relationship!
Don't [...] Yell.
- I don't get involved in your [Bleep] Relationship.
Are you [Bleep] Serious?
I stay out of your way all the [Bleep] Time!
I'm [...] Sick of this!
I'm [Bleep] Sick of this!
- Stop.
It's not worth it.
- Sick of it?
- Yeah!
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You want to hit me?
You want to hit me?
You want to hit me, tough guy?
You want to [Bleep] Do it?
You want to throw my [Bleep] Bed?
- Yeah, I do.
- You want to throw my bed?
You want to [Bleep] Do this?
[Grunts]
- Stop!
Stop!
- [Growls]
- Look at you, bro.
- Stop!
- Get out of here, bro.
[Bleep] Get out of here.
- We need to talk.
- Get emotional.
Don't- get the [Bleep] Away from me.
- Yo, look at me.
You okay?
You all right?
Look at me.
I'm not even playing.
Just look at me.
Mike bashed his head into the wall.
And I could tell Mike is completely disoriented.
He's opening his eyes to me, but he's giving me a blank look.
This isn't funny anymore.
You okay?
Get the [Bleep] Out of here.
What did I do to you?
- [Mockingly] "What did I do?"
Why don't you just tell me?
What the [...]-
- What did I do?
- You didn't tell me that he told you that I was gonna bring home five girls the first [Bleep] Night.
- 'Cause anybody- they were [Bleep] There.
- Now he's a big man.
Now he's [Bleep] Laying on the floor.
Admit it, bro.
Admit your [Bleep] For once.
- Admit it?
Admit it?
- Admit it.
- Admit it.
I don't do nothing with your relationship, tough guy.
Let's do it!
- Stop it!
Let's do it!
Stop!
[Whimpers]
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop!
- [Grunts] I'm bleeding.
I'm bleeding.
Stop it!
Stop!
Stop!
- I waited for a long time to [Bleep] You up.
I waited for a long time to...
I've been waiting, bro.
I've been waiting for a long time to [Bleep] You up.
You did this for no reason, no reason at all...
No reason...
No reason.
He didn't hurt me.
There is not one little scrap on my face- nothing on my pretty face.
All those muscles didn't do [Bleep] To me.
Those [Bleep] Walls are [Bleep] Hard right there.
- How'd your knee in your [Bleep] Face feel?
Yo, [Bleep] You, Ron!
I'll take you on every day, mother[Bleep]!
All you do is suck [Bleep], you [Bleep].
- I'll [Bleep] You up every day!
- Get out of here.
- Ron, stop it.
Yo, [...] You, you punk!
- How's your face feel, you [Bleep] [Bleep].
- No matter what he said, it didn't matter to me.
Stop talking to me!
- Ron!
- Shut the [Bleep] Up!
Stop talking to me!
- Sam, walk away.
- Sam, please...
- Please just walk away.
- Please...
Don't...
Let's not make this Jersey.
- This isn't.
Just stop yelling at me!
- Walk away from it!
- Stop yelling at me!
- This isn't [Bleep] Fun anymore!
- Then stop [Bleep] Yelling at me!
I [Bleep] Get it!
- You need to walk away and leave this guy alone, because you're the reason why he's getting so amped up.
- I would love to- - stop!
- Get out, then!
- Stop it!
- Sammi's still there.
- Just stop!
- [Laughing] What?
- Stop talking to me!
- Stop.
Just stop.
- You're not worth nothing.
- Really?
- I've been calling girls since I've been here.
- You've been calling girls since you've been here?
- Yeah, every night.
- You ain't [Bleep].
Get out of my [Bleep] Face.
Get out of my face.
Thank you.
Finally.
Finally.
- Your boy's been waiting to do that for so long.
- Who-Ron?
- [Laughing] Yeah.
But to be honest with you, he didn't do [Bleep], really.
I don't think either of them can fight.
I mean, I know Mike used to take karate, and Ronnie's got big muscles or whatever, but big muscles doesn't mean you can fight.
You need to know how to punch.
Neither of them know how to punch.
Like, Ronnie punched Mike.
It didn't do anything.
Mike knocked himself out.
I think Mike tried to commit suicide by hitting his head against the wall, 'cause he was sick of dealing with the Ron and Sam bull[Bleep].
Are you okay?
You need to go to the hospital?
- I don't want to.
You should.
- I don't want to go to the hospital.
Dude, [Bleep] Your pride.
You should feel better.
Make sure you know what's going on.
- I hit my head against a concrete wall.
It hurts.
- I understand.
So go to the hospital and make sure you're not, like, severely hurt.
Mike?
You need to go.
I'm like, "dude, like, I know that you don't want to feel
"like a lowlife and you got your ass beat,
"but you need to go to the hospital to make sure that you're [Bleep] Okay."
- [Crying] Oh, he needs help.
I don't like this.
[Line trilling]
- We call the ambulance because we're afraid that Mike might have a concussion or something worse.
[Rock music]
- Mike, I'm here with you, bro.
It's pauly.
I'm here with you, bro.
This is too much.
[Sniffles]
- if I can't be someone of consequence
- [Sniffles] I don't want the [Bleep] Kid to die.
I don't want him dead.
[Siren]
- I'm so mad that jenni's talking to Ron.
He needs to be by himself.
Get the [Bleep] Out!
- Please- - tell her to get the [...] Out.
- I'm [Bleep] Begging you for our house.
I know, but, please.
I'm real worried about Mike right now.
They're gonna keep him for four more hours
- just to do the cat scan.
- Yo, how you doing?
- Mike, I'm here with you, bro.
It's Pauly.
I'm here with you, bro.
This is not fun anymore.
- Get the [...] Out of here, bro.
- You need to just tell me what happened.
- Oh, my God!
- Please.
Ronnie, you're talking to me.
Come on.
- She shouldn't be in there.
He's wasted.
It's not gonna matter what she says to him.
I hate to say it.
- No, but you should be in there, right?
- I'm so mad that jenni's talking to Ron, because I feel like I'm the only person who understands, like, why Ron is acting like this right now, and I don't think that anything
anybody says is gonna calm him down.
He needs to be by himself.
- Get the [Bleep] Out!
- Please tell her to get the [Bleep] Out!
- I know.
I get it.
Just please-
I'm [Bleep] Begging you for our house.
I know, but, please, just [Bleep] Give us a minute.
Just please!
- I [Bleep] Up tonight.
Why can't you just accept it?
Stop.
- Don't [...] Do this to me anymore.
I'm sick of it.
I'm sick of you putting me in this position.
I didn't do [Bleep] To you!
[Bleep]!
Leave me the [Bleep] Alone!
- [Sighs]
- Leave me the [...] Alone!
- Right now I'm thinking, "how can I get through this?"
I feel like there's been a lot of jealousy and animosity between me and Mike, and I just let it build up and build up and build up.
I can't believe I let myself get so angry.
The kid's in the hospital and [Bleep].
That's kind of [Bleep] Up.
Finally there was just so much built-up [Bleep] With him that I was just like...
- Yeah.
It was a lot of unfinished and unsaid it felt like that everyone just let him get away with so much stuff all the time.
- In Ron's defense, he and Mike had this animosity towards each other for so long that this fight was, like, long overdue.
- [Sniffles] The second she's back with me, look what happens.
[Sighs] [Bleep] My life, dude.
[Crying] I did my best.
Dude.
[Sniffles]
I know.
- I just feel like there's no point to, like, fight each other, you know?
The craziest thing is, is that, like, he's in the hospital, and, like, it wasn't even from the fight.
Like, he [Bleep] Knocked himself out into the wall.
What the [Bleep]?
Yeah, people get concussions a lot.
It's not, like- - yeah.
- I used to get them all the time from cheerleading.
- Mm-hmm.
- I'd smack myself right on the ground and be, like...
- You sure you didn't get that when you blacked out drunk and fell?
- Well, that happens, too.
[All laugh]
- I'm real worried about Mike right now.
Nobody should be alone with this [Bleep] Going on.
He needs somebody there for him, and I'll be there for him.
[Velcro tearing]
Yo, how you doing?
- Good.
A little better now that they let me use the bathroom.
- No doubt, no doubt.
We're here now, so...
We're here.
[Velcro tearing]
- [Voice breaking] Me and Sam- we can't be together.
I'm like, "it's not healthy right now."
What happened tonight was not the right way in any way.
I feel like I owe everybody in the house an apology.
[Sobbing]
- Like, I have you crying.
My room's a mess.
My roommate's in the hospital.
- [Crying] I didn't want that to happen.
Like, I didn't want my roommates fighting, and, like...
I just feel terrible.
[Sighs]
- I'm gonna leave you alone.
Then you come out and talk to me when you're ready.
Yeah.
[Sniffles]
- You let me know.
I'll be in the smush room, I guess.
- What's up?
- I love you, bro.
- You all right?
What?
- I love you.
You know that, right?
- Yeah, but I don't like when you act like that, my dude.
- I know.
- It's like, when you drink, you literally become, like, a hothead.
It's [Bleep] Scary.
It's not worth it.
Like...
So just, please, bro- that's all I ask, you know.
Just-we'll work on it together.
When he's dating Sam, he flips out, turns into another person, and then says he's sorry.
But that doesn't make it okay.
You got to fix the problem.
- I love you, dog.
You know that.
- Yeah, I love you, too, man.
- You get me, brother.
- If you ever need to talk, I'm-you know?
[Dramatic music]
- Obviously, us being together is toxic.
So maybe it's just best to just-you know?
We have our issues.
It sucks, because I do love you so much.
And...
I do care about you...
- [Clears throat]
More than I care about myself.
- Stop, like, with that.
- Can I just talk?
I'm sorry for the [Bleep] That I did say to you tonight.
- Whatever.
It's all true, anyway.
- It is true.
I did call a girl while I was here.
Who?
- Just some random girl that I just hook up with?
- No.
- Who is it?
- Just some girl.
- Look at me in the face.
- Just some girl...
- Who?
- That I...
- No, no, no, tell me a name, please.
- Some girl that I met.
- From where-long island?
Good-bye.
- Can-can you just sit?
- Can you just- look at me.
I'm gonna tell you one thing.
- I'm being honest.
- It's okay.
Be honest all you want.
But I just don't want anything to do with you ever again in my entire life.
Sam.
Sam.
[Sighs]
I'm through with Ron and the bull[Bleep] And the lies and whatever that he has to say to me, 'cause everything he says is complete bull[Bleep].
- Can we please just talk, Sam?
- Just, please, get away from me, please.
I blew my own cover, but, you know, I'm kind of glad that it came out, in a way.
I feel like a weight's been lifted off my shoulder.
I just want to talk, Sam.
- I don't care anymore.
What do you want to say?
Like, do you.
I don't care anymore.
I don't ever want to look at you ever again.
Just-I don't care anymore.
Just get the [Bleep] Away from me.
I cared enough.
Get the [Bleep] Away from me.
- Dude, that's enough of this [Bleep].
No peace of mind.
Don't live in this house with [Bleep] Tension.
I'm tired of dwelling on stuff and just letting it destroy my present, and it's destroying my future.
I think the best thing for me to do is just go home right now.
[Pensive music]
- Put my roommate in the hospital because of some girl that's been playing with my mind.
- Ronnie feels like he's trapped in his own mind right now and doesn't know who he is.
And because of that, he's trying to flee.
I want your butt[Bleep].
- That's not necessary.
Stop.
- Jionni is very quiet about sexuality.
And me-I'm just like, bam, "let's [Bleep] Dirty talk."
- Aryou D.T.F.?
- Hey!
- Dude, what's up, bro?
- I can't be here, dude.
Can't do it.
- Just sleep it off, dude.
- It's not about sleeping it off.
It's about...
- Go to bed, bro.
You're in Italy.
Come on, bro.
- It's about how we played games.
I have no peace of mind.
I've been here for a week.
- Okay, but that doesn't mean that you go home.
- It's about peace of mind, and I don't have it.
- You know how you get peace of mind?
Going through [Bleep] Like this is how you get peace of mind.
If you go home, you're gonna be [Bleep] Miserable and depressed.
Ronnie feels like he's trapped in his own mind right now and doesn't know who he is.
And because of that, he's trying to flee.
- I put my [Bleep] Roommate in the hospital...
Yeah, well...
- Because of some girl that's been playing with my mind for [Bleep] He last three weeks, bro.
- So make it better.
Don't go home.
So that's how you're gonna go down, by doing that?
- What else am I gonna do, bro?
- There's a light at the end of the tunnel.
I swear to God.
I promise you.
- Maybe I just need to wait for a few days.
- Do you know what it's like not to know what is wrong or what's right?
I've been throwing away the efforts I've made to leave this all behind
don't feel sorry for me
- I just sat there and just thought about some [Bleep].
Vinny's like the Dr. Phil in the house.
He's young, but he definitely gives good advice, and I think that he's right.
Why would I give up so much?
You know what I mean?
There's a reason why I'm here.
- You are the reason I go on
[Telephone ringing]
- Hello?
- Hello.
Um, can I speak with, uh, nooki or, uh, Sally-Jenny?
Who is this?
I call from fast flora.
Are you a florist?
Yes.
- All this crazy [Bleep] Is going on.
You know, I got roommates in the hospital.
I got [Bleep] Fights.
I got psychological talks that I'm having with people.
- I don't understand what you say.
- And I got florists calling me, telling me that they deliveries of flowers for the girls.
It's the last thing I want to hear right now.
- I call this afternoon.
- Yes.
- Uh, to this number?
- Si.
- Okay, but- - all right, grazie.
[Bleep].
Vin convinces me to stay, so I decide to put Mike's bed back in the spot so that when he does get out of the hospital, he a place to lay his head down.
As much as I hate the kid and I can't stand him and I think he's a sneaky [Bleep], it's just like, he did get hurt.
I'm not that mean of a person.
- Yo.
- What happened?
- I only got to see him for two seconds.
I was in the waiting room the whole time.
And they had to do, like, cat scans and all that stuff.
- They would know if there was something serious, right?
- He did the cat scan.
They said it's nothing.
He should be fine.
They just got to keep him for observation.
It's probably the whole day.
I waited, like, four hours with Mike.
They're gonna keep him for four more hours for observation, so I head back to the house, exhausted.
I'm beat, though.
- Yeah, I didn't sleep a wink, bro.
It's [Bleep]...
I've been doing [Bleep] All night.
I'm beat.
[Uplifting music]
[Doorbell pulsing]
[Beeps]
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Just a little head trauma, a little sprain, a little of this, little of that.
You know what I mean?
- Got us all worried, bro.
- [Chuckles]
The doctor's prognosis was a light concussion, also combined with a neck sprain as well.
That's not good, 'cause, man, for the next couple days,
I can't G.T.L.
I'm upset, man.
[Groaning]
[Dramatic music]
You all right?
[Grunts] - [Groans]
I didn't mean that [Bleep].
You know that, right?
So, you know?
- The conflict between me and Ron-it's unsettled.
At any time, it could pop off.
I won't hesitate to fight him, and he won't hesitate to fight me, because nobody got the better of each other in round one.
[Groans]
What's up, baby?
Let's do it, baby.
Let's do it, baby!
I don't even know what he was saying, but I know it was bad, just by his tone and the way he was looking at me.
- It doesn't mean anything.
He's being a douche bag.
I'll just knock him out.
- After last night's [Bleep], there were so many emotions, like, so many thoughts going through my head that I was just beating myself up.
[Mellow music]
I feel like I've been in this house, surrounded by so many people all the time, that I haven't had time to collect my thoughts.
Today I feel like I need to get out and spend the day by myself.
I am remorseful today.
I realize I definitely want to change the fact that I keep everything bottled up till I finally just explode.
Things that I don't have control over I can't flip out about.
I have to just learn how to let it just roll off my shoulder.
So I get up this morning, and there's mine and Nicole's flowers from our boyfriends.
Finally.
It's, like, cute adorable roses from jionni, and it has a little bunny inside.
And I'm just like, "meh."
[Chuckles]
- Oh, you're back?
- You know Mike's home, right?
- No.
- Oh, yeah, he's home, sleeping.
How is he-okay?
He suffered head trauma, and then he can't go out for a week or something.
I need to do laundry.
- I have to pick mine up.
- Did you want to come with us?
We'll drop it off, pick it up, and go eat.
Now that we know that Mike had no serious problem and it was just, like, a blow to the head, our house is kind of back to normal, not that it's a good normal, you know what I mean?
But, hey, if it wasn't [Bleep] Up, it wouldn't be our house, right?
- Is Ron and Sam together, or is Ron and Sam not together?
- I feel like they're together.
- I just honestly don't want to hear anything about any of it.
I don't either.
- One of our roommates just went to the hospital because of Ron and Sam.
We're tired of the arguments.
And at this point, like, enough is enough.
- Ronnie and Sam's relationship is a joke.
- Ron's like, "I'm done.
I'm done.
I'm done."
Then he's trying to get back with her, and I'm just like...
It's so sickening.
What comes to mind when I think of Ronnie and Sam is, like, me throwing up...
[Vinny speaking Italian]
Because I can't stand it anymore.
- Ciao.
Good.
How are you?
Oh!
- We see Ronnie sitting there by himself, and I'm curious to see, you know, what Ronnie has to say for himself today.
- I'm sorry for last night, brother.
I'd never do something like that with you, like...
That [Bleep] Was built up three years.
- Oh, yeah.
No, sure.
It's the first time we're talking to Ronnie since the incident.
And he's just, like, real apologetic and real sorry that [Bleep] Went down.
- I tried to talk to her last night, and she was like, "I'm done with you."
- Oh, wait.
You guys are done?
That's what she said.
She's like, "I'm done." Right?
She's like, "go [Bleep] Yourself."
- Yeah, but we've heard that before.
You end up making it funny.
No, she actually was, like,
"you're the scum earth piece of [Bleep]."
- Why do you love this girl?
- I know.
I have no idea.
- So why would you want to be with someone like that?
- I was actually happy the last few days with her.
That was five minutes, and then she proved herself once again.
- She wanted to see how much you care about her by flipping out on someone else.
- You know that's the mind state she has right now.
She has the mind state that "Ronnie called a girl,"
so now she's gonna have to try to get the upper hand on me.
- You got to be an adult and walk away from the relationship.
I've done it how many times?
"I'm done.
I'm done.
I'm done with Sam."
I get a breather.
I catch myself.
And then I'm like, "I'm not done.
I love her."
- You walk away.
- Exactly.
- Like, you really can't help who you love.
- I love you as a friend.
- Okay.
- But you [Bleep] Up, and that's it.
It scared him to see him on a stretcher, because I do care about him as a friend.
If you go to the club with that look, you know how many girls are gonna be like,
"what happened, honey?"
- [Laughs] I know.
We're trying to get Ronnie to push up on some girls in the club.
He's talking to one girl.
- I'm trying to get at you.
- But if Ron brings a girl home, Sammi's gonna flip out.
- Hi.
Is Nicole there?
- Oh, hold on.
Snooki!
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Did you get your flowers?
- I got them.
I love them.
I miss you.
I want to, like, hang out.
I want to see you.
I'm sexually frustrated.
Are you?
I was until I had fun in the shower, and then I was like, "brr, bye."
Ugh.
Don't say that.
You're gross.
- I'm not gross.
It's a way of life.
What else is going on?
- Nothing.
I want your butt[Bleep].
- That's not necessary.
Stop.
- Jionni is a very, like, quiet person.
You have to be quiet about your emotions, about sexuality and stuff like that.
And me-I'm just like, bam, "let's [Bleep] Dirty talk.
I'm [Bleep] Horny."
Are you d.T.F.?
- Hey!
- I'm gonna, like, have an orgasm right now.
- All right, can we please slow down a little bit with this [Bleep]?
- Okay.
Jionni gets upset.
He's like, [Deep voice] "Don't say that."
[Normal voice] I'm like, "come on."
Like, I just don't want to think.
I just want to be myself.
Love you.
- Love you, too.
- Tootles.
He's such a jerk.
[Rock music]
- 'cause by the look in your eyes it's safe to say you're five, five years away
I've had enough.
And if he wants to be like this, I'll go give back everything Ron has given me, including the stuff I got him.
So I put all my stuff on Ron's bed.
Some guy out there will appreciate me as a person and will really love me for who I am, and it's not Ron.
[Whispering] Mike.
[Normal voice] Are you okay?
I felt like I caused the problem.
Like, I'm not a fan of you, Mike, but, you know, I just felt bad.
Like, I don't want to see a roommate go to the hospital.
I apologize for everything.
I'm sorry.
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Mm-hmm.
I didn't really even listen to her apolwgy too much, because it is Sam's fault we fought.
And I just went through a wall.
I can't hear that [Bleep].
[Mellow music]
[Groans]
[Stove clicking]
I have a big heart, you know.
And if somebody else was hurt in the house, like me,
I would be checking on them.
But nobody was really checking on me, really, that much, you know what I mean?
So I kind of felt alienated a little bit.
[Sniffles]
I want
[Sniffles]
- What everybody else wants - [Sighs]
[Crunches]
I'm definitely feeling alone- definitely feeling alone right now.
A place to lay my head
[Sniffles]
[Doorbell pulsing]
[Beeps]
You have a neck brace on?
You all right?
When I see Mike in his neck brace,
I feel like he's doing an insurance claim right now.
It was a mild concussion from the head butt to the wall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
- And that was it.
And some-you know, from when I hit my head- what was it, like, whiplash?
- Yeah, like, in my neck.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's good it's not major.
We see Mike in a neck brace.
I'm like, "oh, my God."
He's got his glasses on, like always, and a neck brace.
You don't wear sunglasses with a neck brace.
He looks ridiculous.
- They said I'll be out for, like, a week.
[Mellow rock music]
Get the [Bleep] Out of here.
What are you doing?
[Whispering] Who's is that?
[Normal voice] Is that yours?
What are you doing?
Ronnie!
Oh, God.
[Dramatic music]
Yours?
- Mm-hmm.
It's okay.
I figured.
I was a little immature by putting stuff on Ron's bed, but throwing out now stuff is a little bit going, you know, too far.
And the earrings- did you throw them out, too?
I'll take them.
I don't do this.
- Shouldn't be throwing that out.
Diamond earrings- get out of here.
Whatever.
That [Bleep] Was cement.
The only reason I did that was because I was like,
"I might as well the pain out the way now."
What?
I don't think I would've put you in the hospital.
The wall put you in the hospital.
- That [Bleep] Doesn't even have a dent on it.
- Che cosa?
- What does that mean?
Some guy was talking [Bleep] While I was dancing with this chick.
- Look.
Over there?
- You ain't [Bleep], mother[Bleep]!
- You're in the streets of Florence!
Yeah, you're in the streets of Florence!
Let's do it!
- So we're leaving in ten minutes.
Don't leave without me, or I'll never talk to you guys again.
You all right?
- I didn't realize that wall was so hard.
[Chuckling]
I try to be the peacemaker in this house.
Even though me and him could fight at any instant,
I still respect the kid.
- What the...?
- [Chuckling]
Oh, no, 'cause...
[Chuckles]
The only-the only reason I did that was because I had got into a fight, like, maybe, like, two years ago.
And this dude was, like, double your size, and I was like, "[Bleep].
I'm gonna have a problem."
I was like, "I might as well get the paint out the way now."
So I put my head through a sheetrock wall, and the kid was like, "holy [Bleep].
This kid's crazy."
But I didn't know that [Bleep] Was cement.
That [Bleep] Doesn't even have a dent on it.
I
- I knew I might've had a problem with you.
I was like, "all right..." - [Laughing wildly]
"Let's do this."
- What?
It didn't even make sense.
Like, I don't think I would've put you in the hospital.
The wall put you in the hospital.
- So, I mean, it is kind of funny now.
I don't get that.
They're laughing in there.
- Oh, Ron and Mike?
- Yes.
Ron and Mike.
They resolved it.
I've been trying to stay out of the relationship with you and your girl, like, 3,000%.
And by any means, I didn't- definitely didn't mean to- to upset you like that, you know what I mean?
And, uh, if, uh...
If us having to fight like that and me banging my head-
I mean, 'cause that happened.
You know what I mean?
Exactly.
- What are the boys doing tonight?
- Who cares?
- So it's girls' night?
Yeah.
You look like a pilgrim.
Do the Italian look.
- Oh, it's so nice out tonight.
- We have to go to Tijuana for dinner.
I don't know about you, but I plan on frickin' drinking at this bar.
I'm living in the sun drinking up the fun
I'm going all over town the town, baby
- We should celebrate.
- Oh, yeah.
- This will be a fun night.
- I want to do this every night.
- We should.
- I will.
- I don't like hanging out with the guys.
We have us girls to have our backs, and, you know, the best times is with your girls.
I tell you that.
It's the truth.
- Well, this is a turn of events from the [Bleep] Scary place.
If mikor anyone says [Bleep] Like that to you, say it that moment or day, or let it go.
- And don't fight.
Just be like, "did you say this?"
- Yes.
And don't, like, kind of- 'cause it looks like you're using it as ammo for the future.
I have to rk on myself.
I actually feel like really bad for my roommates that they're part of our fighting.
Like, it makes me sick.
I didn't want to come into Italy and do that.
And I think that the girls are trying to give me good advice, like girlfriends would do.
- So is Mike going out tonight, or is he staying in?
- He can't take the neck brace off for a week.
He can't go out for a week.
- He can't go out?
- Oh, no.
- I didn't know that.
- Really?
- I didn't know that either.
- Sorry.
You guys ready?
- Let's do this.
- All right, let's go.
R.V.P.
It's r.V.P. Right now.
Mike's home still dealing with his issues and trying to find a way to apologize to the wall, I guess.
[Electronic music]
- Yeah, buddy.
Yeah, buddy.
Yeah, buddy.
Is this it?
Everything is all right everything is all right seaside moonlight take a break, form a line
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Everything is all right
I saw this pixie on a fixy out in front of the bar
- I'm gonna go get a drink.
- This guy's wasted right now.
- What do you want to drink?
- Mojito.
- It's finally starting to feel like I'm out with single Ronnie.
I got it.
I got it.
- He's got that look on his face like he's gonna creep.
I'm like, "damn, I hope he starts hooking up."
- I'm from New York, okay?
- Okay.
- I'm from New York.
- I know.
But, babe, I'm your girl.
- You're cool as [Bleep].
Che cosa?
Look.
Over there?
- Che cosa?
- What does that mean?
Che cosa?
Some guy was talking [Bleep]
While I was dancing with this chick.
[Girl speaking Italian]
Che cosa?
- Do it.
What's up, baby?
What's up, baby?
Let's do it, baby.
Let's do it, baby!
I don't even know what the [Bleep] He was saying, but I know it was bad, just by his tone and the way he was looking at me.
- It doesn't mean anything.
He's being a douche bag.
I'll just knock him out.
He's being a douche bag.
- Aah!
What's up, baby?
What's up, baby?
What's up, baby?
Let's do it, baby!
I'll [...] You up!
What's up, baby?
What's up, baby?
You ain't [Bleep], mother[Bleep]!
- You're in the streets of Florence!
Yeah, you're in the streets of Florence!
- Let's do it, baby!
Let's do it, then!
Let's do it!
- Yo, what's up?
- You ain't [Bleep], mother[Bleep]!
- You're in the streets of Florence!
Yeah, you're in the streets of Florence!
- Let's do it, baby!
- Let's fight!
- Let's do it, then!
- Yeah!
Yo, what's up?
- Get back.
- Who is that?
- Yo, some gorilla talked [Bleep].
Pauly was white boy wasted.
At any other time,
Pauly wouldn't have even reacted to that.
But mixing pauly's state of mind with these guys being ass[Bleep], it made pauly snap.
These guys have been starting with everybody all night- these two guys.
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.
I'm too happy to be mad.
I held back, and I kept my cool.
I don't want to fight.
I'm not a fighter.
- Let's go over there for a little bit.
- I think he was jealous I was dancing with that girl.
Maybe it was his girlfriend.
That's probably why.
[Rock music]
[Deena counting in Italian]
[Snooki and deena shouting in Italian]
- Who wants to get naked and get spray-tanned?
- Actually, I've been naked this entire [Bleep] Trip.
You okay?
I kind of wanted to talk to you.
Okay.
- Are you sad?
You sad?
I just want to say, the b.S. That went on-
I'm still mad at you for that.
You're a [Bleep] For that.
But the fact that I saw you on the floor.
God forbid anything happened to you, and that was the last words I said to you-
I want you to know I love you as a friend.
- Okay.
- But you [Bleep] Up.
And that's it.
You know?
- Okay.
- I saw you on the stretcher.
I started crying.
Like, it's not okay.
I thought you were dying.
- [Laughs]
- Ass[Bleep].
- I hit a concrete wall pretty hard.
- Okay, well, I thought you were dying-I don't know.
- Me and snooks- she was a little mad at me.
I was a little mad at her.
And after a trip to the hospital, we realized that at the end of the day, we love each other.
So I don't think Nicole and jionni are meant for each other.
- If you go to the club with that look, you know how many girls are gonna be like,
"what happened, honey?"
- [Laughs] I know.
- Dude, you'll get mad girls with that [Bleep].
La la la la la la la na na na
[Shouts in Italian]
- Girl, I've been all over the world looking for you
No, we need a drink!
- I'm known for taking what I think I deserve and you're overdue
She likes you.
We're trying to get Ronnie to push up on some girls in the club.
He's talking to one girl, but you can tell that he's scared because of Sammi.
I'm trying to get at you.
- If Ron brings a girl home, Sammi's gonna flip out, 'cause that'll just start another war.
But a man has needs.
What, is he gonna wait two months to do it?
I don't think so.
Na na na na na
- You okay?
Listen, let's get out of here.
You okay?
I meet a girl.
Then I realize that, you know, I don't want these grenades, these things that Vinny and pauly bring home.
Scusi.
Sorry.
The old Ronnie in Miami would've brought a girl back just to get a rise out of Sam.
How much?
Sam always expects the worst out of me, especially when she's not there to watch over me.
I'm not that dumb.
Come on.
I'll give you ten.
Instead of bringing home a grenade girl to get her mad and start another fight, let me be an adult and show her, "you're the ass[Bleep].
And I'm not the ass[Bleep] Anymore."
- Oh, there we go.
We got it.
[Upbeat electronic music]
- You let her.
I'm gonna [Bleep] You tonight, Ronnie.
[Vinny laughing]
- [Bleep] Tonight.
- Whoo!
- I don't know what to do with myself.
What if Ron brings home a girl?
I don't know if I can handle this right now.
- Yo.
[Chuckles]
[Speaking gibberish]
- I don't like feeling like this.
Where's my ex-girlfriend?
I'm the ass[Bleep].
All right?
Just so you know.
Just so you know.
That's all I got to say.
- Are those for somebody else?
Just so you know.
So I give Sam the flowers, just kind of showing her I'm gonna be happy either way, like, you know what I mean?
Like, I'm gonna move on, like, you know what I mean?
Whether it's with or without you at this point, like, you know?
- Did you bring home another girl?
- Are you kidding?
- Yeah, absolutely.
I brought home [Bleep] Mad girls.
[Chuckles]
When I give you flowers, don't ask me if I brought home a girl.
- The biggest piece of [Bleep] Ever...
- Ron, I'm just trying to talk to you, like, normally.
- That comes home with flowers for his ex-girlfriend.
I wish I had a piece of shit like that.
Ah.
He got me flowers.
Like, I'm, like, more than confused right now.
Hello.
Yeah, what's up?
- Why are you being mean to me?
Every time I try talking to you, you're, like, ignoring me.
Why would you get me flowers if you want to ignore me?
Like, thank you.
I'm trying to say thank you, and you just won't even, like, let me.
- Great way of showing thank you.
[Grunts]
- Every time I try to, like, talk to you so you know what?
Find somebody better than me.
Call me in [Bleep] Four years when you find somebody better than me.
- Oh, you're so...
[Scoffs]
- Yeah, whatever.
You too.
You tell somebody to go [Bleep] Themselves.
"You're a piece of [Bleep].
You're a scumbag."
And see if they come home with a [Bleep] Dozen roses for you...
- Can you just sit here?
- And see how it goes.
What did I just do?
Like, why did I even get her the roses?
Whatever, dude.
- Thank you for the flowers.
I'm taking them back.
Ever since it started girl, I always knew
Waste of my [Bleep] Money and mybleep] Time, bro.
[Bleep].
You don't deserve me, and you don't deserve these roses.
Tell me you love me that's all I need to hear then I'll have no need to stay, and I can disappear
- Okay, you just bought me flowers, and now you're throwing them out, so now I'm like,
"what the [Bleep]?" In my head.
Like, what is going on?
It hurts.
I'm just all-like, I feel all [Bleep] Up in the head at this point.
It must be right first time.
You can't service it or bring it back or complain to the manufacturer that it doesn't work.
Failure in space is not an option.
If something goes wrong, customers are not happy and they don't come back to you again.
So what we've got here is the startings of a telecommunications satellite.
We've got seven smaller thrusters and we have a main engine, which is fitted inside the cone.
If we sent a spacecraft up into space with no insulation, the distortions caused by the very temperature differences would buckle the structure and destroy it.
If the heart stops, the patient dies.
If the quartz crystal stops oscillating, the satellite will die.
If I say I work on satellites...
"What, you put the dishes on the walls, do you?"
They just don't...
They don't understand that there's something up there as well, in space.
The moments leading up to the firing of that main engine is very tense.
It's the nearest we get to science fiction.
It's just something people dream of.
We sort of live a little bit of that dream.
Space is incredibly special.
What we do is quite exceptional here.
After almost two years of precision engineering and costing over £100 million, a six-tonne telecommunications satellite is sitting on top of this rocket.
In terms of the satellite, the risk here of course is that it's now about to be shaken from the rocket motors.
It's also going to get a fantastic thrust load on it.
And now it's just one day away from being fired into orbit.
The amount of testing that we do to verify it effectively never guarantees you 100% but it guarantees you that you've got a very, very high probability of success and that's what we go for.
The violence of the launch is the most dangerous moment of a satellite's life.
We have to make sure it survives this phase and then it can go into operation.
This is the bit where we all get that, er...
A little bit of butterflies in the stomach.
And although it's being launched in faraway French Guiana, most of it was designed and built in Britain.
We're on the A1 heading south at the moment.
It's about quarter to eight in the morning.
I've done this trip for the last 30 years.
Bob Graham is a site director at Astrium, one of the biggest spacecraft manufacturers in the world.
If people say, "Who do you work for?"
and I mention the name of the company there's often a slightly quizzical look on their face.
Then it becomes quite a surprise when you say,
"Well, I work in the space industry."
When the Space Race was at its height in the 1960s, the United Kingdom had virtually no space industry.
Today, British engineers lead the world in satellite design and manufacture.
Working in space is always something different and there's not many people in the industry.
So in the pub when someone says, "What do you do for a living?"
You say, "I work in the space industry,"
they do give you a funny look.
We watched the moon landings and everything that NASA did was quite incredible.
For me, I can't quite believe I'm being able to do this.
Yeah, we've known each other a long time.
26 years?
Haven't we?
Is it that long?
I think so.
God.
Yeah.
Oh, dear.
We don't look that old either, do we?
What's Mr Cross up to?
You visitors are all the same!
Astrium have factories all across Europe but employ around 3,500 people in the UK.
Every satellite the company builds starts life here just outside London on their site in Stevenage.
I've worked here for nearly 30 years.
I came to Stevenage in 1982 for what was sold to me as a 12-18 month position and I've been here ever since.
It gets into your blood.
It's a really, really good job to have.
There's not many areas within in the country where you can actually work on spacecraft.
Telecommunication satellites are an integral part of the modern world.
They allow us to send television pictures and communicate over vast distances using all of today's modern technology.
But because they operate in deep space, they have to incorporate some extremely complex engineering.
A modern communications satellite needs to be capable of surviving the possible impact of debris travelling at thousands of metres per second.
And they need to be able to operate in temperatures that fluctuate between minus 200 degrees Centigrade to a blistering 150 degrees Centigrade.
And yet, the satellite has to continuously operate for a guaranteed 15 years, because out in space, there's absolutely no prospect of repair.
I think people do take it for granted.
So if you pick up your mobile phone to make a phone call you don't realise it's bouncing off a satellite.
Or you turn on your TV.
It's just stuff you do everyday without thinking about it.
The upper quadrant, section five...
Yeah?
..
looked fine.
A modern telecommunications satellite can be over five metres high and three metres wide.
Although astonishingly complicated, there are basically two distinct parts forming its main body.
The mechanics... and the electronics.
The mechanics make up what's called the service module.
And the electronics make up the communications module.
The satellite's central skeleton is built around a carbon fibre cylinder connected to aluminium panels which hold four fuel tanks, a main engine, thrusters and batteries.
This is the service module.
On top of it sits the communications module which carries the satellite's complex electronic payload.
Also added are solar arrays.
Attached to the main body, they capture sunlight which is converted into electric power, and antenna dishes that will transmit and receive signals from Earth.
And by looking at different stages of the build it's possible to understand how they're put together.
From the manufacturing viewpoint this is the beginning of the process.
The build begins with a central core, the skeleton of the satellite.
Strands of carbon fibre coated with resin are wound into a complex pattern to make the cylinder as strong and light as possible.
When it's finished and vertical it weighs just 20kg and is ready for the next stage of construction.
In here is where we produce our panels, our honeycomb panels.
Aluminium skins.
Very, very thin skins, very lightweight.
Low mass is key in terms of space and we use aluminium because it's good structurally.
The aluminium panels are attached to the central cylinder forming more of the basic structure.
John Richards has been building these for almost his whole working life.
We're just putting the flight bolts into the SM floor and that attaches the floors to the central structure.
I'm not sure how many bolts, probably about 20 in each quadrant.
I don't suppose, really, people just think of satellites as something that's up in space orbiting round.
I don't suppose they think of actually what goes into building them.
You take your time, because as you're probably aware that these things are worth a lot of money.
And it only takes us to make one slight mistake and it could end up costing millions of pounds.
Best thing about working here is the people like John and people that have been here years, always willing to pass on experience and to help you out.
After the basic structure is finished the rest of the systems can be added.
Once I've gone through my final testing we have a big clean down, make sure it's particle free, ready to be accepted into Mick's area and I'll give him a shout and usually that's it.
I mean it's very casual, it's just, "When you going to be ready?"
"Tomorrow", whatever, and just hand it over to him.
Satellites have to be built in extremely clean environments because any dirt inside the moving parts can have devastating effects once they're in space.
In fact there are special areas of the factory that actually have fewer dust particles than you'd find in a typical hospital operating theatre.
And in here, engineer Graham Viney and team leader Mick Atkinson have the tricky task of managing the assembly and integration of the fuel tanks, the pipe work and the engines of the service module.
We do get problems now and again because when it's designed, it's all done on a model and then when it comes down to us it is quite a bit different in the real life, putting it together.
There's certain things that we know we can't do in the design because it just won't be able to be done on the shop floor.
So what we've got here is the overall service module or the startings of the service module of the telecommunications satellite.
What you can see are two tanks of an eventual four tank propellant system.
On the outside, in several locations, we've got seven smaller thrusters and we have a main engine, a liquid apogee engine, which is fitted inside the cone.
The service module carries four fuel tanks, all placed around the central core.
Each fuel tank can withstand an internal pressure equal to being over 200 metres underwater.
The fuel is used for the satellite's engines.
The main engine fires the satellite out into orbit after it's launched and then, for the rest of its lifespan, the other seven pairs of smaller thrusters will keep the satellite in its orbit.
The fuel for all of these engines is delivered by one of the most explosive mixtures known to man -
Nitrogen Tetroxide and Monomethyl Hydrozene, or NTO and MMH.
As you can guess from the names, these aren't particularly pleasant liquids, so extremely toxic and extremely hazardous.
If you take in any of the NTO or the MMH, basically you will suffer from burns, internal burning and then eventually it leads to death.
They are lethal.
The reason for choosing these dangerous fuels is simple - their explosive quality.
The more explosive the mixture, the bigger the thrust, and the less fuel you need.
But at three tonnes, this volatile mixture is still half the satellite's launch weight.
And with such an explosive power, the tanks need to be tested to destruction to ensure they'll survive the trip into space.
Part of the testing of the propellant tanks is to take it to an actual burst pressure.
We don't test it with gas, we tend to test it with water.
We increase the pressure and we get up towards 49 bar and the tank will split.
Although the tanks won't be filled with fuel until just before the launch, it's still delicate work fitting them.
We're just about to install the third propellant tank into the structure.
Two are already installed, this is the third one.
It is quite tricky, yeah.
And it's worth a lot of money, of course, as well.
About the price of a good house, actually, yeah.
The propellant tanks are built from titanium because the metal doesn't react with the fuel in any way.
And they are machined to be wafer thin.
'We've got to be so careful that no damage occurs 'during this process, so it's quite delicate.
'It never goes wrong.
It can't.
It can't go wrong.'
LAUGHS
'Yeah, it's quite a big operation in the tasks that we perform' so it's good to get it out of the way.
We've got it off to a T now.
Hopefully, tomorrow we'll be putting the other tank in.
It's the end of a successful day, and so, with the tanks fitted, the next stage of the build will be adding the engines.
So when I tell people I work in the space industry, it either sparks conversation and genuine interest or is a complete conversation killer.
The concept of satellites came from Arthur C Clarke back in 1945.
He thought, "How can we transmit data from one side of the Earth
"to the other side of the Earth?"
These things will make possible a world in which we can be in instant contact with each other, wherever we may be.
'Men will no longer commute, they will communicate.'
With the launch of Telstar in 1962, transmitting sound and vision across continents and oceans became a reality.
'We have acquired the Telstar, Captain Booth puts his thumb up.
'And there is the picture direct from Telstar.
'This is the sort of image 'and the sort of sound on which, in fact, the future 'of inter-continental telecommunications 'via space vehicles is built.'
If you threw something at the horizon it would just fall and drop.
If you threw it hard enough, you could probably throw it past the horizon, and where would it drop to?
Well, it would continuously drop.
And that's what we're talking about.
When you have enough energy to throw a rock or whatever it is to the horizon but you throw it hard enough that it then continuously falls, then you're in orbit.
For a satellite to stay in the same place in the sky it has to travel at the same rate as the Earth spins - once every 24 hours.
This is called geostationary orbit and it can only be achieved at 35,786km above the equator.
Any closer to the Earth and the satellite orbits too fast.
Any further away and it's too slow.
And that's why, in the UK, all TV dishes point at 29 degrees above the horizon.
They are all receiving a signal from one particular satellite that never moves in relation to our homes.
Microwaves won't work round the curvature of the Earth.
You need to be able to see the point that you're transmitting to or receiving from.
The satellite receives and transmits signals through large antenna dishes that fold out from its main body.
But they're very different from the dishes we see outside our homes.
They have carbon fibre skins bonded onto a Kevlar honeycomb core, but there's another, more important difference - they don't have a smooth surface.
The customers will specify a coverage.
That coverage will be to maximise access to the population and the service area.
So for the one we're looking at here, which is over Europe, we're looking at the landmass of Europe, so the more we can do to suppress the unwanted power over the sea, the more we can put it where they're going to get their revenue from.
What we see in the top-right corner is what we're actually doing to the reflector.
We're slowly manipulating the reflector surface, very subtly - in tens of millimetres - to actually produce a highly-concentrated area over Europe.
Shaping the reflectors in this way focuses the signal better, and this is critical, because the power they transmit back to Earth is astonishingly small.
The power that we're transmitting for each channel is equivalent to a 100-watt light bulb, and that 100-watt light bulb is 22,000 miles away from the surface of the Earth.
This is quite amazing technology, really.
The satellite is kept in its correct orbit with a series of different-sized engines, but given it weighs around six tonnes, it doesn't need the engines you may think.
If you were to fit this engine to your car, you'd have trouble fitting in the three tonnes of propellant, but you may move it very, very slowly.
It's not going to take off.
But we're in space, so we can use this engine on a six-tonne satellite and move it through space because there's no friction, so it's relatively easy to do.
Once in geostationary orbit, the smaller thrusters will take over from the main engine to keep the satellite in position.
We have thrusters dotted around so that we can control the attitude of the satellite, to keep the antennas pointed, to keep the data flowing.
We've got influences from the Earth, which is not a perfect sphere, so gravity will have an effect, and solar radiation from the sun.
We have large solar arrays that will pick up from the solar radiation and slowly change the attitude of the satellite and we need to fire a thruster to bring it back.
These manoeuvres happen regularly, just to keep the satellite in its correct position.
But at the end of its life, these small thrusters will use the last of the fuel to blast it even further away from the Earth and into a graveyard orbit, which will be its final resting place.
Whilst all the structural components for the satellite are built in Stevenage, the communications module is built in the company's other UK site at Portsmouth.
Portsmouth's history is well-known, of course, for the maritime aspects of Portsmouth, but actually, for a long time, maybe associated with that there's been a capability in defence electronics.
More than 50 years this site has been here, and over the last 20 years we've seen this shift from defence electronics to space.
It's here that the electronic components that form the communications module are made and fitted.
I don't think we talk about the space activities very much here.
I don't know whether it was because it started off being defence-oriented and therefore quite secret, and whether that's sort of part of the culture.
But nevertheless, people in this area don't normally associate it - even the ones that live here - don't know that we make sophisticated satellites.
Over 12 months, thousands of individual electronic components will be designed, built and fitted to the structure.
And their reliability is critical.
Failure in space is not an option.
Customers spend 150 million buying a satellite and if something goes wrong they are not happy and they don't come back to you again.
This communication module is also known as the "payload".
On a spacecraft there are many parts, but essentially it comes down to the payload - the reason for it being there, what it wishes to receive and what it wishes to transmit.
Each satellite is guaranteed by the company to work for at least 15 years.
If it doesn't, they don't get paid, so attention to detail is critical.
The main driver for what we do here is reliability, so on the site here we have 3,000 engineers - no service engineers.
Once the equipment on the spacecraft goes into service it has to operate for 15 years without any reduction in its quality of service.
During that time, it gets hot and cold so the heat on board the spacecraft makes the electronics grow old.
The radiation gives it sunburn, so it has to survive through all those things.
At the heart of the communications module are micro-electronic circuits called "hybrids".
These are computer processors, like silicon chips, but are built for space.
The circuits are printed onto gallium arsenide, a semiconductor, and bonded onto a ceramic tile.
Then they're connected with gold wire.
I'm placing a one-thou gold wire onto a substrate using a combination of heat, pressure and vibration.
Each satellite is made up of around 20kg of pure gold.
It's 99.9% pure gold, so, yeah, it's good stuff!
Only the best!
Pure gold is stable, doesn't degrade and is an excellent conductor of both heat and electricity.
I was only 18 when I first did wire bonding so I suppose I was quite adaptable to it.
Even though I've got chubby fingers, I like doing delicate work.
I haven't tried embroidery yet, though!
Once complete, the chips are incorporated into bigger electronic units.
I've been working on this for the best part of four years, to actually get it from the early design, right through to actually realising some of the hardware.
Decoding commands - it's a bit like you sort of pick up your telephone and dial a number.
This particular unit, crudely, it's doing the same sort of function.
Then the components are tested again and again and again.
We've got about 8,000 test steps on this particular unit on its own, so end to end, it's probably something like around two to three months, I would think.
But certainly on the design side, you know, you're very conscious that this, actually, is going to be up there for 15 years.
That's quite at the fore of your mind in terms of everything you do.
It certainly is in my mind, anyway!
But not all the components inside the satellite rely on modern technology.
I've worked in this building for about 12 years, but I've been engaged on crystal growth for the last 42 years.
Morning, Mike.
Morning.
A huge problem for satellite communication is interference.
This happens when the outgoing signal is confused with the incoming signal.
This problem can be prevented by quartz crystals built into devices called "resonators".
You can look on the quartz resonator as the beating heart.
If the heart stops, the patient dies, and similarly, with a satellite, if the quartz crystal stops oscillating, the satellite will die.
Oscillating crystals are used to control all the frequencies the satellite transmits.
And the quality of the crystal is critical because if there's any impurity, they won't work.
This is a block of natural quartz that we purchased from a small company that uses quartz for crystal balls.
Something like that would set you back somewhere between £10,000-£20,000.
OK, Mike, bring in the crane.
Because Derek needs to ensure the crystal quality and supply, he originally used purchased crystals to provide seeds from which he grows his own.
What we're trying to do here is to replicate the way natural quartz grows in nature.
Natural quartz will grow deep in the Earth's crust.
The difference is we're trying to speed up the process so we can complete the growth in, essentially, a few months rather than a few thousand years.
Over the next three months, under a high temperature and enormous pressure, crystals slowly form in a solution of caustic soda.
We've been producing them for 25 years or so, and so far nobody has beaten them.
Once they're formed, the pure crystals are first sliced... ..then shaped...
..and finally polished until they are little bigger than a contact lens before being incorporated into the satellite's electronics.
Our crystals are the purest in the world.
I can say that with absolute certainty.
Once all the electronic sections have been made, they need to undergo a series of tests before being attached to the communications module.
My name's Gary Stancombe.
I've worked in vibration tests and mechanical tests at Astrium for 15 years now.
I'm going to do some taping down to tidy it up and then we'll be ready.
OK.
This test is to check they will survive the extreme physical impact of the satellite's launch.
What we're doing today is we're going to subject this unit to a sequence of vibration tests to simulate the launch environment when the rocket lifts off and those eight minutes which will take it into space.
It does get a fair old shake.
Today, we're going to subject it to a 20G vibration test - 20 times gravity.
So anything in there will feel 20 times heavier.
Every electronic component is tested in this way, sometimes to breaking point.
It is a hard test, yeah.
It's a thorough test.
It has to be.
We have to ensure that everything is going to still be working once the unit gets into space.
We do see failures, but not too often.
But it's not just the vibration of the launch that each component has to cope with.
There are also massive shock waves.
These happen as explosive charges decouple each stage of the rocket.
From the solid boosters, the satellite housing and main engine, through to the deployment of the satellite itself.
These are quite substantial shock waves so they need to be tested.
OK, and that's the shock test!
Once the electronics have survived all these tests they can be fitted into the communications module.
Ian Kilby started work as a technician over a decade ago, but he's now in charge of ensuring everything is connected correctly.
When I moved up from technician to engineer, at that point you're no longer allowed to fit any equipment to the payload.
I do miss the hands-on side of things.
I used to enjoy the challenges that wave-guide and co-ax present to the fitters, and yeah, sometimes I do wish, on particularly bad days, I wish I was back down there on the tools and could not worry so much about things.
At the moment, the communications module is in two pieces and Ian has a brave attempt at explaining how it all fits together.
Basically the signal, when it's received from Earth - when the whole satellite's coupled - there'll be an antenna, a receiver antenna on the top floor.
The signal will come in.
It goes through the equipment on the top floor.
They amplify it, clean up the signal, get the part of the signal we require.
It then travels down, down through the payload and there will be some equipment called MPMs which are not installed yet.
It travels up through the switch network, goes up through the OMUX, it's amplified again and harmonised a little bit more, the signal is cleaned a little bit more again at the OMUX level, and then basically, it comes back
to the top floor, to a feed-horn, to the reflector and then back to Earth.
Ian's idiots' guide to a payload!
Modern telecom satellites can now transmit over 300 digital channels simultaneously.
But just 20 years ago, they could only cope with ten analogue TV channels.
And their speed of transmission, or lack of it, was apparent to everyone.
THEME MUSIC
If you think back to Terry Wogan's show, when he used to have one on BBC One...
..the very first sort of satellite links, London to New York, it was almost painful to watch.
She called me, did she?
# I hear you calling me. #
Am I speaking to Linda Gray?
HIS WORDS ECHO: ..
Linda Gray.
Yes.
Well, that's established that it's not working.
SHE LAUGHS
With the amount of lag, you had to wait for the signal to go, or Terry's voice to reach the USA, and then the response time back.
It was an eternity.
I'm sure people remember that.
It just took forever.
When we talk on satellite like this, you know, the miracle of sound, there's just a little second or two delay.
So it's not that Barry's hearing has gone.
It's merely it's a long way to Los Angeles.
But now with the speed, the processing power and the speed of modern satellites, it's barely noticeable.
It's, like I say, within a second.
Once all the electronic equipment is fixed, the side panels and the central structure are joined together to form the complete communications module.
These are some of the most delicate parts of the satellite.
And to safeguard them in the extreme environment of deep space, they need special protection.
My name's Katy Smith.
I'm the thermal architect here and I've been working here for about six years.
My job is the thermal design, the build, the test of the spacecraft.
Deep-space environment's incredibly hostile.
It's incredibly cold - minus-270 degrees C - whereas the sun-pointing surface could be in the region of 150, if not more.
And on top of that, you're in a vacuum so there's no convective environment, you can't reject heat like you would.
For example, your cup of tea, when you blow on it, it removes the heat.
It doesn't exist.
And the satellite needs to be able to operate within these massive temperature differences.
If we sent a spacecraft up into space with no insulation, it wouldn't work.
You'd have one side with severe damage to the structure because of the sun's influence.
You'd have panels dropping off.
So the distortions caused by the temperature differences would buckle the structure and destroy it.
And the heat isn't just a problem on the outside of the satellite because these extremes of temperature could be disastrous for all the on-board electronics inside.
They can only operate between a cold minus-10 degrees to a warm 40 degrees.
So to keep the internal temperature within this range, the satellite is wrapped in material called Kapton.
Kapton is a high-temperature layer.
It's very robust.
You can use it in an environment from minus-250 degrees C, up to a continuous operating temperature of about 290 degrees C.
I think the best way of describing it as a home product would be a Quality Street wrapper.
It's difficult to tear, incredibly light, so for a space environment, it's hugely applicable.
But Kapton can't protect the satellite on its own.
What you're actually seeing here is a very thin deposition of aluminium.
So here, when you can see the gold outer layer, it's not actually gold.
What you're seeing is the vacuum-deposited aluminium behind the Kapton, like that, giving it an amber or gold effect.
The aluminium-backed Kapton forms a blanket, insulating the satellite and preventing heat being lost to deep space, while at the same time stopping the sun overheating the electronics inside.
I know it seems kind of counterintuitive because you've got large amounts of energy coming in from the sun, but to balance it out and find a happy medium, you have to block some of the sun, dump some of the heat
and supply some heat internally.
It's a really complicated juggling act.
The Kapton blanket is the first line of defence at keeping the satellite at a reasonably constant temperature.
But the electronics inside also create their own heat, and this, too, needs to be dissipated.
To do this, some very clever engineering is also incorporated into the two large structural panels on the outside of the service module.
A complex matrix of pipes act as massive radiators, dumping heat generated by the electronics and keeping the internal temperature constant.
A heat pipe is a very, very effective method of moving heat from one local region to another.
There's no working parts, no electricity required, so power-wise, it's good.
But unlike household radiators, these pipes contain ammonia, because it boils and vaporises at just the right temperature -
33 degrees centigrade.
So what happens, is at one end, in the hot, high power dissipation region, what will be a liquid at that stage evaporates.
The vapour then travels up the tube, up the centre of the tube to the cold region and at this region it condenses.
It dumps the heat and then travels back down to start the whole cycle again in the form of a liquid.
There is one final line of defence, which is also crucial in reflecting heat away from the satellite.
And it's all down to this team.
I know it sounds very cheesy, but it's the satisfaction of knowing that you're actually contributing to mankind.
You see that panel that comes in with no mirrors on it.
And then, when it goes out, it looks beautiful, all polished up.
And you know it's serving a purpose up there to protect the spacecraft.
You stand back and look at it and go, "Wow, we did that."
A thin silver surface of mirrors will reflect the sun's rays away from the satellite and is its last form of heat defence.
These are 100 microns thick.
So they are very thin, it's about as thick as a human hair.
We have sheets of 198 mirrors at a time, so they're very fragile.
The glass the mirrors are made of also helps to emit heat away from its core.
Just want to feather that in.
Well, we've put the activator in and we've only got 30 minutes to apply the adhesive, put the mirrors on and get it under vacuum,
So, it is a bit of a rush.
It's eight hours of prep for 30 minutes of organised chaos!
The surface that you can see is 99% silver, it's pure silver.
And the back surface, the darker side, is nickel and chrome, which is called nichrome and that is there purely to stop the silver from oxidising.
I you remember, if you can think back to your grandmother's silver dinner service when it goes black.
These will go black and they then, they don't become reflective.
That's it.
We're done.
In Portsmouth, Ian Kilby is putting the communications module through its final checks in a special room called an anechoic chamber.
We're firing some microwaves at the payload to see if there are any leaks in any of our co-axial connections.
So, if you imagine the same signal is inside the payload, it's leaked around and it's coming out of a hole, it could, in turn, effect the input into the satellite and the output going out.
So, it could blind itself, in effect, with its own loop of RF signal.
It's been quite catastrophic in the past to have EMC leaks because it actually interferes with the transmission that's coming from the comms module back to Earth.
The chamber is designed to block out any radio signals from getting in or out.
It's almost like taking a telephone towards a radio when you're phoning the radio station.
You get that a big screaming squeal, in an effect not a screaming squeal, but obviously it has a similar effect on a telecoms payload.
With the final testing complete, it's time to box up the communications module ready for shipping.
It's always a nerve-wracking moment to pick up something of this value.
It's all the fruits of our labours over the last few months.
Lots of things potentially could go wrong.
You know, we're picking it up with a crane.
Failure with the crane or something catastrophic could happen.
Even when it's turning into the box, it's quite a nerve wracking moment, it's quite a large mass.
After over two years of intense and complicated engineering, most of the work that takes place in the UK is done and the modules are shipped to Toulouse in the south of France.
It's always quite pleasing when you see another delivery going out of the door.
It's in this facility where the final assembly happens.
It's a complicated and delicate process.
First, the service module made in Stevenage and the communications module from Portsmouth will be joined together.
Then, the solar arrays are added.
Finally, the antenna will be attached.
Graham Viney has escorted the service module to Toulouse but luckily for him it's his French colleague,
Pascal Gaudin, who's in charge.
This phase is key for Pascal, he's responsible for the integration here.
For me, you can probably tell I'm a little more relaxed, but I understand what Pascal is going through, but it's not me.
Here, at that point, we have a few millimetres, really, tolerance, that's all.
We are all feeling a bit nervous about this because we have to look at all the proximities between the two structures and spacecraft is never the same, so each time there are surprises, so, we have to be very careful about this operation.
After six hours careful work, the two British built modules are successfully coupled and the main body of the satellite is complete.
I think more relaxed, we passed the most critical phase of this operation.
Now we still have to fit all together the different interfaces, which are on different levels but so far it's a success, yes, this coupling is a success.
Completing the satellite in Toulouse will take another seven months of dedicated work.
Although all satellites carry fuel for the engines they are actually solar powered.
My name is Ludwig Grandl,
I am the manager for the Centre Of Competence of Astrium Solar Arrays, here in Germany.
For the last 40 years, the main centre for solar array production in Europe has been this factory.
The satellite will have over 20,000 individual solar cells, each helping to generate the electricity needed to power the electronic systems.
What you can see here, that's a typical solar array for our Euro star programmes.
One wing as we see it here completed with the mechanism is around 130kg.
Though, on a satellite we have two of them.
Each array is 20 metres long and yet their combined total weight is the equivalent of just three average sized men.
The arrays are folded against the satellite's structure for the launch, but once in space, they gently unfold, using a system of springs and wires.
Let me say, we are extreme reliable in this way and we never lost function of one of our solar arrays for whatever reasons.
The solar arrays are dependent on a drive mechanism.
This allows them to move and always face the sun and this machine has been designed and built back in the UK by Bob and his team.
This is one of the key critical elements in the spacecraft, so it has to operate every day for 15 years.
If we lose this, we lose power into the spacecraft, that causes the mission failure.
This mechanism is one of the most critical components of the whole satellite.
It has to move the solar arrays to face the sun every second of every day for its entire 15 year lifetime.
Because if it doesn't, the satellite will loose power.
This provides two functions.
It provides the power transfer from the arrays and then it also enables the arrays to track the sun by rotating at one cycle per day.
This is the spacecraft.
These are the arrays.
So, they sit in here holding the arrays and if you imagine my fist as the Earth and the camera perhaps as the sun, then as the Earth rotates and the spacecraft rotates, you'll see that if you don't rotate the array to track the sun,
then you don't get the power.
So we have to rotate, as this space craft sits in geostationary orbit above the equator, moving round the Earth, we have to rotate these so they are always facing the sun.
There is a very, very high pleasure in engineering in getting something right.
The fact that you can see something which was, in effect, something in somebody's imagination turn into reality and for it then to be successful, is a tremendous kick, it really is.
With everything fitted and tested the satellite is carefully packed into a hi-tech crate and sent by plane to the launch site...
..Where it's prepared for its final journey.
It's a tense time for the whole team.
We're in the satellite control centre and this control centre takes over control of the satellite after it's separated from the launcher.
It is critical, it is a crucial phase.
Good line pressure to fire the thrusters.
At the moment, this team here is running through a rehearsal.
There is a computer simulating everything the satellite does, we can send commands as we would and it responds like a satellite, and it's really testing, testing the team.
As the satellite is being prepared for launch on the other side of the world, these rehearsals are critical because when it leaves the rocket that gets it into space its orbit will be elliptical.
The moments leading up to the firing of that main engine is very tense, a lot of pressure, and if it doesn't happen we have a lot of people looking at us.
Graham and his team will then have to fly it into the correct geostationary orbit by remotely operating its main engine and thrusters.
Each burn will take up to 90 minutes, but overall the procedure will take two weeks and use half of the available fuel.
Every time we circularise the orbit of a satellite, there's something about those two weeks where something will challenge us.
The launch day is fast approaching.
And over 4,000 miles from Stevenage,
Bob Graham is following the satellite's journey.
We're in French Guiana, which is in South America and very close to the equator.
Green, lots of green trees.
Very, very hot, about 37 degrees today.
One of the reasons we launch from the equator, or very close to the equator, is because the earth spins and there's a faster rotational speed actually on the equator.
It makes business sense to fire a rocket into space from the equator as it's cheaper to launch.
Which means less fuel, means a lower cost launch and from the spacecraft's perspective it's actually being placed closer to its end orbital position so, again, it uses less fuel on the spacecraft.
The satellite will be lifted into orbit by an Ariane 5 rocket.
At over 50 metres and almost 800 tonnes fully fuelled, this is the workhorse of European space exploration.
Our satellite is right at the top of the launch vehicle you can see the fairing at the top the curved part is literally sitting right inside there.
Watching the launch has a special resonance for Bob.
I've worked in the space industry for nearly 30 years, never seen a launch in my whole career, never.
To be so close is a really incredible and moving moment because a lot of people do not actually get to witness this.
I feel terribly privileged that I'm here and I would see myself as a representative of the people who've actually contributed to the delivery and the success of this spacecraft.
You're talking about 30 million horsepower at launch.
So, the thrust when this vehicle takes off is about the equivalent of 12 A380 airbuses taking off.
This is a pretty rough ride for the satellite and that's what all the design and everything is about.
We have to make sure it survives this phase and then it can go into operation.
So, it's, er, yes, this is the bit where we all get that...
little bit of butterflies in the stomach, which is saying, "I hope this goes all right."
Maybe even some sweaty palms, let's wait and see.
Later that day, the rocket is carefully rolled out to the launch pad.
It's taken over two years, in excess of £100 million and some exceptional engineering to get this far.
And now, there's nothing Bob can do.
Except wait.
Launch day.
And on schedule, the automatic countdown commences.
At first, everything goes smoothly.
But at just 1 minute and 47 seconds before ignition, the countdown stops.
The window has opened and there's a hold.
There's some problem somewhere which they're checking.
They'll restart the seven-minute countdown.
So we will see how it goes from here.
Little butterflies.
Is it going to go?
Is it going to go?
And is it going to be... ..as they say it is in terms of the light, the noise and, er...yeah.
So let's see.
As night falls, it's apparent that the technical issues are more serious than first thought.
And after an hour of waiting, the launch is cancelled.
The next morning, an initial investigation suggests a faulty fuel valve in the rocket caused the postponement.
Here we are in Mission Control Jupiter, the morning after.
This is the place where that final decision was made last night to postpone it.
As an engineer, I know this is the right decision.
The decision made last night was the right one.
But... ..as a man, as a person, as a representative of a team, yes, there's an element of disappointment that it didn't happen.
Space is difficult.
It is about risk.
It is about showing that our products are good, but we can't afford to take the risks.
But it will happen again.
Maybe I won't see it, but others will and I guess that's life.
And finally, the satellite was successfully launched.
Today, 35,786 kilometres above us, the brand-new communications satellite is now being prepared to broadcast pictures directly into your home.

I fell asleep.
I hope I didn't hurt his feelings.
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
Do you want to be rich?
Yes.
Do you want to provide a secure future for your children?
Yes.
Would you like to tell your boss to take this job and shove it?
Oh, God, yes.
Then all you need is the next great American invention.
Damn it, there's always a catch!
Bring your ideas down to the National Invention Convention Extravaganza at the Natesville High School gym this Saturday, where a celebrity judge could make you
America's next millionaire.
We could never win that.
Why not?
Regular people come up with great inventions every day.
What if we combine the oven with the toaster into one thing?
An oven-toaster.
Inventing's for smart people.
Like the guy who put his chocolate in the other guy's peanut butter.
That's not true.
Bill Gates couldn't even finish college, and he invented the computer.
Do you really think we could do this?
We gotta at least try.
Guys, this could be our one chance at having a better life.
Maybe you're right.
I think we could invent something.
I'm in.
Great.
Everybody put on your thinking caps today and come home with at least one good invention.
What about putting hot food into pockets?
Pocket-Hots.
Well, cleanup on aisle three is done.
Happy to say mother and new child are doing just fine.
What ya drawing?
Just my idea for a new invention.
It's a baby mop.
While the baby crawls, it also cleans.
My mom wants us to enter the National Invention Convention Extravaganza this Saturday.
I've always considered myself pretty inventive.
I invented a language that only me and my identical twin knew.
But I haven't spoken to that ugly turd in decades, so maybe I should invent something new.
That'll really fisnad his gleeblok.
Have you thought about making those in different colors?
I'm gonna do that with my invention.
Different colors.
I call that.
What's your invention?
I don't know, but it's gonna be different colors.
Different colors, that's a great idea.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do it.
Thanks.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
Wow.
That's really cool.
What?
Oh, that you're gonna take my idea.
Wyatt's always working on projects for business school, and every time I try to make a suggestion, he just shoots it down like he's threatened by it or something.
Threatened?
That's crazy.
That's a weird thing to be.
Not me.
In fact, you want to partner up on this?
I mean, we'll have to spend a lot of time together working on it...
Sure.
Yeah, that sounds fun.
You got your pen in my cottage cheese!
You got your cottage cheese on my pen.
Nope.
Keep thinking.
I know I shouldn't keep shaving with Donna's leg razor, but I miss her, and it makes me feel close to her.
Burt, did you fall asleep on me again?
I'm sorry.
There's some inventors contest this weekend, and Virginia wants us to "put on our thinking caps"
and think of an invention.
Come up with anything yet?
Uh, solar-powered electric jump rope, a pencil that makes your grammar more correcter, man yogurt.
Man yogurt?
You know, yogurt for men.
All they have now are girly flavors like blueberry or strawberry.
Why not have man flavors like pork chops, stew?
Interesting.
You could call it "Bro-gurt."
Bro-gurt!
I got it!
I got it!
I got our million- dollar idea.
Man-flavored yogurt.
Why in the world would anyone want yogurt that tastes like a man?
No, it's man flavors, like hamburger cheeseburger, but not turkey burger 'cause that'd be girly.
You see how this works?
And here's the best part.
We call it "Bro-gurt."
Bro-gurt.
I like it.
A catchy name is half the battle.
That's right up there with Manwich.
See, it's that type of thinking that's gonna get us out of the service business
And into the business of being served!
God, you are on a roll!
- (chuckles) On a roll like a Manwich!
- Whoa!
I've got to tell that Manwich line to Andrew when he comes over.
Andrew?
No, that twit cannot come over here.
We got work to do.
He's my partner.
He came up with the name Bro-gurt.
Burt, this was for our family to get ahead.
Now Andrew is gonna be an albacore around our necks for the rest of our lives!
I think I've got a good one.
"The Baby Mop."
Put it on a baby...
And the baby crawls your mess away.
I like it.
It's smart, it's simple, and most importantly, no outside partner.
I have a partner.
Sabrina.
No!
The plan was to go out and come back with an idea!
Not come back with a person that we have to share our bajillion dollars with.
Dang!
Am I the only smart person in this house?
What about a TV channel just for news?
Wait.
They'll have to fill up too many hours and resort to sensationalizing non-issues and stirring up partisan bickering.
Scratch that idea.
It sucks.
Hello.
Well, hey, good news.
Since Hope doesn't crawl anymore,
Shelley's gonna loan us some babies for the presentation.
That's great, but I have good news, too.
I finally figured out what's missing from the Baby Mop.
The handle to steer it.
Yeah, but the baby's just supposed to clean while it crawls around.
That's the whole point.
But babies are unpredictable, and they might not crawl where you want them to, and... (sighs) Man, you hate it!
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just letting it soak in.
Uh, a stick.
Yeah, because...
Yeah, no, a stick!
It's a great idea, partner.
Thanks.
I'm gonna go see if we have more colors.
Dude, she just jacked up your invention with that handle.
Now it's just a mop that cries.
Yeah, but this invention thing's a long shot anyway.
I'm not gonna argue with her.
That's what Wyatt does, and I'm gonna do the opposite.
The opposite of the guy
- she has sex with.
- Good strategy.
Anyway, doesn't matter because your baby mop has no chance of winning against my "shoemerang."
A shoe that will return to you no matter where you throw it.
(shoe clatters in distance)
I'm still working on ideas.
(blender whirring)
Mmm.
That has to be the best scotch-and-cigar-flavored yogurt ever made!
I know, right?
Bro-gurt is just the beginning.
If this goes well, we can invent all sorts of products just for men.
Yeah.
Why should women get to invent everything?
Exactly.
We can make pork-sicles.
We can make soap that smells like bacon.
Tampons for our butts!
What?
I don't know.
I'm just pitching.
You losers can quit chopping meat.
I've got the winning invention.
What does the average American family spend $130 a year on?
Deodorant.
But that'll all stop once they buy...
Pit-stops!
The world's first reusable underarm protection.
Ooh, that's good.
If this goes well, you're gonna grow up wearing name-brand clothes and get braces.
How ya doing, Natesville inventors?
(gasps) Sorry I couldn't be there with you in person, but I got a lot of Hollywood projects, and these jackets don't cut the sleeves off themselves.
Still got it.
But I'm still able to be there with you because of the technology of the video chat, which somebody invented.
You've come in here today as regular, average citizens, but one of you may leave here as wealthy as me.
So good luck to you.
Registration starts in five minutes.
Please follow the yellow carpet to the sign-up tables outside.
See ya then.
Andrew Dice Clay, oh, my God!
I love him!
His cassette's been stuck in my car radio, like, ten years.
(spits, squawks)
Okay, the basic entry fee is $20.
For a little bit extra, we offer patent-pending date-stamping.
This stops other people from stealing your idea.
It's too bad this wasn't around when Bill Johnson invented the lightbulb.
I thought Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb.
And that's why you need the date stamp.
I'll take it.
You think we should get that?
Burt, I didn't know we had to pitch this to a celebrity.
I don't think I can do this.
Okay, fine.
I'll do all the talking.
You got to settle down.
Go over to the glow-in-the-dark ice-cream guy.
Maybe he's got a napkin you can dry your eyes with.
Okay, now I hate to be pushy, but I cannot recommend any higher the invention checklist.
I mean, the first thing on the list is "Buy the invention checklist."
I'll take it.
Hey, good idea sending him over there.
Now let's win this thing before he gets back.
What has happened to you?
You sound so heartless.
I am heartless where a billion dollars is concerned.
Burt, people only give to charity after they have money.
You think Oprah was building orphanages in Africa when she was poor?
She wasn't.
She was smoking crack in Baltimore.
Why do you hate Oprah so much?
Why do you always defend her?
Okay, your total comes to $87.
We are going to be so rich.
Knock, knock.
I like where this is going.
Who's there?
Orange.
Orange who?
Orange you glad someone invented a new color of traffic cone?
The formal traffic cone for black-tie events.
Hey, hammerhead, black-tie events are at night.
Drivers can't see those cones.
What's wrong with you?
Shoemerang!
Next.
If there's two things I love in this world, it's produce and skin care.
And this is where my two loves meet.
An avocado face mask which you keep on for 15 minutes, and then...
Mmm...
Mmm.
Eat the years off your face with Face-amole.
All right, face cream you could eat.
I've eaten worse things than that.
Oh!
Let's talk numbers.
How much dough does each jar cost to make?
Oh, avocados are 30 cents apiece wholesale.
Two avocadoes per jar, 40 cents for the jar.
So each unit costs one dollar.
Man, I didn't know he was going to ask us how much stuff costs.
I can't do math in my head.
Here's some paper.
I can't do math on paper.
I'm going to run home and get our receipts and a calculator.
Hey, grab me some perfume.
These Pit-stops are good at absorbing sweat, but they're doing nothing for the stink.
Hey, Jimmy, here's your babies.
I hope we go early.
I'm technically not supposed to take them away from the day care center.
Hey, where's the the handle?
Oh, man.
I bet the janitor stole it.
He was probably afraid the babies were going to take his job.
Oh, but not with the stick.
No, he'd still have to push the stick.
I'll go talk to him.
Yeah, and there are 12 other janitors that work here, so if the first one doesn't know what you're talking about, just keep looking.

We've already started the presentation.
That's okay.
Just start over.
Here you go.
Just go ahead.
Nope, no, enough with the stupid stick.
- What?
You told me that you liked it.
- I lied.
- And now it's just a mop that cries.
- Oh, really?
Well, why don't we ask Andrew Dice Clay what he thinks.
Do you think the handle is stupid?
Of course it's stupid, but don't worry about it, sweetheart.
You're pretty.
Nobody expects you to be smart.
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't want this stick to cost me and Hope a shot at a billion dollars.

BURT:
Receipts and calculator!
Got it, got it, got it!
Got it.
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
Stupid, stupid...
(phone ringing)
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!
(line ringing)
You're right, the reception is great, but my partner's not answering. (groans)
Do you have a really bad headache?
My underarms are bone dry.
That's because I'm wearing...
Pit-stops!
Stopping your day from being the pits.
So if I have two rubber bands and two sponges in my house, and I do, why would I buy your product?
They come in children's sizes, too.
Next.
That brings us to...
Bro-gurt.
Would the inventors of Bro-gurt get up here?
Bro-gurt?
All right, then, moving on.
For the fifth time, I'd like to call up the inventor of the total-noise- cancellation headphones.
The total-noise-cancellation headphones.
Excuse me, sir.
I was wondering if I could pitch to Mr. Clay now.
I'm, I'm sorry.
All the presentations are done.
The Dice Man is making his decision as we speak.
I am such a loser.
I was too afraid to step up for my friend Burt, and now the world will never get to taste his man yogurt.
There, there.
What happened?
Am I too late?
I'm sorry, Burt.
I wanted to go up when they kept calling our name, but every time I stood up,
I started to poop a little and had to sit back down.
And we should have made those butt tampons.
It's not your fault.
If I had half a brain, I would have known to come prepared.
I'm just glad I get to take these off.
I'm starting to lose feeling in my arms.
Attention, everyone.
Listen to me over here.
In a way, you're all winners, 'cause you got to spend the day with the Dice Man.
But that's the only way, because I didn't hear anything today that was worthy of my celebrity to endorse.
So, there is no winner.
So I guess you could say, you rolled the craps with the Dice Man.
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Dice Clay.
My partner never got a chance to pitch his idea.
You're out of luck, pal.
Hickory dickory dock, you ran out of time on the clock.
Oh!
I know, but he was gone, and I was just too intimidated to step in for him.
And anyway, he's back now...
Hey, ding dong, what part of "no" don't you understand?
You want me to say it in different languages?
Spanish... "no." French... "no."
Portuguese... "no."
No!
No!
I'm tired of giving up.
I didn't get into the college I wanted and so I gave up.
My wife left me and I gave up.
Well, I can't do it this time, because this time I didn't just mess up my own life.
This was my friend's chance to get ahead.
My only friend.
And it's a great idea.
And we are not leaving until you hear about it and hopefully validate our parking.
Who do you think you're talking to, huh?
I'm the Dice Man.
I got my name on my shirt.
There ain't a dry cleaner in Brooklyn don't got my picture on their wall.
Get out of here.
You got that, pal?
You understand me now, huh?
So let's get stepping towards the door.
(gasps)
Oh!
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
VIRGINIA:
This is a scam.
Andrew Dice Clay didn't turn us down, you did.
You are a very bad man.
Yeah.
I bet you don't even know anything about inventing products.
That's not true.
I mean, I invented this... this digital video motion-capture technology.
But I didn't know anything about patent law, and it turns out James Cameron had invented it first.
That kid from Growing Pains?
I always thought he was smart.
The point I'm trying to make is that
I thought I'd wasted a lot of time and money on this, and then I found an innovative way to make money with it.
Yeah, by scamming us out of our savings and giving us nothing in return.
Now, listen, listen, easy, easy.
Okay, Burt?
Burt, okay, I wouldn't say you didn't get anything out of this.
I mean, I heard Andrew say that you thought you weren't smart.
I mean, you came up with the idea for...
It's yogurt that comes in flavors for men.
That is a truly original idea.
Do you know what it takes to come up with an original idea?
It takes a brain.
Yeah.
I guess it does.
Virginia, after Burt comforted Andrew,
I heard Burt tell you that you had no heart.
And you agreed with him?
But then later, when Andrew needed comforting and Burt wasn't around, you opened your arms and you opened your heart.
Yeah, I do have a heart.
It's just that Burt's is so big,
I never have a chance to use mine.
And Andrew, you told Burt that you were too afraid to even talk to Andrew Dice Clay.
And yet later, you summoned the courage to not only talk to Andrew Dice Clay, you yelled at Andrew Dice Clay.
It wasn't Andrew Dice Clay, it was you.
But you didn't know that.
JIMMY:
Is anybody else creeped out by how many conversations this guy eavesdrops on?
Hey, what about Jimmy?
Yeah.
What did Jimmy get out of this?
I'll tell you what I got.
I got in a huge fight with Sabrina.
Now I just want to go home.
And you can go home.
All of you could have gone home any time you wanted.
MAW MAW:
My icecream!
It's melting!
It's melting!
Are you still mad at Jimmy about what happened today?
No.
Actually, the more I think about it,
I kind of really liked seeing him blow up like that.
- I know.
It really was kind of...
- Hot, right?
You know, I'm kind of glad I got in that fight with Sabrina.
I had her on such a pedestal.
- I'm glad you're finally over her.
- Oh, no, I still like her.
But seeing how crazy she got kind of humanized her a bit.
Which is good.
Takes her down a few pegs.
Hey, that Wizard of Oz movie's coming on.
Should we try watching it again?
See if we can get past the first ten minutes?
I just don't see the point of buying a color TV to watch a black-and-white movie.
Plus Hope only likes movies with singing and dancing and monkeys.
She'd hate it.
It doesn't matter.
I'll find something else.
I'm just happy to be home.
There's no place like home.
Hello?
Anyone home?
Your mat says "Welcome"... unless it's being sarcastic.

What if we combine the oven with the toaster into one thing?
An oven-toaster.
Inventing's for smart people.
Like the guy who put his chocolate in the other guy's peanut butter.
That's not true.
Bill Gates couldn't even finish college, and he invented the computer.
Do you really think we could do this?
We gotta at least try.
Guys, this could be our one chance at having a better life.
Maybe you're right.
I think we could invent something.
I'm in.
Great.
Everybody put on your thinking caps today and come home with at least one good invention.
What about putting hot food into pockets?
Pocket-Hots.
Well, cleanup on aisle three is done.
Happy to say mother and new child are doing just fine.
What ya drawing?
Just my idea for a new invention.
It's a baby mop.
While the baby crawls, it also cleans.
My mom wants us to enter the National Invention Convention Extravaganza this Saturday.
I've always considered myself pretty inventive.
I invented a language that only me and my identical twin knew.
But I haven't spoken to that ugly turd in decades, so maybe I should invent something new.
That'll really fisnad his gleeblok.
Have you thought about making those in different colors?
I'm gonna do that with my invention.
Different colors.
I call that.
What's your invention?
I don't know, but it's gonna be different colors.
Different colors, that's a great idea.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do it.
Thanks.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
Wow.
That's really cool.
What?
Oh, that you're gonna take my idea.
Wyatt's always working on projects for business school, and every time I try to make a suggestion, he just shoots it down like he's threatened by it or something.
Threatened?
That's crazy.
That's a weird thing to be.
Not me.
In fact, you want to partner up on this?
I mean, we'll have to spend a lot of time together working on it...
Sure.
Yeah, that sounds fun.
You got your pen in my cottage cheese!
You got your cottage cheese on my pen.
Nope.
Keep thinking.
I know I shouldn't keep shaving with Donna's leg razor, but I miss her, and it makes me feel close to her.
Burt, did you fall asleep on me again?
I'm sorry.
There's some inventors contest this weekend, and Virginia wants us to "put on our thinking caps"
and think of an invention.
Come up with anything yet?
Uh, solar-powered electric jump rope, a pencil that makes your grammar more correcter, man yogurt.
Man yogurt?
You know, yogurt for men.
All they have now are girly flavors like blueberry or strawberry.
Why not have man flavors like pork chops, stew?
Interesting.
You could call it "Bro-gurt."
Bro-gurt!
I got it!
I got it!
I got our million- dollar idea.
Man-flavored yogurt.
Why in the world would anyone want yogurt that tastes like a man?
No, it's man flavors, like hamburger cheeseburger, but not turkey burger 'cause that'd be girly.
You see how this works?
And here's the best part.
We call it "Bro-gurt."
Bro-gurt.
I like it.
A catchy name is half the battle.
That's right up there with Manwich.
See, it's that type of thinking that's gonna get us out of the service business
And into the business of being served!
God, you are on a roll!
- On a roll like a Manwich!
- Whoa!
I've got to tell that Manwich line to Andrew when he comes over.
Andrew?
No, that twit cannot come over here.
We got work to do.
He's my partner.
He came up with the name Bro-gurt.
Burt, this was for our family to get ahead.
Now Andrew is gonna be an albacore around our necks for the rest of our lives!
I think I've got a good one.
"The Baby Mop."
Put it on a baby...
And the baby crawls your mess away.
I like it.
It's smart, it's simple, and most importantly, no outside partner.
I have a partner.
Sabrina.
No!
The plan was to go out and come back with an idea!
Not come back with a person that we have to share our bajillion dollars with.
Dang!
Am I the only smart person in this house?
What about a TV channel just for news?
Wait.
They'll have to fill up too many hours and resort to sensationalizing non-issues and stirring up partisan bickering.
Scratch that idea.
It sucks.
Hello.
Well, hey, good news.
Since Hope doesn't crawl anymore,
Shelley's gonna loan us some babies for the presentation.
That's great, but I have good news, too.
I finally figured out what's missing from the Baby Mop.
The handle to steer it.
Yeah, but the baby's just supposed to clean while it crawls around.
That's the whole point.
But babies are unpredictable, and they might not crawl where you want them to, and...
Man, you hate it!
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just letting it soak in.
Uh, a stick.
Yeah, because...
Yeah, no, a stick!
It's a great idea, partner.
Thanks.
I'm gonna go see if we have more colors.
Dude, she just jacked up your invention with that handle.
Now it's just a mop that cries.
Yeah, but this invention thing's a long shot anyway.
I'm not gonna argue with her.
That's what Wyatt does, and I'm gonna do the opposite.
The opposite of the guy
- she has sex with.
- Good strategy.
Anyway, doesn't matter because your baby mop has no chance of winning against my "shoemerang."
A shoe that will return to you no matter where you throw it.
I'm still working on ideas.
Mmm.
That has to be the best scotch-and-cigar-flavored yogurt ever made!
I know, right?
Bro-gurt is just the beginning.
If this goes well, we can invent all sorts of products just for men.
Yeah.
Why should women get to invent everything?
Exactly.
We can make pork-sicles.
We can make soap that smells like bacon.
Tampons for our butts!
What?
I don't know.
I'm just pitching.
You losers can quit chopping meat.
I've got the winning invention.
What does the average American family spend $130 a year on?
Deodorant.
But that'll all stop once they buy...
Pit-stops!
The world's first reusable underarm protection.
Ooh, that's good.
If this goes well, you're gonna grow up wearing name-brand clothes and get braces.
How ya doing, Natesville inventors?
Sorry I couldn't be there with you in person, but I got a lot of Hollywood projects, and these jackets don't cut the sleeves off themselves.
Still got it.
But I'm still able to be there with you because of the technology of the video chat, which somebody invented.
You've come in here today as regular, average citizens, but one of you may leave here as wealthy as me.
So good luck to you.
Registration starts in five minutes.
Please follow the yellow carpet to the sign-up tables outside.
See ya then.
Andrew Dice Clay, oh, my God!
I love him!
His cassette's been stuck in my car radio, like, ten years.
Okay, the basic entry fee is $20.
For a little bit extra, we offer patent-pending date-stamping.
This stops other people from stealing your idea.
It's too bad this wasn't around when Bill Johnson invented the lightbulb.
I thought Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb.
And that's why you need the date stamp.
I'll take it.
You think we should get that?
Burt, I didn't know we had to pitch this to a celebrity.
I don't think I can do this.
Okay, fine.
I'll do all the talking.
You got to settle down.
Go over to the glow-in-the-dark ice-cream guy.
Maybe he's got a napkin you can dry your eyes with.
Okay, now I hate to be pushy, but I cannot recommend any higher the invention checklist.
I mean, the first thing on the list is "Buy the invention checklist."
I'll take it.
Hey, good idea sending him over there.
Now let's win this thing before he gets back.
What has happened to you?
You sound so heartless.
I am heartless where a billion dollars is concerned.
Burt, people only give to charity after they have money.
You think Oprah was building orphanages in Africa when she was poor?
She wasn't.
She was smoking crack in Baltimore.
Why do you hate Oprah so much?
Why do you always defend her?
Okay, your total comes to $87.
We are going to be so rich.
Knock, knock.
I like where this is going.
Who's there?
Orange.
Orange who?
Orange you glad someone invented a new color of traffic cone?
The formal traffic cone for black-tie events.
Hey, hammerhead, black-tie events are at night.
Drivers can't see those cones.
What's wrong with you?
Shoemerang!
Next.
If there's two things I love in this world, it's produce and skin care.
And this is where my two loves meet.
An avocado face mask which you keep on for 15 minutes, and then...
Mmm...
Mmm.
Eat the years off your face with Face-amole.
All right, face cream you could eat.
I've eaten worse things than that.
Oh!
Let's talk numbers.
How much dough does each jar cost to make?
Oh, avocados are 30 cents apiece wholesale.
Two avocadoes per jar, 40 cents for the jar.
So each unit costs one dollar.
Man, I didn't know he was going to ask us how much stuff costs.
I can't do math in my head.
Here's some paper.
I can't do math on paper.
I'm going to run home and get our receipts and a calculator.
Hey, grab me some perfume.
These Pit-stops are good at absorbing sweat, but they're doing nothing for the stink.
Hey, Jimmy, here's your babies.
I hope we go early.
I'm technically not supposed to take them away from the day care center.
Hey, where's the the handle?
Oh, man.
I bet the janitor stole it.
He was probably afraid the babies were going to take his job.
Oh, but not with the stick.
No, he'd still have to push the stick.
I'll go talk to him.
Yeah, and there are 12 other janitors that work here, so if the first one doesn't know what you're talking about, just keep looking.
Ifyou'vegot some milk that you dropped
Clean-up'sa breeze with the Baby Mop.
If there are two things in life you can always count on, it's that things will spill... and babies will crawl.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Not only is there no reason to cry over spilled milk, there's no reason to cry over spilled wine.
Ifyourhusband'sadrunk and he just won't stop
You'rethekindofmom that needs a Baby Mop
BabyMopturnsababy into a cleaning machine
Ifshe'sgotthe time to crawl
Thenshe'sgotthe time to clean.
Hey, I went to the store, and I got a new mop handle.
We've already started the presentation.
That's okay.
Just start over.
Here you go.
Just go ahead.
Nope, no, enough with the stupid stick.
- What?
You told me that you liked it.
- I lied.
- And now it's just a mop that cries.
- Oh, really?
Well, why don't we ask Andrew Dice Clay what he thinks.
Do you think the handle is stupid?
Of course it's stupid, but don't worry about it, sweetheart.
You're pretty.
Nobody expects you to be smart.
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't want this stick to cost me and Hope a shot at a billion dollars.
So you patronize me?
- What does that word mean?
- It means you're acting like a jerk.
I think you're confusing being a jerk with being right.
Oh!
Well, if you're not going to use the mop handle,
I got a pretty good idea where you can shove it.
BabyMop.
Receipts and calculator!
Got it, got it, got it!
Got it.
I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
Stupid, stupid...
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!
You're right, the reception is great, but my partner's not answering.
Do you have a really bad headache?
My underarms are bone dry.
That's because I'm wearing...
Pit-stops!
Stopping your day from being the pits.
So if I have two rubber bands and two sponges in my house, and I do, why would I buy your product?
They come in children's sizes, too.
Next.
That brings us to...
Bro-gurt.
Would the inventors of Bro-gurt get up here?
Bro-gurt?
All right, then, moving on.
For the fifth time, I'd like to call up the inventor of the total-noise- cancellation headphones.
The total-noise-cancellation headphones.
Excuse me, sir.
I was wondering if I could pitch to Mr. Clay now.
I'm, I'm sorry.
All the presentations are done.
The Dice Man is making his decision as we speak.
I am such a loser.
I was too afraid to step up for my friend Burt, and now the world will never get to taste his man yogurt.
There, there.
What happened?
Am I too late?
I'm sorry, Burt.
I wanted to go up when they kept calling our name, but every time I stood up,
I started to poop a little and had to sit back down.
And we should have made those butt tampons.
It's not your fault.
If I had half a brain, I would have known to come prepared.
I'm just glad I get to take these off.
I'm starting to lose feeling in my arms.
Attention, everyone.
Listen to me over here.
In a way, you're all winners, 'cause you got to spend the day with the Dice Man.
But that's the only way, because I didn't hear anything today that was worthy of my celebrity to endorse.
So, there is no winner.
So I guess you could say, you rolled the craps with the Dice Man.
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Dice Clay.
My partner never got a chance to pitch his idea.
You're out of luck, pal.
Hickory dickory dock, you ran out of time on the clock.
Oh!
I know, but he was gone, and I was just too intimidated to step in for him.
And anyway, he's back now...
Hey, ding dong, what part of "no" don't you understand?
You want me to say it in different languages?
Spanish... "no." French... "no."
Portuguese... "no."
No!
No!
I'm tired of giving up.
I didn't get into the college I wanted and so I gave up.
My wife left me and I gave up.
Well, I can't do it this time, because this time I didn't just mess up my own life.
This was my friend's chance to get ahead.
My only friend.
And it's a great idea.
And we are not leaving until you hear about it and hopefully validate our parking.
Who do you think you're talking to, huh?
I'm the Dice Man.
I got my name on my shirt.
There ain't a dry cleaner in Brooklyn don't got my picture on their wall.
Get out of here.
You got that, pal?
You understand me now, huh?
So let's get stepping towards the door.
Oh!
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
This is a scam.
Andrew Dice Clay didn't turn us down, you did.
You are a very bad man.
Yeah.
I bet you don't even know anything about inventing products.
That's not true.
I mean, I invented this... this digital video motion-capture technology.
But I didn't know anything about patent law, and it turns out James Cameron had invented it first.
That kid from Growing Pains?
I always thought he was smart.
The point I'm trying to make is that
I thought I'd wasted a lot of time and money on this, and then I found an innovative way to make money with it.
Yeah, by scamming us out of our savings and giving us nothing in return.
Now, listen, listen, easy, easy.
Okay, Burt?
Burt, okay, I wouldn't say you didn't get anything out of this.
I mean, I heard Andrew say that you thought you weren't smart.
I mean, you came up with the idea for...
It's yogurt that comes in flavors for men.
That is a truly original idea.
Do you know what it takes to come up with an original idea?
It takes a brain.
Yeah.
I guess it does.
Virginia, after Burt comforted Andrew,
I heard Burt tell you that you had no heart.
And you agreed with him?
But then later, when Andrew needed comforting and Burt wasn't around, you opened your arms and you opened your heart.
Yeah, I do have a heart.
It's just that Burt's is so big,
I never have a chance to use mine.
And Andrew, you told Burt that you were too afraid to even talk to Andrew Dice Clay.
And yet later, you summoned the courage to not only talk to Andrew Dice Clay, you yelled at Andrew Dice Clay.
It wasn't Andrew Dice Clay, it was you.
But you didn't know that.
Is anybody else creeped out by how many conversations this guy eavesdrops on?
Hey, what about Jimmy?
Yeah.
What did Jimmy get out of this?
I'll tell you what I got.
I got in a huge fight with Sabrina.
Now I just want to go home.
And you can go home.
All of you could have gone home any time you wanted.
My icecream!
It's melting!
It's melting!
Are you still mad at Jimmy about what happened today?
No.
Actually, the more I think about it,
I kind of really liked seeing him blow up like that.
- I know.
It really was kind of...
- Hot, right?
You know, I'm kind of glad I got in that fight with Sabrina.
I had her on such a pedestal.
- I'm glad you're finally over her.
- Oh, no, I still like her.
But seeing how crazy she got kind of humanized her a bit.
Which is good.
Takes her down a few pegs.
Hey, that Wizard of Oz movie's coming on.
Should we try watching it again?
See if we can get past the first ten minutes?
I just don't see the point of buying a color TV to watch a black-and-white movie.
Plus Hope only likes movies with singing and dancing and monkeys.
She'd hate it.
It doesn't matter.
I'll find something else.
I'm just happy to be home.
There's no place like home.
Hello?
Anyone home?
Your mat says "Welcome"... unless it's being sarcastic.
If that's the case, it should have quotes around it.
Is this really necessary?
Trust me, ever since his wife left him, he comes over and he won't leave.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
We never should have let this guy in the first time.
It's like when we fed that three-legged dog with the filmy eye, and it kept coming around.
Doesn't anybody hear the...?
Oh, man.
You guys are jerks.
I got some mail for Donna today.
It was addressed to "occupants," but she would have loved to get half-price carpet cleaning.
It's okay.
There, there.
Is he gone?
♪ Whoo!
♪
♪ Here we go, oh, oh, oh ♪
♪ Oh, oh, oh!
♪
What time did Andrew finally leave?
I don't know.
I fell asleep.
I hope I didn't hurt his feelings.
Do you want to be rich?
Yes.
Do you want to provide a secure future for your children?
Yes.
Would you like to tell your boss to take this job and shove it?
Oh, God, yes.
Then all you need is the next great American invention.
Damn it, there's always a catch!
Bring your ideas down to the National Invention Convention Extravaganza at the Natesville High School gym this Saturday, where a celebrity judge could make you
